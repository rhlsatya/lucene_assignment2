Notice of Availability of the Draft Environmental Impact Statement for the Exxon Valdez Oil Spill Restoration Plan

Forest Service, Department of Agriculture, and the Office of the Secretary, Department of the Interior. National
Marine Fisheries Service, Department of Commerce is a cooperating agency.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of availability of the draft environmental impact statement for the Exxon Valdez restoration plan.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

On behalf of the Exxon Valdez Trustee Council, the Department of Agriculture, Forest Service announces the availability
of the Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) for the Exxon Valdez Oil Spill Restoration Plan. This notice announces
the locations and dates of public meetings to solicit comments on the DEIS. The responsible official for the preparation
of the DEIS is the Regional Forester, Phil Janik. The Restoration Plan will establish management direction and guide
all natural resource restoration activities covered by the civil settlement to the Exxon Valdez oil spill.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
A. Introduction



On October 8, 1991, a federal court approved settlement between the State and Federal governments and Exxon under
which Exxon will pay $1 billion in criminal restitution and civil damages to the governments. The State and Federal
Trustees will receive $900 million in civil damages from Exxon over the 10 years. The funds are to be used to restore
to their pre-spill condition the natural resources and the services they provide, that were injured by the Exxon Valdez
oil spill. This includes the restoration of any natural resource injured, lost or destroyed and the services provided
by that resource or which replaces or substitutes for the injured, lost or destroyed resource and affected services.
Restoration includes all phases of injury assessment, restoration, replacement, and enhancement of natural resources,
and acquisition of equivalent resources and services.



All decisions about restoration and uses of restoration funds are determined by six natural resources Trustees,
three Federal and three State. The three Federal Trustees are: The Administrator for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, and the Secretaries of the Department of Agriculture and of the Interior.
The three State Trustees are: The Commissioners of Fish and Game and Environmental Conservation, and the Attorney
General. A Trustee Council, located in Alaska, which is made up of the three State Trustees and designees of the three
Federal Trustees, is responsible for decisions relating to the assessment of injuries, uses of the restoration funds,
and all restoration activities including the preparation of a Restoration Plan.

On April 10, 1992 (57 FR 12473-12475) on behalf of the Exxon Valdez Trustee Council, the Forest Service published
a Notice of Intent to prepare an EIS on the Restoration Plan. This was later revised on January 14, 1994 (59 FR 2352-2353).
Since then the Trustee Council developed a draft Restoration Plan which has become the proposed action for the analysis
conducted in the DEIS.


B. Draft Restoration Plan



The proposed action (Draft Restoration Plan) consists of nine policy statements, a discussion of categories of restoration
actions and broad objectives for injured resources. The policies for identifying and conducting restoration actions
are:

1. The restoration program will take an ecosystem approach.

2. Restoration activities may be considered for any injured resource or service.

3. Most restoration activities will occur within the spill area. However, restoration activities outside the spill
are, but within Alaska, may be considered when the most effective restoration actions for an injured migratory population
are in a part of its range outside the spill area or when the information acquired from research and monitoring activities
outside the spill area will be important for restoration or understanding injuries within the spill area.

4. Restoration activities will emphasize resources and services that have not recovered. Resources and services
will be enhanced, as appropriate, to promote restoration. Restoration projects should not adversely affect the
ecosystem.

5. Projects designed to restore or enhance an injured service must have a sufficient relationship to an injured resource;
must benefit the same user group that was injured; and, should be compatible with the character and public uses of the
area.

6. Competitive proposals for restoration projects will be encouraged.

7. Restoration projects will be subject to independent scientific review before Trustee Council approval.

8. Meaningful public participation in restoration decisions will be actively solicited.

9. Government agencies will be funded only for restoration work that they do not normally conduct.

Four types of restoration actions are identified and discussed in the Draft Restoration Plan: General restoration,
habitat protection and acquisition, monitoring and research, and public information and administration. Alternatives
to the proposed action place different emphases on each of these categories of restoration actions.

General Restoration consists of activities that fall within manipulation of the environment, management of human
use for reduction of marine pollution. Decisions about conducting general restoration projects would look at the
following factors: Extent of natural recovery, the value of an injured resource to the ecosystem and to the public,
the duration of benefits, the technical feasibility of the project, the likelihood of success, the relationship
of costs to expected benefits, potential for harmful side effects, benefits to more than one resource, effects on
health and human safety, consistency with applicable laws, and policies, and duplication with other actions.

Habitat Protection and Acquisition is a category that includes purchase of private land or interests in land such
as conservation easements, mineral rights, or timber rights. It also includes recommendations for changing public
agency management practices. Specific policies that relate to habitat protection and acquisition are proposed.
These policies deal with ranking potential lands to determine potential benefits, the need for a willing seller,
purchasing at fair market value, post acquisition management of the acquired lands and involving the public in the
prioritization process.

Monitoring and Research consists of recovery monitoring, restoration monitoring and ecological monitoring and
research. Specific policies governing the selecting and performance of monitoring activities are discussed in
the Draft Restoration Plan.

Public Information and Administration is the last category of restoration actions. It consists of all necessary
administrative actions that are not attributable to a particular project. The Draft Restoration Plan goal for this
category is for administrative costs to average no more than 5% of overall restoration expenditures for the remainder
of the settlement period.

General restoration objectives have been developed for resources that are recovering, resources not recovering,
resources where the recovery is unknown, resources such as archaeological resources and wilderness, and services.
These broad objectives will guide in the development of annual work plans.

Further information regarding the proposed action and possible restoration alternatives is included in the Draft
Exxon Valdez Oil Spill Restoration Plan, Summary of Alternatives for Public Comment, April 1993; the Supplement
to Draft Exxon Valdez Oil spill Restoration Plan, Summary of Alternatives for Public Comment, June 1993; the Summary
of Public Comment on Alternatives of the Draft Exxon Valdez Oil Spill Restoration Plan, September 1993; and the Draft
Exxon Valdez Oil Spill Restoration Plan, November 1993. Copies of these documents may be requested from the Oil Spill
Public Information Office, 645 G. Street, Anchorage, Alaska, 99501. Phone number 907 278-8008 or within Alaska

D. Comments 



The comment period on the DEIS will be 45 days from the date the Environmental Protection Agency's notice of availability
appears in the 

Federal Register

. It is very important that those interested in this proposed action participate at this time. To be most helpful, comments
on the DEIS statement should be as specific as possible, and may address the adequacy of the statement or the merits
of the alternatives discussed. (See the Council on Environmental Quality Regulations for implementing the procedural
provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act at 40 CFR 1503.3). 

In addition, Federal court decisions have established that reviewers of DEIS statements must structure their participation
in the environmental review of the proposal so that it is meaningful and alerts an agency to the reviewer's position
and concerns. Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corp. v. NRDC. 435 U.S. 519, 553 (1978). Environmental objections that
could have been raised at the draft stage may be waived if not raised until after completion of the final EIS. Wisconsin
Heritage, Inc. v. Harris, 490 F. Supp. 1334, 1338 (E.D. Wis. 1980). The reason for this is to ensure that substantive
comments and objections are made available to the Forest Service at a time when it can meaningfully consider them and
respond to them in the final.

Notice of Preliminary Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair 
Value and Postponement of Final Determination: Silicomanganese 
from Brazil

On May 13, 1994, based on petitioners' March 14, 1994, 
allegation of sales below cost of production (COP), the 
Department initiated a COP investigation (

see

 decision memorandum 
from Richard Moreland to Barbara Stafford, dated May 13, 1994) 
and issued a COP questionnaire. However, because of the deadline 
established for Paulista's COP questionnaire response, this 
information could not be considered for the preliminary 
determination. It will be considered for the final 
determination. 




Postponement of Final Determination 



Pursuant to section 735(a)(2)(A) of the Act, on 
April 26, 1994, Paulista requested that, in the event of an 
affirmative preliminary determination in this investigation, the 
Department postpone its final determination to 135 days after the 
date of publication of an affirmative preliminary determination. 
Pursuant to 19 CFR 353.20(b), if our preliminary determination is 
affirmative, and the Department receives a request from producers 
or resellers who account for a significant portion of the exports 
under investigation, we will, absent compelling reasons for 
denial, grant the request. Because Paulista represents a 
significant portion of the exports under investigation and there 
are no compelling reasons to deny the request, we are postponing 
the final determination until the 135th day after the date of 
publication of this notice in the 

Federal Register

. 





Scope of Investigation 




The merchandise covered by this investigation is 
silicomanganese. Silicomanganese, which is sometimes called 
ferrosilicon manganese, is a ferroalloy composed principally of 
manganese, silicon, and iron, and normally containing much 
smaller proportions of minor elements, such as carbon, 
phosphorous and sulfur. Silicomanganese generally contains by 
weight not less than 4% iron, more than 30% manganese, more than 
8% silicon and not more than 3% phosphorous. All compositions, 
forms and sizes of silicomanganese are included within the scope 
of this investigation, including silicomanganese slag, fines and 
briquettes. Silicomanganese is used primarily in steel 
production as a source of both silicon and manganese. This 
investigation covers all silicomanganese, regardless of its 
tariff classification. Most silicomanganese is currently 
classifiable under subheading 7202.30.0000 of the Harmonized 
Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTS). Some silicomanganese 
may also be classifiable under HTS subheading 7202.99.5040. 
Although the HTS subheading is provided for convenience and 
customs purposes, our written description of the scope of this 
proceeding is dispositive. 



Period of Investigation 



The period of investigation (POI) is June 1, 1993, through 
November 30, 1993. 




Such or Similar Comparisons 




We have determined that the class or kind of merchandise 
subject to this investigation constitutes two such or similar 
categories: silicomanganese lumps and silicomanganese fines. In 
making our fair value comparisons, in accordance with the 
Department's standard methodology, we first compared identical 
merchandise. Where there were no sales of identical merchandise 
in the home market to compare to U.S. sales, we made similar 
merchandise comparisons on the basis of the criteria defined in 
Appendix V to the antidumping duty questionnaire. In accordance 
with 19 CFR 353.58, the Department normally attempts to compare 
U.S. sales to home market sales made at the same level of trade, 
where possible. Because Paulista did not make sales at the same 
level of trade in Brazil and the United States, we made 
comparisons without regard to level of trade. 



Fair Value Comparisons 



To determine whether Paulista's sales of silicomanganese 
from Brazil to the United States were made at less than fair 
value, we compared the United States price (USP) to the foreign 
market value (FMV), as specified in the ``United States Price'' and 
``Foreign Market Value'' sections of this notice. 




United States Price 



In accordance with section 772(b) of the Act, we based USP 
for Paulista on purchase price because all sales were made to 
unrelated parties prior to importation into the United States. 

We calculated purchase price sales based on prices to 
unrelated customers in the United States. We made deductions, 
where appropriate, for foreign brokerage, handling and foreign 
inland freight in order to adjust these prices to an ex-factory 
basis. We did not add an amount for interest revenue because 
Paulista failed to place adequate information on the record to 
support this adjustment (see concurrence memorandum, dated June 
3, 1994). We will, however, examine






this issue further at verification, and consider it for the final determination. 




On October 7, 1993, the Court of International Trade (CIT), 
in 

Federal-Mogul Corp. and The Torrington Co. 

v. 

United States, 


Slip Op. 93-194 (CIT, October 7, 1993), rejected the Department's 
methodology for calculating an addition to USP under section 
772(d)(1)(C) of the Act to account for taxes that the exporting 
country would have assessed on the merchandise had it been sold 
in the home market. The CIT held that the addition to USP under 
section 772(d)(1)(C) of the Act should be the result of applying 
the foreign market tax rate to the price of the United States 
merchandise at the same point in the chain of commerce that the 
foreign market tax was applied to foreign market sales. 

Federal- 
Mogul, 

Slip Op. 93-194 at 12. 

In accordance with the Federal-Mogul decision, we have added 
to USP the product of the home market tax rate and the price of 
the United States merchandise at the same point in the chain of 
commerce that the home market tax was applied to foreign market 
sales. We have also deducted from the USP and the FMV those 
portions of the home market tax and the USP tax adjustments 
attributable to expenses included in the home market and United 
States bases of the tax if those expenses are later deducted to 
calculate FMV and USP. These adjustments to the home market tax 
and the USP tax adjustment are necessary to prevent the 
methodology for calculating the USP tax adjustment from creating 
antidumping duty margins where no margins would exist if no taxes 
were levied upon foreign market sales.

<DOCNO> FR940617-2-00011 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940617-2-00007 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

This margin creation effect is due to the fact that the basis for calculating both the amount of tax included in the price
of the foreign market merchandise and the amount of the USP tax adjustment include many expenses that are later deducted
when calculating USP and FMV. After these deductions are made, the tax included in FMV and the USP tax adjustment still
reflect the inclusion of these expenses in the bases. Thus, a margin may be created that is not dependent upon a difference
between adjusted USP and FMV, but is the result of differences between the expenses in the United States and the home
market that were deducted through adjustments. 
This adjustment to avoid the margin creation effect is in accordance with court decisions. The United States Court
of Appeals has held that the application of the USP tax adjustment under section 772(d)(1)(C) of the Act should not
create an antidumping duty margin if pre-tax FMV does not exceed USP. 

Zenith Electronics Corp. 

v. 

United States, 

988 F.2d 1573, 1581 (Fed. Cir. 1993). In addition, the CIT has specifically held that an adjustment should be made to
mitigate the impact of expenses that are deducted from FMV and USP upon the USP tax adjustment and the amount of tax included
in FMV. 

Daewoo Electronics Co., Ltd. 

v. 

United States, 

760 F. Supp. 200, 208 (CIT, 1991). However, the mechanics of the Department's adjustments to the USP tax adjustment
and the foreign market tax amount as described above are not identical to those suggested in 

Daewoo

. 
In this investigation, we added to USP an amount for value added tax that would have been paid had the U.S. sale not been
exported. In Brazil, there are four different taxes levied on sales of the subject merchandise in the home market which
are not levied on export sales: 
(1) Imposto sobre a Circulac&atilde;o de Mercadorias e Servicos (ICMS), a regional tax with a rate that varies depending
upon the state in which the purchase originates; 
(2) Imposto sobre Produtos Industrializados (IPI), the Federal value-added tax which is levied at a rate of four percent;

(3) Programa de Integrac&atilde;o Social (PIS), a social integration program tax which is levied at a rate of 0.65
percent; and 
(4) Contribuicao do Fim Social (CONFINS), a social investment fund tax which is levied at a rate of 2.0 percent. 


Foreign Market Value 


In order to determine whether there was a sufficient volume of sales in the home market to serve as a viable basis for
calculating FMV, we compared the volume of home market sales of subject merchandise to the volume of third country
sales of subject merchandise, in accordance with section 773(a)(1)(B) of the Act. Since the total volume of merchandise
sold by Paulista in Brazil during the POI was greater than five percent of the aggregate volume of third country sales
for each such or similar category, we determined that the home market was viable. Therefore, we based FMV on home market
sales for both silicomanganese lumps and silicomanganese fines, in accordance with 19 CFR 353.48(a). We excluded
from our analysis sales to a related customer that were not claimed by Paulista to be at arm's length. 
We calculated FMV based on prices to unrelated customers. In light of the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit's
(CAFC) decision in 

Ad Hoc Committee of AZ-NM-TX-FL Producers of Gray Portland Cement 

v. 

United States, 

Slip Op. 93-1239 (Fed. Cir., January 5, 1994), the Department no longer deducts home market movement charges
from FMV pursuant to its inherent authority to fill in gaps in the antidumping statute. We instead adjust for those
expenses under the circumstance of sale provision of 19 CFR 353.56 and the exporter's sales price offset provision
of 19 CFR 353.56(b) (1) and (2), as appropriate. 

Accordingly, in the present case, we made circumstance of sale adjustments for certain post-sale home market movement
charges under 19 CFR 353.56. Also pursuant to 19 CFR 353.56(a)(2), we made circumstance of sale adjustments, where
appropriate, for differences in credit expenses, warehousing, sampling-weighing-testing expenses, and bank
fees. In accordance with 19 CFR 353.56(b), we added commissions paid on U.S. sales and deducted indirect selling expenses
incurred on sales in Brazil up to the amount of the U.S. commission. 
Under our past practice, if the Department determines that a country is hyperinflationary, we calculate FMVs on a
monthly basis to eliminate the distortive effects of inflation (see, Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair
Value and Amended Antidumping Duty Order, Tubeless Steel Disc Wheels from Brazil, 53 FR 34566, September 7, 1988).
An economy is deemed to be hyperinflationary if its monthly inflation rate is greater than 5 percent or if its annual
inflation rate is greater than 60 percent. We determined that Brazil's economy was hyper-inflationary during the
POI. Brazil's inflation rate was over 60 percent during 1993. 
We included in FMV the amount of the VAT collected in the home market (

i.e.

, the sum of the actual IPI, PIS and CONFINS tax rates plus the weighted-average ICMS rate). However, we calculated
the amount of tax that was due solely to the inclusion of price deductions in the original tax base (

i.e.

, the sum of any adjustments, expenses, and charges that were deducted from the tax base). 

See

 the ``United States Price'' section of this notice, above. This amount was deducted from the FMV after all other additions
and deductions had been made. 



Cost of Production 


Based on petitioner's allegations, and in accordance with section 773(b) of the Act, the Department initiated an
investigation to determine whether Paulista made home market sales at prices below its COP over an extended period
of time, which would not permit the recovery of costs within a reasonable period of time. However, Paulista's COP questionnaire
response is due on June 16, 1994, which is after the deadline for the preliminary determination. The response will,
however, be considered for the final determination. 


Currency Conversion 


No certified rates of exchange, as furnished by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, were available for the POI. In
place of the official certified rates, we used the daily official exchange rates for Brazilian currency published
by the Central Bank of Brazil. 
In hyperinflationary economies, the Department normally converts movement charges for U.S. sales on the date that
these charges become payable, and we have done so in this investigation. 


Verification 


As provided in section 776(b) of the Act, we will verify the accuracy of all information used in making our final determination.



Suspension of Liquidation 


In accordance with section 733(d)(1) of the Act, we are directing the Customs Service to suspend liquidation of all
entries of silicomanganese from Brazil that are entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after
the date of publication of this notice in the 

Federal Register

. The Customs Service shall require a cash deposit or posting of a bond equal to the estimated preliminary dumping margins
as shown below. This suspension of liquidation will remain in effect until further notice. The estimated preliminary
dumping margins are as follows:

Best Information Available 



U.S. Customs shipment data suggest that there were sales of subject merchandise during the POI. Because MOFTEC and
most of the potential respondents failed to provide information concerning whether there were such sales, the Department,
in accordance with section 776(c) of the Act, must base its preliminary determination on best information available
(BIA). 

In determining what to use as BIA, the Department follows a two-tiered methodology, whereby the Department normally
assigns lower margins to those respondents who cooperate in an investigation and margins based on more adverse assumptions
for those respondents who do not cooperate in an investigation. Since the potential respondents in this case did not
cooperate, we assigned a BIA margin based on the most adverse assumptions. 

In this case, BIA is the information contained in the petition, as amended on November 24, 1993. (

See Initiation of Antidumping Duty Investigations: Silicomanganese from Brazil, the People's Republic of China,
Ukraine and Venezuela, 

58 FR 64553, December 8, 1993.) The amended petition provides only one margin, listed below, for all PRC producers
and exporters of silicomanganese. 



Critical Circumstances 



Petitioner alleges that critical circumstances exist with respect to imports of silicomanganese from the PRC. Pursuant
to section 733(e)(1) of the Act and 19 CFR 353.16, we analyzed the allegations using the Department's standard methodology.


To find critical circumstances, the Department must determine whether there is a reasonable basis to believe or suspect
that 
1) there is a history of dumping in the United States or elsewhere of the same class or kind of subject merchandise, or
the importer knew or should have known that the producer or reseller was selling the subject merchandise at less than
its foreign market value; and 2) there have been massive imports of the subject merchandise over a relatively short
period. 

We have not found a history of dumping of PRC silicomanganese in the United States or elsewhere. According to Department
practice, however, we will impute knowledge of dumping to importers of subject merchandise when the dumping margin
exceeds 25 percent in purchase price situations (

see Preliminary Determination on Silicon Carbide from the PRC

, 58 FR 64549, December 8, 1993). In this case, the estimated dumping margin for silicomanganese imports from the PRC
is 150.00 percent. 

We consider imports of merchandise under investigation to be massive if there has been an increase of 15 percent or
more over a relatively short period of time. For the preliminary determination, we were able to obtain import data
through the month of March. To determine whether there have been massive imports of silicomanganese from the PRC,
we compared the import volume for the month in which the petition was filed, November, and the four months subsequent
to that month with the import volume for the five months prior to the filing of the petition, using Department of Commerce
shipment data. We found that the import volume of silicomanganese during the period subsequent to the filing of the
petition was massive, increasing by 426.83 percent over the previous period's import volume. 

For the foregoing reasons, the Department preliminarily finds that critical circumstances exist in this case. 



Suspension of Liquidation 



In accordance with section 733(d)(1) of the Act, we are directing the Customs Service to suspend liquidation of all
entries of silicomanganese from the PRC that are entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after
the date 90 days before the date of publication of this notice in the 

Federal Register

. The Customs Service shall require a cash deposit or posting of a bond equal to the amount shown below. These suspension
of liquidation instructions will remain in effect until further notice. 






ITC Notification 



In accordance with section 733(f) of the Act, we have notified the ITC of our determination. If our final determination
is affirmative, the ITC will determine before the later of 120 days after the date of this preliminary determination
or 45 days after our final determination whether these imports are materially injuring, or threaten material injury
to, the U.S. industry.

Postponement of Final Determination



In accordance with 19 CFR 353.20(b), Nikopol and Zaporozhye, which together account for all exports of the merchandise
covered in this proceeding, have requested that, in the event of an affirmative determination, the Department postpone
the final determination until 135 days after the date of publication of the preliminary determination. Because we
find no compelling reason to deny the request, we are postponing the date of the final determination until not later
than 135 days after the date of publication of this notice.



Scope of Investigation



The merchandise covered by this investigation is silicomanganese. Silicomanganese, which is sometimes called
ferrosilicon manganese, is a ferroalloy composed principally of manganese, silicon, and iron, and normally containing
much smaller proportions of minor elements, such as carbon, phosphorous and sulfur. Silicomanganese generally
contains by weight not less than 4% iron, more than 30% manganese, more than 8% silicon and not more than 3% phosphorous.
All compositions, forms and sizes of silicomanganese are included within the scope of these investigations, including
silicomanganese slag, fines and briquettes. Silicomanganese is used primarily in steel production as a source of
both silicon and manganese. These investigations cover all silicomanganese, regardless of its tariff classification.
Most silicomanganese is currently classifiable under subheading 7202.30.0000 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule
of the United States (HTSUS). Some silicomanganese may also be classifiable under HTSUS subheading 7202.99.5040.
Although the HTSUS subheading is provided for convenience and customs purposes, our written description of the scope
is dispositive.



Period of Investigation



The period of investigation (POI) is June 1, 1993, through November 30, 1993.



Surrogate Country



In past antidumping investigations, the Department has considered Ukraine to be a NME country. Ukraine has not contested
this designation, and we are continuing to consider it a NME country. Therefore, in accordance with section 773(c)
of the Act, the Department has based foreign market value on factors of production, and has valued the factors of production
using surrogate values from market economy countries that are at a level of economic development comparable to that
of Ukraine, and that are significant producers of comparable merchandise.

Due to dramatic and ongoing changes in Ukraine's economy, we were not able to identify a single preferred surrogate
country for Ukraine. Therefore, we have ranked groups of surrogates into three tiers: Egypt, Colombia, Morocco,
and Peru, which we determined were most similar to Ukraine in per capita GNP and population size, were assigned to tier
one; Ecuador, Guatemala, Bolivia, the Dominican Republic, and Indonesia were placed in tier two; and finally, the
Philippines and El Salvador were included in tier three. (

See 

Memorandum from Dave Mueller, Director, Office of Policy, to Gary Taverman, dated May 2, 1994 on file in Room B-099
of the Main Commerce Department building.) It should be noted that although the tiers are ranked hierarchically,
the surrogate countries are not hierarchically ranked within each tier.

We considered surrogate values for the factors of production from first-tier countries as most desirable and surrogate
values from second-tier countries the next most desirable. Values from third-tier countries were used only as a last
resort when factor-price data were not available from countries in the first two tiers.

In some instances, we were able to obtain surrogate values for a particular factor of production from only one country.
Where surrogate values were available from more than one country within a tier, we averaged the pricing data for all
of the countries. We then used the average price for that tier to value the factor of production. For purposes of this
preliminary determination, we determined that this was the most objective method given that there was no basis for
distinguishing countries included within the same tier.

When we were not able to value factors of production using published, publicly-available information from any surrogate
country, we relied on information provided by U.S. embassies and consulates in the surrogate countries.



Fair Value Comparisons



To determine whether sales of silicomanganese from Ukraine to the United States were made at less than fair value,
we compared the United States price (USP) to the foreign market value (FMV), as specified in the ``United States Price''
and ``Foreign Market Value'' sections of this notice.



United States Price



In accordance with section 772(b) of the Act, we based USP for Zaporozhye on purchase price because all sales were made
to unrelated parties prior to importation into the United States. For Nikopol, we have based USP on exporter's sales
price (ESP), under section 772(c) of the Act. 

We calculated purchase price for Zaporozhye based on prices to an unrelated purchaser in the United States. We made
deductions, where appropriate, for foreign inland freight and loading expense (which were both valued in a surrogate
country), to adjust the prices to an ex-factory basis.

We calculated ESP for Nikopol based on prices at which the merchandise was sold on various terms to unrelated purchasers
in the United States. We made deductions, where appropriate, for foreign inland freight and loading expense (which
were both valued in a surrogate country), marine insurance, ocean freight, U.S. customs duty, U.S. customs brokerage
and U.S. inland freight, to adjust the prices to an ex-factory basis.

In calculating U.S. price for Nikopol, we excluded one sale of silicomanganese fines because this sale was atypical
of Nikopol's U.S. sales and represented an insignificant amount of Nikopol's total U.S. sales during the POI.



Foreign Market Value



We calculated FMV based on factors of production reported by Zaporozhye and Nikopol. The factors used to produce silicomanganese
include materials, labor, and energy. To calculate FMV, the reported factors of production were valued using prices
obtained in surrogate countries.

In the case of material inputs, we also used surrogate transportation rates to value the transportation of inputs
from their sources to the silicomanganese factories.

To value manganese ore, we used an average of CIF import values from two first-tier surrogate countries: Colombia
and Egypt. The source of both values was United Nations Trade Statistics for 1992.

We were unable to find published, publicly-available information for manganese sinter, and we received no relevant
information from the U.S. diplomatic posts. Therefore, for the preliminary determination, we have valued this product
using manganese ore prices.

To value quartzite, we relied on a publicly-available Moroccan import value contained in United Nations statistics.
To value coke, the most current publicly-available source was a Colombian value for 1992 exports reported on an FOB
basis in statistics published by the United Nations.

To value electricity, we used publicly-available information from Colombia contained in the Departamento Nacional
de Planeacion's Junta Nacional de Tarifas de Servicios Publicos (June 1993). We selected this source because it provided
an electricity rate for industrial use during the POI. 
To value natural gas, we relied on an average of two published, publicly-available values for our first-tier surrogate
countries, Colombia and Morocco. The Colombian value was reported on a FOB Colombian port basis and was obtained from
U.S. import statistics for 1993. The Moroccan value was the average price at which natural gas was imported into that
country in 1992. The source of this value was the 1992 International Trade Statistics Yearbook, Volume 1, 1993. Before
averaging these values, we converted the Moroccan value into a price per cubic meter. 
To value production labor, we used published, publicly-available values for Egypt from the 1993 Year Book of Labour
Statistics, 52nd edition. We used the most recent statistics available, values from 1987, which we inflated to the
POI using statistics published by The Economist Intelligence Unit: Egypt Country Profile 1993/94. 
For selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A), and profit, we found no publicly-available, published
information. In addition, we were unable to use information provided by the U.S. Embassy in Egypt for SG&A and
profit because we were unable to determine the cost bases upon which the Egyptian percentages were calculated. Therefore,
we relied on the statutory minimums of ten percent for SG&A and eight percent for profit (see section 773(e)(1)(B)
of the Act). 
For factory overhead, we also found no publicly-available, published information. In addition, we were unable to
use the information provided by the U.S. Embassy in Egypt for factory overhead because we were unable to determine
the cost basis upon which the overhead percentage was calculated. Furthermore, the statute does not provide any minimum
percentage for factory overhead. Therefore, we relied upon information from the second-tier surrogate country
of Bolivia provided by the U.S. Embassy in Bolivia. This information was used during the recent antidumping investigation
of Refined Antimony Trioxide (See Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Refined Antimony Trioxide
From the People's Republic of China, 57 FR 6801, February 28, 1992.) The information is in a cable in the public file
for this case (

see

 La Paz Cable 14178, September 23, 1991). Except as noted below, where necessary, we adjusted the above surrogate country
prices for inflation to the POI using the wholesale price indices published for each of the surrogate countries by
the International Monetary Fund (IMF). In the case of Peru, we used the consumer price index of the IMF because the IMF
does not publish a wholesale price index for that country. In the case of Egypt, for which the IMF publishes neither
wholesale nor consumer price indices, we adjusted for inflation, where necessary, using statistics published by
The Economist Intelligence Unit: Egypt Country Profile 1993/94.

Verification 


As provided in section 776(b) of the Act, we will verify the accuracy of all information used in making our final determination.



Critical Circumstances 


Petitioners alleged that critical circumstances exist with respect to imports of silicomanganese from Ukraine.
Pursuant to section 733(e)(1) of the Act and 19 CFR 353.16 (1993), we requested shipment information from Zaporozhye
and Nikopol and attempted to analyze that information using the Department's standard methodology. To find critical
circumstances, we must determine whether there is a reasonable basis to believe or suspect that 
1) there is a history of dumping in the United States or elsewhere of the same class or kind of subject merchandise, or
the importer knew or should have known that the producer or reseller was selling the subject merchandise at less than
its foreign market value; and 2) there have been massive imports of the subject merchandise over a relatively short
period. 
We have not found a history of dumping of Ukrainian silicomanganese in the United States or elsewhere. According to
Department practice, however, we will impute knowledge of dumping to importers of subject merchandise when the dumping
margin exceeds 25 percent in purchase price situations. In this case, the estimated dumping margin for silicomanganese
imports from Ukraine is 123.02 percent, a rate which exceeds our benchmark for imputing knowledge of dumping. Therefore,
we have preliminarily found that importers should be imputed knowledge of dumping of the subject merchandise. 
Pursuant to 19 CFR 353.16(f)(2), the Department considers imports of subject merchandise to be massive if there has
been an increase of 15 percent or more over a relatively short period of time. We also consider, when possible, the respondent's
share of import penetration of the domestic market in making this determination. In this case, evidence indicates
that Ukrainian U.S. market penetration has increased. 
To determine whether imports increased, we have examined the volume of imports by comparing volumes for the five months
subsequent to the filing of the petition (November 1993 through March 1994) to the five months prior to the filing of
the petition (June 1993 through October 1993). Although Zaporozhye has provided adequate information to perform
an analysis of whether imports have increased, Nikopol has not done so. Specifically, the shipment information provided
by Nikopol was inconsistent with its sales data. (

See

 the concurrence memorandum, dated June 10, 1994.) Given that neither company has established its eligibility for
separate dumping margins, the data concerning critical circumstances must be considered in a consolidated manner.
Accordingly, given the lack of adequate information, we preliminarily determined that there have been massive imports
of silicomanganese from the Ukraine. 
Based on the foregoing, the Department preliminarily finds that critical circumstances exist in this case. 


Suspension of Liquidation 


In accordance with section 733(d)(1) of the Act, we are directing the Customs Service to suspend liquidation of all
entries of silicomanganese from Ukraine that are entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after
90 days prior to the date of publication of this notice in the 

Federal Register

. The Customs Service shall require a cash deposit or posting of a bond equal to the estimated amount by which the FMV
exceeds the USP as shown below. These suspension of liquidation instructions will remain in effect until further
notice. 
The weighted-average dumping margin is as follows: 






ITC Notification 


In accordance with section 733(f) of the Act, we have notified the ITC of our determination. If our final determination
is affirmative, the ITC will determine before the later of 120 days after the date of this preliminary determination
or 45 days after our final determination whether these imports are materially injuring, or threaten material injury
to, the U.S. industry.

Such or Similar Comparisons 


We have determined that the class or kind of merchandise subject to this investigation constitutes two such or similar
categories: silicomanganese lumps and silicomanganese fines. In making our fair value comparisons, in accordance
with the Department's standard methodology, we first compared identical merchandise. Where there were no sales
of identical merchandise in the home market (third country market with respect to silicomagnese fines) to compare
to U.S. sales, we made similar merchandise comparisons on the basis of the criteria defined in Appendix V to the antidumping
questionnaire, on file in Room B-099 of the main building of the Department of Commerce. In accordance with 19
CFR 353.58, we made comparisons at the same level of trade, where possible. 



Fair Value Comparisons 



To determine whether Hevensa's sales of silicomanganese from Venezuela to the United States were made at less than
fair value, we compared the United States price (USP) to the foreign market value (FMV), as specified in the ``United
States Price'' and ``Foreign Market Value'' sections of this notice. 


United States Price 


We based USP for Hevensa on purchase price (PP), in accordance with section 772(b) of the Act, because all sales were
made to unrelated parties prior to importation into the United States. 
We calculated PP based on FOB Venezuelan port prices to unrelated customers in the United States. We made deductions,
where appropriate, for freight, loading expenses and rebates. We added an amount, where appropriate, for duty drawback,
in accordance with section 772(d)(1)(B) of the Act. 
On October 7, 1993, the Court of International Trade (CIT), in 

Federal-Mogul Corp. and The Torrington Co. 

v. 

United States, 

Slip Op. 93-194 (CIT, October 7, 1993), rejected the Department's methodology for calculating an addition
to USP under section 772(d)(1)(C) of the Act to account for taxes that the exporting country would have assessed on
the merchandise had it been sold in the home market. The CIT held that the addition to USP should be the result of applying
the foreign market tax rate to the price of the United States merchandise at the same point in the chain of commerce that
the foreign market tax was applied to foreign market sales. Federal-Mogul, Slip Op. 93-194 at 12. 
In accordance with the CIT decision in Federal-Mogul, we have multiplied the foreign market tax rate by the price of
the United States merchandise at the same point in the chain of commerce that the foreign market tax was applied to foreign
market sales, and have added the product to the USP. We have also deducted from the USP and the FMV those portions of the
respective home market tax and the USP tax adjustments attributable to expenses included in the foreign market and
United States bases of the tax if those expenses are later deducted to calculate FMV and USP. These adjustments to the
foreign market tax and the USP tax adjustment are necessary to prevent the methodology for calculating the USP tax
adjustment from creating antidumping duty margins where no margins would exist if no taxes were levied upon foreign
market sales. 
This margin creation effect is due to the fact that the basis for calculating both the amount of tax included in the price
of the foreign market merchandise and the amount of the USP tax adjustment include many expenses that are later deducted
when calculating USP and FMV. After these deductions are made, the tax included in FMV and the USP tax adjustment still
reflect the inclusion of these expenses in the bases. Thus, a margin may be created that is not dependent upon a difference
between adjusted USP and FMV, but is the result of differences between the expenses in the United States and the home
market that were deducted through adjustments.

The adjustment to avoid the margin creation effect is in accordance with the United States Court of Appeals' holding
that the application of the USP tax adjustment under section 772(d)(1)(C) of the Act should not create an antidumping
duty margin if pre-tax FMV does not exceed USP. 

Zenith Electronics Corp.

 v. 

United States

, 988 F.2d 1573, 1581 (Fed. Cir. 1993). In addition, the CIT has specifically held that an adjustment should be made
to mitigate the impact of expenses that are deducted from FMV and USP upon the USP tax adjustment and the amount of tax
included in FMV. 

Daewoo Electronics Co., Ltd.

 v. 

United States

, 760 F. Supp. 200, 208 (CIT, 1991). However, the mechanics of the Department's adjustments to the USP tax adjustment
and the foreign market tax amount as described above are not identical to those suggested in 

Daewoo

. 
In this investigation, Venezuela began collecting a value added tax (IVA) during the POI, on October 1, 1993. Consequently,
for those U.S. sales invoiced on or after October 1, 1993, we added an amount for this tax, calculated as described above,
that would have been collected had the U.S. sale not been exported. For the U.S. sales invoiced prior to October 1, 1993,
we also added an amount for value-added tax when no home market comparison sales were made prior to October 1, 1993 (see
below). 


Foreign Market Value 


In order to determine whether there was a sufficient volume of sales in the home market to serve as a viable basis for
calculating FMV, we compared the volume of home market sales of subject merchandise to the volume of third country
sales of subject merchandise, in accordance with section 773(a)(1)(B) of the Act. Since Hevensa's volume of home
market sales of silicomanganese lump was greater than five percent of the aggregate volume of third country sales,
we determined that the home market was viable and, therefore, based FMV for silicomanganese lump on home market sales,
in accordance with 19 CFR 353.48(a). We found that the home market was not viable for silicomanganese fines. We selected
Peru as our third country market for sales of silicomanganese fines, pursuant to 19 CFR 353.49. 
In accordance with 19 CFR 353.46, we calculated FMV for silicomanganese lump based on delivered or FOB plant prices
to unrelated customers. In light of the Court of Appeals of the Federal Circuit's (CAFC) decision in 

Ad Hoc Committee of AZ-NM-TX-FL Producers of Gray Portland Cement 

v. 

United States

, Slip Op. 93-1239 (Fed. Cir., January 5, 1994), the Department no longer deducts home market movement charges
from FMV pursuant to its inherent power to fill in gaps in the antidumping statute. We instead adjust for those expenses
under the circumstance-of-sale provision of 19 CFR 353.56 and the exporter's sales price offset provision of 19 CFR
353.56(b)(1) and (2), as appropriate. 
Accordingly, in the present case, we made circumstance of sale adjustments for post-sale home market movement charges
under 19 CFR 353.56. This adjustment included home market inland freight and loading charges. Pursuant to 19 CFR 353.56(a)(2),
we also made circumstance-of-sale adjustments, where appropriate, for differences in credit expenses and royalties.

As discussed above, the IVA was only levied on sales in the home market invoiced on or after October 1, 1993. Therefore,
we divided the reported home market sales into two categories, one covering home market sales invoiced during the
period June-September, 1993, and one covering sales invoiced on or after October, 1993. We accounted for the application
of the IVA tax only on sales invoiced on or after October 1, 1993. 
As the basis for FMV, we selected the home market group depending on when the U.S. sale was invoiced. For U.S. sales invoiced
prior to October 1, 1993, we used the former group, and for those sales invoiced after September 30, 1993, we used the
latter group. 
We also calculated the amount of the tax that was due solely to the inclusion of price deductions in the original tax
base (i.e., the sum of any amounts that were deducted from the tax base). See the ``United States Price'' section of
this notice, above. This amount was deducted from the FMV after all other additions and deductions had been made. 
In accordance with 19 CFR 353.49, we calculated FMV for silicomanganese fines on FOB plant prices, inclusive of packing,
to unrelated customers in Peru. Pursuant to 19 CFR 353.56(a)(2), we made circumstance-of-sale adjustments, where
appropriate, for differences in credit expenses and royalties. We deducted third country packing and added U.S.
packing costs, in accordance with section 773(a)(1) of the Act.

Cost of Production 


Based on petitioner's allegations, and in accordance with section 773(b) of the Act, the Department initiated an
investigation to determine whether Hevensa made home market sales at prices below its COP, and over an extended period
of time. Although Hevensa's COP questionnaire response will be received too late for consideration for the preliminary
determination, it will be considered for the final determination. 


Currency Conversion 


Because certified exchange rates from the Federal Reserve were unavailable, we made currency conversions based
on the official monthly exchange rates in effect on the dates of the U.S. sales as certified by the International Monetary
Fund. 


Verification 


As provided in section 776(b) of the Act, we will verify the accuracy of all information used in making our final determination.



Suspension of Liquidation 


In accordance with section 733(d)(1) of the Act, we are directing the Customs Service to suspend liquidation of all
entries of silicomanganese from Venezuela that are entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after
the date of publication of this notice in the 

Federal Register

. The Customs Service shall require a cash deposit or posting of a bond equal to the estimated preliminary dumping margins
as shown below. This suspension of liquidation will remain in effect until further notice. The estimated preliminary
dumping margins are as follows:


 

ITC Notification 


In accordance with section 733(f) of the Act, we have notified the ITC of our determination. If our final determination
is affirmative, the ITC will determine before the later of 120 days after the date of the preliminary determination
or 45 days after our final determination whether imports of the subject merchandise are materially injuring, or threaten
material injury to, the U.S. industry.

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
supplementary information:

 Chapter 19 of the North American Free-Trade Agreement (``Agreement'') establishes a mechanism to replace domestic
judicial review of final determinations in antidumping and countervailing duty cases involving imports from a NAFTA
country with review by independent binational panels. When a Request for Panel Review is filed, a panel is established
to act in place of national courts to review expeditiously the final determination to determine whether it conforms
with the antidumping or countervailing duty law of the country that made the determination.


Under Article 1904 of the Agreement, which came into force on January 1, 1994, the Government of the United States,
the Government of Canada and the Government of Mexico established Rules of Procedure for Article 1904 Binational
Panel Reviews (``Rules''). These Rules were published in the 

Federal Register

 on February 23, 1994 (59 FR 8686).
A first Request for Panel Review was filed with the Canadian Section of the NAFTA Secretariat, pursuant to Article
1904 of the Agreement, on May 30, 1994, requesting panel review of the final injury determination described above.
Rule 39(1)(c) of the Rules provides that:
(a) A Party or interested person may challenge the final determination in whole or in part by filing a Complaint in accordance
with Rule 39 within 30 days after the filing of the first Request for Panel Review (the deadline for filing a Complaint
is June 29, 1994);
(b) A Party, investigating authority or interested person that does not file a Complaint but that intends to appear
in support of any reviewable portion of the final determination may participate in the panel review by filing a Notice
of Appearance in accordance with Rule 40 within 45 days after the filing of the first Request for Panel Review (the deadline
for filing a Notice of Appearance is July 14, 1994); and
(c) The panel review shall be limited to the allegations of error of fact or law, including the jurisdiction of the investigating
authority, that are set out in the Complaints filed in the panel review and the procedural and substantive defenses
raised in the panel review.

Announcement of an Opportunity To Join a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement on Healthcare Information
Technology Architecture Standards (HITAS)



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

National Institute of Standards and Technology, Commerce.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) invites interested parties to participate in a Cooperative
Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) to establish a healthcare information system. The infrastructure will
include application platform, application software, storage, human/computer interaction, and communication
technologies. It will share medical information while maintaining confidentiality of patient data.



Through the CRADA, called the ``Forum on Healthcare Information Technology Architecture Standards'', NIST will
provide the mechanism for industry and users to resolve standards-related technical issues that currently inhibit
deployment of medical information technology products. Parties interested in participating in the CRADA should
be prepared to invest adequate resources in the collaboration and be firmly committed to the goal of rapid development
and deployment of new healthcare information technology.

The program will be within the scope and confines of The Federal Technology Transfer Act of 1986 (Public Law 99-502,
15 U.S.C. 3710a), which provides federal laboratories including NIST, with the authority to enter into cooperative
research agreements with qualified parties. Under this law, NIST may contribute personnel, equipment and facilities_but
no funds_to the cooperative research program. Members will be expected to make a contribution to the forum's efforts
in the form of materials, equipment, personnel, and/or funds. The program is expected to last three years. This is
not a grant program.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) invites interested parties to participate in a forum to
establish a healthcare information system infrastructure. Through the CRADA, NIST will provide a venue and process
for industry and users to resolve standards-related technical issues.




This project is based upon a shared, global vision of a large scale distributed healthcare information infrastructure
which will encompass application platform, application software, storage, human/computer interaction, and communication
technologies, integrated via object oriented middleware. The new infrastructure will share medical information
while maintaining the security and confidentiality of patient data.

The CRADA will also provide links among the user requirement-driven Open Systems Environment Implementors Workshop
(OIW), the consensus-driven base standards community, and the market-driven technical community to reduce time-to-market
for complex technical products requiring simultaneous consensus in a variety of technical areas.

International market input from the workshops and the standards community are crucial to meeting government and
industry objectives for common solutions across the global marketplace. Coordination with accredited U.S. and
international standards groups is an important aspect of this partnership.

Participants will be assured of the technical and economic feasibility of the resultant technical products. This
will accelerate acceptance of the specifications, promote rapid development of commercial products, and contribute
to earlier deployment of technology to meet user needs.

Proposed Revision of Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 153, Programmer's Hierarchical Interactive
Graphics Systems (PHIGS)



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Commerce.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice; request for comments.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

A revision of FIPS 153, PHIGS, is being proposed. This proposed revision will add features to the basic PHIGS functionality
defined in FIPS 153, which adopts voluntary industry standards, ANSI/ISO 9592.1-3:1989, and ANSI/ISO 9593-1:1990,
9593-3:1990, 9593-4:1991. The basic PHIGS functionality provides for control and data interchange
between an application program and its graphic support systems and for a set of functions and programming language
bindings for the definition, display and modification of two-dimensional (2D) or three-dimensional (3D) graphic
data. New features will be provided by the proposed adoption of voluntary industry specifications ANSI/ISO 9592.1a,2a,3a,4:1992
for PHIGS PLUS. PHIGS PLUS will augment the basic PHIGS functionality by providing facilities for specifying curved
lines, curved and facetted surfaces, lighting and shading, and color. In addition, the proposed revision will add
a requirement for the validation of PHIGS implementations using either FORTRAN or C bindings.


Prior to the submission of this proposed revision to FIPS 153 to the Secretary of Commerce for review and approval,
it is essential to assure that consideration is given to the needs and views of manufacturers, the public, and State
and local governments. The purpose of this notice is to solicit such views.
This proposed revision contains two sections: (1) An announcement section, which provides information concerning
the applicability, implementation, and maintenance of the standard; and (2) a specifications section. Only the
announcement section of the standard is provided in this notice. Interested parties may obtain copies of the specifications
(ANSI/ISO 9592.1-3:1989, ANSI/ISO 9592.1a,2a,3a,4:1992, and ANSI/ISO 9593-1:1990, 9593-3:1990,
9593-4:1991) from American National Standards Institute (ANSI), 11 West 42nd Street, 13th floor, New York,
NY 10036, (212) 642-4900.

Proposed Federal Information Processing Standards Publication 153-1
(date)


Announcing the Standard for Programmer's Hierarchical Interactive Graphics System (PHIGS)


Federal Information Processing Standards Publications (FIPS PUBS) are issued by the National Institute of Standards
and Technology after approval by the Secretary of Commerce pursuant to section 111(d) of the Federal Property and
Administrative Services Act of 1949 as amended by the Computer Security Act of 1987, Public Law 100-235.


1. Name of Standard. 

Programmer's Hierarchical Interactive Graphics System (PHIGS) (FIPS PUB 153-1).


2. Category of Standard. 

Software Standard, Graphics.


3. Explanation. 

This publication is a revision of FIPS PUB 153 and supersedes that document in its entirety. This revision provides
a substantial, upward-compatible enhancement of the basic PHIGS functionality known as Plus Lumiere and Surfaces,
PHIGS PLUS (ANSI/ISO 9592.1a,2a,3a,4:1992). PHIGS PLUS adds facilities for the specification of curved lines,
curved and facetted surfaces, lighting and shading, and adds a mechanism for color specification to allow non-indexed
color specification. Amendments to each part of the PHIGS specification detail revisions required by PHIGS PLUS.
Also, each language binding of PHIGS has been amended as a result of PHIGS PLUS. The specifications and amendments
that comprise the complete PHIGS standard as a result of this revision are detailed in the Specification section of
this document.
In addition this revision adds a requirement for validation of PHIGS implementations using either FORTRAN or C bindings.
However, validation is currently limited to basic PHIGS functionality, and therefore does not include the new functionality
of PHIGS PLUS added by this revision.
FIPS 153-1 adopts the American National Standard Programmer's Hierarchical Interactive Graphics System,
ANSI/ISO 9592.1-3:1989, and ANSI/ISO 9592.1a,2a,3a,4:1992, and 9593.1:1990, 9593.3:1990, 9593.4:1991,
as a Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS). This standard specifies the control and data interchange between
an application program and its graphic support system. It provides a set of functions and programming language bindings
for the definition, display and modification of two-dimensional (2D) or three-dimensional (3D) graphical data.
In addition, these language bindings allow for the definition, display and modification of geometrically related
objects, graphical data, and the relationships between the graphical data. The purpose of the standard is to promote
portability of graphics application programs between different installations. The standard is for use by implementors
as the reference authority in developing graphics software systems; and by other computer professionals who need
to know the precise syntactic and semantic rules of the standard.

8. Objectives. 

The primary objectives of this standard are:





_to allow very highly interactive graphics application programs using 2D or 3D hierarchically structured graphics
data to be easily transported between installations. This will reduce costs associated with the transfer of programs
among different computers and graphic devices, including replacement devices.

_to aid the understanding and use of dynamic hierarchical graphics methods by application programmers.

_to aid manufacturers of graphics equipment by serving as a guideline for identifying useful combinations of graphics
capabilities in a device.

_to encourage more effective utilization and management of graphics application programmers by ensuring that skills
acquired on one job are transportable to other jobs, thereby reducing the cost of graphics programmer retraining.

_to aid graphics application programmers in understanding and using graphics methods by specifying well-defined
functions and names. This will avoid the confusion of incompatibility common with operating systems and programming
languages.







9. Applicability.

 PHIGS is one of the computer graphics standards (Appendix A discusses the family of computer graphics standards)
provided for use by all Federal departments and agencies. These graphics standards should be used for all computer
graphics applications and programs that are either developed or acquired for government use.



9.1

 The FIPS for PHIGS is intended for use in computer graphics applications that are either developed or acquired
for government use. It is specifically designed to meet the performance requirements of such demanding applications
as Computer Aided Design/Computer Aided Engineering/Computer Aided Manufacturing, command and control, molecular
modelling, simulation and process control. It emphasizes the support of applications needing a highly dynamic,
highly interactive operator interface and expecting rapid screen update of complex images to be performed by the
display system. The PHIGS Plus functionality is designed to support graphics applications requiring lighting and
shading, curved lines, curved and facetted surfaces, and non-indexed color specification.



9.2 

The use of this standard is compulsory and binding when one or more of the following situations exist:





_The graphics application is very highly interactive, or contains hierarchically structured graphics data, or
requires rapid modification of 2D or 3D graphics data and the relationships among the data.

_It is anticipated that the life of the graphics program will be longer than the life of the presently utilized graphics
equipment.

_The graphics application or program is under constant review for updating of the specifications, and changes may
result frequently.

_The graphics application is being designed and programmed centrally for a decentralized system that employs computers
of different makes and models and different graphic devices.

_The graphics program will or might be run on equipment other than that for which the program is initially written.

_The graphics program is to be understood and maintained by programmers other than the original ones.

_The graphics program is or is likely to be used by organizations outside the Federal government (

i.e.,

 State and local governments, and others).

9.3 

Nonstandard features of implementations of PHIGS should be used only when the needed operation or function cannot
reasonably be implemented with the standard features alone. Although nonstandard features can be very useful, it
should be recognized that the use of these or any other nonstandard elements may make the interchange of graphics programs
and future conversion more difficult and costly.



10. Specifications.

 American National Standard Programmer's Hierarchical Interactive Graphics System, ANSI/ISO 9592.1-3:1989 and
ANSI/ISO 9592.1a, 2a, 3a, 4:1992, define the scope of the specifications, the syntax and semantics of the PHIGS elements
and requirements for conforming implementations. All of these specifications apply to Federal Government implementations
of this standard.

ANSI/ISO 9592.103:1989 and ANSI/ISO 9592.1a,2a,3a,4:1992 define a language independent nucleus of a graphics
system for integration into a programming language. Thus, it is embedded in a language layer obeying the particular
conventions of the language. FIPS 153-1 is therefore divided into two parts. Part 1 represents the functional aspects
of PHIGS. Part 1 consists of the following:




(1) Functional description (ANSI/ISO 9592.1:1989) and (ANSI/ISO 9592.1a:1992, Amendment 1)



The functional description of PHIGS provides a set of functions for the definition, display and modification of 2D
or 3D graphical data. It also provides for the definition, display and manipulation of geometrically related objects,
along with the modification of graphics data and the relationships between that graphical data.



(2) Archive file format (ANSI/ISO 9592.2:1989) and (ANSI/ISO 9592.2a:1992, Amendment 1)



The archive file provides a file format suitable for the storage and retrieval of PHIGS structures and structure network
definitions. It allows structure definitions to be stored in an organized way on a graphical software system. And,
facilitates transfer of structure definitions between different graphical software systems.



(3) Clear-text encoding (ANSI/ISO 9592.3:1989) and (ANSI/ISO 9592.3a:1992, Amendment 1)



The clear-text encoding provides a representation of the archive file syntax that is easy to type, edit and read. The
file is human-readable (allows editing), human friendly (easy and natural to read) and machine readable (parsable
by software).



(4) Plus Lumiere and Surfaces, PHIGS PLUS (ANSI/ISO 9592.4:1992)



The Programmer's Hierarchical Interactive Graphics System (PHIGS) Plus Lumiere and Surfaces (PHIGS PLUS) extends
the basic PHIGS functionality by adding facilities for the specification of curved lines, curved and facetted surfaces,
lighting and other effects such as depth modulation.




Part 2 of FIPS 153-1 consists of the bindings of PHIGS and PHIGS PLUS functions to actual programming languages, defined
in ANSI/ISO 9593:1990. These bindings are developed in cooperation with the voluntary standards committees of the
various languages. The following bindings currently exist, and form part 2 of FIPS 153-1:




_The FORTRAN Language binding for PHIGS (ANSI/ISO 9593.1:1990);
_The ADA Language binding for PHIGS (ANSI/ISO 9593.3:1990);
_The C Language binding for PHIGS (ANSI/ISO 9593.4:1991).




Subsequent language bindings, including those for PHIGS PLUS, will be added periodically as they become available.
As these bindings are approved by ANSI, each language binding will become part of this standard.



11. Implementation.

 Implementation of this standard involves four areas of consideration: the effective date, acquisition of PHIGS
software system implementations, interpretations of PHIGS implementations, and validation of PHIGS implementations.



11.1 Effective Date.

 This revised standard is effective six (6) months after approval by the Secretary of Commerce. Requirements for the
use of basic PHIGS functionality (defined in ANSI/ISO 9592.1-3;1989 and ANSI/ISO 9593.1:1990, 9593.3:1990, 9593.4:1991)
are unchanged and continue in effect. Validation of PHIGS implementations is required after the effective date in
accordance with section 11.4.

<TEXT>
 



11.2 Acquisition of Implementations.

 Conformance to FIPS for PHIGS is required whether PHIGS toolbox packages are developed internally, acquired as part
of an ADP system procurement, acquired by separate procurement, used under an ADP leasing arrangement, or specified
for use in contracts for programming services. Recommended terminology for procurement of FIPS for PHIGS is contained
in the 

U.S. General Services Administration publication Federal ADP & Telecommunications Standards Index

, chapter 4 part 1.


11.3 Interpretation of this FIPS.

 NIST provides for the resolution of questions regarding FIPS for PHIGS specifications and requirements, and issues
official interpretations as needed. Procedures for interpretations are specified in FIPS PUB 29-3. All questions
about the interpretation of FIPS for PHIGS should be addressed to: Director, Computer Systems Laboratory (CSL),
ATTN: PHIGS Interpretation, National Institute of Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, MD 20899, Telephone:
(301) 975-3265.


11.4 Validation of PHIGS Implementations.

 Implementations of FIPS for PHIGS using either FORTRAN or C bindings shall be validated in accordance with NIST Computer
Systems Laboratory (CSL) validation procedures for FIPS for PHIGS. Recommended procurement terminology for validation
of FIPS for PHIGS is contained in the 

U.S. General Services Administration publication Federal ADP & Telecommunications Standards Index

, Chapter 4 Part 2. This GSA publication provides terminology for three validation options: Delayed Validation,
Prior Validation Testing and Prior Validation. The agency shall select the appropriate validation option. The agency
is advised to refer to the NIST publication 

Validated Products List

 for information about the validation status of PHIGS products. This information may be used to specify validation
time frames that are not unduly restrictive of competition.
The agency shall specify the criteria used to determine whether a Validation Summary Report (VSR) or Certificate
is applicable to the hardware/software environment of the PHIGS implementation offered. The criteria for applicability
of a VSR or Certificate should be appropriate to the size and timing of the procurement. A large procurement may require
that the offered version/release of the PHIGS implementation shall be validated in a specified hardware/software
environment and that the validation shall be conducted with specified hardware/software features or parameter
settings; e.g., the sema parameter settings to be used in a performance benchmark. An agency with a single-license
procurement may review the 

Validated Products List

 to determine the applicability of existing VSRs or Certificates to the agency's hardware/software environment.
PHIGS implementations using either FORTRAN or C bindings shall be validated using the NIST PHIGS Test Suite, a suite
of automated validation tests for PHIGS implementations. The NIST PHIGS Test Suite was first released in July 1990
to help users and vendors determine compliance with FIPS for PHIGS. The most recent version of the test suite will be
used for validating conformance of PHIGS implementations after the effective date of FIPS PUB 153-1. The results
of validation testing by the PHIGS Testing Service are published on a quarterly basis in the 

Validated Products List

, available from the National Technical Information Service (NTIS). See related documents section.
Each release of the test suite has provided additional language bindings and test cases to increase the test suite's
coverage of PHIGS functionality. Version 2.1 of the NIST PHIGS Test Suite, released in April 1994, provides testing
for PHIGS implementations using either the FORTRAN or C language binding. Version 2.1 does not include tests for the
functionality of PHIGS PLUS added by this revision of FIPS for PHIGS.
A PHIGS Test Suite license includes all of the tests described above, documentation, and automatic notifications
of approved changes to the PHIGS Test Suite for a six month period. A license for the most recent version of the PHIGS
Test Suite is a necessary requirement for an organization that desires to be tested by the NIST PHIGS Testing Service
after the effective date of FIPS 153-1.
Current information about the NIST PHIGS Validation Service and validation procedures for FIPS for PHIGS is available
from: National Institute of Standards and Technology, Computer Systems Laboratory, Graphics Software Group, Building
225, room A266, Gaithersburg, MD 20899, (302) 975-3265.


12. Waivers.

 Under certain exceptional circumstances, the heads of Federal departments and agencies may approve waivers to Federal
Information Processing Standards (FIPS). The head of such agency may redelegate such authority only to a senior official
designated pursuant to section 3506(b) of Title 44, United States Code.
Waivers shall be granted only when:
a. Compliance with a standard would adversely affect the accomplishment of the mission of an operator of a Federal
computer system, or
b. Cause a major adverse financial impact on the operator which is not offset by Governmentwide savings.
Agency heads may act upon a written waiver request containing the information detailed above. Agency heads may also
act without a written waiver request when they determine that conditions for meeting the standard cannot be met. Agency
heads may approve waivers only by a written decision which explains the basis upon which the agency head made the required
finding(s). A copy of each such decision, with procurement sensitive or classified portions clearly identified,
shall be sent to: National Institute of Standards and Technology; ATTN: FIPS Waiver Decisions, Technology Building,
room B-154; Gaithersburg, MD 20899. In addition notice of each waiver granted and each delegation of authority
to approve waivers shall be sent promptly to the Committee on Government Operations of the House of Representatives
and the Committee on Governmental Affairs of the Senate and shall be published promptly in the 

Federal Register

.

Appendix A



The Family of Graphics Standards



The following computer graphics standards are now available to address the needs of government applications in creating,
modifying, manipulating, and exchanging computer-generated pictures:

 FIPS PUB 120-1, the Graphical Kernel System (GKS), which adopts ANSI X3.124-1985;

 FIPS PUB 153-1, the Programmer's Hierarchical Interactive Graphics System (PHIGS), which adopts ANSI/ISO
9592-1989;

 FIPS PUB 128-1, the Computer Graphics Metafile (CGM), which adopts ANSI/ISO 8632-1992 and

 FIPS PUB 177, the Initial Graphics Exchange Specification (IGES), which adopts ASME/ANSI Y14.24M-1989.

In addition, the Computer Graphics Interface (CGI) has recently become an International standard, and is expected
to be issued as a FIPs.

These standards fall into two categories: Application Programmer's Interface (API) standards, and Interoperability
standards. The goal of API standards is to enhance the portability of graphics programs (and programmers) between
installations and environments. The goal of Interoperability standards is to enable graphics data to be exchanged
successfully between graphics systems and devices.

Figure 1 is a very simple reference model of a computer graphics operating environment. The model emphasizes that
a graphics application program interacts with physical devices and human operators via a computer graphics environment.
Figure 1 also shows that the application may receive information from an external database.

The output of the graphics program, as shown in Figure 1, is directed to a virtual graphics device (i.e., Virtual Device
Interface or VDI) rather than directly to a physical device. A Device Driver provides an interface, implemented in
either hardware or software, for translating virtual device commands to commands understood by a particular physical
device. By substituting one device driver for another, an application can run on a different physical device. This
device independent is a central concept of this graphics reference model.

In Figure 1, the API standards reside in the box labelled the Device Independent Graphics Package. Interoperability
standards are related to the boxes in Figure labelled Metafile, Database and Virtual Device Interface. Figure 2 depicts
the various graphics standards associated with the general model shown in Figure 1. These are discussed below.

Application Programmer's Interface (API) Standards



Standards at the API promote program and programmer portability. A standard at this level specifies a set of operations
on a variety of graphics objects. An API standard provides for the portability of applications across a wide range
of computer hardware, operating systems, programming languages, and graphics devices. A program written to an API
standard at one facility in one environment should be easily transferable to another facility in a different environment.
Facility dependencies should be the major area requiring modification.


The specific functions supported by a particular API standard provide certain capabilities. The application programmer,
by identifying the capabilities needed, determines the API better suited for the application. As shown in Figure
2, there are currently two graphics API standards, GKS and PHIGS.


GKS provides a functional description of a two-dimensional (2D) graphics interface. It provides the basic graphics
support required by a wide variety of applications requiring the production of computer-generated pictures. A procedural
language binding of a functional standard specifies the exact name for each operation, its parameter sequence, and
the data types for the parameters. FORTRAN, Pascal, Ada and C language bindings are parts of GKS.


GKS is suitable for use in graphics programming applications that employ a broad spectrum of graphics, from simple
passive graphics output (where pictures are produced solely by output functions without interaction with an operator)
to interactive applications; and which control a whole range of graphics devices, including but not limited to vector
and raster devices, microfilm recorders, storage tube displays, refresh displays, and color displays.
'

PHIGS provides for the definition, display, modification, and manipulation of 2D and 3D graphical data. It provides
functionality to support storage of graphics and application data in a hierarchical form. Information may be inserted,
changed, and deleted from the hierarchical data storage with the functions provided by PHIGS. Language binding specifications
for PHIGS include FORTRAN, C and Ada.


PHIGS is specifically designed to meet the performance requirements of such demanding applications as Computer
Aided Design/Computer Aided Engineering/Computer Aided Manufacturing, command and control, molecular modeling,
simulation and process control.


Capabilities in PHIGS but not in GKS include: the centralized hierarchical data storage: the dynamic and responsive
nature of interactions; the addition of a modeling capability; and support for color models other than Red-Green-Blue
(RGB).



Interoperability Standards




Graphics Interoperability standards allow graphical data to be interchanged between graphics devices. As shown
in Figure 2, there are three graphics interoperability standards, CGM, (future) CGI, and IGES.

CGM is used for the storage and transfer of picture description information. It enables pictures to be recorded for
long term storage, and to be exchanged between graphics devices, system, and installations. As indicated in Figure
2, the storage mechanism for CGM is in the form of a neutral file formal called a metafile. The software which creates
the metafile is known as a CGM Generator. The software which reads and displays a CGM metafile is known as an Interpreter.


CGM specifies a semantic interface that describes 2D graphical entities using primitives (like polyline, text,
and ellipse) and attributes (like color, line width, interior style, and fonts). CGM is compatible with the specification
of 2D elements in GKS. A data encoding specifies the exact sequence of bits used to represent each operation and its
parameters. CGM contains three types of data stream encodings (binary, character, and clear text) to provide the
implementor choices depending on the particular application.


IGES provides a method for representing and storing geometric, topological, and nongeometric product definition
data that is independent of any one system. Where CGM transfers graphical pictures, IGES transfers a graphical database
which can be processed to represent a picture. Thus IGES represents more than just purely graphical data. As Figure
2 indicates, the storage mechanism for IGES is in the form of a neutral file format that must be translated by a Preprocessor
and Postprocessor for conversion between systems. IGES permits the compatible exchange of product definition data
used by various computer aided design/computer aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) systems.

The future CGI standard is designed to specify the exchange of information at the Virtual Device Interface. It will
provide an interface between the device independent and device dependent parts of a graphics system. Since CGI contains
information at a virtual level, it can be used to create a CGM. A CGM can also be output on a CGI device in a straightforward
manner.

<USDEPT>COMMITTEE FOR PURCHASE FROM PEOPLE WHO ARE BLIND OR SEVERELY DISABLED</USDEPT>



<DOCTITLE>Procurement List; Addition </DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or 
Severely Disabled.

 

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Addition to the procurement list.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This action adds to the Procurement List a commodity to 
be furnished by nonprofit agencies employing persons who are blind 
or have other severe disabilities. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On April 22, 1994, the Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled published notice (59 F.R.
19164) of proposed addition to the Procurement List. 
Comments were received from the current contractor for the 
applicator in response to a request for sales data. The contractor 
indicated that it is near a labor surplus area that is home to most 
of its workers and that it is experiencing less demand than it can 
supply. The contractor indicated that most of its workers are the 
sole support for their families. Consequently, the contractor 
believes that addition of the applicator to the Procurement List 
would have a severe adverse impact on the company. 



The proportion of the contractor's sales which it would lose if it 
were unable to sell this applicator to the Government is very 
small. It was not the current contractor for another item 
mentioned in its comments at the time the item was added to the 
Procurement List. Consequently, the loss of sales would not 
constitute severe adverse impact on the company. 

As the contractor admitted, it is not located in a labor surplus 
area even though some of its workers live in one. The contractor 
also did not state that workers would be discharged if the 
applicator is added to the Procurement List. Because these workers 
live near an area which is not considered a labor surplus area, 
they may well secure other employment if they are discharged. 
People with severe disabilities, on the other hand, have 
unemployment rates exceeding 65% nationally. Like the contractor's 
workers, people with severe disabilities are often the sole support 
for their families. Consequently, the Committee believes that the 
definite creation of jobs for people with severe disabilities by 
addition of the applicator to the Procurement List outweighs the 
possible loss of employment for people who can more easily find 
other jobs. 

After consideration of the material presented to it concerning 
capability of qualified nonprofit agencies to provide the 
commodity, fair market price, and impact of the addition on the 
current or most recent contractors, the Committee has determined 
that the commodity listed below is suitable for procurement by 
the Federal Government under 41 U.S.C. 46-48c and 41 CFR 51-2.4. 

I certify that the following action will not have a significant 
impact on a substantial number of small entities. The major 
factors considered for this certification were: 

1. The action will not result in any additional reporting, 
recordkeeping or other compliance requirements for small entities 
other than the small organizations that will furnish the commodity 
to the Government. 

2. The action does not appear to have a severe economic impact on 
current contractors for the commodity. 

3. The action will result in authorizing small entities to furnish 
the commodity to the Government. 

4. There are no known regulatory alternatives which would 
accomplish the objectives of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act (41 
U.S.C. 46-48c) in connection with the commodity proposed for 
addition to the Procurement List.

Accordingly, the following commodity is hereby added to the 
Procurement List: 




Applicator, Disposable 



6515-00-059-5235 




This action does not affect current contracts awarded prior to the 
effective date of this addition or options exercised under those 
contracts.

notices (59 F.R. 14154, 19164 and 22596) of proposed additions to the Procurement List. 



After consideration of the material presented to it concerning capability of qualified nonprofit agencies to provide
the commodities and service, fair market price, and impact of the additions on the current or most recent contractors,
the Committee has determined that the commodities and service listed below are suitable for procurement by the Federal
Government under 41 U.S.C. 46-48c and 41 CFR 51-2.4.

<AGENCY>

Consumer Product Safety Commission.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

In accordance with provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. chapter 35), the Consumer Product Safety
Commission has submitted to the Office of Management and Budget a request for approval, through September 30, 1994,
of a collection of information consisting of a survey of persons who call the Commission's hotline.



Each year, about 170,000 members of the public call the Commission's toll-free hotline to report unsafe products
or to obtain information on product recalls, general safety information, or referrals to other federal, state, or
local health, safety or consumer agencies.

On September 11, 1993, President Clinton issued Executive Order 12862, which includes the requirement that agencies
``survey customers to determine the kind and quality of services they want and their level of satisfaction with existing
services.'' The Commission's hotline is a major point of contact between the Commission and the public, and is one
of the few activities of the Commission for which customer service can be objectively measured. Therefore, it is critical
for CPSC to determine how hotline callers are being served.

The Commission plans to conduct a Customer Satisfaction Survey by sampling approximately 600 hotline callers. This
survey will be conducted by telephone and will require about four minutes for each interview. The Commission will
use the results of this survey to implement E.O. 12862 and to determine both the current level of customer satisfaction
and the additional kind and quality of services desired by the public.

<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Extension of comment period.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

this Notice of Availability previously published in the 

Federal Register

 on May 6, 1994 (59 FR 23710) is being republished to extend the comment period from June 5, 1994 to 27 June 1994, and to
correct a number of typographical errors. The Baltimore District of U.S. Army Corps of Engineers investigated the
feasibility of construction of fish and wildlife restoration measures in the Anacostia River basin. The District
Engineer recommends the restoration of 80 acres of wetlands, 5 miles of streams and 33 acres of bottomland habitat.
The feasibility study of the potential restoration actions was conducted under authority of a U.S. House of Representatives
Committee on Public Works and Transportation resolution adopted September 8, 1988. The non-Federal sponsors for
the feasibility phase of the project are: Montgomery County, Prince George's County, the District of Columbia, the
State of Maryland, the Interstate Commission on the Potomac River Basin, and the Metropolitan Washington Counsel
of Governments.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

1. The U.S. House of Representatives, Committee on Public Works and Transportation, authorized the Anacostia River
and Tributaries study in a re solution adopted on September 8, 1988. The resolution requested the Corps of Engineers
to determine if further improvements for flood control, navigation, erosion, sedimentation, water quality and
other related water resources needs are advisable on the Anacostia River and tributaries.




2. The Anacostia River basin is a 170-square mile sub-basin of the Potomac River. Headwaters of the Anacostia River
are in the piedmont and coastal plain areas of Montgomery and Prince George's Counties, Maryland and it joins with
the Potomac River in the District of Columbia. The entire river system is freshwater; although, the tidal influence
extends for approximately 9 miles above the confluence with the Potomac River.
3. The Corps of Engineers involvement in the basin dates back more than 115 years and includes projects and programs
for navigation, flood control, debris removal and aquatic vegetation control. These Federal actions have served
their intended purposes well and have benefited the area in terms of improved navigation and reduced flood damages.
However, from 1902 through the 1960s, project construction eliminated approximately 2,600 acres of wetlands, 99,000
linear feet of aquatic habitat and 700 acres of bottomland hardwoods. These ecosystems performed numerous beneficial
ecological functions for the Anacostia basin and the associated Potomac River and Chesapeake Bay. One of the primary
functions of these ecosystems is fish and wildlife habitat. Historically, the Anacostia River basin contained a
diverse assemblage of fish and wildlife species. However, populations of many species have sharply declined due
to the habitat loss and degradation in the Anacostia basin.






5. The Baltimore District has prepared a DEIS which describes the impacts of the proposed projects on environmental
and cultural resources in the study area and the overall public interest. The DEIS also apply guidelines issued by
the Environmental Protection Agency, under authority of Section 404 of the Clean Water Act of 1977 (P.L. 95-217).
An evaluation of the proposed actions on the waters of the United States was performed pursuant to the guidelines of
the Administrator, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, under authority of Section 404 of the Clean Water Act.
The Section 404(b)(1) evaluations show that the proposed actions meet all guidelines under the Clean Water Act, and
an exemption under Section 404(r) of Public Law 92-500, as amended is therefore requested.
6. The public involvement included meetings and close coordination with interested private individuals and organizations,
as well as concerned Federal, state and local agencies. A public notice requesting comments on the proposed project
and DS IS being provided to appropriate agencies and the public through printed media and mailings. The Baltimore
District invites potentially affected Federal, state and local agencies, and other interested organizations and
parties to comment on the study recommendations. Agencies that are currently involved in the feasibility study and
EIS process include, but are not limited to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service,
National Marine Fisheries Service, U.S. Geological Service, U.S. Soil Conservation Service, National Park Service,
National Capital Planning Commission, Montgomery County Department of Environmental Protection, Prince George's
County Department of Environmental Resources, District of Columbia Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs
and Department of Public Works, Maryland Department of Natural Resources, Maryland Department of the Environment,
Maryland National Capital Park and Planning Commission, Interstate Commission on the Potomac River Basin, and the
Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments.
7. In accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and the Clean Water Act, the Corps of Engineers
is soliciting comments from the public, Federal, state and local agencies and officials, and other interested parties.
Any comments received will be considered by the Corps of Engineers in the decision to implement the projects. To make
this decision, comments are used to assess impacts on endangered species, historic properties, water quality, general
environmental effects, and other interest factors listed above. Comments are also used to determine the overall
public interest and the need for a public hearing on the proposed activities. This public notice is being sent to organizations
and individuals known to have an interest in the restoration of the Anacostia River basin. Please bring this notice
to the attention of any other individuals with an interest in this matter.
8. Any person who has an interest in the proposed projects may make comments and/or request a public hearing. Comments
must clearly set forth the interest which may be adversely affected by these activities and the manner is which the
interest may be adversely affected. Copies of the DEIS are available upon request. Written comments must be submitted
within 30 calendar days of the date of the notice in the 

Federal Register

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The DOE announces that it plans to accept an unsolicited proposal and award a grant to Benedict College, Harden and
Blanding Streets, Columbia, South Carolina. The grant, ``Mathematics and Science Enrichment Program,'' will be
awarded for a three-year period at a DOE funding level of $648,000. Funds of $200,000 will be awarded for the first budget
period, and subject to the availability of funds, the remainder will be awarded for the second and third budget period.
Pursuant to 10 CFR 600.7(b) and 600.14, eligibility for this award has been limited to Benedict College as a result
of acceptance of their unsolicited proposal, and DOE has determined that award of a grant is appropriate. 


 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Procurement Request Number 


09-94SR18432.000. 



Project Scope 


The objective of this program is to identify, motivate, and begin preparation of students for science-based careers.
The proposed program will offer a year-round science and mathematics enrichment program for 75 youths in grades 4
through 9. The participants in this program will be among those underrepresented in science-based careers (minorities
and females). This program will provide to participants assistance in acquiring basic communication, computation
and reasoning skills, as well as exposure to a variety of science-based careers through field trips and the use of role
models. 

Benedict College is a Historically Black College or University (HBCU) and falls within the meaning and intent of Executive
Orders 12320, 12677 and 12876 pertaining to Government assistance to HBCUs. The participation of HBCUs in federally
supported programs is relatively limited. In order to overcome some of these limitations, the Executive Orders directed
federal agencies to increase the participation of HBCUs in federally-funded programs and to strengthen their capabilities
to provide quality education. This award represents an effort to strengthen the HBCU community. The program proposed
in the application is considered meritorious, and the activities to be carried out under this award would not be eligible
for financial assistance under any recent, current, or planned solicitation. Based on documentation presented
and appropriate evaluation, it is determined to be in the best interest of DOE to award a grant to Benedict College.

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of financial assistance award in response to a non-competitive financial assistance application.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) pursuant to the DOE Financial Assistance Rules, 10 CFR  600.7(b)(2) is announcing
its intention make a financial assistance award to the Electric Power Research Institute to perform a study on the
next generation geothermal power plant.




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

This proposal was a solicited application. The Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) issued a Request for Proposal
(RFP), RFP3657-01 ``Next Generation Geothermal Power Plant (NGGPP)_Phase 1 Studies'' on June 2, 1993. The
purpose of the RFP was to conduct studies that would expedite development of the next generation of geothermal power
plants. This includes development, evaluation and comparison of power plant concepts and ranking of the suitability
of these concepts for various geothermal resources. After a competitive evaluation process, EPRI selected the Ben
Holt Company to perform the study. Negotiations with the Department of Energy (DOE) for additional funding resulted
in 3 additional power plant concepts to be added to the scope of work. Competition for this effort would not be appropriate
for this effort since EPRI has already gone through a competitive process and it would have a significant impact on
the continuance and completion of the study.





The proposed project will contribute to the DOE mission of ``* * * providing the scientific foundation
[and] technology * * * necessary to achieve efficiency in energy use, diversity in energy sources,
and access to technical information * * *''. The results of the study will be published, presented
at several geothermal conferences and made available to the geothermal industry and to the public. The proposed study
to be completed by the Ben Holt Company are in harmony with the direction of the Geothermal Energy Conversion Program.


The objectives of this effort are to evaluate the feasibility, efficiency, environmental impacts and the economics
of geothermal power plant technologies. This study is envisioned to be vital to developers in determining which technology
to use to most efficiently utilize their geothermal resource.


Technologies that will be covered through this study are the following: Commercial air-cooled binary plants; commercial
flash plants; advanced binary cycles, which includes the use of mixed and alternative working fluids, alternative
cooling systems, advanced turbines and supersaturated turbine expansion; the Kalina cycle, which uses an ammonia-water
mixture as the working fluid and regenerative pre-heating and partial vaporization; advanced flash concepts that
will incorporate the use of equipment advances and cycle modifications; the use of rotary separator turbines in lieu
of steam flash tanks; sub-atmospheric flash cycles; hot dry rock; steam flash/binary hybrid plants; and geothermal/natural
gas hybrid plants.

The above listed technologies will be optimized and rated for various geothermal resources. The geothermal resources
that will be used in this evaluation provide a cross section of possible temperature and pressure ranges available.

The probability of meeting the objectives listed above are very high. The Ben Holt Company has been involved in the
geothermal industry for over 30 years, and the individuals involved have the experience and education that are needed
and required for this study.


The staff of the Ben Holt Company are qualified and positioned to provide this service. Part of the competitive process
accomplished by EPRI was to verify that the applicants personnel were qualified to preform this task. DOE has also
verified that the individuals involved in this study have the appropriate education and experience.

The Ben Holt Company's base of operations is an office in Pasadena, California, and is fully capable of meeting their
needs.

The budget proposed for the anticipated work was reviewed and is considered to be appropriate and adequate.

The public benefit to be derived from the proposed study will be an evaluation that shows utilities, independent power
producers and developers how to optimize the geothermal resources that are available to them. This study will also
show the economics and the environmental benefits of using geothermal energy.

The evaluation accomplished through the proposed cooperative agreement support the geothermal energy conversion
program's direction and objectives. EPRI has competitively chosen the Ben Holt Company to perform this evaluation.
Therefore, issuing a solicitation for a competitive bid to accomplish a study of the Next Generation Geothermal Power
Plant would be inappropriate and would have a significant adverse impact on the accomplishment and completion of
the desired report.

Notice of Financial Assistance Award in Response to a Non-Competitive Financial Assistance Application.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 


The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) pursuant to the DOE Financial Assistance Rules, 10 CFR 600.7(b)(2) is announcing
its intention make a financial assistance award to the International Geothermal Association to encourage research,
development and utilization of geothermal resources worldwide through the compilation, publication and dissemination
of scientific and technical data and information.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 


This proposal was a solicited application. The International Geothermal Association (IGA) Secretariat is the U.S.
office, located in Berkeley, California, of the International Geothermal Association which is the parent organization
with its headquarters in New Zealand. The objective of the IGA is to assist the Berkeley office in its outreach activities,
encourage research, development and utilization of geothermal resources worldwide through the compilation publication
and dissemination of scientific and technical data and information, both within the community of geothermal specialists
and between geothermal specialists and the general public. The IGA Secretariat has been supported in the past by the
Department of Energy through a contract with Sandia National Laboratory; however, the Department believes that
the proposed effort will provide a benefit to the public and therefore a grant mechanism is a more appropriate funding
method. Competition for this effort would have an adverse effect on continuity and completion of activities. 






The proposed project will contribute to the DOE mission of ``* * * providing the scientific and educational
foundation and technology * * * necessary to achieve efficiency in energy use, diversity in energy
sources, and access to technical information * * *''. The International Geothermal Association
(IGA) will do this by supporting the U.S. geothermal industry through various activities and will work to create data
bases and a business environment in which the U.S. geothermal industry can thrive, globally. 


The objectives of the IGA Secretariat, located in Berkeley, California, are to provide assistance in preparing and
distributing the IGA newsletter (produced and published in the United States), developing educational programs
appropriate for the IGA membership, stimulating international interest in geothermal energy, identifying potential
international development opportunities, and continuing involvement in the Organizing Committee of the World
Geothermal Conference 1995. The Secretariat also provides coordination of all activities, correspondence and
meetings for the IGA, maintains the master list of the IGA membership as well as their potential members and works to
enhance the benefits of IGA membership. 


The probability of meeting the objectives listed above are very high, given that the IGA has been successful in the
past for similar endeavors. 


The staff of the International Geothermal Association Secretariat are qualified and positioned to provide this
service. George Frye has been the Executive Director of the IGA Secretariat since February 1993, Mr. Frye has 20 years
experience within the oil/gas/geothermal industry and is a registered professional engineer. 


The IGA Secretariat's base of operations is in the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory in Berkeley, California, and is fully
capable of meeting their needs. 


The budget proposed for the anticipated work has been reviewed and is considered to be appropriate and adequate. 


The public benefit to be derived through this grant with the IGA Secretariat is the increased awareness of international
opportunities for the U.S. geothermal industry. Many countries throughout the world have the resources for geothermal
energy. The U.S. geothermal industry is a world leader and is poised to exploit these resources. The IGA provides an
invaluable global link where contacts are found and made, thereby facilitating the world-wide utilization of geothermal
energy. 


The Services provided through the proposed grant fully supports the program's direction and objectives. The International
Geothermal Association Secretariat is qualified and positioned to perform the above mentioned tasks. The IGA is
an accepted and respected industry association and has approximately 1,970 members largely from the geothermal
service industries. The IGA has established an information network which is continually growing. Competition for
this effort would have a significant adverse impact on the continuation of the proposed activities.

<DOCTITLE>Golden Field Office; Federal Assistance Award to Southern California Edison Company</DOCTITLE>


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Department of Energy.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of Financial Assistance Award in Response to an Unsolicited Financial Assistance Application.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), pursuant to the DOE Financial Assistance Rules, 10 CFR 600.7, is announcing its
intention to enter into a cooperative agreement with Southern California Edison (SCE) Company for an on-grid photovoltaics
(PV) implementation program.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

DOE has evaluated, in accordance with  600.14 of the Federal Assistance Regulations, the unsolicited proposal
entitled ``PV Implementation Program'' and recommends that the unsolicited proposal be accepted for support without
further competition in accordance with  600.14 of the Federal Assistance Regulations.


DOE is actively pursuing a program towards solar energy conversion, with one major objective being the cost-effective
application of photovoltaics (PV) in utility applications. This SCE activity directly relates to the program objective
and could be a significant step toward the implementation of PV in utility applications. The proposal from SCE is a
unique opportunity to install PV in a utility application which is likely to be one of the closest to being cost effective
in the near term. In addition, SCE is active in the promotion of renewable energy sources and is an ideal utility candidate
to pursue the proposed PV application.
The proposed application involves using PV to meet peak load requirements on selected SCE electric distribution
circuits. The circuits of interest are old, underground 4 kV circuits which have reached the limit of their load-carrying
capability. The circuits serve residential areas which have seen recent growth in peak load requirements so that
the circuits will soon exceed their limit during the summer peak load period. Without PV, the main alternative is to
replace the circuits by excavating city streets and landscaping to install new underground, high-capacity cable.
Installing PV to meet the peak load requirements on these circuits results in the deferment of this significant cable
replacement expense. SCE estimated that replacement of about 200 miles of underground 4 kV circuits in their system
could be deferred by the use of grid-connected PV. This would require approximately 25 MW of PV to meet the peak loads
on these circuits.
The successful implementation of this project would provide:
1. The installation of on-grid PV systems in high-value, distributed-generation locations.
2. Major sustained PV procurements over several years, resulting in a stimulus to suppliers.
3. PV price reductions which are expected to occur from large, sequential installations.
4. Consistent, professionally-designed PV installations which will serve as demonstrations for other utilities
and industries.
5. A cleaner environment in the SCE service area.
The proposed on-grid PV installations are well-suited to the SCE service area. Several candidate 4 kV circuits have
been identified for the displacement of peak loads by grid-connected PV, with a sufficiently large number of potential
additional circuits to allow the project to develop into a major PV demonstration if warranted. Preliminary surveys
conducted by SCE indicate that sufficient space will be available in the residential areas to allow PV installations.

SCE has significant previous experience in PV systems, and has the necessary facilities to perform design and monitoring
functions. SCE has been involved with PV since 1978, and has been one of the most active utilities in the field of renewable
energy. By assigning a Manager of PV Applications, SCE has increased its commitment to PV development and implementation.

SCE has proposed a two-phase program, including a project feasibility assessment and project implementation. The
feasibility assessment will identify all technical, regulatory, budget/schedule, and environmental issues related
to the program in combination with the installation and monitoring of several small, pilot PV systems. The results
of this initial project phase will be used by SCE and DOE to determine the merits of proceeding to the second phase. Phase
II will include PV system final design, installation, and performance monitoring, and will proceed only after completion
of Phase I and after approval from DOE.

The team proposed by SCE has sufficient experience in the development and deployment of PV systems, and should be capable
of successfully implementing the proposed on-grid PV program. As noted above, SCE has appointed a Manager of PV Applications
to strengthen the emphasis on PV implementation.

The proposed multi-disciplinary team includes personnel with experience in project management, cost/schedule
development and control, project engineering, PV applications, system planning, environmental affairs, and customer
service. As a major electric utility which has successfully completed complex energy generation projects, SCE has
the expertise required to perform all functions associated with PV implementation and monitoring in the proposed
application.

In addition, a Project Review Committee (PRC) will be established during the initial project phase to assist in technical,
analysis, data collection, and information dissemination issues. The PRC will have members from SCE, DOE, UPVG,
and national laboratories.

The proposal has been found to be meritorious as stated above in the evaluation. The SCE program represents a unique
approach to utility applications of PV which has potential for near-term cost effectiveness. SCE has the capabilities
and commitment to renewable energy sources which should provide a basis for successful PV implementation in the proposed
application. The proposed project is not eligible for financial assistance under a recent, current, or planned solicitation.

The program cost is estimated to be $5,000,000 total, with the DOE share being $2,500,000 and the SCE share being $2,500,000.

<DOCTITLE>Golden Field Office; Federal Assistance Award to Utility Photo Voltaic Group</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Department of Energy.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of Financial Assistance Award in Response to a Financial Assistance Application.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), pursuant to the DOE Financial Assistance Rules, 10 CFR 600.7, is announcing its
intention to renew a Cooperative Agreement with the Utility PhotoVoltaic Group (UPVG) for a multi-task photovoltaics
(PV) program intended to continue outreach efforts to electric utilities and to begin a multi-year PV hardware initiative.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

DOE has evaluated, in accordance with  600.7 of the Federal Assistance Regulations, the proposal entitled
``Phase 2 Plan for the Utility PhotoVoltaic Group'' submitted by UPVG. DOE recommends that the proposal for work continuation
be accepted for support without further competition in accordance with  600.7 of 10 CFR part 600.



The project extension will be performed in ten tasks, with emphasis toward outreach to educate utility and other audiences
and toward building a foundation for accelerated utility PV purchase commitments. The overall UPVG objective is
the establishment of an accelerated market for PV systems that allows reduced PV costs through economy of scale. The
program is intended to develop and disseminate PV information for utilities, prompt utility purchases, and develop
a foundation for a multi-year PV hardware initiative.

The programmatic evaluation [see 10 CFR 600.7(b)(2)(ii)(D)] completed for this proposal resulted in a recommendation
to fund this grant application for the following reasons:



A. Overall Merit and Relevance to the DOE Mission



DOe is actively pursuing a program towards solar energy conversion, with a major program objective being the cost-effective
use of photovoltaics (PV) in utility applications. The UPVG activities directly support the DOE objectives by involving
a large group of member electric utilities in the near-term implementation of large-scale PV systems. The UPVG represents
an ideal and totally unique mechanism to encourage the use of PV through DOE financial support of the large, unified
group of interested utilities.



B. Anticipated Objectives and Probability of Success in Meeting Them



The proposed activities continue a multi-year program at UPVG intended to result in the achievement of PV acceptance
and use by electric utilities. The program involves several different tasks, with an overall objective being the
installation of 50 MW of new utility PV generation capacity within 5 years.

The current UPVG program includes ten overall tasks, each with multiple subtasks. The ten tasks include:



1. Technology Transfer and Member Development.
2. Commercialization Strategies.
3. Applications and Markets.
4. Planning and Evaluation.
5. Engineering and Demonstrations.
6. External Outreach and Coordination.
7. TEAM-UP Organization Development.
8. Initiate Small-Scale Applications.
9. Initiate Large-Scale Applications.
10. Management and Administration.




Each of these tasks is a required element of the overall program to develop a utility market for PV.



The successful implementation of this project would result in:




1. Continued UPVG member utility involvement with PV technology.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940617-2-00066 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940617-2-00042 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

2. Recruitment of additional utility members in UPVG.
3. PV information dissemination to utilities and other groups.
4. Refined market analysis and PV evaluation tools, such as a cost estimating guide and PV-SCREEN, for analysis of
grid-connected PV systems.
5. Initiation of PV utility applications via large- and small-scale demonstrations.




From the previous project phase, UPVG has developed a working relationship with its member utilities and has the expertise
to recruit additional utility members. Most of the other tasks in this phase are also extensions of work previously
begun by UPVG, such as information dissemination and PV market analysis. The techniques required for successful
completion of the proposed tasks are available at UPVG and have already been demonstrated in the previous activities.
Thus, the probability of success is high.


C. Quality of the Applicant's Personnel and Facilities


The proposed efforts by UPVG do not require unique facilities or equipment.
The team proposed by UPVG has significant experience in the development and deployment of PV systems, and should be
capable of successfully implementing the proposed PV program. The team includes senior personnel from several different
organizations, including private consultants with experience in utility projects, the Electric Power Research
Institute, and several electric utilities. The UPVG Executive Director has significant experience in technology
transfer and the management of associations since, in addition to UPVG, he also provides management and staff support
to the Fuel Cell Commercialization Group, the National Hydrogen Association, and the Utility Biomass Energy Technology
Association.
In addition, a UPVG Board of Directors was previously established to assist in management, financial, technical,
and other issues. The Board is composed of personnel from member utilities.


D. Appropriateness and Adequacy of the Proposed Budget


The budget proposed for the anticipated work was reviewed and is considered to be appropriate and adequate. A total
of $1,209,000 will be required for the program, with $1,000,000 provided by DOE for the period of February 15, 1994
to March 31, 1995. Cost sharing will be provided by UPVG in the amount of $209,000.
The UPVG program represents a unique approach to achieving utility involvement with PV. The program has potential
to result in near-term utility applications of PV technology and is consistent with DOE objectives. The proposed
project is not eligible for financial assistance under a recent, current, or planned solicitation.
Competition for the effort would have a significant adverse impact on the continuity and completion of the proposed
activity. The UPVG is the only organization whose sole purpose is the advancement and development of cost-effective
utility applications of PV. UPVG has established relationships with all the utility participants and has developed
an understanding of the technical and management issues required for successful and timely accomplishment of program
objectives. Therefore, recompetition would cause a time delay of numerous months in task completion and would require
a significant duplication of costs to enable a new awardee to perform the proposed tasks.

<DOCTITLE>Central Maine Power Co., et al; Edwards Manufacturing, Inc., and Town of Madison, Maine; Notice of Intent To Prepare
An Environmental Impact Statement and Conduct Public Scoping Meetings</DOCTITLE>



June 13, 1994. 



The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) has received an application for license of hydroelectric projects
within the Kennebec River Basin in the State of Maine. The hydropower projects are located north of the City of Augusta
along the Kennebec River. The projects are: Weston No. 2325, Ft. Halifax No. 2552, Automatic No. 2555, Union Gas No.
2556, Rick Rips No. 2557, Oakland No. 2559, Wyman No. 2329, Moosehead No. 2671, Moxie No. 2613, Edwards No. 2389 and
Sandy River No. 11433. 

The FERC staff has determined that licensing these projects would constitute a major federal action significantly
affecting the quality of the human environment. Therefore, the staff intends to prepare an Environmental Impact
Statement (EIS) on the hydroelectric projects in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act. 

The staff's EIS will objectively consider both site specific and cumulative environmental impacts of the projects
and reasonable alternatives, and will include an economic, financial and engineering analysis. 

A draft EIS will be issued and circulated for review by all the interested parties. All comments filed on the draft EIS
will be analyzed by the staff and considered in a final EIS. The staff's conclusions and recommendations will then
be presented for the consideration of the Commission in reaching its final licensing decision. 



Scoping Meetings



The FERC staff will conduct two scoping meetings. An evening scoping meeting is primarily for public input while a
morning meeting will focus on resource agency concerns. All interested individuals, organizations, and agencies
are invited to attend and assist the staff in identifying the scope of environmental issues that should be analyzed
in the EIS. 

The first scoping meeting will be held on Wednesday, July 13, 1994, from 7:30 p.m. until 10:30 p.m. in the Cushnoc Auditorium,
Augusta Civic Center, Augusta, Maine. Issues of primary concern to to general public will be the focus of the meeting.
The second scoping meeting will be held on Thursday, July 14, 1994, from 8:30 a.m. until 12:30 p.m. at the Augusta Civic
Center Drive, in the Washington and York rooms. 

The Augusta Civic Center can be reached from the Maine Turnpike by taking Exit 31-South onto Civic Center Drive; proceed
one-half mile to the Civic Center entrance. 

Prior to the meetings, Scoping Document 1 Revised (SD 1-R) will be mailed to the list of interested parties. SD
1-R identifies resources issues to be address in the EIS. Copies of SD 1-R will also be available at the scoping
meetings or can be obtained by writing: FERC-Kennebec Projects, c/o Doug Hjorth, Stone Webster, 245 Summer Street,
Boston, MA 02210. 



Objectives 



At the scoping meetings the staff will: (1) Summarize the environmental issues tentatively identified for analysis
in the planned EIS; (2) determine the relative depth of analysis for issues to be addressed in the EIS; (3) identify
resource issues that are not important and do not require detailed analysis; (4) solicit from the meeting participants
all available information, especially quantified data, on the resources at issue; and (5) encourage statements
from experts and the public on issues that should be analyzed in the EIS, including points of view in opposition to,
or in support of, the staff's preliminary views.




Procedures 



The meetings will be recorded by a stenographer and all statements (oral and written) thereby become a part of the formal
record of the Commission proceedings. Individuals presenting statements at the meetings will be asked to clearly
identify themselves for the record. 

Individuals, organizations, and agencies with environmental expertise and concerns are encouraged to attend the
meetings and to assist the staff in defining and clarifying the issues to be addressed in the EIS. 

Participants at the public meetings are asked to keep oral comments brief and concise. 

Persons choosing not to speak at the meetings, but who have views on the issues or information relevant to the issues,
may submit written statements for inclusion in the public record. In addition, written scoping comments may be filed
with the Secretary, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE, Washington, DC 20426, until
August 15, 1994.

All written correspondence should clearly show the following caption on the first page: Kennebec River Basin EIS.


All those that are formally recognized by the Commission as intervenors in the licensing proceeding are asked to refrain
from engaging staff or its contractor in discussions of the merits of the projects outside of any announced meetings.


Further, parties are reminded of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure, requiring parties filing documents
with the Commission, to serve a copy of the document on each person whose name is on the official service list.

the regulations (see Order No. 533 issued May 8, 1991, 
56 FR 23108 (May 20, 1991)), that all preliminary 
comments, recommendations, terms and conditions be 
filed with the Commission within 90 days from the 
issuance date of this notice and the date of issuance 
of the draft application, whichever is later. All 
reply comments must be filed with the Commission within 
135 days from the date of this notice and the date of 
issuance of the draft application, whichever is later. 

Anyone may obtain an extension of time for these 
deadlines from the Commission only upon a showing of 
good cause or extraordinary circumstances in accordance 
with 18 CFR 385.2008. 

All filings must: (1) Bear in all capital letters the 
title ``COMMENTS'', ``REPLY COMMENTS'', ``RECOMMENDATIONS'', 
``TERMS AND CONDITIONS'', or ``PRESCRIPTIONS''; (2) set 
forth in the heading the name of the potential 
applicant and the project number of the application to 
which the filing responds; (3) furnish the name, 
address, and telephone number of the person submitting 
the filing; and (4) otherwise comply with the 
requirements of 18 CFR 385.2001 through 385.2005. All 
comments, recommendations, terms and conditions or 
prescriptions must set forth their evidentiary basis 
and otherwise comply with the requirements of 18 CFR 
4.34(b), except as amended by this notice with respect 
to deadline, mailing list, and the requirement to file 
all comments upon issuance of this notice rather than 
upon notice of an application being ready for 
environmental analysis. Any of these documents must be 
filed by providing the original and eight copies to: 
Secretary, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 
North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426. An 
additional copy must be sent to: Director, Division of

The procedures for service of all comments (including 
preliminary recommendations, terms and conditions, and 
prescriptions) filed with the Commission for the 
Lorella Project shall be: (1) All comments (and any 
attachments) must be served on the Commission's service 
list which includes all entities receiving a draft 
application and final application; (2) a letter 
notification that comments have been filed with the 
Commission must be served on the general mailing list 
(exclusive of service list entities) prepared for this 
project by the Commission; (3) for convenience, the 
Commission will make available on request to any entity 
filing comments a computer diskette of these 
mailing lists. Commenters may obtain computerized 
copies of these mailing lists from Sabina Joe at (202) 
219-1648. 

(2) Pursuant to  4.32(b)(7) of 18 CFR of the 
Commission's regulations, if any resource agency, 
Indian Tribe, or person believes that an additional 
scientific study should be conducted in order to form 
an adequate factual basis for a complete analysis of 
the application on its merit, the resource agency, 
Indian Tribe, or person must formally file a request 
for a study with the Commission not later than 90 days 
from the issuance date of this notice and issuance date 
of the draft application, whichever is later, and serve 
a copy of the request on the potential applicant. (See 
j(1) above for filing and service). Except for the 
filing deadline set forth in this notice, Section 
4.32(b)(7) shall apply. This shall be the last 
opportunity in the Lorella licensing process to request 
additional scientific studies. This substitutes for 
the request for additional scientific studies made at 
the time of tendering for filing of an application 
under the Commission's traditional licensing process. 

k. Status of Environmental Analysis: Under third party 
contract provisions of the National Energy Policy Act of 
1992, the Commission is supervising the selected third party 
contractor's ongoing preparation of a Draft Environmental 
Impact Statement (DEIS) for the Lorella Project. The 
Commission plans to issue a DEIS at the same time as (or 
shortly after) the potential applicant files a final 
application with the Commission. Preliminary comments, 
terms, conditions, and prescriptions, and additional 
scientific study requests solicited with this notice are 
critical to the development of the DEIS. Final comments, 
recommendations, terms, conditions, and prescriptions will 
be solicited at the time of filing of the final application 
and issuance of the DEIS. 

l. With this notice, we are initiating consultation with the 
Oregon STATE HISTORIC PRESERVATION OFFICER (SHPO), as 
required by Section 106, National Historic Preservation Act,

p. Scoping Process: In gathering background information for 
preparation of the environmental document for the issuance 
of a Federal hydropower license, staff of the Federal Energy 
Regulatory Commission, is using a scoping process to 
identify significant environmental issues related to the 
construction and operation or the continued operation of 
hydropower projects. The staff will review all issues raised 
during the scoping process and identify issues deserving of 
study and also deemphasize insignificant issues, narrowing 
the scope of the environmental analysis as well. If 
preliminary analysis indicates that any issues presented in 
the scoping process would have little potential for causing 
significant impacts, the issue or issues will be identified 
and the reasons for not providing a more detailed analysis 
will be given.

q. Request for Scoping Comments: Federal, state, and local 
resource agencies; licensees, applicants and developers; 
Indian tribes; other interested groups and individuals, are 
requested to forward to the Commission, any information that 
they believe will assist the Commission staff in conducting 
an accurate and thorough analysis of the site-specific and 
cumulative environmental effects of the proposed licensing 
activities of the project(s). Therefore you are requested 
to provide information related to the following items: 
 Information, data, maps or professional opinion that 
may contribute to defining the geographical and 
temporal scope of the analysis and identifying 
significant environmental issues. 
 Identification of and information from any other EIS or 
similar study (previous, on-going, or planned) relevant 
to the proposed licensing activities in the subject 
river basin. 
 Existing information and any data that would aid in 
describing the past and present effects of the 
project(s) and other developmental activities on the 
physical/chemical, biological, and socioeconomic 
environments. For example, fish stocking/management 
histories in the subject river, historic water quality 
data and the reasons for improvement or degradation of 
the quality, any wetland habitat loss or proposals to 
develop land and water resources within the basin.

basis and, therefore, there is no impact on its existing design day and annual obligations to its customers as a result
of the construction of the new point of delivery.

8. Koch Gateway Pipeline Co.



[Docket No. CP94-597-000]


Take notice that on June 8, 1994, Koch Gateway Pipeline Company (Koch Gateway), P.O. Box 1478, Houston, Texas 77251-1478,
filed in Docket No. CP94-597-000 a request pursuant to Sections 157.205 and 157.211 of the Commission's
Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR   157.205, 157.211) for authorization to construct and
operate a sales tap through which it would deliver natural gas to Entex, Inc. (Entex) under Koch Gateway's blanket
certificate issued in Docket No. CP82-430-000 pursuant to Section 7 of the Natural Gas Act, all as more
fully set forth in the request that is on file with the Commission and open to public inspection. 
Koch Gateway proposes to construct and operate a six-inch sales tap, located on its Jackson-Magnolia line in Hinds
County, Mississippi, which would be used to deliver gas to the town of Byram which is a customer of Entex. Koch Gateway
states that the estimated cost of the tap is $8,000. Koch Gateway proposes to deliver up to 1,000 MMBtu per day under
its NNS Rate Schedule and an additional 4,200 MMBtu per day under its ITS Rate Schedule. Koch Gateway also states that
the new tap will not change the existing certificated entitlements for Entex. 


Comment date: 

July 25, 1994, in accordance with Standard Paragraph G at the end of this notice.

Title:

 Collection of Economic and Regulatory Support Data Under RCRA (ICR No. 1641.01). This ICR requests approval for a
new collection.


Abstract:

 EPA's Office of Solid Waste (OSW) is requesting approval for a generic clearance to collect economic and regulatory
impact data through surveys, interviews, or focus group meetings with industry or other parties in support of the
Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) rulemaking actions. RCRA, as amended by the Hazardous and Solid Waste
Amendments, requires EPA to establish a national regulatory program to ensure that hazardous waste is managed in
a manner protective of human health and the environment. EPA is authorized under sections 2002 and 3007 of RCRA to collect
information from industry and other parties when necessary to carry out its regulatory responsibilities. 
The information collected will be used to assess the costs and benefits of various potential regulatory and nonregulatory
actions. 
The first collection to be administered under the generic clearance, the Hazardous Waste Identification Rule (HWIR)
Expert Elicitations, is included in this ICR. Information will be collected through interviews (expert elicitations)
with hazardous and industrial solid waste experts to support development of alternative approaches for hazardous
waste identification. The Agency will conduct two sets of expert elicitations, one for each HWIR regulatory option:
Contaminated Soil and Sediment Media; and Contaminated Debris.


Burden Statement:

 The public reporting burden for this generic collection is estimated to average 3 hours per response and the burden
for the HWIR Expert Elicitations collection ranges from 15 minutes to 1.5 hours per respondent. These estimates include
all aspects of the information collection including the time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data
sources, gathering the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information. 


Respondents:

 Hazardous waste generators, scientists, industry experts, and treatment, storage and disposal facilities.


Estimated Number of Respondents:

 3,000.


Estimated Number of Responses per Respondent:

 1.4. 


Estimated Total Annual Burden on Respondents:

 12,780 hours.


Frequency of Collection:

 On Occasion.
Send comments regarding the burden estimate, or any other 

aspect of this collection of information, including suggestions for 
reducing the burden, to:




Sandy Farmer, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Information Policy Branch (2136), 401 M Street, SW., Washington,

<DOCTITLE>Conformity; General Preamble for Exemption From Nitrogen Oxides Provisions </DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 General preamble for future proposed rulemakings. 





</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This General Preamble clarifies how EPA believes that nonclassifiable (i.e., submarginal, transitional, and incomplete/no
data) ozone nonattainment areas which are outside the Northeast ozone transport region and have ambient monitoring
data demonstrating attainment of the national ambient air quality standard for ozone may be exempted from the conformity
rules' nitrogen oxides (NO

x

) requirements. This notice also references a recent memorandum which states EPA's preliminary interpretation
for such ozone nonattainment areas which are classified as marginal or above. 



Clarification of EPA policy for areas with monitoring data which demonstrates attainment is particularly important
because many areas already have such data and appear to qualify for exemption from the conformity NO

x

 requirements. 

In order to avoid repetition, this General Preamble describes guidance on NOx exemptions with respect to the transportation
conformity rule. However, this guidance for transportation conformity is intended to also apply with respect to
general conformity. 

This General Preamble explains EPA's policy generally for future notice-and-comment rulemakings taking action
on requests for NOx exemptions for specific areas. It contains EPA's preliminary interpretations of relevant provisions
of the Clean Air Act and the conformity rules. The interpretations contained herein are not binding as a matter of law
until final rulemaking action is taken on each specific area. Opportunity for public comment on NOx exemption determinations
made by EPA will be provided separately for each area during these individual rulemakings.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 


I. Background 


A. Transportation Conformity Rule 



The transportation conformity final rule, entitled ``Criteria and Procedures for Determining Conformity to State
or Federal Implementation Plans of Transportation Plans, Programs, and Projects Funded or Approved Under title
23 U.S.C. or the Federal Transit Act,'' was published in the 

Federal Register

 on November 24, 1993 (58 FR 62188). This action was required under section 176(c)(4) of the Clean Air Act, as amended
in 1990. 

Conformity to an implementation plan is defined in the Clean Air Act as conformity to an implementation plan's purpose
of eliminating or reducing the severity and number of violations of the national ambient air quality standards and
achieving expeditious attainment of such standards. In addition, Federal activities may not cause or contribute
to new violations of air quality standards, exacerbate existing violations, or interfere with timely attainment
or required interim emission reductions towards attainment. The transportation conformity final rule establishes
the process by which the Federal Highway Administration and the Federal Transit Administration of the United States
Department of Transportation and metropolitan planning organizations determine the conformity of highway and
transit projects. Under the rule, conformity applies in nonattainment and maintenance areas. 

The transportation conformity rule requires ozone nonattainment and maintenance areas to perform a regional emissions
analysis of motor vehicle NOx emissions in order to determine the conformity of transportation plans and programs.
This analysis must demonstrate that the NO

x

 emissions which would result from the transportation system if the proposed transportation plan and program were
implemented are within the total allowable level of NO

x

 emissions from highway and transit motor vehicles (``motor vehicle emissions budget''), as identified in a submitted
or approved attainment demonstration or maintenance plan. 

Until an attainment demonstration or (for nonclassifiable areas) a maintenance plan is approved by EPA, the regional
emissions analysis of the transportation system must also satisfy the ``build/no-build test.'' That is, the analysis
must demonstrate that emissions from the transportation system if the proposed transportation plan and program
were implemented would be less than the emissions from the transportation system if only the previously applicable
transportation plan and program were implemented. Furthermore, the regional emissions analysis must show that
emissions from the transportation system if the transportation plan and program were implemented would be lower
than 1990 levels by any nonzero amount. 

The transportation conformity rule as currently written provides for an exemption from these requirements with
respect to NO

x

 if the Administrator determines under section 182(f) of the Clean Air Act that additional reductions of NO

x

 would not contribute to attainment. This exemption is explicitly referred to and is described in similar language
in  51.394(b)(3)(i) (the ``Applicability'' section of the rule) and in the preamble (58 FR 62197, November
24, 1993). The language is repeated in the provisions of the rule regarding the motor vehicle emissions budget test
( 51.428(a)(1)(ii)) and the ``build/no-build'' test (  51.436(e), 51.438(e)), although Clean
Air Act section 182(f) is not specifically mentioned. 

Section 182(f) of the Clean Air Act contains requirements for_and in some cases, exemptions for_major stationary
NO

x

 sources in marginal and above ozone nonattainment areas and in an ozone transport region. EPA guidance for application
of section 182(f) in these areas is briefly described and referenced in the next section of this preamble. Because
the transportation conformity rule covers all nonattainment areas_including nonclassifiable ozone nonattainment
areas (

i.e., 

submarginal, transitional, incomplete/no data areas) that are not necessarily covered under section 182(f)_corresponding
guidance is needed for applying in these nonclassifiable ozone nonattainment areas the section 182(f) NO

x

 exemption referenced in the transportation conformity rule. This guidance is described below (section II, ``EPA
Policy'') and is consistent with the existing guidance that applies to the marginal and above areas outside an ozone
transport region. The substantive test for a NO

x

 exemption is the same in both sets of areas, but in nonclassifiable ozone nonattainment areas the effect of a NO

x

 exemption is limited solely to the issue of whether such areas may be exempted from meeting the NO

x

 requirements of the transportation conformity rule. 



B. General Conformity 



On November 30, 1993 (58 FR 63214), EPA published the general conformity final rule, entitled ``Determining Conformity
of General Federal Actions to State or Federal Implementation Plans.'' This action was required under section 176(c)(4)
of the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1990. 

Like the transportation conformity rule, the general conformity rule exempts an area from considering NO

x

 emissions if the area has been exempted under section 182(f) of the Clean Air Act (see definition of ``precursors of
a criteria pollutant,'' 58 FR 63248). 

In order to avoid repetition, this General Preamble describes guidance on NO

x

 exemptions with respect to the transportation conformity rule. However, this guidance for transportation conformity
is intended to also apply with respect to general conformity.

C. Section 182(f) of the Clean Air Act 



Section 182(f) of the Clean Air Act requires states to apply the reasonably available control technology (RACT) and
new source review (NSR) requirements that apply to major stationary sources of volatile organic compounds to major
stationary sources of NO

x

 as well. NO

X

 RACT is required in moderate and above ozone areas, as well as in all areas within an ozone transport region. NO

X

 NSR regulations are required in marginal and above ozone areas, as well as in all areas within an ozone transport region.


Clean Air Act section 182(f)(1)(A) states that, for nonattainment areas not within an ozone transport region (as
established under Clean Air Act section 184), these NO

X

 requirements shall not apply if the Administrator determines that additional reductions of NO

X

 would not contribute to attainment of the national ambient air quality standard (NAAQS) for ozone in the area. Furthermore,
for areas within an ozone transport region, section 182(f)(1)(B) states that these stationary source NO

X

 requirements shall not apply if additional NO

X

 reductions would not produce net ozone air quality benefits in the region. 
EPA issued limited guidance on section 182(f) exemptions in a September 17, 1993 memo from Michael H. Shapiro, Acting
Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation, to the Regional Air Division Directors entitled, ``State Implementation
Plan (SIP) Requirements for Areas Submitting Requests for Redesignation to Attainment of the Ozone and Carbon Monoxide
(CO) National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) on or after November 15, 1992.'' EPA issued more extensive guidance
in a December 1993 document entitled, ``Guideline for Determining the Applicability of Nitrogen Oxide Requirements
under section 182(f).'' Most recently, EPA has clarified and, in part, revised its guidance in a May 27, 1994 memorandum
from John S. Seitz, Director of the Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards, to Regional Air Division Directors,
``Section 182(f) NO

X

 Exemptions_Revised Process and Criteria.'' All of these guidance documents are available by request from the contacts
listed above. 

Taken together, these guidance documents state that if an area (not within an ozone transport region) has attained
the ozone standard, as demonstrated by adequate monitoring data consistent with EPA guidance, it is clear that additional
NO

X

 reductions would not contribute to attainment. Therefore, such an area would meet the test under section 182(f)(1)(A)
for an exemption from NO

X

 NSR and RACT requirements.

A. Transportation Conformity and Section 182(f) Exemptions 



The transportation conformity rule states that its NO

X

 provisions do not apply when the Administrator has determined under section 182(f) of the Clean Air Act that ``additional
reductions of NO

X

 would not contribute to attainment.'' Although two other passages of the transportation conformity rule use this
language (which is borrowed from section 182(f)(1)(A)'s test for areas outside an ozone transport region) without
specifically referring to section 182(f), EPA believes there is no appropriate basis to interpret this identical
language differently under the transportation conformity rule than under the Clean Air Act. Consequently, EPA believes
this common language should be interpreted similarly for purposes of both section 182(f) and conformity NO

X

 exemptions. Therefore, EPA is providing guidance which would exempt nonclassifiable ozone nonattainment areas
outside an ozone transport region from the conformity rule's NO

X

 provisions on the same substantive basis as the applicable section 182(f) test.

1

 




The transportation conformity rule applies to all nonattainment and maintenance areas, and does not distinguish
between nonclassifiable nonattainment and other nonattainment areas. Consequently, EPA interprets the transportation
conformity rule's reference to the need for nonattainment areas to obtain a section 182(f) exemption in order to be
relieved of the NO

X

 conformity requirements to include nonclassifiable ozone nonattainment areas (

i.e.

, submarginal, transitional, incomplete/no data areas), even though such areas are not subject to Clean Air Act section
182(f) itself. This means that ozone nonattainment areas, including nonclassifiable ozone nonattainment areas,
can only be exempted from the NO

X

 provisions of the transportation conformity rule if EPA determines that the area satisfies the substantive test
required for an areawide section 182(f) exemption, through a process similar to that required for section 182(f)
exemptions which are not related to conformity. 

Thus, for nonclassifiable ozone nonattainment areas outside the Northeast ozone transport region, EPA will consider
requests for determinations that additional NO

X

 reductions would not contribute to attainment if such areas already have air quality data that demonstrate attainment
of the ozone standard, that are consistent with 40 CFR part 58 requirements, and that are recorded in EPA's Aerometric
Information Retrieval System (AIRS). Once made, this determination would relieve an area of the transportation
conformity rule's NO

X

 provisions. A more thorough explanation of the conditions and process for obtaining the 182(f) exemption is given
in the May 27, 1994 Seitz memorandum. 



B. Condition on NO

X

 

Exemptions for Areas Outside the Ozone Transport Region With Monitoring Data Demonstrating Attainment 



If a NO

X

 transportation conformity exemption request is based solely on monitoring data demonstrating attainment, EPA's
approval of the exemption, if otherwise warranted, will be granted on a contingent basis, 

i.e., 

the exemption would last for only as long as the area's monitoring data continues to demonstrate attainment. If subsequently
it is determined that the area has violated the standard, the exemption, as of the date of the determination, would
no longer apply. EPA would notify the state that the exemption no longer applies, and would also provide notice to the
public in the 

Federal Register

. Existing transportation plans and TIPs and past conformity determinations will not be affected by a determination
that the NO

X

 exemption no longer applies, but new conformity determinations would have to observe the NO

X

 requirements of the conformity rule. The State must continue to operate an appropriate air quality monitoring network,
in accordance with 40 CFR part 58, to verify the attainment status of the area. The air quality data relied on for the
above determinations must be consistent with 40 CFR part 58 requirements and other relevant EPA guidance and recorded
in EPA's Aorometric Information Retrieval System (AIRS).

C. Areas Inside an Ozone Transport Region 



Section 182(f) of the Clean Air Act provides a different test for exempting areas in an ozone transport region from
NO

X

 requirements (see section I.C. of this preamble). In particular, that test requires a demonstration that shows additional
NO

X

 reductions would not produce net ozone benefits in the transport region as a whole. Since the requirement for meeting
this test is substantially different from that needed to meet the contribute-to-attainment test in section 182(f)(1)(A),
and since the language in the conformity rule clearly does not reflect the language of the test provided for areas in
an ozone transport region, the determination of how such areas would qualify for an exemption from the rule's NO

X

 requirements merits more consideration before EPA can issue appropriate guidance. Today's guidance therefore
applies only to NO

X

 exemptions for areas outside the Ozone Transport Region. 

As noted previously, requests for conformity NO

X

 exemptions must consider the nonattainment area as a whole. With respect to transportation conformity, NO

X

 exemptions will not be granted for portions of nonattainment areas. Therefore, nonattainment areas with portions
both inside and outside the Ozone Transport Region will be treated for purposes of such exemption requests as areas
inside the Ozone Transport Region, and for the present time, will not be eligible for an exemption based on monitoring
data as described in this notice. 

EPA will give further consideration to areas in the Ozone Transport Region, and if EPA does propose to exempt some of
these areas, they will be addressed in state-specific rulemaking notices unless another general preamble providing
guidance for such areas is published first. 



III. Process for Receiving a NO

X

 Exemption Based on Monitoring Data for Nonclassifiable Areas 



EPA believes that section 182(f) sets up two separate procedures by which EPA may act on NO

X

 exemption requests. Subsections 182(f) (1) and (2) direct that action on NO

X

 exemption determination requests should take place ``when [EPA] approves a plan or plan revision.'' This language
appears to contemplate that exemption requests submitted under these paragraphs are limited to states, since states
are the entities authorized under the Act to submit plans or plan revisions. By contrast, subsection 182(f)(3) provides
that ``person[s]

2

'' may petition for a NO

X

 determination ``at any time'' after the ozone precursor study required under section 185B of the Act is finalized,
 and gives EPA a limit of six months after filing to grant or deny such petitions. Although subsection 182(f)(3) references
section 182(f)(1), EPA believes that paragraph (f)(3)'s reference to paragraph (f)(1) encompasses only the substantive
tests in paragraph (f)(1) (and, by extension, paragraph (f)(2)), not the requirement in paragraph (f)(1) for EPA
to grant exemptions only when acting on plan revisions. 






Accordingly, petitions submitted under subsection 182(f)(3) are not required to be submitted as state implementation
plan (SIP) revisions. Consequently, the state is not required under the Act to hold a public hearing in order to petition
for an areawide NO

X

 exemption determination under section 182(f)(3) (see Clean Air Act sections 110(a) (1) and (2)). For similar reasons,
if the state is submitting an areawide petition under subsection 182(f)(3), it is unnecessary to have the Governor
submit the petition. However, because of the need for consistency with the AIRS data and the requirements of 40 CFR
part 58, EPA believes that, particularly in cases where the NO

X

 exemption request (including a request for exemption from the NO

X

 requirements of the conformity rules) is based on monitoring data, if such data is contained in a petition submitted
by a person other than the state, the petition should be coordinated with the state air agency. Lack of endorsement
by the state air agency will require more scrutiny by EPA, and therefore EPA's processing of the petition will likely
take more time. 

EPA will grant or deny a petition for an areawide NO

X

 transportation conformity exemption through a full rulemaking process. This may involve a direct final rule or a
notice of proposed rulemaking followed by a final rule. Either process allows opportunity for public comment. For
areas which are relying on monitoring data which demonstrates attainment, the notice and comment will provide opportunity
for comment on the preliminary interpretations contained in this General Preamble. These rulemakings will also
offer opportunity for comment on the appropriateness of using monitoring data which is consistent with the requirements
in 40 CFR part 58 and consistent with the data recorded in AIRS as the basis of EPA's approval and rescission of the contingent
NO

X

 exemption. If EPA issues a final rulemaking concluding that it will use such air quality monitoring data in making
subsequent determination that an area has violated the standard, no further notice and comment will be required in
order to rescind the NO

X

 exemption in the event that such data subsequently indicates that a violation has occurred. 

EPA is preparing a delegation of authority to Regional Administrators to make determinations under section 182(f)
for areas which are outside the Ozone Transport Region and which have three years of monitoring data demonstrating
attainment. This delegation would allow the rulemaking for 182(f) determinations to be conducted by EPA's regional
offices. 



IV. Effect of a NO

X

 

Transportation Conformity Exemption on Transportation Planning

This section applies to both classified and nonclassifiable areas. 
Once EPA makes a finding under a separate notice which grants a NO

X

 transportation conformity exemption, an area is relieved of the transportation conformity rule's requirements
for regional analysis of NO

X

 emissions. 
However, EPA plans to amend the transportation conformity rule to require that once an area's maintenance plan is
approved, any previously approved NO

X

 conformity exemption no longer applies. The area must then demonstrate as part of its conformity determinations
that the transportation plan and TIP are consistent with the motor vehicle emissions budget for NO

X

 where such a budget is established by the maintenance plan. As currently written, none of the transportation conformity
rule's NO

X

 requirements would ever apply to an area once such an area had received a NO

X

 transportation conformity exemption. 
EPA believes that it is crucial for maintenance areas to demonstrate consistency with the maintenance plan's motor
vehicle NO

X

 emissions budget because that budget represents the level of motor vehicle NO

X

 emissions needed for continued maintenance. However, the maintenance plan's NO

X

 motor vehicle emissions budget for the purposes of transportation conformity will not necessarily require annual
NO

X

 emission reductions throughout the ten-year period.
EPA intends to promptly amend the conformity rule as stated above, so that NO

X

 motor vehicle emissions budgets in maintenance plans will begin to apply at the time or shortly after those plans are
approved. 


V. Administrative Requirements





Regulatory Flexibility Act 


Whenever EPA is required by section 553 of the Administrative Procedures Act or any other law to publish general notice
and proposed rulemaking for any proposed rule, EPA shall propose and make available for public comment an initial
regulatory flexibility analysis.
The regulatory flexibility requirements do not apply for this General Preamble because it is not a regulatory action
in the context of the Administrative Procedures Act or the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Interpretive Ruling; extension of deadline for filing FCC Form 395-B for 1994.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This Interpretive Ruling explains how the Federal Communications Commission requires radio stations involved
in time brokerage or multiple ownership circumstances to report employees on Annual Employment Reports, FCC Form
395-B. For licensees affected by the Interpretive Ruling, the Ruling extends the deadline for filing 1994 Form
395-B's. The former deadline of May 31, 1994, is extended to July 18, 1994. The FCC requires radio stations to
file a Form 395-B each year listing station employees for Equal Employment Opportunity purposes. The Interpretive
Ruling provides greater guidance about how employees should be reported by stations involved in a time brokerage
or by multiple stations owned by the same licensee in the same market.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 


In the Matter of: Petition for Issuance of Interpretive Ruling Concerning FCC Form 395-B, Broadcast Annual
Employment Report.


Interpretive Ruling




Issued: 

May 27, 1994.






Released: 

May 27, 1994.






By the Chief, Mass Media Bureau.


I. Introduction



1. The Mass Media Bureau has before it a petition for an interpretive ruling regarding how the employees of radio station
time brokers should be reported on the FCC Form 395-B, Annual Employment Report for broadcast stations.
 The request was filed on May 2, 1994, by the law firms of Arent, Fox, Kintner, Plotkin & Kahn; Hardy & Carey;
and attorney David Tillotson (the Firms).
 The Firms allege that there are a variety of different factual situations involving time brokerage and different
ways in which employees engaged in providing brokered services could be reported. They request that the Commission
issue an interpretive ruling to clarify how employees in various situations should be reported.






II. Pleadings


2. The Firms describe several specific situations and ask how reports should be filed for each. In the first example,
a broker is a licensee of another station in the same market as the brokered station to which the broker provides programming
services. In this case, all employees are employed by the licensee-broker, but some employees' duties relate exclusively
to the broker's station, some to the brokered station, and some to both stations. The Firms then analyze the merits
of various reporting methods. In the second example, a broker is not a licensee of a station in the same market as the
brokered station. Moreover, the broker may or may not be a Commission licensee. Again, while all employees are employed
by the broker, their duties relate variably to the broker's station (in the case of licensee-brokers), the brokered
station, or both. The Firms, as before, offer their analyses of various reporting methods. Finally, in a third example,
the Firms ask how shared employees should be reported where stations in the same radio service are under common ownership
or control in the same market, such as occurs where a licensee owns two FM stations in the same market.



III. Discussion



3. In response to petitioners' request, this Interpretive Ruling sets forth general Commission policy on how to report
employees on Form 395-B for broadcast stations involved in time brokerage arrangements. As a general matter,
we believe that, consistent with the EEO Rule which measures licensee performance, employees hired in concert with
time brokerages and LMAs should be reported on the Form 395-B submitted by the licensee that employs them. Thus,
in the first example above, all employees hired and employed by the licensee-broker and whose duties include providing
program services or other duties in support of the LMA should, as a general matter, be reported on the 395-B filed
by the licensee-broker's station. This is because all such employees are either employed by, or under the control
of, the licensee-broker. The licensee of the brokered station should file a Form 
395-B for any employees it may retain or hire after commencement of the brokerage agreement.



4. In the second example above, whether the broker is a licensee or not, there is no cognizable brokerage agreement
because the broker does not hold an interest in a station in the same market as the brokered station. See 47 CFR 73.3555(a)(2)(i).
However, where the broker is a licensee, the reporting requirements are, as a general matter, no different from the
first example above. The licensee of the brokered station should file a Form 395-B for any employees it may retain
or hire after commencement of the brokerage agreement. Similarly, the licensee-broker should file a Form 395-B
for its employees. If personnel employed by the licensee-broker perform duties for both stations, the licensee-broker
should report them on its Form 395-B. If the licensee-broker employes personnel to work at the brokered station,
they should also be reported on the Form 395-B for the licensee-broker's station.



5. These policies are not inconsistent with prior Commission statements in Policy Statement on Part-time Programming,
82 FCC 2d 107, 115 (1980) (Policy Statement). The Policy Statement only considered whether employees of a non-licensee
time broker should be reported by licensees selling blocks of their airtime to brokers. The Commission declined to
require licensees of brokered stations to report employees of a non-licensee broker as part of the EEO employment
profile. Our ruling here merely indicates that, as a general matter, time brokers who are themselves licensees should
report individuals under their employ, whether they work at the licensee-broker's station or a station operated
by the broker under an LMA. The two rulings are, therefore, fully consistent. In addition, the Policy Statement was
directed at the typical time brokerage existing in 1980, which involved the brokerage by non-licensees of short,
discrete periods of broadcast time. The more common practice today is for large blocks of time or the entire programming
schedule of a station to be brokered. When that practice is engaged in by a licensee-broker, we believe it generally
appropriate that the licensee-broker comply with the EEO Rule and its attendant reporting obligations.

6. In accordance with the reasoning set forth in Policy Statement, if the broker is not a licensee, as in the second example
above, the broker is not required to file a Form 395-B. However, we will closely watch to see that such agreements
are not used to circumvent our EEO Rule and policies.

7. Turning to the third example outlined by petitioners involving the reporting of shared employees of commonly owned
stations in the same radio service in the same market, current data processing technology available to the Commission
does not allow for the employment profile of more than one station to be reported on the same Form 395-B except
in cases involving an AM/FM combination. Therefore, if a licensee owns two FM stations or two AM stations in the same
market, the licensee should file a separate report for each station, dividing employees between the stations according
to their primary duties. If the duties of one or more employees involve work for both stations equally the licensee
should file a Form 395-B for one station with all employees from both stations listed. It should then file a separate
Form 395-B for the other station explaining that the station's employees are reported on the Form 395-B
filed for the licensee's other station in the same market. We expect the licensees of multiple stations in the same
market to file the Form 395-B attributing employees to the stations according to the manner in which the stations
operate.



IV. Conclusion



8. Accordingly, it is ordered that this Interpretive Ruling is issued, to be effective upon publication in the 

Federal Register.








9. It is further ordered that the May 31, 1994, due date for the filing of 1994 Form 395-B is extended for those affected
by this Interpretive Ruling until 30 days after publication of this Interpretive Ruling in the 

Federal Register. 

Licensees who have already filed their 1994 Form 395-B may amend them prior to that date.

<DOCTITLE>FCC Renews Advisory Committee to Enhance Network Reliability and Amends Charter</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Federal Communications Commission.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of Advisory Committee Renewal.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

As of January 6, 1994, the Federal Communications Commission has renewed for two years the charter for an advisory
committee, the ``Network Reliability Council,'' and has also subsequently amended its charter. As amended, the
charter directs the committee to provide recommendations to the Commission and to the industry on the effects of increasing
interconnection and new technologies on telecommunications reliability, review the recommendations contained
in the industry publication, ``Network Reliability: A Report to the Nation,'' propose guidelines that will enhance
availability of essential telecommunications services, such as E911, during network outages and collect data on
whether network outages have disproportionate geographic or demographic impact.



In order to ensure a balanced membership on the Council, the Commission has carefully selected members on the basis
of their technical knowledge and the significance of questions of network reliability for their organizations and
for those they represent. Any new members will be chosen so that the largest possible diversity of interests, given
the function to be performed, will continue to be represented.

The continuation of the advisory committee is necessary and in the public interest to prepare and evaluate recommendations
to the industry and to the FCC for avoiding, and minimizing the impact of, future network outages, to monitor and encourage
the implementation of its prior recommendations by the telecommunications industry, and to assess the effectiveness
of the implemented recommendations on network access during outages.

Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry Announcement of Cooperative Agreement to Minority Health Professions
Foundation 


Summary


The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR)
announce the availability of fiscal year (FY) 1994 funds for a sole source cooperative agreement with the Minority
Health Professions Foundation (MHPF) and its member institutions to assist them in expanding and enhancing their
educational and research opportunities for minorities and disadvantaged students. Approximately $1,000,000
is available in FY 1994 to fund the Minority Health Professions Foundation. It is expected that the award will begin
on or about September 29, 1994, and will be made for a 12-month budget period within a project period of up to five years.
Funding estimates may vary and are subject to change. Continuation awards within the project period will be made on
the basis of satisfactory progress and the availability of funds. 
The purpose of this cooperative agreement is to continue assisting the MHPF Institutions to: (1) increase the number
of minority health professionals in public health; (2) improve the health status for minority and disadvantaged
persons; (3) expand health services to underserved populations; (4) increase research in minority health; and (5)
enhance both didactic curricula and practical experience for students at the member institutions and strengthen
the curricula of the school. Students will be better prepared to improve the health status of minorities and disadvantaged
people and be more focused as a centralized group of minority health professionals to implement the strategies for
health promotion/disease prevention. Further, this will encourage public health research among investigators
at all member institutions of the MHPF. 
The CDC will: (1) Collaborate with MHPF and member institutions in expanding the opportunities for faculty, staff
and students for field experience in environmental and occupational health, and preventive medicine public health;
(2) Collaborate with MHPF to help identify research issues that its member institutions are uniquely able to investigate
related to the ``Healthy People 2000'' National Health Objectives; (3) Assist the MHPF with the activities of member
medical, dental, pharmacy and veterinary medical schools in strengthening their research infrastructure; 
(4) Assist the MHPF in working with medical, dental, pharmacy, and veterinary medical schools and public health agencies
in strengthening instruction in the theory and practice of disease prevention and health promotion; (5) Provide
technical assistance to MHPF in developing, coordinating, and distributing, and evaluating instructional materials
for preventive practices and clinical preventive services; (6) Provide technical assistance to MHPF in (i) the publication
of a professional journal, (ii) the distribution of information on graduate programs in public health, and (iii)
recruitment of professionals, especially those who represent minority groups; (7) Assist the MHPF in information
exchange through conferences and workshops on instruction, practice, and research in environmental, medical,
and public health objectives listed in ``Healthy People 2000''; and (8) Collaborate with MHPF in the implementation
of the program activities under this agreement. 
The Public Health Service (PHS) is committed to achieving the health promotion and disease prevention objectives
of ``Healthy People 2000,'' a PHS-led national activity to reduce morbidity and mortality and improve the quality
of life. This announcement is related to the priority areas of Educational and Community-Based Health Programs and
Clinical Preventive Services. (For ordering a copy of ``Healthy People 2000,'' see the section 

WHERE TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.

)


Authority 


This program is authorized under Section 301 (a) of the Public Health Service Act, 42 U.S.C. 241 (a) as amended and the

Smoke-Free Workplace 


The Public Health Service strongly encourages all grant recipients to provide a smoke-free workplace and promote
the non-use of all tobacco products. This is consistent with the PHS mission to protect and advance the physical and
mental health of the American people. 


Eligible applicant 


Assistance will be provided only to the Minority Health Professions Foundation and the member schools. No other applications
are solicited. The program announcement and application kit have been sent to MHPF. 
MHPF is the only organization capable of administering this cooperative agreement program because through the collective
effort of the member schools, it is the only organization that has: 
(1) Established a comprehensive database related to teaching and other activities of all African-American medical,
dental, pharmacy and veterinary schools; 
(2) Developed and evaluated an inventory of essential disease prevention and health promotion skills needed by all
medical and health profession students; 
(3) Assessed the current education, research and disease prevention and health promotion activities for students
and its member institutions;
(4) Developed a national organization whose member institutions are all predominately minority health professions
institutions with excellent professional performance records. 
(5) Developed an inventory of critical knowledge, skills and abilities related to instruction in medical and health
professional preparation. Through the collective efforts of its member institutions, the MHPF has demonstrated:
(1) the ability to work with academic institutions and official health agencies on mutual education, service, and
research endeavors; and (2) the leadership necessary to attract minority health professionals into public health
careers.

<DOCTITLE>Final Minimum Percentages for ``High Rate'' and ``Significant Increase in the Rate'' for Implementation of the Statutory
General Funding Preference and Final Funding Priority for Grants for Establishment of Departments of Family Medicine_Fiscal
Year 1994 </DOCTITLE>



The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) announces the final minimum percentages for ``high rate''
and ``significant increase in the rate'' for implementation of the statutory general funding preference and final
funding priority for fiscal year (FY) 1994 Grants for Establishment of Departments of Family Medicine authorized
under the authority of section 747(b) of the Public Health Service (PHS) Act, title VII, as amended by the Health Professions
Education Extension Amendments of 1992, Public Law 102-408, dated October 13, 1992. 



Purpose 



Section 747(b) of the PHS Act authorizes support to schools of medicine and osteopathic medicine to meet the costs
of projects to establish, maintain, or improve family medicine academic administrative units (which may be departments,
divisions, or other units) to provide clinical instruction in family medicine. Funds awarded will be used to: (1)
Plan and develop model educational predoctoral, faculty development and graduate medical education programs in
family medicine which will meet the requirements of section 747(a), by the end of the project period of section 747(b)
support; and (2) support academic and clinical activities relevant to the field of family medicine. 

The program may also assist schools to strengthen the administrative base and structure that is responsible for the
planning, direction, organization, coordination, and evaluation of all undergraduate and graduate family medicine
activities. Funds are to complement rather than duplicate programmatic activities for actual operation of family
medicine training programs under section 747(a). 



Statutory General Funding Preference 



As provided in section 791(a) of the PHS Act, preference will be given to any qualified applicant that_ 

(A) has a high rate for placing graduates in practice settings having the principal focus of serving residents of medically
underserved communities; or 

(B) during the 2-year period preceding the fiscal year for which an award is sought, has achieved a significant increase
in the rate of placing graduates in such settings. This preference will only be applied to applications that rank above
the 20th percentile that have been recommended for approval by the peer review group. 



Statutory Funding Preference 



Establishment and Expansion 



In addition, Public Law 102-408 has amended section 747(b) to include the following statutory funding preference
for this program. 

Section 747(b)(2) provides that preference shall be given to any qualified applicant that agrees to expend the award
for one of the following purposes: 

(a) Establishing an academic administrative unit (defined as a department, division, or other unit), for programs
in family medicine; or 

(b) substantially expanding the programs of such a unit. 

A program will meet the definition of ``substantial expansion'' if it has developed an acceptable plan for a 50 percent
increase in a sufficient number of the following areas to qualify for 70 points. The expansion must be completed within
3 years. 



 


A proposed notice was published in the 

Federal Register

 on January 6, 1994, at 59 FR 767 for public comment. Several comments were received during the 30-day comment period
from one respondent regarding the statutory funding preferences, which are established by law and the established
funding priorities for which comments were not requested. The respondent also expressed concern with the proposed
funding priority. The respondent suggests that we focus more on the results than activities. These comments will
be given serious consideration in the development of funding priorities in future cycles. 

Therefore, the final minimum percentages for ``high rate'' and ``significant increase in the rate'' and final funding
priority for this program will be retained as follows: 



Final Minimum Percentages for ``High Rate'' and ``Significant Increase in the Rate'' 



``High rate'' means that 20 percent of all graduates of the medical school in 1989 or 1990, whichever is greater, are
spending at least 50 percent of their work time in clinical practice in the specified settings.

<DOCTITLE>Final Minimum Percentages for ``High Rate'' and ``Significant Increase in the Rate'' for Implementation of the General
Statutory Funding Preference, Final Funding Priority and Special Consideration for Grants for Predoctoral Training
in Family Medicine </DOCTITLE>



The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) announces the final minimum percentages for ``high rate''
and ``significant increase in the rate'' for implementation of the General Statutory Funding Preference and final
funding priority and special consideration for fiscal year (FY) 1994 for Grants for Predoctoral Training in Family
Medicine authorized under the authority of section 747(a), title VII of the Public Health Service (PHS) Act, as amended
by the Health Professions Education Extension Amendments of 1992, Public Law 102-408, dated October 13, 1992.




Purpose 



Section 747(a) of the Public Health Service Act authorizes the award of grants to assist in meeting the cost of planning,
developing and operating or participating in approved predoctoral training programs in the field of family medicine.
Grants may include support for the program only or support for both the program and the trainees. 



General Statutory Funding Preference 



As provided in section 791(a) of the PHS Act, preference will be given to any qualified applicant that_

(A) has a high rate for placing graduates in practice settings having the principal focus of serving residents of medically
underserved communities; or 

(B) during the 2-year period preceding the fiscal year for which an award is sought, has achieved a significant increase
in the rate of placing graduates in such settings. This preference will only be applied to 
applications that rank above the 20th percentile of applications that have been recommended for approval by the peer
review group. 

A proposed notice was published in the 

Federal Register

 on October 5, 1993 at 58 FR 51836 for public comment. No comments were received during the 30-day comment period. Therefore,
the final minimum percentages for ``high rate'' and ``significant increase in the rate'', final funding priority
and special consideration for this program will be retained as follows: 



Final Minimum Percentages for ``High Rate'' and ``Significant Increase in the Rate'' for Implementation of the General
Statutory Funding Preference 



``High rate'' is defined as a minimum of 20 percent of graduates of the medical school in academic year 1988-89
or 1989-90. 

``Significant increase in the rate'' means that the rate of placing academic year 1989-90 graduates in the specified
settings is at least 50 percent higher than the rate of placing academic year 1988-89 graduates in such settings
and that not less than 15 percent of academic year 1989-90 graduates are working in these areas. Academic years
1988-89 and 1989-90 are used because they are the two most recent years that medical school graduates would
have entered practice following the completion of residency training. 



Final Funding Priority 



In addition, a funding priority will be given to applicants based on their level of accomplishment in relation to the
outcome or process measures cited below: 



 


Final Special Consideration 



Special consideration will be given to the degree to which applicants demonstrate that prior year funding has increased
the percentage of graduates who select Graduate Training in Family Practice.

<DOCTITLE>Indian Health Service Research Program Grants Application Announcement</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Indian Health Service, HHS.




</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of final funding emphases for competitive grant applications for the Indian Health Service (IHS) Research
Program.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The IHS announces the final funding emphases for fiscal year (FY) 1995 IHS Research Program authorized by Section
208 of the Indian Health Care Improvement Act, as amended, 25 U.S.C. 1621g. There will be only one funding cycle during
FY 1995. Grants shall be administered in accordance with applicable Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circulars
and HHS polices.



This program is described at 93.905 in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance. Executive Order 12372 requiring
intergovernmental review is not applicable to this program.



General Program Goals



1. To support practice and community-based research projects likely to improve the health of American Indians and
Alaska Natives (AI/AN) served by the IHS. Projects that are basic science or laboratory research are not considered
as conforming to the program goals, and will be returned to the applicant.

2. To develop research skills among IHS and tribal health professional. The applicant, as the direct and primary recipient
of PHS funds, must perform a substantive role in carrying out project activities and not merely serve as a conduit for
an award to another party, or to provide funds to another party.

3. These grants will be awarded and administered in accordance with the published program announcement in the 

Federal Register

 of March 18, 1994 (59 FR 12964) and the Indian Health Care Improvement Act, as amended, 25 U.S.C. 1621g.



Research Funding Emphases



Proposed funding emphases were published in the 

Federal Register

 of March 18, 1994 (59 FR 12964) for public comment. No comments were received during the 30-day comment period. Therefore,
as proposed, the following funding emphases will be retained as listed below.

1. Studies of documented high importance to the community in which the research is to be done.

2. Studies with high relevance for the AI/AN populations. (The series ``The Research Agenda for Indian Health'' in


the IHS Primary Care Provider,

 lists many relevant research subjects. Reprints are available from the IHS Research Program and the Area Research
Offices.)

3. For studies that involve problems that are both social and medical (e.g, dysfunctional families), research on
factors that enable the community or individuals to overcome the problems.

4. Competing continuations of previously-funded research projects.



Review Process



Applications meeting eligibility requirements that are complete and conform to the published program announcement
in the 

Federal Register

 of March 18, 1994 (59 FR 12964) will be reviewed in accordance with the following process.



1. Review by authorized Institutional Review Boards (IRB). 

All applications involving human subjects will be reviewed by the authorized Area or National IRBs in the IHS for compliance
with requirements to protect human subjects contained in 45 CFR 46, and as specified in the IHS Multiple Project Assurance
(MPA). It is suggested but not required that the application be sent to the appropriate Area IRB(s) two months before
the deadline, for the IRB review of the proposal to permit making the changes before the final submission. The IRB will
review only IRB issues, not purely technical methods. Any applications involving investigators from institutions
with IRBs with MPAs and involving human subjects must also be reviewed by the IRBs of the respective institution(s).
The researcher should contact non-IHS IRBs for their deadline requirements. No research project can be funded by
IHS unless it has been approved by, and has met the conditions of, all applicable IRBs.



2. Review by the Indian Health Research Study Section (IHRSS). 

Applications meeting eligibility requirements that are complete, responsive, and conform to this program announcement
will be reviewed for merit by the IHRSS appointed by the IHS to review these applications. The IHRSS review will be conducted
in accordance with the IHS objective review procedures. The technical review process ensures selection of quality
research projects in a national competition for limited funding. The IHRSS will include at least 60 percent non-IHS,
Federal or non-Federal, individuals, all experts in research. For each application, the IHRSS will decide to disapprove,
or to defer pending more information, or to approve the project. If the IHRSS decides to approve the project, it will
review the application against established criteria, and will assign a numerical score to the application. The members
of the IHRSS will use the following criteria and weights to make the score.

 Notice of program exclusions.

 


During the month of May 1994, the HHS 
Office of Inspector General imposed 
exclusions in the cases set forth below. 
When an exclusion is imposed, no program 
payment is made to anyone for any items or 
services (other than an emergency item or 
service not provided in a hospital emergency 
room) furnished, ordered or prescribed by an 
excluded party under the Medicare, Medicaid, 
Maternal and Child Health Services Block 
Grant and Block Grants to States for Social 
Services programs. In addition, no program 
payment is made to any business or facility, 
e.g., a hospital, that submits bills for 
payment for items or services provided by an 
excluded party. Program beneficiaries remain 
free to decide for themselves whether they 
will continue to use the services of an 
excluded party even though no program 
payments will be made for items and services 
provided by that excluded party. The exclusions 
have national effect and also apply to all other 
Federal non-procurement programs.

<DOCTITLE>Refugee Resettlement Program: Allocations to States of FY 1994 Funds for Refugee Social Services and for Refugees
Who Are Former Political Prisoners From Vietnam</DOCTITLE>


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR), ACF, HHS.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final notice of allocations to States of FY 1994 funds for refugee
 social services and for refugees who are former political prisoners from Vietnam. 


</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This notice establishes the allocations to States of FY 1994 funds for social services under the Refugee Resettlement
Program (RRP). In order to help meet the special needs of former political prisoners from Vietnam, the Director has
added to the formula allocation $2,000,000 in funds previously set aside for social services discretionary projects.
This notice eliminates the set-aside for mutual assistance associations (MAAs) as a separate component of the social
service allocations. 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Notice of the proposed social service allocations to States was published in the 

Federal Register

 on March 14, 1994 (59 FR 11794). The population estimates that were used in the proposed notice have been adjusted as
a result of additional population information submitted by 7 States. 


I. Allocation Amounts 


The Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) has available 
$80,802,000 in FY 1994 refugee social service funds as part of the FY 1994 appropriation for the Department of Health
and Human Services (Pub. L. 103-112). 
Of the total of $80,802,000, the Director of ORR will make available to States $68,681,700 (85%) under the allocation
formula set out in this notice. These funds would be made available for the purpose of providing social services to
refugees. In addition, the Director of ORR is making available $2,000,000 from discretionary social service funds
to be allocated under the formula in this notice for additional services to former political prisoners from Vietnam.
ORR intends FY 1994 to be the last year in which a special set-aside will be allocated for additional services for former
political prisoners from Vietnam. 


A. Discretionary Social Service Funds for Vietnamese Political Prisoners 


In recognition of the special vulnerability of refugees who are former political prisoners from Vietnam, the Director
of ORR has set aside $2,000,000 from discretionary social service funds to be allocated under the formula set forth
in this announcement, based on the number of actual political prisoner arrivals in FY 1993. This formula allocation
is shown separately in Table 1 (cols. 7 and 8). States are required to use this allocation to provide additional services,
as described below, to recent arrivals from Vietnam who are former political prisoners and members of their families.

Allowable services for the above-cited funds for political prisoners include the following direct services: (1)
Specialized orientation and adjustment services, including peer support activities; and (2) specialized employment-related
services, as needed. Adjustment services include any service listed under 45 CFR 400.155(c) of the ORR regulations.
Under no circumstances may these funds be used for direct cash payments or stipends, or for the purchase of advertising
space or air time.

Allowable services under this allocation for Vietnamese political prisoners are intended to supplement, not to
supplant, those services provided to refugees in general under the social service formula allocation, discussed
below. 
ORR intends to provide technical assistance to States and organizations that request it to assure effective program
development and implementation. 
Because these funds are being provided specifically for services for former political prisoners from Vietnam, States
which allocate social service funds to other local administrative jurisdictions, such as counties, shall do so for
these funds, using a formula which reflects arrivals of this target population during FY 1993. 
ORR strongly encourages States and other contracting jurisdictions, in selecting service providers for the above,
to award these funds, to the extent possible, to qualified refugee mutual assistance associations with experience
serving the target population. All contractors receiving these funds should have Vietnamese language capacity
and Vietnamese cultural understanding. 
States are required to provide to ORR program performance information on the Vietnamese political prisoner program
that meets the reporting requirements contained in 45 CFR 92.40, under the terms and conditions of the social services
grant awards to States. The information to be contained in the narrative portion of State quarterly performance reports
must include: (1) Names of service contractors; (2) categories of activities provided; (3) numbers of persons served;
and (4) outcomes, to the extent possible. 


B. Refugee Social Service Funds 


The population figures for the social service allocation include refugees, Cuban/Haitian entrants, and Amerasians
from Vietnam since these populations may be served through funds addressed in this notice. (A State must, however,
have an approved State plan for the Cuban/Haitian Entrant Program in order to use funds on behalf of entrants as well
as refugees.) 
The Director will allocate $68,681,700 to States on the basis of each State's proportion of the national population
of refugees who had been in the U.S. 3 years or less as of October 1, 1993 (including a floor amount for States which have
small refugee populations). 
The use of the 3-year population base in the allocation formula is required by section 412(c)(1)(B) of the Immigration
and Nationality Act (INA) which states that the ``funds available for a fiscal year for grants and contracts [for social
services] * * *. shall be allocated among the States based on the total number of refugees (including
children and adults) who arrived in the United States not more than 36 months before the beginning of such fiscal year
and who are actually residing in each State (taking into account secondary migration) as of the beginning of the fiscal
year.'' 
As established in the FY 1991 social services notice published in the 

Federal Register

 of August 29, 1991, section I, ``Allocation Amounts'' (56 FR 42745), a variable floor amount for States which have
small refugee populations is calculated as follows: If the application of the regular allocation formula yields
less than $100,000, then_
(1) a base amount of $75,000 is provided for a State with a population of 50 or fewer refugees who have been in the U.S.
3 years or less; and 
(2) For a State with more than 50 refugees who have been in the U.S. 3 years or less: (a) A floor has been calculated consisting
of $50,000 plus the regular per capita allocation for refugees above 50 up to a total of $100,000 (in other words, the
maximum under the floor formula is $100,000); (b) if this calculation has yielded less than $75,000, a base amount
of $75,000 is provided for the State. 
ORR has consistently supported floors for small States in order to provide sufficient funds to carry out a minimum
service program. Given the range in numbers of refugees in the small States, we have concluded that a variable floor,
as established 
in the FY 1991 notice, will be more reflective of needs than previous across-the-board floors. 
The $12,120,300 in remaining social service funds (15% of the total funds available) will be used by ORR on a discretionary
basis to provide funds for individual projects intended to contribute to the effectiveness and efficiency of the
refugee resettlement program. Grant announcements on discretionary initiatives will be issued separately.

Population To Be Served 


Although the allocation formula is based on the 3-year refugee population, in accordance with the requirements of
45 CFR Part 400 Subpart I_Refugee Social Services, States are not required to limit social service programs to refugees
who have been in the U.S. only 3 years. In keeping with 45 CFR 400.147(a), a State must allocate an appropriate portion
of its social service funds, based on population and service needs, as determined by the State, for services to newly
arriving refugees who have been in the U.S. less than one year. 
While 45 CFR 400.147(b) requires that in providing employability services, a State must give priority to a refugee
who is receiving cash assistance, social service programs should not be limited exclusively to refugees who are cash
assistance recipients. If a State intends to provide services to refugees who have been in the U.S. more than 3 years,
45 CFR 400.147(c) requires the State to specify and justify as part of its Annual Services Plan those funds that it proposes
to use to provide services to those refugees. 
ORR expects States to ensure that refugee social services are made available to special populations such as Amerasians
and former political prisoners from Vietnam, in addition to special funding that ORR may designate to address the
special needs of these populations. 
ORR funds may not be used to provide services to United States citizens, since they are not covered under the authorizing
legislation, with the following exceptions: (1) Under current regulations at 45 CFR 400.208, services may be provided
to a U.S.-born minor child in a family in which both parents are refugees or, if only one parent is present, in which that
parent is a refugee; and (2) under the FY 1989 Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and Related Programs Appropriations
Act (Pub. L. 100-461), services may be provided to an Amerasian from Vietnam who is a U.S. citizen and who enters
the U.S. after October 1, 1988. 


Service Priorities 


Refugee social service funding should be used to assist refugee families to achieve economic independence. To this
end, ORR expects States to ensure that a coherent plan of services is developed for each eligible family that addresses
the family's needs from time of arrival until attainment of economic independence. Each service plan should address
a family's needs for both employment-related services and other needed social services. 
Reflecting section 412(a)(1)(A)(iv) of the INA, the Director expects States to ``insure that women have the same
opportunities as men to participate in training and instruction.'' In addition, States are expected to make sure
that services are provided in a manner that encourages the use of bilingual women on service agency staffs to ensure
adequate service access by refugee women. In order to facilitate refugee self-support, the Director also expects
States to implement strategies which address simultaneously the employment potential of both male and female wage
earners in a family unit, particularly in the case of large families. States are expected to make every effort to assure
the availability of day care services in order to allow women with children the opportunity to participate in employment
services or to accept or retain employment. To accomplish this, day care may be treated as a priority employment-related
service under the refugee social services program. Refugees who are participating in employment services or have
accepted employment are eligible for day care services. For an employed refugee, day care funded by refugee social
service dollars must be limited to one year after the refugee becomes employed. States are expected to use day care
funding from other publicly funded mainstream programs as a prior resource and are expected to work with service providers
to assure maximum access to other publicly funded resources for day care. 
In accordance with 45 CFR 400.146, if a State's cash assistance dependency rate for refugees (as defined in  400.146(b))
is 55% or more, funds awarded under this notice (with the exception of the political prisoner set-aside) are subject
to a requirement that at least 85% of the State's award be used for employability services as set forth in  400.154.
ORR expects these funds to be used for services which directly enhance refugee employment potential, have specific
employment objectives, and are designed to enable refugees to obtain jobs in less than one year as part of a plan to achieve
self-sufficiency. This reflects the Congressional objective that ``employable refugees should be placed on jobs
as soon as possible after their arrival in the United States'' and that social service funds be focused on ``employment-related
services, English-as-a-second-language training (in non-work hours where possible), and case-management services''
(INA,  412(a)(1)(B)). If refugee social service funds are used for the provision of English language training,
such training should be provided concurrently, rather than sequentially, with employment or with other employment-related
services, to the maximum extent possible. ORR also encourages the continued provision of services after a refugee
has entered a job to help the refugee retain employment or move to a better job. 
Since current welfare dependency data are not available, those States that historically have had dependency rates
at 55% and above are invited to submit a request for a waiver of the 85% requirement if they can provide reliable documentation
that demonstrates a lower dependency rate.

ORR will consider granting a waiver of the 85% provision if a State meets one of the following conditions: 

1. The State demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Director of ORR that the dependency rate of refugees who have been
in the U.S. 24 months or less is below 55% in the State. 

2. The State demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Director that (a) less than 85% of the State's social service allocation
is sufficient to meet all employment-related needs of the State's refugees and (b) there are non-employment-related
service needs which are so extreme as to justify an allowance above the basic 15%. Or 

3. In accordance with section 412(c)(1)(C) of the INA, the State submits to the Director a plan (established by or in
consultation with local governments) which the Director determines provides for the maximum appropriate provision
of employment-related services for, and the maximum placement of, employable refugees consistent with performance
standards established under section 106 of the Job Training Partnership Act. 

Refugee social services should be provided in a manner that is culturally and linguistically compatible with a refugee's
language and cultural background. In light of the increasingly diverse population of refugees who are resettling
in this country, refugee service agencies will need to develop practical ways of providing culturally and linguistically
appropriate services to a changing ethnic population. To the maximum extent possible, particularly during a refugee's
initial years of resettlement, refugee social services should be provided through a refugee-specific service system
rather than through a system in which refugees are only one of many client groups being served. When planning State
refugee services, States are strongly encouraged to take into account the reception and placement (R & P) services
provided by local resettlement agencies in order to utilize these resources in the overall program design and to ensure
the provision of seamless services to refugees. 

In order to provide culturally and linguistically compatible services in as cost-efficient a manner as possible
in a time of limited resources, ORR encourages States and counties to promote and give special consideration to the
provision of refugee social services through coalitions of refugee service organizations, such as coalitions of
MAAs, voluntary resettlement agencies, or a variety of service providers. ORR believes it is essential for refugee-serving
organizations to form close partnerships in the provision of services to refugees in order to be able to respond adequately
to a changing refugee picture. Coalition-building and consolidation of providers is particularly important in
communities with multiple service providers in order to ensure better coordination of services and maximum use of
funding for services by minimizing the funds used for multiple administrative overhead costs. 

States should also expect to use funds available under this notice to pay for social services which are provided to
refugees who participate in alternative projects. Section 412(e)(7)(A) of the INA provides that: 




The Secretary [of HHS] shall develop and implement alternative projects for refugees who have been in the United States
less than thirty-six months, under which refugees are provided interim support, medical services, support [social]
services, and case management, as needed, in a manner that encourages self-sufficiency, reduces welfare dependency,
and fosters greater coordination among the resettlement agencies and service providers. 




This provision is generally known as the Wilson/Fish Amendment. The Department has already issued a separate notice
in the 

Federal Register

 with respect to applications for such projects (50 FR 24583, June 11, 1985). The notice on alternative projects does
not contain provisions for the allocation of additional social service funds beyond the amounts established in this
notice. Therefore a State which may wish to consider carrying out such a project should take note of this in planning
its use of social service funds being allocated under the present notice.

Funding to MAAs



ORR has eliminated the set-aside for refugee mutual assistance associations as a separate component under the social
service notice and instead has folded these funds into the social service formula allocation to States. Elimination
of the MAA set-aside, however, is not intended to represent any reduction in ORR's commitment to MAAs as important
participants in refugee resettlement. ORR believes that the continued and/or increased utilization of qualified
refugee mutual assistance associations in the delivery of social services helps to ensure the provision of culturally
and linguistically appropriate services as well as increasing the effectiveness of the overall service system.
Therefore, at a minimum, ORR expects States to continue to use MAAs as service providers at a level comparable to previous
years. ORR strongly encourages States when contracting for services, including employment services, to give consideration
to the special strengths of MAAs, whenever contract bidders are otherwise equally qualified, provided that the MAA
has the capability to deliver services in a manner that is culturally and linguistically compatible with the background
of the target population to be served. ORR also expects States to continue to assist MAAs in seeking other public and/or
private funds for the provision of services to refugee clients. 

ORR defines MAAs as organizations with the following qualifications: 

a. The organization is legally incorporated as a nonprofit organization; and 

b. Not less than 51% of the composition of the Board of Directors or governing board of the mutual assistance association
is comprised of refugees or former refugees, including both refugee men and women. 



State Administration 



States are reminded that under current regulations at 45 CFR 400.206 and 400.207, States have the flexibility to charge
the following types of administrative costs against their refugee program social service grants, if they so choose:
Direct and indirect administrative costs incurred for the overall management and operation of the State refugee
program, including its coordination, planning, policy and program development, oversight and monitoring, data
collection and reporting, and travel. See also State Transmittal No. 88-40. 



II. Discussion of Comments Received 



We received 17 letters of comment in response to the notice of proposed FY 1994 allocations to States for refugee social
services. The comments are summarized below and are followed in each case by the Department's response. 



Comment: 

Fourteen commenters expressed their views regarding the proposed elimination of the MAA set-aside. Eleven commenters
expressed concern over the proposed elimination of the MAA set-aside, while two commenters supported the elimination.
One commenter was concerned that without the Federal requirement for a set-aside, the State would not be able to continue
a State MAA set-aside in order to adhere to its general procurement requirements for contracting for social services.
One commenter felt that the MAA set-aside represents the only structure through which ORR can recognize the role of
MAAs in refugee resettlement. Another commenter felt that elimination of the set-aside reflected a distancing of
ORR from the MAAs and did not create a level playing field for MAAs. Five commenters felt that elimination of the set-aside
would represent a hardship on MAAs and would preclude MAAs from receiving any State social service funding. One commenter
felt that there would be public pressure on States to award the exact amount of previous set-asides to MAAs and would
create the need for a new tracking system to document the level of funding to MAAs to compare MAA funding with previous
set-asides. One commenter asked for clarification on whether ORR will continue to require States to assist MAAs to
seek other public and/or private funds as it has in the past. 



Response: 

The elimination of the MAA set-aside is not intended to convey a diminution of ORR's commitment to MAAs. We continue
to believe in the importance of the role of MAAs in service provision and firmly believe that the involvement of MAAs
is essential to effective refugee resettlement.

<TEXT>
 

ORR first instituted a set-aside for MAAs over 10 years ago as an incentive to States to work with and fund MAAs. At that
time, MAAs were emerging as important organizations in the refugee resettlement field. We felt that States needed
to be encouraged to begin funding these organizations as service providers. Today, the situation is quite different;
we believe that MAAs are now in a position to compete effectively for refugee social services funds. Many MAAs have
succeeded in becoming highly qualified and experienced service agencies and, in many States, have been able to obtain
a much higher level of refugee social service funding than is available under the MAA set-aside. For this reason, we
believe the MAA set-aside has served its purpose and should be discontinued at the Federal level. This in no way suggests
that States should lower their commitment to using MAAs to provide services to refugees; to the contrary, we expect
and encourage States to continue to use MAAs as service providers at levels comparable to previous years. In addition,
MAAs may compete for funding under ORR's discretionary programs which are open to nonprofit organizations. 

We inadvertently deleted the language that has appeared in previous notices requiring States to assist MAAs in seeking
other public and/or private funds for the provision of services to refugee clients. We have included similar language
in this notice which strongly encourages, but does not require, States to assist MAAs in seeking other public and/or
private funds for the provision of services. 



Comment: 

Two commenters requested clarification regarding ORR's expectation that States should ensure that refugee social
services are provided to special populations such as Amerasians and former political prisoners from Vietnam. One
commenter made the point that all refugees are special populations. Another commenter felt that while a State can
ensure that services are made available to special populations, a State cannot ensure that services are provided,
since it cannot ensure that refugees will access the services offered. The commenter suggested that the language
in the notice be revised to acknowledge this distinction. 



Response:

 The phrase ``such as'' is not intended to suggest an inclusive list of special populations, but simply to provide examples
of such special populations. We agree that States can only ensure that services are made available to refugees. The
language in the notice has been changed to reflect ORR's expectation that States should ensure that refugee social
services are made available to special populations. 



Comment: 

Two commenters requested clarification regarding ORR's expectation that States should ensure that a coherent plan
of services is developed for each eligible family that addresses the family's needs from time of arrival until attainment
of economic independence. One commenter pointed out that a plan of services can only be developed for individuals
and families that access services and recommended that the language in the notice be revised to clarify this point.
The commenter also questioned how the definition of an ``eligible family'' would apply to recent arrivals who are
single. Another commenter questioned what is meant by ``a coherent plan of services from time of arrival until attainment
of economic independence''. 



Response:

 Our intent regarding a coherent plan of services is for such a plan to be developed for every family that applies for
services or receives cash assistance. We believe that a State can ensure that this is carried out by requiring its providers
to develop such plans. Refugees who are single individuals, without family, should be considered an eligible one-person
family unit. ``A coherent plan of services from time of arrival until attainment of economic independence'' means
the development of a comprehensive service plan that includes the provision of employment-related and other services
needed to help a newly arrived family move to a point of economic self-support. 



Comment:

 Three commenters commented on ORR's expectation that services should be provided in a manner that is culturally and
linguistically compatible. Two of the commenters indicated that this expectation would require the provision of
services through a refugee-specific system which, they felt, would be financially impractical. Both commenters
felt that it would be more cost-effective to fold refugee services into the existing mainstream system. Another commenter
expressed support for the provision of services through a refugee-specific system. One commenter asked for a clear
definition of what ``culturally and linguistically compatible'' means. 



Response:

 What ORR means by the provision of services in a manner that is culturally and linguistically compatible is that an
agency providing refugee social services must employ or contract with staff who (1) speak the native language of and
(2) are either from the same ethnic background as, or are culturally knowledgeable of, the refugee populations the
agency serves, and must use these staff in the provision of services to refugee clients. 

Regarding the cost-effectiveness of a refugee-specific service system, we believe that the investment of refugee
program funds in a refugee-specific service system, particularly in the initial years after a refugee's arrival
in the U.S., will prove to be more cost-effective in the long run than serving refugees through a mainstream system.
The provision of services through a service provider system whose only clientele is refugees is likely to result in
more tailored and comprehensive services to refugees, resulting, we believe, in earlier employment and self-sufficiency
than what would otherwise occur when refugees are served through a mainstream system. Refugees often tend to receive
minimal services or are the last to be served in mainstream systems where they are one of many client groups served.
We wish to emphasize, however, that there is nothing to preclude, and in fact we encourage, the use of mainstream resources
to augment the services provided through a refugee-specific service system.

Comment: 

Two commenters had concerns regarding ORR's encouragement to States and counties to give special consideration
to coalitions of refugee service organizations. One commenter expressed concern about how coalitions would be more
cost-effective. The commenter also questioned how ORR envisions special consideration for coalitions in relation
to the competitive procurement process. Another commenter felt that coordination should not be mandated as an end
in itself. The commenter felt that if early employment is the goal, local service systems should be as uncomplicated
as possible in order to get the job done efficiently. The commenter was concerned that current providers that are doing
an effective job would be dismantled prematurely. 


Response: 

We believe that the formation of coalitions among refugee service agencies ought to lead to service delivery efficiencies
and to a rational downsizing of existing systems that will be necessary to keep pace with the changing nature of the
refugee population to be served. We believe the formation of coalitions will enable the pooling of varied talents
and skills within the agencies to more efficiently serve the changing population of refugee arrivals that will occur
over the next few years. We also believe that the formation of coalitions should result in the reduction of administrative
costs such as accounting and reporting costs, making coalitions more competitive. In addition, we believe the formation
of coalitions will result in better coordination of services to refugees.
Encouragement of or special consideration for coalitions should not interfere with State procurement requirements.
Coalitions will have to compete along with other applicants. However, States in their Requests for Proposals (RFPs)
could choose to include language that encourages the formation of coalitions or could include bonus points for coalitions
in the scoring criteria, as long as these actions do not violate State procurement rules. 


Comment: 

One commenter requested clarification on whether language in the notice such as ``States are strongly encouraged''
and ``the State should'' is advisory or is a mandatory requirement.


Response: 

When ORR uses phrases such as ``States are strongly encouraged,'' ``States are expected to,'' or ``the State should,''
the language is advisory in nature and should not be interpreted as a mandatory requirement. 


Comment: 

Six commenters made comments regarding requirements for the use of discretionary funds for services to former political
prisoners (FPP) from Vietnam. One commenter requested that ORR specify which family members are eligible for services
under the FPP set-aside or allow States and counties to make that determination. The commenter also requested that
ORR define what adjustment services may be provided under the FPP program and recommended that ORR use the same definition
as used in 45 CFR 400.155(c) of the ORR regulations. One commenter, noting ORR's prohibition against the purchase
of advertising space and air time with FPP funds, recommended that paid outreach announcements through refugee community
media and Vietnamese newspapers be allowed under the FPP program. 
One commenter noted that ORR requires States to allocate FPP funds using a formula that reflects recent and anticipated
arrivals of former political prisoners. The commenter pointed out that there is no timely or reliable source of anticipated
arrivals by State and recommended limiting the State allocation formula to recent arrivals and recommended defining
the term ``recent arrivals.'' One commenter recommended that counties which administer FPP programs be granted
10% for administrative costs and that States should be limited to no more than 2% for administrative costs. 
Two commenters recommended dropping outcomes as a performance reporting requirement under the FPP program. One
of the commenters questioned the increased reporting requirements when the FPP program is entering its last year
of operation. Another commenter recommended accepting available individual contract data on outcomes since it
would be difficult in some States with a wide range of FPP services to provide a program-wide outcomes report. One commenter
supported the proposed FPP reporting requirements and did not feel the increased reporting requirements would add
significantly to existing workloads. Another commenter recommended that FPP projects be supported that demonstrate
accountability for outcomes such as those that occurred in the Amerasian projects. The commenter further suggested
that ORR should require coordination between the agencies that provide FPP services and the voluntary agencies that
resettle former political prisoners. 


Response: 

Family members who are eligible for services under the FPP set-aside include any relative of a former political prisoner
who lives in the same household with the FPP. Adjustment services are defined as those services listed under 45 CFR
400.155(c) of the ORR regulations. This definition is included in this notice. Regarding the use of FPP funds for paid
outreach announcements through the refugee media, our position is unchanged on this issue; we do not feel that the
purchase of advertising space and air time constitutes an effective use of FPP funds. FPP providers should work with
the voluntary agencies that resettled FPP refugees to contact these refugees within the constraints of the Privacy
Act.

We agree with the comment regarding the difficulty of basing a State allocation formula on anticipated arrivals and
have dropped this factor from the formula. In the interest of consistency, we have changed the notice to require States
to allocate FPP funds using a formula which reflects arrivals during FY 1993 to local jurisdictions, the same formula
used by ORR to allocate FPP funds to States. We have no specific guidance regarding the distribution of administrative
costs between county and State; this is an issue that should be resolved between the county and the State. All costs
claimed against grants must be in conformity with HHS grants regulations at 45 CFR part 92 and other applicable Federal
requirements. 
In regard to performance requirements for the FPP program, we have not added any new reporting requirements. As in
FY 1993, States are required to provide program performance information on the FPP program consistent with the reporting
requirements contained in 45 CFR 92.40, under the terms and conditions of the social services grant awards to States.
In addition, we have simply clarified that the information to be reported must include the four items listed in this
notice. Regarding program outcomes, States may provide available outcome data from individual contracts. In regard
to suggestions for additional requirements for FPP projects, we have decided not to consider additional requirements
since this is the last year of the FPP set-aside program. 


Comment:

 Five commenters addressed the issue of ORR's use of 15% of social service funds for ORR discretionary grants. Two commenters
indicated support for the 15% discretionary use, while two commenters objected it. One commenter recommended that
there should be equitable distribution of discretionary funding with input and involvement of States, an expansion
of selection panels, more lead time to develop proposals, and the development of meaningful evaluation criteria.
Another commenter felt that the notice should describe the focus of discretionary funds for FY 1994, as has been done
in previous years. 


Response: 

We continue to believe that it is necessary to maintain a portion of social service funds for discretionary use in order
to carry out national initiatives and special projects that respond to changing needs and circumstances in the refugee
program. Regarding the issue of equitable distribution, discretionary funds are awarded on a competitive basis,
based on the quality of applications in relation to the evaluation criteria, rather than on the basis of a population-based
allocation formula. Therefore, the geographic distribution of funds awarded on the basis of merit may not be the same
as a distribution by formula. Regarding more State involvement in discretionary funding, since States are frequently
competitors for ORR discretionary funds, along with other applicants, it is not possible to involve States in funding
decisions without creating a conflict of interest, a violation of Federal grant rules. We do not believe our selection
panels need to be expanded; ORR selection panels have traditionally been broad-based, involving a varied group of
experts from the resettlement field and other disciplines. We agree that sufficient lead time is necessary to develop
proposals; we are committed to allowing as much lead time as the grant process timetable will bear. We also agree that
the use of meaningful evaluation criteria is essential in the review of grant applications; such evaluation criteria
are included in our grant announcements. We have not included a description of our discretionary focus for FY 1994
because we have been in the process of revamping our discretionary program agenda this year. FY 1994 grant announcements
have recently been made available in the 

Federal Register

. 


Comment: 

Three commenters expressed support for the concurrent provision of English language training with employment and
employment-related services. One commenter recommended that the provision of English language training be tied
to the provision of vocational training and that the notice reflect this emphasis. 


Response: 

We do not believe that English language training should be tied exclusively to one type of employment-related service
such as vocational training. Our intent is to encourage the concurrent provision of English language training in
concert with other employment-related services to speed the process of a refugee becoming employed and self-sufficient.
At the same time, we want to discourage the provision of English language training in a sequential manner, as a prerequisite
to receiving other employment-related services. 


Comment: 

One commenter requested clarification regarding the meaning of ``appropriate coordination'' with reception and
placement (R & P) agencies to ensure the provision of seamless services to refugees.

<DOCNO> FR940617-2-00132 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940617-2-00079 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 



Response:

 Appropriate coordination means working with R & P agencies to ensure that there is a smooth transition between
services provided by the R & P agencies and services provided to refugees through the State program. When planning
services, a State should take into account what services are provided by R & P agencies so that there is a relationship
and a continuum between R & P services and State-funded services and an absence of service gaps or service duplication.



Comment:

 One commenter expressed concurrence with the need for continued provision of services after employment to help a
refugee retain employment or move to a better job. The commenter recommended that ORR review the list of services in
45 CFR 400.153 through 400.156 and if additional services are desired, specify them in the notice. 


Response:

 We are reviewing the list of allowable services in 45 CFR subpart I to determine if changes should be made. Such changes
would have to be made through a regulatory change, not through the notice. 


Comment:

 Two commenters commended ORR for not restricting services to a 36-month refugee population, while one commenter
expressed disappointment that ORR did not limit services to a 36-month population. 


Response:

 As a point of clarification, a restriction of services to a time-limited population could only be effected through
regulatory action. 


Comment:

 One commenter complained that the requirement that States must specify and justify the use of funds for services to
refugees who have been in the U.S. more than 3 years is a reversal from previous years when a justification was required
to use social service funds for newly-arrived refugees. 


Response:

 ORR regulations under 45 CFR 400.147 require that both the use of funds for services to newly arriving refugees ( 400.147(a))
and the use of funds for services to refugees who have been in the U.S. more than 36 months ( 400.147(c)) must be
specified and justified as part of a State's annual services plan. This regulation has been in effect since July 1,
1989. The notice this year simply emphasized  400.147(c) instead of  400.147(a). 


Comment:

 One commenter objected to the requirement that funds should be used for services designed to get refugees a job in less
than one year, while one commenter supported the one-year requirement. 


Response:

 We have responded to this comment in previous notices. Since our position remains unchanged, we refer the commenter
to our response in the FY 1993 final social service notice, published in the 

Federal Register

 on July 28, 1993 (58 FR 40437). 


Comment:

 One commenter recommended that the notice clarify that social service funds may be used to serve unemployed refugees
who are not receiving cash assistance as long as cash assistance recipients make up a percentage of the social services
caseload which is at or above the State's welfare dependency rate. The commenter indicated that the State currently
interprets the ORR notice to mean that only cash assistance clients may receive services. 


Response:

 We believe the notice is clear that social services funds may be used to serve non-cash-assistance recipients. The
notice, under the section ``Population to be Served,'' states that ``social service programs should not be limited
exclusively to refugees who are cash assistance recipients.'' However, as the wording indicates, this is not a mandatory
requirement. States are not required to ensure that cash assistance recipients make up a percentage of the social
services caseload that is not less than the State's welfare dependency rate. States, however, are required to give
priority to a refugee who is receiving cash assistance. 


Comment:

 One commenter objected to the use of a floor amount for small States. 


Response:

 We have responded to this comment in previous notices. Since our position has not changed on this issue, we refer the
commenter to our response in the FY 1993 final social service notice, published in the 

Federal Register

 on July 28, 1993 (58 FR 40437). 



Comment:

 Two commenters objected to unlimited State administrative costs for social services. One commenter recommended
capping administrative costs at 5% for any State receiving more than $12 million in social service funds and recommended
that counties be allowed a maximum of 20% for administrative costs. 


Response:

 Since the statute does not specify a limitation on the amount of social service funds that can be used for administrative
costs, we have not imposed a limit on States, choosing instead to allow States to make that determination. In regard
to the percentage of funds that counties may use for administrative costs, this is an issue that needs to be resolved
between county and State, not ORR. As noted earlier, all costs must meet Federal grant requirements. 


Comment:

 One commenter suggested that ORR consider safeguards to ensure that primary emphasis is placed on serving new arrivals,
with services beyond the initial period being the exception and only allowable if a State has been successful in meeting
the needs of new arrivals. 


Response:

 Such a requirement could be put into effect only through regulatory action. We are giving this issue consideration.

Comment:

 One commenter felt that it is unwise to rely heavily on the presence of bilingual female staff as the key factor in improving
services to refugee women. The commenter felt that the relevance of service matters much more. 


Response:

 The issue is access to services, not just relevance of service. We believe that access to services and communication
between client and provider improve significantly for refugee women when there are bilingual women on staff to provide
services to these clients. 



III. Allocation Formula 


Of the funds available for FY 1994 for social services, $68,681,700 is allocated to States in accordance with the formula
specified below. A State's allowable allocation is calculated as follows: 
1. The total amount of funds determined by the Director to be available for this purpose; divided by_
2. The total number of refugees and Cuban/Haitian entrants who arrived in the United States not more than 3 years prior
to the beginning of the fiscal year for which the funds are appropriated and the number of Amerasians from Vietnam eligible
for refugee social services, as shown by the ORR Refugee Data System. The resulting per capita amount will be multiplied
by_
3. The number of persons in item 2, above, in the State as of October 1, 1993, adjusted for estimated secondary migration.

The calculation above yields the formula allocation for each State. Minimum allocations for small States are taken
into account. 
Allocations for political prisoners are based on FY 1993 arrival numbers for this group in each State from the Refugee
Data Center and are limited to States with 170 or more political prisoner arrivals. We have limited the population
base to FY 1993 political prisoner arrival numbers because these funds are intended to serve recent arrivals. We have
not included States with fewer than 170 former political prisoners in the political prisoner allocations formula
because the resulting level of funding would be insignificant. In these States, we believe the small number of political
prisoners could be adequately served under the State's refugee social services program. 


IV. Basis of Population Estimates 


The population estimates for the allocation of funds in FY 1994 are based on data on refugee arrivals from the ORR Refugee
Data System, adjusted as of October 1, 1993, for estimated secondary migration. The data base includes refugees of
all nationalities, Amerasians from Vietnam, and Cuban and Haitian entrants. 
For fiscal year 1994, ORR's formula allocations for the States for social services are based on the numbers of refugees
and Amerasians who arrived, and on the numbers of entrants who arrived or were resettled, during the preceding three
fiscal years: 1991, 1992, and 1993, based on final arrival data by State. Therefore, estimates have been developed
of the numbers of refugees and entrants with arrival or resettlement dates between October 1, 1990, and September
30, 1993, who are thought to be living in each State as of October 1, 1993. Refugees admitted under the Federal Government's
private-sector initiative are not included, since their assistance and services are to be provided by the private
sponsoring organizations under an agreement with the Department of State. 
The estimates of secondary migration were based on data submitted by all participating States on Form ORR-11.
The total migration reported by each State was summed, yielding in- and out-migration figures and a net migration
figure for each State. The net migration figure was applied to the State's total arrival figure, resulting in a revised
population estimate. Because the reporting period covered on Form ORR-11 was a maximum of only 8 months as of
June 1993 for the majority of States whose reporting base was their cash/medical assistance caseload, extra weight
was given to the secondary migration reported by those States to arrive at estimates of secondary migration over a
36-month period. In 1993, no count of recently-arrived refugee children was available from the Department of Education
for use as a comparison. 
Estimates were developed separately for refugees and entrants and then combined into a total estimated 3-year refugee/entrant
population for each State. Eligible Amerasians are included in the refugee figures. 

Table 1, below, shows the estimated 3-year populations, as of October 1, 1993, of refugees (col. 1), entrants (col.
2), and total refugees and entrants (col. 3); the formula amounts which the population estimates yield (col. 4); and
the allocation amounts after allowing for the minimum amounts (col. 5). Table 1 also shows the number of former political
prisoner arrivals in FY 1993 (col. 6); and the allocation amounts for services to this population (col. 7). 


V. Allocation Amounts 


Funding subsequent to the publication of this notice will be contingent upon the submittal and approval of a State
annual services plan, as required by 45 CFR 400.11(b)(2). The following amounts are allocated for refugee social
services in FY 1994:

Federal Property Suitable as Facilities To Assist the Homeless; Notice 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Office of the Assistant Secretary for Community Planning and Development, HUD. 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This Notice identifies unutilized, underutilized, excess, and surplus Federal property reviewed by HUD for suitability
for possible use to assist the homeless. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 In accordance with 56 FR 23789 (May 24, 1991) and section 501 of the Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act (42
U.S.C. 11411), as amended, HUD is publishing this Notice to identify Federal buildings and other real property that
HUD has reviewed for suitability for use to assist the homeless. The properties were reviewed using information provided
to HUD by Federal landholding agencies regarding unutilized and underutilized buildings and real property controlled
by such agencies or by GSA regarding its inventory of excess or surplus Federal property. This Notice is also published
in order to comply with the December 12, 1988 Court Order in National Coalition for the Homeless v. Veterans Administration,
No. 88-2503-OG (D.D.C.). 



Properties reviewed are listed in this Notice according to the following categories: Suitable/available, suitable/unavailable,
suitable/to be excess, and unsuitable. The properties listed in the three suitable categories have been reviewed
by the landholding agencies, and each agency has transmitted to HUD: (1) Its intention to make the property available
for use to assist the homeless, (2) its intention to declare the property excess to the agency's needs, or (3) a statement
of the reasons that the property cannot be declared excess or made available for use as facilities to assist the homeless.


Properties listed as suitable/available will be available exclusively for homeless use for a period of 60 days from
the date of this Notice. Homeless assistance providers interested in any such property should send a written expression
of interest to HHS, addressed to Judy Breitman, Division of Health Facilities Planning, U.S. Public Health Service,
HHS, room 17A-10, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857; (301) 443-2265. (This is not a toll-free number.)
HHS will mail to the interested provider an application packet, which will include instructions for completing the
application. In order to maximize the opportunity to utilize a suitable property, providers should submit their
written expressions of interest as soon as possible. For complete details concerning the processing of applications,
the reader is encouraged to refer to the interim rule governing this program, 56 FR 23789 (May 24, 1991). 

For properties listed as suitable/to be excess, that property may, if subsequently accepted as excess by GSA, be made
available for use by the homeless in accordance with applicable law, subject to screening for other Federal use. At
the appropriate time, HUD will publish the property in a Notice showing it as either suitable/available or suitable/unavailable.


For properties listed as suitable/unavailable, the landholding agency has decided that the property cannot be declared
excess or made available for use to assist the homeless, and the property will not be available. 

Properties listed as unsuitable will not be made available for any other purpose for 20 days from the date of this Notice.
Homeless assistance providers interested in a review by HUD of the determination of unsuitability should call the
toll free information line at 1-800-927-7588 for detailed instructions or write a letter to Barbara
Richards at the address listed at the beginning of this Notice. Included in the request for review should be the property
address (including zip code), the date of publication in the 

Federal Register

, the landholding agency, and the property number. 

For more information regarding particular properties identified in this Notice (

i.e.

, acreage, floor plan, existing sanitary facilities, exact street address), providers should contact the appropriate
landholding agencies at the following addresses: Dept. of Transportation: Ronald D. Keefer, Director, Administrative
Services & Property Management, DOT, 400 Seventh St. SW., room 10319, Washington, DC 20590; (202) 366-4246;
U.S.Army: Elaine Sims, CECPW-FP, U.S. Army Center for Public Works, 7701 Telegraph Road, Alexandria, VA 22310-3862;
(703) 355-3475; (These are not toll-free numbers).

<USBUREAU>Office of the Assistant Secretary for Housing-Federal Housing Commissioner</USBUREAU>





Interest Rate for the Section 235(r) Mortgage Insurance Program 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Office of the Assistant Secretary for Housing-Federal Housing Commissioner, HUD. 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of change in interest rate. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This notice announces a change in the maximum interest rate for mortgages to be insured under section 235(r) of the
National Housing Act. The section 235(r) maximum interest rate is to be determined by the Secretary of HUD and published
in the 

Federal Register

. Mortgage market conditions now dictate that the Secretary increase the section 235(r) maximum rate from 8.00 percent
to 8.50 percent. There is no change being made in the maximum margin of additional percentage points that may be added
to the maximum rate if the established conditions are met. Therefore, the maximum for the premium section 235(r) interest
rate will be 10.00 percent (8.50 percent for the rate of interest and 1.50 percent for the margin of additional percentage
points). 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Section 235(r) of the National Housing Act (12 U.S.C. 1715z) authorizes the Secretary to insure mortgages that refinance
existing mortgages insured under section 235. The purpose of the program is to reduce the interest rate insured and
assisted under section 235 in order that the assistance payments the Department pays on behalf of mortgagors may be
reduced. The regulations implementing the program are contained in subpart H of 24 CFR part 235_refinancing of mortgages
under section 235(r). 



The interest rate for these loans is set by the Secretary and published in the 

Federal Register

 as authorized by 24 CFR 235.1202(b)(3). The previous section 235(r) interest rate of 8.00 percent was published in
the 

Federal Register

 on April 21, 1994 (59 FR 19021). The Department has determined that market conditions dictate a change in the section
235(r) interest rate. The change will take effect on the date of publication of this notice. 

The most recent HUD survey of Mortgage Market conditions 
(i.e., Secondary Market Prices and Yields), an OMB-designated Principal Federal Indicator, found that the dominant
national FHA rate being quoted to potential homebuyers for ``lock-in'' commitments of 60 days or more was 8.50 percent
on April 1, 1994, with an average of .32 points, and an effective interest rate of 8.55 percent. The 8.50 percent rate
was dominant in most parts of the country. 

Most FHA mortgages are funded in the GNMA mortgage-backed 
securities market. There is a 50 basis point spread between FHA contract interest rates and GNMA coupon rates (this
covers the GNMA guarantee fee and servicing cost). On May 12, 1994, the GNMA 7.50 percent coupon securities (8.00 percent
FHA loans) were priced at about 5 points discount. This level of discount tends to impede FHA loans to finance home purchases.
On the other hand, the GNMA 8.00 percent security (8.50 percent FHA loans) was trading in the two-month forward market
at around two points discount, while the 8.50 percent GNMA coupons (9.00 percent FHA mortgages) continued to trade
at over par (i.e., premium). Under the FHA negotiated rate/points provisions a two point discount for 8.50 percent
FHA mortgages would not be burdensome. 

It is expected that secondary market prices will stabilize 
in the near term at the 8.50 percent contract rate. The May 1, 1994, 

Blue Chip Financial Forecast

 showed that after mortgage rates rose in the first quarter of 1994, the average forecast was that mortgage rates would
stabilize in the second, third and fourth quarters. The May summary forecast of Data Resources Incorporated projects
a rise in 30 year Treasury rates during the second quarter (which is half over), then stable rates in the third and fourth
quarters. 

Adjusting the section 235(r) rate to 8.50 percent will bring this rate back into line with the rest of the FHA current
production loans. Therefore, the maximum rate for section 235(r) mortgages is 8.50 percent beginning with the publication
date of this notice. The maximum margin of additional percentage points that may be added to the maximum rate under
24 CFR 235.1202(b)(3)(i)(B) will remain at 1.50 percent. 

The subject matter of this notice is categorically excluded from HUD's environmental clearance procedures, in accordance
with 24 CFR 50.20(l). For that reason, no environmental finding has been prepared for this notice.

<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Fish and Wildlife Service, Interior. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice. 






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 Mr. Welton Tapper, the owner of a single family lot in the Country Cove subdivision, (Applicant) is seeking an incidental
take permit from the Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) pursuant to Section 10(a)(1)(B) of the Endangered Species
Act (Act). The proposed permit would authorize the incidental take of a threatened species, the Florida scrub jay,


Aphelocoma coerulescens coerulescens, 

incidental to construction of a single family residence on an approximately 0.5 acre lot within the subdivision.
The lot is located in the Country Cove subdivision, in the Town of Malabar, Brevard County, Florida. 



The Service also announces the availability of an environmental assessment (EA) and habitat conservation plan (HCP)
for the incidental take application. Copies of the EA or HCP may be obtained by making a request to the Regional Office
address below. The Service is soliciting data on 

Aphelocoma coerulescens

 coerulescens in order to assist in the requirement of the intra-Service consultation. This notice also advises the
public that the Service has made a preliminary determination that issuing the incidental take permit is not a major
Federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment within the meaning of Section 102(2)(C)
of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as amended. The Finding of No Significant Impact is based on information
contained in the EA and HCP. The final determination will be made no sooner than 30 days from the date of this notice.
This notice is provided pursuant to Section 10(c) of the Act and National Environmental Policy Act Regulations (40
CFR 1506.6). 




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Aphelocoma coerulescens coerulescens 

is geographically isolated from other subspecies of scrub jays found in Mexico and the Western United States. The
Florida scrub jay is found almost exclusively in peninsular Florida and is restricted to scrub habitat. The total
estimated population is between 7,000 and 11,000 individuals. Due to habitat loss and degradation throughout the
State of Florida, it has been estimated that the Florida scrub jay population has been reduced by at least half in the
last 100 years. Surveys have indicated that suitable Florida scrub jay habitat exists on the Applicant's property
and surrounding areas. Construction of this individual homesite may therefore result in death of, or injury to, 

Aphelocoma coerulescens coerulescens 

incidental to the carrying out of these otherwise lawful activities. Habitat alteration associated with property
development may reduce the availability of feeding, shelter, and nesting habitat. 



The EA considers the environmental consequences of two alternatives. The no action alternative may result in some
loss of habitat for 

Aphelocoma coerulescens coerulescens 

and exposure of the Applicant under Section 9 of the Act. This action is inconsistent with the purposes and intent of
Section 10 of the Act. The proposed action alternative is issuance of the incidental take permit. This provides for
restrictions of construction activity, monitoring Florida scrub jay activity during construction of the home,
retaining natural vegetation to the maximum extent practicable, enhancing native vegetation through replanting,
a prohibition on pets, and installation of a bird feeder and bird bath on the property. The HCP provides a funding mechanism
for these mitigation measures.

ACTION:

 Notice.

 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 Richland Bull Creek Associates (Applicant) has applied to the Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) for an incidental
take permit pursuant to Section 10(a) of the Endangered Species Act (Act). The Applicant has been assigned Permit
Number PRT-783564. The requested permit, which is for a period not to exceed 30 years, would authorize the incidental
take of the endangered golden-cheeked warbler (

Dendroica chrysoparia

). The proposed take would occur as a result of construction of a residential development on 196 acres, in Austin, Travis
County, Texas. The proposed development will permanently eliminate about 176 acres of occupied and/or potential
endangered species habitat. 


The Service has prepared an environmental assessment (EA) and habitat conservation plan (HCP) for the incidental
take application. A determination of jeopardy to the species or a Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI) will not
be made before 30 days from the date of the publication of this notice. This notice is provided pursuant to Section 10(c)
of the Act and National Environmental Policy Act regulations (40 CFR 1506.6).

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 A Habitat Conservation Plan has been developed as mitigation for the incidental taking of the golden-cheeked warbler.
The Applicant proposes to mitigate the incidental take via dedicating 260 acres of occupied golden-cheeked warbler
habitat as a permanent preserve, providing funding for the operation and management of the preserve lands, performing
golden-cheeked warbler monitoring and research studies on the preserve and project lands, and avoiding construction
activities within warbler territories during the breeding season. Details of the mitigation are provided in the
Environmental Assessment and Habitat Conservation Plan for the Spicewood at Bull Creek and Canyon Mesa Developments.
A determination of jeopardy to the species or a Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI) will not be made before 30 days
from the date of publication of this notice. This notice is provided pursuant to Section 10(c) of the Act and National
Environmental Policy Act regulations (40 CFR 1506.6). The Applicant considered four alternatives, but rejected
three of them.

Minimum Wages for Federal and Federally Assisted Construction; General Wage Determination Decisions



General wage determination decisions of the Secretary of Labor are issued in accordance with applicable law and are
based on the information obtained by the Department of Labor from its study of local wage conditions and data made available
from other sources. They specify the basic hourly wage rates and fringe benefits which are determined to be prevailing
for the described classes of laborers and mechanics employed on construction projects of a similar character and
in the localities specified therein.

The determinations in these decisions of prevailing rates and fringe benefits have been made in accordance with 29
CFR part 1, by authority of the Secretary of Labor pursuant to the provisions of the Davis-Bacon Act of March 3, 1931,
as amended (46 Stat. 1494, as amended, 40 U.S.C. 276a) and of other Federal statutes referred to in 29 CFR Part 1, Appendix,
as well as such additional statutes as may from time to time be enacted containing provisions for the payment of wages
determined to be prevailing by the Secretary of Labor in accordance with the Davis-Bacon Act. The prevailing rates
and fringe benefits determined in these decisions shall, in accordance with the provisions of the foregoing statutes,
constitute the minimum wages payable on Federal and federally assisted construction projects to laborers and mechanics
of the specified classes engaged on contract work of the character and in the localities described therein.

Good cause is hereby found for not utilizing notice and public comment procedure thereon prior to the issuance of these
determinations as prescribed in 5 U.S.C. 553 and not providing for delay in the effective date as prescribed in that
section, because the necessity to issue current construction industry wage determinations frequently and in large
volume causes procedures to be impractical and contrary to the public interest.

General wage determination decisions, and modifications and supersedeas decisions thereto, contain no expiration
dates and are effective from their date of notice in the 

Federal Register

, or on the date written notice is received by the agency, whichever is earlier. These decisions are to be used in accordance
with the provisions of 29 CFR Parts 1 and 5. Accordingly, the applicable decision, together with any modifications
issued, must be made a part of every contract for performance of the described work within the geographic area indicated
as required by an applicable Federal prevailing wage law and 29 CFR Part 5. The wage rates and fringe benefits, notice
of which is published herein, and which are contained in the Government Printing Office (GPO) document entitled ``General
Wage Determinations Issued Under the Davis-Bacon and Related Acts,'' shall be the minimum paid by contractors and
subcontractors to laborers and mechanics.

Any person, organization, or governmental agency having an interest in the rates determined as prevailing is encouraged
to submit wage rate and fringe benefit information for consideration by the Department. Further information and
self-explanatory forms for the purpose of submitting this data may be obtained by writing to the U.S. Department of
Labor, Employment Standards Administration, Wage and Hour Division, Division of Wage Determinations, 200 Constitution
Avenue, NW., room S-3014, Washington, DC 20210.

<DOCTITLE>Cleveland Electric Illuminating Company, et al.; Environmental Assessment and Finding of No Significant Impact</DOCTITLE>



The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an amendment to Facility Operating
License No. NPF-58 issued to the Cleveland Electric Illuminating Company, Centerior Service Company, Duquesne
Light Company, Ohio Edison Company, Pennsylvania Power Company, and Toledo Edison Company (the licensees) for operation
of the Perry Nuclear Power Plant, Unit No. 1, located in Lake County, Ohio.



Environmental Assessment



Identification of Proposed Action



The Proposed action would revise the provisions in the Technical Specifications (TS) to delete the area critically
monitors for the fuel preparation pool, spent fuel storage pool and the upper containment pools.

The proposed action is in accordance with the licensee's application for amendment dated February 28, 1992.



The Need for the Proposed Action



The proposed amendment is needed to reflect that area criticality monitors for the fuel preparation pool, spent fuel
storage pool and the upper containment pools are monitors only and do not prevent inadvertent criticality and are
not considered in any design basis accident or transient. Therefore, these monitors can be adequately controlled
by plant documents and procedures similar to other area radiation monitors.



Environmental Impact of the Proposed Action



The NRC staff has completed its evaluation of the proposed revision to the TS and concludes that removing the area criticality
monitors from TS and placing operability and surveillance requirements in plant documents and procedures will not
increase offsite releases. These monitors are not relied upon to successfully mitigate a fuel handling accident
outside of containment. Therefore, the proposed changes do not increase the probability or consequences of accidents,
no changes are being made in the types of any effluents that may be released offsite, and there is no significant increase
in the allowable individual or cumulative occupational radiation exposure. Accordingly, the NRC staff concludes
that this proposed action would result in no significant radiological environmental impact.

With regard to potential nonradiological impacts, the proposed changes to the TS involve systems located within
the restricted area as defined in 10 CFR part 20. It does not affect nonradiological plant effluents and has no other
environmental impact. Therefore, the NRC staff concludes that there are no significant nonradiological environmental
impacts associated with the proposed amendment.



Alternative to the Proposed Action



Because the Commission's staff has concluded that there are no significant environmental impacts associated with
the proposed action, any alternatives would have either no significantly different environmental impact or greater
environmental impact.

The principal alternative would be to deny the requested amendment. This would not reduce environmental impacts
as a result of plant operations.



Alternative Use of Resources



This action does not involve the use of resources not previously considered in the Final Environmental Statement
related to operation of the Perry Nuclear Power Plant, Units 1 and 2, dated August 1982.



Agencies and Persons Consulted



The NRC staff reviewed the licensee's request and consulted with the State of Ohio.



Finding of No Significant Impact



The Commission has determined not to prepare an environmental impact statement for the proposed license amendment.

Based upon the foregoing environmental assessment, we conclude that the proposed action will not have a significant
effect on the quality of the human environment.

For further details with respect to this action, see the licensee's application for amendment dated February 28,
1992, which is available for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, Gelman Building, 2120 L
Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555 and at the local public document room at the Perry Public Library, 3753 Main Street,
Perry, Ohio 44081.

Exemptions From Rules 10b-6, 10b-7, and 10b-8 During Distributions of Certain French Securities



June 7, 1994 


Pursuant to delegated authority, the Division of Market Regulation issued the following letter granting class exemptions
(``Exemptions'') from rules 10b-6, 10b-7, and 10b-8 (``Trading Practices Rules'') under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 to facilitate distributions in the United States of securities of certain highly capitalized
French issuers. The Exemptions permit distribution participants and their affiliated purchases to effect transactions
in France that otherwise would be prohibited by the Trading Practices Rules, subject to certain disclosure, recordkeeping,
record production, and notice requirements. 
The Exemptions have been issued in the context of a continuing review of the Trading Practices Rules, and are published
to provide notice of their availability.

English Translation of the Letter



Dear Mr. Becker,



I am writing in connection with possible offerings of equity securities of certain French companies involving a distribution
of some or all of the Securities in the United States.






With reference to the policy statement issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission on November 3, 1993, I am writing
to request exemptions from rules 10b-6, 106-7 and 10b-8 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
for French issuers to the extent set forth in part III below.



I. Offerings By French Companies



The structure of an offering of equity securities in a French company varies depending on whether it is a primary or
a secondary offering.



A. Primary Offerings



French law grants shareholders of a French company pre-emptive rights to subscribe for shares issued by such company.
French law also authorizes shareholders, voting at a shareholders meeting, to renounce such pre-emptive rights.
In practice, in the case of a renunciation of such pre-emptive rights, most offerings are conducted so as to grant current
shareholders a priority right to purchase new shares before the general public during a period of 5 to 10 days.



1. Offerings With Pre-emptive Rights



Offerings with pre-emptive rights permit the current shareholders to participate in the capital increase 

pro rata 

or to sell their pre-emptive rights, which are securities separable from the shares, on the market. The existence
of a negotiable pre-emptive right permits detachment of the offering price from the stock market price, because the
shareholders who do not want to participate in an offering can, by selling their rights on the market, be compensated
for the dilution which could result from an offering price which is significantly less than the market price and/or
than their share in the net assets. The discount from the stock market price is generally 10% to 20%. The technique of
an offering with pre-emptive rights is principally used for offerings of shares rather than for those of ``composite
securities'', such as bonds with warrants or bonds convertible into shares, for reasons of valuation and quotation
on the appropriate stock market.

2. Offerings Without Pre-emptive Rights



French law permits an issuer, when it is authorized by its shareholders, to issue shares (or securities exchangeable
for, or convertible into, shares) without pre-emptive rights. In this case, the law limits the discount at which the
issuer may offer the shares from the stock market price.
 The issue price must be at least equal to the average of the stock market prices for any 20 consecutive business days
during the 40-day period immediately preceding the date of the offering (the ``20/40 rule''). The 20/40 rule protects
shareholders to the extent that it limits the discount that can be set for an offering of shares without pre-emptive
rights. In addition, the COB has recommended a priority period in the case of an offering without pre-emptive rights,
permitting current shareholders to subscribe for new shares on a priority basis. This period provides existing shareholders
the ability to maintain their shareholding in the capital of a company of which they are shareholders, even if they
have waived their pre-emptive rights. The practice of the priority period has been widely followed for offerings
without pre-emptive rights; offerings without a priority period are rare today in France (1 or 2 per year).





The 20/40 rule applies, according to the text of the law, only to straight share offerings; however, to avoid circumvention
of the law, the COB requires that the 20/40 rule be applied in the case of offerings of convertible bonds or warrants.
In applying the 20/40 rule, issuers generally choose a reference period that is close to the offering date in order
to limit the amount of the discount.

In order to facilitate an underwritten offering in France and/or on the international market at the same time as an
offering with a priority period, the COB has accepted that the priority period only apply to a substantial part (

i.e., at least two thirds) of the offering.



3. Offerings Without a Priority Period



Offerings without a priority period are extremely rare. Such offerings are used under very limited circumstances,
such as when an issuer needs to offer shares publicly on a foreign market. Such an offering can only take place if one
or both of the following two conditions are met:




_It must be at the closest possible price to the stock market price; and/or

_The existing shareholders are compensated, for example in the form of a distribution of free shares or warrants.




Offerings without a priority period will probably remain atypical, because shareholders generally want to avoid
dilution through the use of pre-emptive rights or a priority period.



4. Underwritten Offerings



In the case of offerings with a priority period, an underwritten offering can occur during the period when the existing
shareholders have a priority right to subscribe for new shares, by anticipating that a fraction of the existing shareholders
will not subscribe for new shares. Underwritten offerings in France and/or on the international market can therefore
take place during the priority period granted to existing shareholders without extending the offering period. In
order to accommodate the differences between the actual behavior of the existing shareholders and the level of anticipated
purchases, several techniques are used: ``claw-back'' arrangements, over-allotment options and arrangements
whereby a majority shareholder renounces his priority subscription rights.

B. Secondary Offerings



1. Public Offerings



Public offerings are the traditional means of selling a large number of shares of a listed company on the market. Public
offerings are regulated both by the general rules of the CBV (title 7) and by the rules of the COB 89.03, chapter III.
Public offerings are at a price different from the market price. sellers, however, generally offer the shares at a
price which is close to the market. price Privatizations, which are a particular kind of public offerings, because
of the nature of the seller (the State) and of the volume of capital involved (up to several dozen billion francs per
transaction), can be carried out with a substantial discount from the last quoted market price (e.g.

, 10 to 15%).

Public offerings require the following:




_approval of the CBV;
_the clearance of the prospectus by the COB;
_The centralization of subscription orders by the Soci&eacute;t&eacute; des Bourses Fran&ccedil;aises;




In addition, public tender offers are market transactions which require a high level of disclosure.

In a public offering, all financial institutions, such as banks (but also other financial intermediaries such as
the French National Post Office and brokerage houses), can receive orders from the public. Such orders are transmitted
to the SBF where they are centralized. None of the financial institutions has any influence over the allocation of
the shares.

A public offering may be underwritten on a stand-by basis. Historically, most public offerings, and in particular
those relating to privatizations, are oversubscribed (about 2 to 4 times).



2. Underwritten Offerings



Whenever an offering is sufficiently large, an underwritten offering can take place in France and/or on an international
market. This is particularly the case in the context of privatization transactions. Such transactions, which use
the book-billing method, provide the banks leading the syndicate greater flexibility when allocating shares to
investors. In the context of an underwritten offering, the price for the offering is set based upon indications of
interest received from potential investors; however, the final price determined by the lead managers cannot be less
than the price in the public tender offer. During the first privatization which used this technique (Rh&ocirc;ne-Poulenc,
November 1993), the institutional investors who purchased shares in the underwritten offering paid a price 8% higher
than that paid by individuals who purchased shares in the public offering.



3. Bought Deals



The ``bought deal'' permits the placement of a certain amount (usually large) of securities with certain institutional
investors. This type of offering, different from a public offering, can only occur when it involves shares of a listed
company being offered at the market price or by techniques explicitly provided for in the general rules of the CBV:




_By ``applications'' (title 4, chapter III of the general rules of the CBV), the price in this case must be between the
best purchase offer and the best sale offer existing at the time of the application (article 4-7-3);

_By option contracts (title 7, chapter II of the general rules of the CBV): these contracts permit the sale or purchase
of a given amount of securities at a price quoted on a stock market the day of the contract or the day of its term or at the
average of the quoted prices between those two dates.




The seller of securities places the securities through a bank or banks with institutional investors of such seller's
choice. Accordingly, the seller transfers the securities first to the bank or banks which have committed to sell them
to such institutional investors in France or abroad.

The COB carefully reviews this type of placement in order to ensure that it is not used to advantage unfairly any existing
shareholder of the company.



C. Market Activities of Underwriters During Offerings



In France, the banks are the underwriters of securities. The vast majority of French banks provide a full range of banking
and securities services such as brokerage, underwriting and investment advisory services including managing on
a discretionary basis the portfolios of bank customers. However, banks may not be direct members of the Paris Bourse
and have to set up separate subsidiaries which will be members of the Bourse.

The French banks acting as underwriters typically continue to engage in a range of trading activities during a distribution.
The underwriters may be active in trading all kinds of securities of the issuer or derivative instruments related
to such securities both in the cash market and in the options market. In these markets, the underwriters trade securities
in the ordinary course for their own account. In addition, the underwriters continue to make investment decisions
for the accounts they manage and their mutual fund management company affiliates continue to make investment decisions
on behalf of the mutual funds they manage.

However, pursuant to legal and regulatory requirements to which they are subject and pursuant to their own respective
internal policies and conduct of business rules, banks maintain ``Chinese wall'' procedures to separate certain
divisions within their respective organizations. The main purpose of these Chinese walls is to ensure that confidential
information held within parts of the respective companies or divisions does not spread inadvertently to other parts
of those companies or to affiliated entities.

In addition, under French law, companies are prohibited from purchasing their own shares either directly or through
a financial intermediary acting on behalf of the company except in limited circumstances. These circumstances are
set forth in article 217-1 and 217-2 of the Companies Act of July 24, 1966, and in COB Regulations No. 90.04.
They include purchases made for the purpose of offering shares to employees of the corporation and, for listed companies,
purchases made for the purpose of market stabilization. These purchases are limited to 10% of the share capital of
the corporation. The company may not own more than 10% of any class of its outstanding shares in capital at any time.

Under COB Regulation No 90.04, such purchases may be only to ensure the liquidity of the shares or to control excessive
fluctuations in their price. The company is required to file a copy of the shareholder's resolution authorizing such
transactions with the COB prior to engaging in such transactions, as well as a monthly copy of the register of purchases
and sales thereafter.

Under article 9 of COB Regulation No. 90.04, transactions made by a company in its own shares and, during a distribution
period, transactions made by financial intermediaries for their own account or on behalf of the underwriting syndicate,
for the purpose of ensuring the proper execution of the distribution are presumed to be legitimate when complying
with the following requirements: (i) the transactions are performed contrary to the trend of the last quoted price,
(ii) the transactions represent a maximum volume of 25% of the total daily transactions recorded over a reference
period
 preceding the transactions, (iii) they are performed only by one intermediary per stock exchange session except
during a public offering.






The distribution period begins with the announcement of the distribution and ends one month after the listing of the
newly issued shares.



II. The French Securities Market



A. The Equity Market



Securities may be listed on one of France's seven stock exchanges: Paris, Bordeaux, Lille, Lyon, Marseille, Nancy
and Nantes which together constitute a single exchange system headed by the same authorities and subject to the same
listing requirements. All securities are traded through a single electronic system, CAC.



Trading on the Paris Bourse



Trading on the Paris Bourse begins at 10 a.m. and ends at 5 p.m. (Paris time) each business day.

Securities may be traded on the cash market (march&eacute; au comptant) or on the monthly settlement market (r&egrave;glement
mensuel RM). Cash transactions comprise the least actively traded French and foreign equity securities on the official
list, all debt securities on the official list and all equity stocks on the second market and hors cote.

The most actively traded French and foreign equity securities on the official list are traded on a monthly settlement
basis. All the securities comprising the CAC 40 Index are traded on the monthly settlement market.

Securities on the monthly settlement market are traded in round lots of 5, 10, 25, 50 and 100, set by the Paris Bourse
to reflect their limit price. While transactions are firm both in prices and quantity once they have been concluded,
the actual cash settlement and delivery of the shares do not take place until the end of the trading month. Investors
on the monthly settlement market must meet an initial margin requirement which may be adjusted as necessary.

When investors place orders on the monthly settlement market they may request immediate settlement provided that
they have the related cash (for a purchase) or securities (for a sale). Trades on odd lots are settled immediately.



Electronic Trading With CAC

Trading in France takes place on a centralized order driven market through member firms, authorized by the Conseil
des Bourses de Valeurs, acting as brokers. Transactions are handled by CAC, an electronic trading system, through
terminals installed in member firms' premises and linked to the Paris Bourse central computers. The core of the CAC
system is linked upstream to an order routing system and downstream to a computerised system that disseminates key
markets data in real time.

Orders entered in the CAC system by the Bourse member firms acting either on their own behalf or as agents for their clients,
are automatically ranked by price limit and, within each limit, are queued to reflect the order of entry in the system.

From 9 a.m. to 10 a.m. the market is in its pre-opening phase and orders are entered into the centralized order book,
without any transaction taking place.

At 10 a.m., the market opens. Based on the limit orders received, the central computer calculates the opening price
at which the largest number of bids and asks orders can be matched. At the same time, the system transforms orders at
market price into limit orders at the opening price, with the result that all limit buy orders at higher prices and limit
sell orders at lower prices are executed. Limit orders at the opening price are executed to the extent that match orders
are available.

From 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., trading takes place on a continuous basis. The execution price is the price limit placed on the
matching order. Where price limits are identical, orders are executed on a first entered, first matched basis.

CAC automatically feeds information into the system's electronic data dissemination network. As a result, at any
given time, the CAC displays the five best bids and asks (price and volume) as well as, in real time, the five latest transactions
completed (time price, number of shares traded).

French securities brokers may also act as principals with respect to clients on the Paris Bourse. However, such prices
must be lodged on to the CAC and must be at or within the current market spread at the time of their transmission. After
hours principal transactions may also take place at any price within the spread at the previous close, plus or minus
1%. Those transactions must be reported to the SBF prior to the opening of the next trading session. Every morning,
prior to the opening, the SBF disseminates through the market data feed message zone the name of the stocks on which
after hours transactions have been reported and the number of shares traded.

Finally block trades in specific securities are permitted outside the market spread, subject to certain restrictions
(

e.g.

 the securities broker effecting the trade must agree to fill all buy orders whose price is higher and all sell orders
whose price is lower than such block trade).

The Enforcement Division of the SBF is in charge of seeing that member firms of the Paris Bourse comply with the securities
laws and the regulations of the CBV.



B. The MONEP (The Options Market)



The MONEP (Paris Traded Options Market) is located within the Paris Bourse; it is governed and regulated by the Conseil
des Bourses de Valeurs, through its general regulation. There are 21 market markers in options on the shares on the
MONEP.

The market makers are registered with a professional body, the ``Soci&eacute;t&eacute; de Compensation des March&eacute;s
Conditionnels'' (SCMC) which is affiliated with the SBF and to which the SBF has delegated responsibility for (i)
options market administration, (ii) technical clearing of the MONEP, (iii) surveillance and control of operations
and members. MONEP members can operate on the markets as brokers and/or as market makers.

Twenty seven series of equity options and two series of options based on the CAC 40 index are traded on the floor of the
Paris Bourse, from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., on a continuous basis by open outcry around different pits., two to four classes
of options being listed and traded in each pit. In each pit, several SCMC representatives execute orders from the Public
Order Book and are responsible for seeing that traders comply with the market's rules.

In addition, for retail orders, brokerage firms have a direct access to an automated trading system called STAMP (

Syst&egrave;me de Transactions Automaiis&eacute;es du MONEP

) through terminals in their own trading rooms. Orders are keyed into the centralized public order book and the data
are displayed and disseminated to users. Such orders are either matched automatically inside the book when they represent
the market's best price or routed to SCMC staff for priority execution on the floor if better prices are available there.

MONEP member firms operate through representatives acting in two distinct capacities: (i) As brokers who trade orders
received directly from clients or issued for brokerage houses' own account, (ii) as market makers. Since a modification
of the General Regulation of the CBV that took place in August 1993, there are three types of market makers:




_The market makers ``specialist'': a specialist market maker is designated for each class of option. He is the only
market maker responsible for quoting and continuously updating a bid/ask price for the series of option allocated
to the firm. The bid/ask price offered by the specialist is disseminated by the SCMC on quotation screens.

_The market maker ``counterpart to the market'': he is required to be present on the floor and may trade within the bid/ask
price offered by the specialist. There are various counterparts to the market for the same class of option.
_The market maker acting as ``block transaction counterpart''. His activity consists in arranging options blocks
transactions for institutional clients, typically from the firm's trading room. The transaction is then executed
on the market if the price is within the spread displayed.





This change is being implemented gradually on a class of option by class of option basis.

Market makers are required to be present on the floor during trading hours and to quote a bid/ask price to any broker
or to the SCMC upon requests. Market makers quotation (bid/ask prices) are entered and disseminated on a real time
basis. All trades are immediately time-stamped and entered into the market system in order to be displayed on the floor
and disseminated outside the floor.

After hours trading is forbidden.



C. The Regulatory Authorities



A professional body, the Conseil des Bourses de Valeurs (CBV) (Stock Exchange Council) is the market regulatory body.
The Conseil des Bourses de Valeurs promulgates regulation dealing with the operation of the French stock exchanges
and set forth the conditions for authorization of member firms, for admission and withdrawal from listing, and for
take over bids. The CBV rules also set forth a professional code of conduct for Bourse members, their subsidiaries,
their manager and their staff. In addition, the Council can take disciplinary action as necessary.

<TEXT>
 

Another professional body, the Soci&eacute;t&eacute; des Bourses Fran&ccedil;aises, implements the CBV regulations,
monitors the trading system, disseminates data on market conditions, provides a number of listing and issuing services
and acts as a clearing house between member firms. The SBF handles day to day administration, surveillance, and development
of the market.
The Commission des op&eacute;rations de bourse (COB), an independent administrative body, is responsible for overall
supervision of French securities, options and futures markets. Under the Ordinance of September 28, 1967, setting
up the COB, the COB is responsible for seeing to the protection of savings invested in securities and all other investments
involving a public offering, to the provision of information to investors and to the proper functioning of markets
for securities, listed financial products or negotiable futures contracts.
If the SBF primarily regulates and carries out the surveillance of the market, including by controlling quotation
rules, participant's risks or margin calls, the market surveillance carried out by the COB is of a different nature
because the COB is entrusted with the broad mission of protecting investors.
The market surveillance carried out by the COB aims at (i) detecting abnormal situations in the functioning of the
markets (ii) sorting and treating data that enable the COB to check that its rules are complied with, including those
relating to public offers and information of shareholders (iii) detecting securities and futures frauds as well
as violations to the business codes of conduct and to regulations of the CBV and the Conseil des March&eacute;s &agrave;
Terme (Futures Market Council).
The surveillance department of the Enforcement Division of the COB is connected to the various computers of the Paris
Bourse, among which the CAC, TOPVAL and REUTER workstations providing the COB with data on a real time basis. Moreover,
the COB has set up its own data base directly linked to the Paris Bourse, the MONEP and the MATIF.
On December 14, 1989, the Commission des op&eacute;rations de bourse and the Securities and Exchange Commission
entered into an administrative agreement on cooperation and exchange of information. This Administrative Agreement
entered into force on January 31, 1991.
Under this Agreement, the COB and the SEC may exchange transaction information, including the identity of customers,
where necessary, in the course of an investigation initiated by either of the Commissions.


D. Laws and Regulations Governing Fraudulent and Manipulative Practices


Provisions relating to fraudulent and manipulative practices are set forth mainly in the Ordinance of September
28, 1967, and in COB Regulation No. 90.04 and No. 90.08.
 Article 10.1 of the Ordinance of September 1967 makes it a criminal offense for any persons who have access to privileged
information on an issuer of securities or on the futures prospects of a security or a negotiable future contract to
effect transactions on the market, either directly or through a third party, before the general public was aware of
this information. It would also be a criminal offense for such a person to communicate such information to a third party
outside the normal course of his professional activities. Under article 10.1, criminal sanctions shall also apply
to any persons who have knowingly disseminated to the public, through whatever channels or means, false or deceitful
information on an issuer of securities or on the future prospects of a security, a quoted financial product or a negotiable
futures contract of such nature as to influence prices. Under article 10.3, similar penalties shall apply to any person
who, either directly or indirectly, has knowingly carried out or attempted to carry out a purpose-fully misleading
act on a financial market with the aim of impeding the normal functioning of the market. It should be stressed that under
article 40 of the Criminal Proceeding Code, any governmental entity who becomes aware of a fact that may constitute
a criminal offense has to transmit the information to the Public Prosecutor.




The violation of COB Regulation No. 90.08 relating to the use of privileged information is sanctioned by the COB through
an administrative proceeding.
COB Regulation No. 90.04 provides that price setting on the market shall result from the general matching of bids and
offers in compliance with the Regulation of the Conseil des Bourses de Valeurs or the Counseil du March&eacute; &agrave;
Terme. Orders transmitted on the market shall not be aimed at hindering or misleading the setting of prices on the market.
If the COB so requires in the course of an investigation, any person transmitting orders on the market must be able to
publicly explain the reasons for, and the details of, the orders.
Regulation 2.3.11 of the CBV requires the member firms to maintain records of securities transaction effected by
them. Such records must be maintained for at least five years from the date thereof. To ensure that the market's rules
and business code of conduct are complied with by all participants, member firms must specify, when entering orders
into the system, whether these orders come from customers or are being executed for the firm's own account, and whether
such orders are the result of program trading. The required transaction information includes (i) the name of the security
that is the subject of the transaction, (ii) the date of the transaction, (iii) the price and size of the transaction,
(iv) whether the transaction was effected for a customer or a proprietary account, (v) the market on which the transaction
is effected, (vi) whether the transaction was a purchase or a sale and (vii) the identity of the account on whose behalf
the transaction was effected.


III. Proposed Exemption From Rules 10b-6, 10b-7, 10b-8


A. Reasons for Relief


The application of rules 10b-6, 10b-7 and 10b-8 to the activities of distribution participants
and their affiliates outside the United States, as experienced on the occasion of several public offerings in the
past few years,
 often conflicts with market practices in France and impose compliance burdens and costs on French issuers and underwriters
and their affiliated purchasers. The application of rules 10b-6, 10b-7 and 10b-8 outside the United
States has and would have, inter alia, the following consequences, which jeopardize the success of primary or secondary
offering.





1. Distribution participants, including the underwriters and in particular the lead underwriter would be unable
to maintain an orderly market by buying and selling affected securities as principles during the offering, within
the limits set forth in COB Regulations. Moreover, the affiliates of the distribution participants would be precluded
from fulfilling their formal market-making obligations on the MONEP with respect to listed options that are affected
securities.
2. The underwriters might not be able to continue certain of their regular contacts with customers such as discussions
regarding investment strategies with respect to the rights and shares and might not be permitted to buy and sell affected
securities in connection with their customers' trading activities.
3. Distribution participants' risk management activities would be restricted. They would be precluded by rule 10b-6
from hedging in derivatives or other affected securities.
4. Distribution participants' customary proprietary trading activities, involving arbitrage and other trading
strategies would be curtailed.


B. Scope of Exemption


We propose that the Commission grant exemptions to the effect that rules 10b-6, 10b-7 and 10b-8 shall
not apply to distribution participants, including issuers of qualified French securities (as defined below), and
their affiliated purchasers (the Relevant Parties) in connection with transactions in Relevant Securities (as
defined below) outside the United States during distributions in the United States of Qualified French Securities
(as defined below), subject to the following terms, conditions and limitations:


1. Securities


(a) The security being distributed (a ``Qualified French Security'') must:
(i) Be issued by (aa) a ``foreign private issuer'' within the meaning of rule 3b-4 under the Exchange Act incorporated
under the laws of France, which issuer (a ``French Issuer'') has outstanding a component security of the CAC 40 Index
 (bb) or a subsidiary of a French Issuer; and

(ii) Satisfy one of the following:
(aa) Be a CAC 40 Index component security; or
(bb) Be an equity security of a French Issuer having an average daily trading volume that equals or exceeds the equivalent
of FF 30 million (which exceeded US $5 million at June 6, 1994), as published by foreign financial regulatory authorities
(``FFRAs'')
 and any US securities exchanges or automated inter-dealer quotation systems during the Reference Period; or





(cc) Be a security that is convertible into, exchangeable for, or is a right to acquire a security of a French Issuer
described in subparagraph ii (aa) or (bb) above.
(b) ``Relevant Security'' means:
(i) A Qualified French Security; or
(ii) A security of the same class and series as, or a right to purchase, a Qualified French Security.


2. Transactions Effected in the United States


All transactions in Relevant Securities effected in the United States shall comply with rules 10b-6, 10b-7
and 10b-8.


3. Transactions Effected in France


(a) All transactions during the Covered Period (as defined below) in Relevant Securities effected in France shall
be conducted in compliance with French law. For purposes of this exemption, ``Covered Period'' means (i) in the case
of a rights offering, the period commencing when the subscription price is determined and continuing until the completion
of the distribution in the United States, and (ii) in the case of any other offering, the period commencing in Paris
three business days before the price is determined in the United States and continuing until the completion of the
distribution in the United States; 

provided, however,

 that the Covered Period shall not commence with respect to any Relevant Party until such person becomes a distribution
participant.

(b) All transactions in Relevant Securities during the Covered Period effected in France on a principal basis shall
be effected or reported on the trading facilities of the Soci&eacute;t&eacute; des Bourses Fran&ccedil;aises.
(c) Disclosure of Trading Activities.






(i) The inside front cover page of the offering materials used in the offer and sale in the United States of a Qualified
French Security shall prominently display a statement in substantially the following form, subject to appropriate
modification where circumstances require. Such statement shall be in capital letters, printed in bold-face roman
type at least as large as ten-point modern type and at least two points leaded:


IN CONNECTION WITH THIS OFFERING, CERTAIN PERSONS MAY ENGAGE IN TRANSACTIONS FOR THEIR OWN ACCOUNTS OR FOR THE ACCOUNTS
OF OTHERS IN (IDENTIFY RELEVANT SECURITIES) PURSUANT TO EXEMPTIONS FROM RULES 10b-6, 10b-7 AND 10b-8
UNDER THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934. SEE ``[IDENTIFY SECTION OF OFFERING MATERIALS THAT DESCRIBES THE TRANSACTIONS
TO BE EFFECTED].''


(ii) In addition, there shall be included in the identified section of the offering materials a comprehensive description
of the activities that may be undertaken by the Relevant Parties in the Relevant Securities during the distribution

in Relevant Securities, provided, however, that in the case of a distribution made pursuant to a right offering, such
information is only required to be kept during the period or periods (a) commencing at any time during the Covered Period
that the rights exercise price does not represent a discount of at least 10% from the current market price of the security
underlying the rights and (b) continuing until the end of the Covered Period or until the rights exercise price represents
a discount of at least 12 percent from the current market price of the security underlying the rights;






(aa) Name of the security, date, time of execution and reporting, where available to the Relevant Party, price and
volume of each transaction; provided however that no information regarding a customer transaction need be provided
unless such transaction has a value of FF 1500000 or more;
(bb) The exchange or inter-dealer quotation system on which the transaction was effected;






(cc) An indication whether such transaction was for a proprietary account or the account of a customer, provided however
that any transaction effected by an underwriter for a customer account for which it has exercised discretionary authority
shall be reported as proprietary trade and;
(dd) The identity of the counterparty only where the counterparty is an underwriter or a selling group member.

(ii) The lead underwriter will communicate the list of the Relevant Parties to the COB; 
(iii) The Relevant Parties shall keep all documents prepared pursuant to paragraph 3.d.i for a period of no less than
two years;
(iv) Upon the request of the Division made pursuant to the Administrative Agreement executed between the SEC and the
COB on December 14, 1989, the COB will require the production and the information referred to in paragraph 3.d.(i)
from the Relevant Parties through the lead underwriter. The Relevant Parties will provide this information to the
COB in a Comma Delimited ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) within 10 days of the request
by the COB and the COB shall transmit it to the Division within 30 days from the date of the request.
(v) If the Division has inquiries relating to the records provided by such Relevant Parties, it will transmit these
inquiries to the COB pursuant to the Administrative Agreement. Representatives of the affected Relevant Party will
be made available to respond to the inquiries of the COB.
The proposed exemption to rules 10b-6, 10b-7 and 10b-8 shall also apply unconditionally to all transactions
on the SEAQ International and any other securities market in a single country outside France and the United States
to which a French issuer has applied for listing the relevant Qualified French Securities if the volume in such relevant
Qualified French Security as published by SEAQ International or such other relevant securities markets is less than
10% of the aggregate worldwide trading volume in that security during the Reference Period.


4. General Conditions


(1) For purposes of this exemption a two business day cooling-off period shall apply under rule 10b-6(a)(4)(v),
(xi) and (xii) in the United States and in each Significant Market,
 provided that trading in Relevant Securities in any Significant Market shall be subject to the exemptive relief then
available in such markets, if any or the record maintenance and record production requirements contained in the letter
regarding Application of cooling-off Periods under rule 10b-6 to Distributions of foreign securities (April
4, 1994) are satisfied by Relevant Parties in such significant market.




(b) The lead underwriter or the global coordinator shall promptly, but in any event before the commencement of the
Covered Period, provide a written notice (``Notice'') to the Division of the following information: (i) the name
of the issuer and the Qualified French Securities; (ii) whether the Qualified French Security is a CAC 40 component
security or information with respect to the market capitalization and the average daily trading volume of the Qualified
French Securities to be distributed; (iii) the identity of the Significant Markets where the Qualified French Security
trades; (iv) if the Notice is for more than one entity, the identity of all underwriters and selling group members relying
on these exemptions; and (v) a statement that the Relevant Parties are aware of the terms and conditions of these exemptions.
We believe this proposed exemption would make it possible to maintain liquidity for shares of French companies throughout
a public offering or private placement in the United States, while minimizing the risk of abuses of the kind at which
rules 10b-6, 10b-7 and 10b-8 are aimed.
Thank you for your assistance and the assistance of your staff in this matter.
  Sincerely,
  Pierre Fleuriot.

Exhibit A


The French underwriters (and their affiliates) will, and the other Underwriters (and their affiliates) may, continue
to engage in the transactions and other activities described below, in France and elsewhere outside the United States,
in respect of the securities being distributed, securities of the same class and series as the securities being distributed,
and securities convertible into, exchangeable for, or giving a right to acquire, the foregoing securities, and derivatives
thereof (collectively, the ``Relevant Securities''), during the distribution period, in accordance with exemptions
obtained from the Securities and Exchange Commission (the ``Commission'') from the application outside the United
States of rules 10b-6, 10b-7 and 10b-8 under the US Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Such exemptions
are subject to certain exceptions, limitations and conditions set out in the Commission's exemption, including
compliance with French law.
The activities referred to above are (a) buying and selling Relevant Securities for the accounts of such Underwriters
(or their affiliates), whether for purposes of risk management in connection with the offering, arbitrage or otherwise,
(b) buying and selling Relevant Securities on behalf of customers, (c) advising customers as to the purchase or sale
of Relevant Securities, including publication of specific company and industry research reports, (d) engaging
in securities lending transactions in Relevant Securities and (e) stabilizing the market (as described below).
As a result of these activities, the Underwriters may at any time be short or long in Relevant Securities.
It is general market practice in France for the Underwriters, and the lead Underwriter in particular, to maintain
an orderly market in subscription rights and existing shares, and it is expected that the lead Underwriter will take
measures to avoid extreme price fluctuations during the distribution period.
The activities referred to above may result in the market prices of the Relevant Securities being different from those
that might otherwise have prevailed in the open market if rules 10b-6, 10b-7 and 10b-8 had applied
in France and elsewhere outside the United States.

with the requirements of rules 10b-6, 10b-7, and 10b-8, except as permitted by paragraph IV.B. below
or by other available exemptions. For purposes of these exemptions, ``Significant Market'' means: (i) SEAQ International
or any other dealer market outside the United States and France for which price and volume information is published
by an FFRA; or (ii) any other securities market(s) in a single country other than the United States or France to which
a French Issuer has applied for listing the Qualified French Security and been accepted, if during the Reference Period
the volume in either (i) or (ii) in such Qualified French Security, as published by the relevant FFRA(s) in such securities
market, is 10 percent or more of the aggregate worldwide trading volume in that security published by all FFRAs in (i)
and (ii), FFRAs in France, and U.S. securities markets to which such French Issuer has applied for listing such Qualified
French Security and been accepted. 

B. In the case of a distribution of Qualified French Securities made pursuant to rights (``rights distribution''),
the Relevant Parties located in the United Kingdom (``U.K. Relevant Parties''): (a) in connection with the rights
distribution, may purchase or solicit the purchase of Relevant Securities in transactions solely in response to
orders for the accounts of their customers in the ordinary course of their business in the United Kingdom (``customer
facilitation activities''); and (b) may bid for or purchase Relevant Securities as principal in market making transactions
through SEAQ International during the rights distribution, in each case subject to the following conditions: 

1. During the period from five business days prior to the expiration date of the rights distribution and until the expiration
date, inclusive, at any time at which the difference between the rights exercise price and the market price of the security
underlying the rights (which for this purpose will be taken to mean the mid-price between the highest bid and lowest
offer quoted on SEAQ International for the security underlying the rights) does not represent a discount of at least
10 percent from the then current market price of the security underlying the rights, the U.K. Relevant Parties will
effect ``passive market making'' transactions in the Relevant Securities subject to the terms and conditions of


Letter regarding Distributions of SEAQ and SEAQ International Securities 

(July 12, 1993) (``LSE Letter''); 

2. The U.K. Relevant Parties, in accordance with Item 502(d)(1) of Regulation S-K under the Securities Act,
shall include a statement regarding transactions which stabilize or maintain the market price of the Relevant Securities
with appropriate modification, to reflect the possibility that the U.K. Relevant Parties may engage in market making,
including passive market making, and customer facilitation activities that otherwise would be prohibited by rule
10b-6, and shall include pursuant to rule 408 under the Securities Act in the ``Plan of Distribution'' or similar
section of the prospectus, a brief description of such proposed market making and customer facilitation activities
in the Relevant Securities; and 

3. The recordkeeping and production requirements set forth by the Commission in the LSE Letter shall apply to all transactions
effected by or on behalf of the U.K. Relevant Parties' accounts, or for the accounts of customers in connection with
customer facilitation activities during the rights distribution.

V. General Conditions 


A. For purposes of these exemptions, a two business day cooling-off period shall apply under Rule 10b-6(a)(4)(v),
(xi) and (xii) in the United States and each Significant Market, provided that trading in Relevant Securities in Significant
Markets shall be subject to the exemptive relief then available in such market, if any, or the record maintenance and
record production requirements contained in 

Letter regarding Application of Cooling-Off Periods Under Rule 10b-6 to Distributions of Foreign Securities


(April 4, 1994) are satisfied by Relevant Parties in such Significant Market. 

B. The lead underwriter or the global coordinator shall promptly, but in any event before the commencement of the Covered
Period, provide a list of the Relevant Parties to the COB and written notice (``Notice'') to the Division containing
the following information: (i) the name of the issuer and the Qualified French Security; (ii) whether the Qualified
French Security is a CAC 40 Index component security or information with respect to the market capitalization and

 and (v) a statement that the Relevant Parties are aware of the terms and conditions of these exemptions. 





C. Any person who fails to comply with the conditions of the exemptions, including a failure to provide requested information,
would not be permitted to rely on the exemptions in future distributions. Upon a showing of good cause, however, the
Commission or the Division may determine that it is not necessary under the circumstances that the exemptions be denied.


The foregoing exemptions from rules 10b-6, 10b-7, and 10b-8 are based solely on your representations
and the facts presented, and are strictly limited to the application of those rules to the proposed transactions.
Any different facts or representations might require a different response. Responsibility for compliance with
any other applicable provisions of the federal securities laws must rest with the Relevant Parties. The Division
expresses no view with respect to any other questions that the proposed transactions may raise, including, but not
limited to, the adequacy of disclosure concerning, and the applicability of any other federal or state laws to, the
proposed transactions.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Notice of Filing of Proposed Rule Change and Amendment No. 1 to Proposed Rule Change
by the American Stock Exchange, Inc. Relating to the Listing and Trading of Options on the Nikkei Stock Index 300</DOCTITLE>



June 10, 1994.



Pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'')
 and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,
 notice is hereby given that on May 31, 1994, the American Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Amex'' or ``Exchange'') filed with
the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II, and
III below, which Items have been prepared by the Amex. On June 10, 1994, the Amex filed Amendment No. 1 to the proposed
rule change.
 The `Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change and Amendment No. 1 from
interested persons.







I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change



The Exchange is proposing to trade standardized options on the Nikkei Stock Index 300 (``Index''). In addition, the
Amex proposes to amend Amex Rule 904C(b) to provide for a position limit for the Index of 50,000 contracts on the same
side of the market, provided that no more than 30,000 of such contracts are in series in the nearest expiration month.

The text of the proposed rule change is available at the Office of the Secretary, the Amex, and at the Commission.



II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



In its filing with the Commission, the Amex included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed
rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be
examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The Amex has prepared summaries, set forth in sections (A), (B),
and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.



(A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



The Exchange is proposing to trade standardized options on the Index. The Index is comprised of 30 stocks which are
representative of the first section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange (``TSE'').

The Index was designed and is maintained by Nihon Keizai Shimbun, Inc. (``Nihon''). The Index's component securities
were selected for their high market capitalizations and high degree of liquidity, and are representative of the relative
distribution of industries within the broader Japanese equity market.

The median capitalization of the companies in the Index on March 31, 1994, was 340.1 billion yen (US $3.3 billion at
the exchange rate of 102.75 yen per dollar prevailing on March 31, 1994). The average market capitalization of these
companies was US $7.5 billion on the same date and using the same rate of exchange. The individual market capitalizations
of these companies ranged from a low of US $875 million to a high of US $76.5 billion on March 31, 1994. The largest stock
accounted for 3.41 percent of the total weighting of the Index, while the smallest accounted for 0.04 percent.

The Index is a capitalization-weighted index and is calculated by multiplying the price of each component security
(in Japanese yen) by its number of shares outstanding, adding those sums and dividing by the current Index divisor.
The Index divisor was determined initially to yield a benchmark value of 100 on October 1, 1982. The Index's closing
value on April 13, 1994, was 296.35. The Index multiplier is 100, and, for valuation purposes, one Index unit (1.0)
is assigned a fixed value of one U.S. dollar.

The Index will be maintained by Nihon. To maintain the continuity of the Index, the divisor will be adjusted to reflect
certain events relating to the component securities. These events include, but are not limited to, changes in the
number of shares outstanding, spinoffs, certain rights issuances, and mergers and acquisitions. The composition
of the Index will be reviewed periodically by Nihon.

The proposed options on the Index are to be European-style (

i.e.

, exercises are permitted at expiration only), and cash-settled. Trading hours for the Index options will be 9 a.m.
to 4:15 p.m. (New York time). Options on the Index will expire on the Saturday following the third Friday of the expiration
month (``Expiration Friday''). The last trading day in an option series normally will be the business day immediately
preceding Expiration Friday of each expiration month (normally a Thursday) and trading in expiring options will
cease at the close of trading on such day. The exercise settlement value for all of the Index's expiring options will
be 
the special opening quotation, which is calculated based upon the opening price of each of the component securities
on the TSE on the last business day prior to expiration. If a stock fails to open for trading, the last available price
of the stock will be used to calculate the Index's settlement value. When an option expiration is moved in accordance
with an Exchange holiday, the last trading day for the expiring Index options will be Wednesday, and the exercise settlement
value of the Index options will be determined at the opening of the regular Thursday trading session on the TSE, even
if the TSE is open on Friday. If the TSE will be closed on the Friday before expiration but the Amex is not, the last trading
day for expiring Index options will be on Wednesday.

The Exchange plans to list options series with expirations in the three near-term calendar months and in the three
additional calendar months in the March cycle. In addition, longer-term options series having up to 36 months to expiration
may be traded. In lieu of such long-term options on a full-value Index level, the Exchange may list long-term, reduced-value
put and call options based on one-tenth (1/10th) of the Index's full value. The current and closing Index value of any
such reduced-value long-term option will be rounded to the nearest one-hundredth (1/100th) after the initial computation.
In either event, the interval between expiration months for either a full-value or reduced-value long-term option
will not be less than six months.

Amex Rules 900C through 980C will apply to the trading of standardized and long-term option contracts based on the
Index. These rules cover issues such as sales practices, margin requirements, exercise prices, position and exercise
limits, and floor trading procedures. Surveillance procedures currently used to monitor trading in each of the Exchange's
other index options also will be used to monitor trading in options on the Index. The Exchange represents that the TSE
has requested that a new comprehensive surveillance sharing agreement be executed with respect to options on the
Index. This agreement will cover the sharing of surveillance information regarding the Index's component securities.

The Exchange believes that the Index is a Stock Index Option under Amex Rule 901C(a) and a Broad Stock Index Group under
Amex Rule 900C(b)(1). With respect to Amex Rule 903C(b), the Exchange proposes to list near-the-money (

i.e., 

Within ten points above or below the current index value) option series on the Index at 21/2 point strike (exercise)
price intervals when the value of the Index is below 200 points. In addition, the Exchange proposes to establish, pursuant
to Amex Rule 904C(b), a position limit of 50,000 contracts on the same side of the market, provided no more than 30,000
of such contracts are in series in the nearest expiration month.

In anticipation of substantial customer activity in the options on this Index (including institutional activity),
the Exchange seeks to have the ability to utilize its Auto-Ex system for orders in the Index options of up to 50 contracts.
Auto-Ex is the Exchange's automated execution system which provides for the automatic execution of market and marketable
limit orders at the best bid or offer at the time the order is entered. The Exchange believes that the ability to use Auto-Ex
for orders of up to 50 contracts will provide customers with deep, liquid markets, as well as expeditious executions.

The Exchange believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with section 6(b) of the Act in general, and furthers
the objectives of section 6(b)(5) in particular, in that it is designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts
and practices, to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to foster cooperation and coordination with persons
engaged in facilitating transactions in securities, and to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free
and open market and a national market system.



B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition



The Amex does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any burden on competition.



(C) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants,
or Others



No written comments were solicited or received with respect to the proposed rule change.



III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule change and Timing for Commission Action



Within 35 days of the date of publication of this notice in the 

Federal Register

 or within such longer period: (i) As the Commission may designate up to 90 days of such date if it finds such longer period
to be appropriate and publishes its reasons for so finding, or (ii) as to which the self-regulatory organization consents,
the Commission will:

(A) By order approve such proposed rule change, or

(B) Institute proceedings to determine whether the proposed rule change should be disapproved.



IV. Solicitation of Comments



Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views, and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying in the Commission's
Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC. Copies of such filing also will be available for
inspection and copying at the principal office of the Amex. All submissions should refer to File No. SR-Amex-94-19
and should be submitted by July 8, 1994.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Midwest Securities Trust Company; Notice of Filing and Immediate Effectiveness
of a Proposed Rule Change Relating to Reorganization Processing</DOCTITLE>


June 10, 1994.



Pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''),
 notice is hereby given that on May 5, 1994, the Midwest Securities Trust Company (``MSTC'') filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (the ``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II, and III below,
which Items have been prepared by MSTC. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed
rule change from interested persons.





I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change



The proposed rule change adds to Article IV of MSTC's rules an interpretation which describes the Reorganization
Processing System.



II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



In its filing with the Commission, MSTC included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule
change. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. MSTC has prepared summaries,
set forth in sections A, B, and C below, or the most significant aspects of such statements.



A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



The purpose of the rule filing is to set forth in MSTC's rules the fact that MSTC may provide reorganization notices
by computer facility. The computer facility that MSTC developed for the purpose of providing reorganization notices
is a user-friendly, real-time computer system that allows participants, through the use of intuitive, data-driven
displays, to view offer information on-line. It will allow MSTC participants to inquire as to various offer criteria,
including offer type(s), target CUSIP(s), MSTC offer status, and offer date(s). Participants will be able to tailor
their inquiries to only those offers in which they have a depository position. They may also view the location of a position
within their MSTC account(s) for a chosen CUSIP. In addition, participants will be able to inquire as to a CUSIP's reorganization
history.

Rule 4 of Article IV of MSTC's rules describes MSTC's activities with respect to reorganizations, and sections 3 and
4 of Rule 2 of Article IV describe MSTC's responsibilities with respect to reorganization information disseminated
by MSTC. Pursuant to these rules, MSTC currently provides daily notification of newly announced and updated corporate
reorganization offers to its participants through manually produced, hard-copy notices. MSTC produces these notices,
which include pertinent offer information, for a variety of offer types including, but not limited to, mergers, reverse
splits, tenders and exchanges, expiring rights and warrants, put options on corporate and municipal bonds, and expiring
convertible securities.

Each current notice includes a disclaimer to the effect that MSTC does not guarantee the correctness or completeness
of the information provided. This liability standard has been used for over twenty years and was part of MSTC's written
procedures when MSTC applied for and received permanent registration as a clearing agency. The proposed interpretation
sets forth language that limits MSTC's liability with respect to the information provided by computer. The liability
standard is substantially the same as the standard for the hard copy notices.

The proposed rule change is consistent with section 17A of the Act in that it will facilitate the prompt and accurate
clearance and settlement of securities transactions.



B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition



MSTC does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any burden on competition.



C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received from Members, Participants,
or Others



Written comments were not and are not intended to be solicited with respect to the proposed rule change, and none have
been received.

III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action



MSTC requests that the proposed rule change become effective upon filing pursuant to 19(b)(3)(A)(iii)
 of the Act and subparagraph (e)(4) of rule 19b-4
 thereunder. The foregoing rule change effects a change in an existing service that does not adversely affect the safeguarding
of securities or funds in the custody or control of MSTC or for which MSTC is responsible and does not significantly
affect the respective rights or obligations of MSTC or persons using the service. At any time within sixty days of the
filing of such rule change, the Commission may summarily abrogate such rule change if it appears to the Commission
that such action is necessary or appropriate in the public interest, for the protection of investors, or otherwise
in furtherance of the purposes of the Act.






IV. Solicitation of Comments



Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views, and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; National Securities Clearing Corporation; Notice of Filing and Immediate Effectiveness
of Proposed Rule Change Modifying NSCC's Correction Fees</DOCTITLE>



June 10, 1994.



Pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
 notice is hereby given that on June 1, 1994, the National Securities Clearing Corporation (``NSCC'') filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change (File No. SR-NSCC-94-08)
as described in Items I, II, and III below, which Items have been prepared by primarily NSCC. The Commission is publishing
this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule changes from interested persons. 





I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change



The proposed rule change modifies NSCC's fee structure as it relates to correction fees for the processing of municipal
securities transactions. The text of the rule change is set forth at Exhibit A. 



II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change




In its filing with the Commission, NSCC included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule
change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined
at the places specified in Item IV below. NSCC has prepared summaries, set forth in sections A, B, and C below, of the
most significant aspects of such statements.



A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change




The purpose of the rule change is to modify NSCC's fee structure as it relates to correction fees for the processing
of municipal securities transactions to reflect the fact that correction capabilities have been accelerated in
conformity with comparison capabilities. In August of 1993, NSCC accelerated the comparison processing for municipal
securities transactions to the date after trade date (``T+1''). Previously NSCC had charged participants for supplemental
input on or after T+2. Because correction processing can now be initiated on T+1, the NSCC fee structure is being modified
in order to charge participants for supplemental input on or after T+1. Although the acceleration of municipal bond
comparison occurred in August of 1993, this fee change will be effective for supplemental comparison processing
as of June 1, 1994.

The proposed rule change provides for the equitable allocation of dues, fees, and charges among participants. Therefore,
NSCC believes that it is consistent with the requirements of the Act, particularly section 17A(b)(3)(D) of the Act.



B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition 



NSCC believes that the proposed rule changes will not have any impact or impose a burden on competition.



C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants,
or Others



NSCC has neither solicited nor received any written comments.



III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action



The foregoing rule change has become effective pursuant to section 19(b)(3)(A)(ii) of the Act
 and subparagraph (e)(2) of Rule 19b-4 thereunder because it establishes a due, fee, or other charge imposed
by NSCC.
 At any time within sixty days of the filing of such rule change, the Commission may summarily abrogate such rule change
if it appears to the Commission that such action is necessary or appropriate in the public interest, for the protection
of investors, or otherwise in furtherance of the purposes of the Act.






IV. Solicitation of Comments



Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views, and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying in the Commission's Public
Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of such filing will also be available for inspection
and copying at the principal office of NSCC. All submissions should refer to File No. SR-NSCC-94-08
and should be submitted by July 8, 1994.




For the Commission by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

<DOCTITLE>American AAdvantage Funds, et al.; Notice of Application</DOCTITLE>



June 10, 1994.



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'').



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of application for exemption under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the ``Act'').







APPLICANTS: 

American AAdvantage Funds, and future portfolios thereof (the ``Trust''), and AMR Investment Services, Inc. (``AMR'').




RELEVANT ACT SECTIONS: 

Order requested under section 6(c) for an exemption from sections 18(f)(1), 18(g), and 18(i) of the Act.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY OF APPLICATION: 

Applicants seek an amendment to a prior order that permits applicants to issue two classes of shares representing
interests in the same portfolio of securities (the ``Prior Order'').
 The requested amendment would permit applicants to issue an unlimited number of classes of shares. Applicants request
that any relief granted pursuant to the application also apply to any future open-end management investment companies
that are advised by AMR or an entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control (within the meaning of section
2(a)(9) of the Act) with AMR and that issue and sell classes of shares on a basis identical in all material respects to
that described in the application.





</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The following is a summary of the application. The complete application may be obtained for a fee at the SEC's Public
Reference Branch.




APPLICANTS' REPRESENTATIONS: 

1. The Trust is registered under the Act as an open-end management investment company. The Trust currently offers
shares representing interests in seven investment portfolios (together with future investment portfolios, the
``Funds''); the American AAdvantage Money Market Fund, the American AAdvantage Municipal Money Market Fund; and
the American AAdvantage U.S. Treasury Money Market Fund (the ``Money Market Funds''); the American AAdvantage Balanced
Fund (the ``Balanced Fund''); the American AAdvantage Equity Fund (the ``Equity Fund''); the American AAdvantage
International Equity Fund (the ``International Equity Fund''); and the American AAdvantage Limited-Term Income
Fund (the ``Limited-Term Income Fund'' and, collectively with the Balanced Fund, the Equity Fund, and International
Equity Fund, the ``Non-Money Market Funds'').



2. AMR is the manager of each Fund, the sole investment adviser of the Money Market Funds, and the sole active investment
adviser to the Limited-Term Income Fund. AMR is a wholly-owned subsidiary of AMR Corporation, the parent company
of American Airlines, Inc. The assets of each of the Non-Money Market Funds, other than the Limited-Term Income Fund,
are allocated by AMR among certain investment advisers designated for each Fund.

3. Applicants seek to amend the Prior Order to permit the Funds to offer an unlimited number of classes of shares in their
existing and future investment portfolios. These new classes will be offered (a) in connection with a plan adopted
pursuant to rule 12b-1 under the Act (a ``Distribution Plan''), (b) in connection with a non-rule 12b-1
shareholder services plan (a ``Shareholder Services Plan''), (c) in connection with the allocation of certain expenses,
as described below, that are directly attributable only to certain classes, and/or (d) without any Distribution
Plan or Shareholder Services Plan. The Distribution Plan and the Shareholder Services Plan are sometimes collectively
referred to as the ``Plans.''

4. Shares of the Funds presently are offered with no front-end sales charge. Pursuant to the terms of the Prior Order,
the Money Market Funds currently offer and sell two classes of shares designated as Mileage Class shares and Institutional
Class shares. Mileage Class shares are presently offered and sold only to natural persons and certain grantor trusts.
Institutional Class shares of the Money Market Funds and shares of the Non-Money Market Funds are presently offered
and sold primarily to institutions.

5. Shares of each existing Fund are distributed directly by the Trust. In the future, some or all classes of the Funds
may be distributed through one or more principal underwriters. Under the current self-distribution arrangement,
distribution activities are carried out primarily by officers of the Trust. The Mileage Class of each of the Money
Market Funds has adopted a rule 12b-1 plan, which provides that each Mileage Class will pay .25% of its average
daily net assets to AMR as compensation for distribution services.

6. Currently, each shareholder of the Non-Money Market Funds is required to enter into a shareholder services agreement
with AMR (a ``Shareholder Services Agreement''). Under this agreement, AMR provides or oversees on behalf of the
shareholder's account certain administrative and management services (other than investment advisory and portfolio
allocation services) for which each shareholder (and not the Fund) pays an annualized fee directly to AMR. This fee
currently equals 0.30% of a shareholder's assets invested in each Fund.

7. If applicants' proposed multiple class distribution system (``Multiple Class System'') is approved by the SEC,
and subject to shareholder approval, the Non-Money Market Funds will no longer have Shareholder Services Agreements.
After implementation of the Multiple Class System, the Non-Money Market Funds will have internalized fees as described
below. Certain classes of the Funds, however, may establish an externalized account maintenance fee for low balance
accounts. It is presently expected that any account maintenance fee charged will not exceed an annual fee of approximately
$25. The fee will be a direct charge against the shares held in the account and will be collected by redeeming a sufficient
number of full and/or fractional shares.

8. With respect to each new class of shares created, the Funds could enter into a Distribution Plan agreement and/or
a Shareholder Services Plan agreement with AMR and/or other groups, organizations or institutions (``Organizations'')
concerning the provision of certain services to shareholders of a particular class.

9. Because many of the services contemplated under a Distribution Plan will be distribution related, such Plan will
be adopted pursuant to rule 12b-1 under the Act. A Shareholder Services Plan will be adopted and operated in accordance
with the procedures set forth in rule 12b-1 (b) through (f) as if the expenditures made thereunder were subject
to rule 12b-1, although the shares offered in connection with such a Plan need not be accorded the voting rights
specified in rule 12b-1. Under a Shareholder Services Plan, fees will be paid by a Fund to one or more Organizations
for shareholder services provided with respect to the shares. Organizations may charge other fees directly to class
shareholders who are the beneficial owners of shares in connection with class shareholder accounts.

10. With respect to each new class, a Fund could pay an Organization either directly or indirectly pursuant to a Distribution
Plan or Shareholder Services Plan for its services and assistance in accordance with the terms of its particular Plan
agreement (``Plan Payments'') and the expense of such payments will be borne entirely by the beneficial owners of
the class of the Fund to which each Plan agreement relates. Plan Payments paid to an Organization pursuant to a Distribution
Plan agreement currently are not expected to exceed .75% of the average daily net asset value of the shares of the class
subject to that particular Distribution Plan agreement. Similarly, Plan Payments paid to an Organization pursuant
to a Shareholder Services Plan agreement are currently not expected to exceed .30% of the average daily net value of
the shares of the class subject to that particular Shareholder Services Plan agreement.

11. If any class of a Fund's shares are distributed by a member of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.
(``NASD''), with respect to each class of shares such Fund shall comply with Article III, section 26 of the Rules of
Fair Practice of the NASD as it relates to the maximum amount of asset-based sales charges that may be imposed by an investment
company.
12. Applicants anticipate that shares of one new class will be offered to tax-exempt employee benefit and retirement
plans of AMR Corporation and its affiliates (the ``AMR Class''). Other new classes, as well as the existing Institutional
Class and Mileage Class, will be offered to institutional investors (other than such benefit plans) and to natural
persons (the ``Unaffiliated Classes''). The offerees of AMR Class shares, on the one hand, and of the Unaffiliated
Classes, on the other hand, will not overlap. Offerees of the AMR Class shares will consist of tax-exempt employee
benefit and retirement plans of AMR Corporation and its affiliates for the benefit of employees, under which the assets
are held in trust by a trustee and employees have limited pre-retirement access to the assets. Applicants propose
to describe, in a separate prospectus, the expenses, performance data and net asset value of the AMR Class shares only
to investors eligible to purchase AMR Class shares and not to investors eligible to purchase shares of the Unaffiliated
Classes. Only those limited ``inside'' investors described above will be eligible to purchase AMR Class shares.
Persons to whom the Unaffiliated Classes will be offered will be ineligible to purchase AMR Class shares since such
investors do not fall within the scope of AMR Class offerees as defined above.
13. In addition, because shares of each class will be marketed to different types of investors, the method of soliciting
sales of such shares will vary. A separate prospectus will be used to offer AMR Class shares and will be tailored to the
needs of such investors regarding purchase procedures and cost information.
14. The shares in different classes within a Fund might have different exchange privileges. Any exchange privilege
connected to any of the Funds' shares will be limited to exchanges among Funds that are part of the same ``group of investment
companies,'' as defined in rule 11a-3 under the Act. All exchanges will be conducted in accordance with the provisions
of rule 11a-3. In addition, applicants anticipate that shares of each Fund will be exchangeable for shares of
other classes within the same Fund to the extent that the shareholder will have been eligible to purchase the shares
acquired in the exchange.
15. The expenses of the Trust that cannot be attributed directly to any one Fund (``Trust Expenses'') generally will
be allocated to each Fund based on the relative net assets of those Funds. Certain expenses that may be attributable
to a particular Fund, but not a particular class (``Fund Expenses'') will be allocated to each class based on the daily
net assets of the class. Finally, certain expenses may be attributable to a particular class of shares of a Fund (``Class
Expenses''). Class Expenses will be charged directly to the net assets of the particular class and thus will be borne
on a 

pro rata

 basis by the outstanding shares of such class.
16. Class Expenses may include: (a) Plan Payments relating to a class of shares, (b) transfer agent fees identified
as being attributable to a specific class of shares, (c) stationery, printing, postage, and delivery expenses related
to preparing and distributing materials such as shareholder reports, prospectuses, and proxy statements to current
shareholders of a specific class, (d) Blue Sky registration fees incurred by a class of shares, (e) SEC registration
fees incurred by a class of shares, (f) expenses of Administrative Services Agreements and other administrative
personnel and services as required to support the shareholders of a specific class, (g) trustees' fees or expenses
incurred as a result of issues relating to one class of shares, (h) accounting expenses relating solely to one class
of shares, (i) auditors' fees, litigation expenses, and legal fees and expenses relating to a class of shares, and
(j) expenses incurred in connection with shareholders meetings as a result of issues relating to one class of shares.
Any other expense will be allocated as a Class Expense only if such allocation is approved by a further SEC exemptive
order.
17. AMR may choose to waive or reimburse Class Expenses on certain classes of the Fund on a voluntary, temporary basis.
Class Expenses are by their nature specific to a given class and obviously expected to vary from one class to another.
Applicants believe that it is acceptable and consistent with shareholder expectations to reimburse or waive Class
Expenses at different levels for different classes of the same Fund.
18. In addition, AMR may waive or reimburse Trust Expenses and/or Fund Expenses (with or without a waiver or reimbursement
of Class Expenses), but only if the same proportionate amount of Trust Expenses and/or Fund Expenses are waived or
reimbursed for each class of a Fund. Thus, any Trust Expenses that are waived or reimbursed will be credited to each
class of a Fund according to the relative net assets of the classes. Similarly, any Fund Expenses that are waived or
reimbursed will be credited to each class of that Fund according to the relative net assets of the classes. Trust Expenses
and Fund Expenses apply equally to all classes of a given Fund. Accordingly, it may not be appropriate to waive or reimburse
Trust Expenses or Fund Expenses at different levels for different classes of the same Fund.


Applicants' Legal Analysis


1. Applicants request an amendment to the Prior Order exempting them from the provisions of sections 18(f)(1), 18(g),
and 18(i) of the Act to the extent that the proposed issuance and sale of an unlimited number of classes of shares representing
interests in the same Funds might be deemed to (a) result in a ``senior security'' within the meaning of section 18(g)
and thus be prohibited by section 18(f)(1), and (b) violate the equal voting provisions of section 18(i).

2. The proposed Multi-Class Arrangement does not involve borrowings and does not affect the Funds' existing assets
or reserves. In addition, the proposed arrangement will not increase the speculative character of the shares in a
Fund, since all shares will participate in all of a Fund's appreciation, income, and expenses in the manner described
above.

3. Applicants believe that the proposed allocation of expenses and voting rights under the Multi-Class System is
equitable and will not discriminate against any group of shareholders. Investors purchasing shares offered in connection
with a Plan and/or bearing Class Expenses will bear the costs associated with the related services and have exclusive
shareholder voting rights with respect to matters affecting the applicable Plan. Conversely, investors purchasing
shares that are not covered by a plan or not bearing Class Expenses will not be burdened with such expenses or enjoy such
voting rights.





4. Accordingly, applicants assert that the requested amendment is appropriate in the public interest and is consistent
with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the Act.




Applicants' Conditions





Applicants agree that the amended order granting the requested relief shall be subject to the following conditions:



1. Each class of shares of a Fund will represent interests in the same portfolio of investments, and be identical in
all respects, except as set forth below. The only differences between the classes of shares of a Fund will relate solely
to one or more of the following: (a) Expenses assessed to a class pursuant to a Plan, if any, with respect to such class;
(b) the impact of Class Expenses, which are limited to any or all of the following: (i) Transfer agent fees identified
as being attributable to a specific class of shares, (ii) stationery, printing, postage, and delivery expenses related
to preparing and distributing materials such as shareholder reports, prospectuses, and proxy statements to current
shareholders of a specific class, (iii) Blue Sky registration fees incurred by a class of shares, (iv) SEC registration
fees incurred by a class of shares, (v) expenses of Administrative Services Agreements and other administrative
personnel and services as required to support the shareholders of a specific class, (vi) Trustees' fees or expenses
incurred as a result of issues relating to one class of shares, (vii) accounting expenses relating solely to one class
of shares, (viii) auditors' fees, litigation expenses, and legal fees and expenses relating to a class of shares,
and (ix) expenses incurred in connection with shareholders meetings as a result of issues relating to one class of
shares; (c) the fact that the classes will vote separately with respect to matters relating to the Fund's Distribution
Plan, if any, or any other matters appropriately limited to such class(es); (d) the different exchange privileges
of the class of shares, if any; and (e) the designation of each class of shares of a Fund. Any additional incremental
expenses not specifically identified above that are subsequently identified and determined to be properly applied
to one class of shares shall not be so applied unless and until approved by the SEC.




2. The Board of Trustees (the ``Board''), including a majority of the Trustees who are not interested persons of the
Trust (``Independent Trustees'') will have approved the Multiple Class System with respect to a particular Fund
prior to the implementation of the system by that Fund. The minutes of the meetings of the Board of the Trust regarding
the deliberations of the Trustees with respect to the approvals necessary to implement the Multiple Class System
will reflect in detail the reasons for the determination by the Board that the proposed Multiple Class System is in
the best interests of each Fund and its shareholders.




3. The initial determination of the Class Expenses that will be allocated to a particular class and any subsequent
changes thereto will be reviewed and approved by a vote of the Board of Trustees of the Trust, including a majority of
the Independent Trustees. Any person authorized to direct the allocation and disposition of monies paid or payable
by a Fund to meet Class Expenses shall provide the Board and the Trustees shall review, at least quarterly, a written
report of the amounts so expended and the purposes for which such expenditures were made.



4. If any class is subject to a Shareholder Services Plan, the Plan will be adopted and operated in accordance with the
procedures set forth in rule 12b-1 (b) through (f) as if the expenditure made thereunder were subject to rule
12b-1, except that shareholders need not enjoy the voting rights specified in rule 12b-1.



5. On an ongoing basis, the Board of the Trust, pursuant to its fiduciary responsibilities under the Act and otherwise,
will monitor each Fund, as applicable, for the existence of any material conflicts among the interests of the classes
of its shares, if there is more than one class. The Board, including a majority of the Independent Trustees, shall take
such actions as is reasonably necessary to eliminate any such conflicts that may develop. AMR and each Fund's manager
investment adviser(s) and distributor, if any, will be responsible for reporting any potential or existing conflicts
to the Board. If such a conflict arises, AMR, and the investment adviser(s) and distributor, if any, at their own expense,
will take such actions as are necessary to remedy such conflict, including establishing a new registered management
investment company, if necessary.

6. The Board of each Fund will receive quarterly and annual statements concerning the amounts expended under the Plans
complying with paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of rule 12b-1, as it may be amended from time to time. In the statements,
only expenditures properly attributable to the sale or servicing of a particular class of shares will be used to justify
any fee for services charged to that class. Expenditures not related to the sale or servicing of a particular class
will not be presented to the Board to justify any fee attributable to that class. The statements, including the allocations
upon which they are based, will be subject to the review and approval of the Independent Trustees in the exercise of
their fiduciary duties.

7. Dividends and other distributions paid by a Fund with respect to each class of its shares, to the extent any dividends
and other distributions are paid, will be declared and paid on the same day and at the same time, and will be determined
in the same manner and will be in the same amount, except that the amount of the dividends and other distributions declared
and paid by a particular class may be different from that of another class because Plan Payments made by a class under
a Plan and other Class Expenses will be borne exclusively by that class.

8. The methodology and procedures for calculating the net asset value and dividends and other distributions of the
classes and the proper allocation of expenses among the classes have been reviewed by an expert (the ``Expert'') who
has rendered a report to the Board of the Trust, which has been provided to the staff of the SEC, stating that such methodology
and procedures are adequate to ensure that such calculations and allocations would be made in an appropriate manner.
On an ongoing basis, the Expert, or an appropriate substitute Expert, will monitor the manner in which the calculations
and allocations are being made and, based upon such review, will render at least annually a report to the Funds that
the calculations and allocations are being made properly. The reports of the Expert will be filed as part of the periodic
reports filed with the SEC pursuant to sections 30(a) and 30(b)(1) of the Act. The work papers of the Expert with respect
to such reports, following request by the Funds which the Funds agree to make, will be available for inspection by the
SEC staff upon written request to the Funds for such work papers by a senior member of the Division of Investment Management
or a Regional office of the SEC, limited to the Director, an Associate Director, the Chief Accountant, the Chief Financial
Analyst, Assistant Director, and any Regional Administrators or Associate or Assistant Administrators. The initial
report of the Expert is a ``Special Purpose'' report on ``policies and procedures placed in operation'' in accordance
with Statements on Auditing Standards (``SAS'') No. 70, ``Reports on the Processing of Transactions by Service Organizations''
of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (``AICPA''). Ongoing reports will be reports on ``policies
and procedures placed in operation and tests of operating effectiveness'' prepared in accordance with SAS No. 70
of the AICPA, as it may be amended from time to time, or in similar auditing standards as may be adopted by the AICPA from
time to time.

9. Applicants have adequate facilities in place to ensure implementation of the methodology and procedures for calculating
the net asset value and dividends and other distributions of the classes of shares and the proper allocation of expenses
among the classes of shares and this representation has been concurred with by the Expert in the initial report referred
to in condition 8 above and will be concurred with by the Expert, or an appropriate substitute Expert, on an ongoing
basis at least annually in the ongoing reports referred to in condition 8 above. Applicants will take immediate corrective
action if the Expert or appropriate substitute Expert, does not so concur in the ongoing reports.

10. If any class of shares is distributed by a principal underwriter, the prospectus of such Fund will contain a statement
to the effect that a salesperson and any other person entitled to receive compensation for selling or servicing shares
of a Fund may receive different compensation with respect to one particular class of shares over another in the Fund.

11. If any class of shares is distributed by a principal underwriter, the Trust will adopt compliance standards as
to when each class of shares may appropriately be sold to particular investors. Applicants will require all persons
selling shares of a Fund to agree to conform to such standards.

12. The conditions pursuant to which the amended exemptive order is granted and the duties and responsibilities of
the Board of the Trust with respect to the Multiple Class System will be set forth in guidelines which will be furnished
to the Trustees.

13. Each Fund will disclose the respective expenses, performance data, distribution arrangements, services, fees,
sales loads, and exchange privileges applicable to each class of shares, other than AMR Class shares, in every prospectus,
regardless of whether all classes of shares are offered through each prospectus. AMR Class shares will be offered
solely pursuant to a separate prospectus. The prospectus for the AMR class shares will disclose the existence of the
Funds' other classes, and the prospectus for the Funds' other classes will disclose the existence of the AMR Class
shares and will identify the investors eligible to purchase AMR Class shares. Each Fund will disclose the respective
expenses and performance data applicable to all classes of shares in every shareholder report. The shareholder reports
will contain, in the statement of assets and liabilities and statement of operations, information related to the
Fund as a whole generally and not on a per class basis. Each Fund's per share data, however, will be prepared on a per class
basis with respect to all classes of shares of such Fund. To the extent any advertisement or sales literature describes
the expenses or performance data applicable to any class of shares, it will also disclose the respective expenses
and/or performance data applicable to all classes of shares, except AMR Class shares. Advertising materials reflecting
the expenses or performance data for AMR Class shares will be available only to those persons eligible to purchase
such shares. The information provided by applicants for publication in any newspaper or similar listing of a Fund's
net asset value and public offering price will present each class of shares separately. The Funds need not provide
such information with respect to the AMR Class shares; however, to the extent that a Fund chooses to do so, the net asset
value or public offering price of AMR Class shares also will be presented separately.

14. Applicants acknowledge that the grant of the amended exemptive order requested by this application will not imply
SEC approval of, authorization of, or acquiescence in any particular level of payments that any Fund may make pursuant
to a Plan in reliance on the amended exemptive order.

<DOCTITLE>Issuer Delisting; Notice of Application to Withdraw from Listing and Registration; (EastGroup Properties, Shares
of Beneficial Interest, $1.00 Par Value) File No. 1-7094</DOCTITLE>



June 10, 1994.



EastGroup Properties (``Company'') has filed an application with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission''),
pursuant to section 12(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'') and Rule 12d2-2(d) promulgated thereunder,
to withdraw the above specified security from listing and registration on the American Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Amex'').

The reasons alleged in the application for withdrawing these securities from listing and registration include the
following:

According to the Company, in addition to being listed on the Amex, its Shares of Beneficial Interest are listed on the
New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (``NYSE''). The Company's Shares of Beneficial Interest commenced trading on the NYSE
at the opening of business on May 3, 1994, and concurrently therewith such securities were suspended from trading
on the Amex.

In making the decision to withdraw its Share of Beneficial Interest from listing on the Amex, the Company considered
the direct and indirect costs and expenses attendant on maintaining the dual listing of its Shares of Beneficial Interest
on the NYSE and on the Amex. The Company does not see any particular advantage in the dual trading of its Shares of Beneficial
Interest and believes that dual listing would fragment the market for its Shares of Beneficial Interest.

Any interested person may, on or before July 1, 1994 submit by letter to the Secretary of the Securities and Exchange
Commission, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549, facts bearing upon whether the application has been made
in accordance with the rules of the exchanges and what terms, if any, should be imposed by the Commission for the protection
of investors. The Commission, based on the information submitted to it, will issue an order granting the application
after the date mentioned above, unless the Commission determines to order a hearing on the matter.




For the commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

<DOCTITLE>MIMLIC Asset Allocation Fund, Inc., et al.; Notice of Application</DOCTITLE>



June 10, 1994.



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'').



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of application for exemption under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the ``Act'').







APPLICANTS: 

MIMLIC Asset Allocation Fund, Inc., MIMLIC Fixed Income Securities Fund, Inc., MIMLIC Investors Fund I, Inc., MIMLIC
Mortgage Securities Income Fund, Inc., MIMLIC Money Market Fund, Inc. (collectively, the ``Applicant Funds''),
MIMLIC Asset Management Company (the ``Adviser''), and MIMLIC Sales Corporation (the ``Distributor''). Applicants
also seek relief on behalf of registered, open-end management investment companies (collectively, with the Applicant
Funds, the ``Funds'') for which the Adviser, or any person controlled by or under common control with the Adviser,
hereafter may serve as investment adviser, or for which the Distributor, or any person controlled by or under common
control with the Distributor, hereafter may serve as distributor of such Fund's shares.




RELEVANT ACT SECTIONS: 

Exemption requested under section 6(c) from sections 2(a) (32), 2(a) (35), 18(f), 18(g), 18(i), 22(c), and 22(d)
of the Act, and rule 22c-1 thereunder.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY OF APPLICATION: 

Applicants seek a conditional order to permit the Funds to create multiple classes of shares and to assess and, under
certain circumstances, waive a contingent deferred sales charge (``CDSC'') upon the redemption of certain shares.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The following is a summary of the application. The complete application may be obtained for a fee at the SEC's Public
Reference Branch.




Applicants' Representations



1. Each Applicant Fund is a Minnesota corporation registered under the Act as an open-end management investment company.
Except for MIMLIC Money Market Fund, Inc.
 the Applicant Funds currently offer shares to the public at net asset value plus a front-end sales charge (``FESC'').
The shares currently also are subject to ongoing distribution and service fees pursuant to a plan adopted under rule
12b-1 (the ``Plan'').
 For shares of the Asset Allocation Fund, the Plan Fees currently are up to .35% of that Fund's average daily net assets;
for shares of each of the other Funds, the Plan Fees are up to .30% of each Fund's average daily net assets.

2. The Adviser, a registered investment adviser, serves as each Applicant Fund's investment adviser. The Distributor,
a registered broker-dealer, serves as principal underwriter of the shares of each Applicant Fund.

3. Applicants seek relief to permit the Funds to offer multiple classes of shares that would differ only as set forth
in condition 1 below. The additional classes may be subject to a FESC, a CDSC, a combination of both, or neither, and
also may be subject to Plan Fees. The Funds will not impose FESCs, CDSCs, or Plan Fees in excess of amounts permitted
by article III, section 26 of the Rules of Fair Practice of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (the
``NASD''), as they may be amended from time to time.

4. Under the requested order, the Applicant Funds' currently outstanding shares will be designated ``Class A'' shares.
Applicants contemplate selling a new class of shares (``Class B shares'') at net asset value without the imposition
of a FESC at the time of purchase. Under the applicable rule 12b-1 plan, Class B shareholders initially will pay
a shareholder services fee at an annual rate of up to .25%, and a distribution fee at an annual rate of up to .75%, of average
daily net assets attributable to Class B shares. The Class B shares would be subject to a CDSC, as further described
below. Class B shares would not be issued in connection with investments of $1,000,000 or more, but rather such investors
would be permitted to invest in Class A shares, which would not be subject to a CDSC.

5. Applicants contemplate that the Class B shares purchased by a shareholder automatically will convert to Class
A shares of the same Fund after a certain holding period. Class B shares acquired through the reinvestment of dividends
and distributions will be considered held in a separate sub-account. Each time any Class B shares purchased by a shareholder
converts to Class A shares, a 

pro rata 

share of the Class B shares in the sub-account also will convert to Class A shares. Applicants may suspend such conversion
if an expert's opinion or Internal Revenue Service ruling that such conversion does not constitute a taxable event
under Federal income tax law is not available. The conversion feature would benefit long-term Class B shareholders
by relieving them of most of the burden of distribution expenses after the Distributor has been compensated.

6. Each service rendered to a specific class of shares will augment or replace, and not be duplicative of, any other
service rendered to the class, or to the Fund. Expenses specific to a particular class of shares may be calculated and
charged to the respective class. All other expenses incurred by a Fund will be allocated between the various classes
based on the percentage of net assets of the class at the beginning of the day after adjusting for the prior day's capital
share activity. Because of the differing class expenses and Plan Fees, the net income attributable to and the dividends
payable on one class of shares of a Fund may be higher or lower than those of the other classes of shares of the same Fund.
To the extent that a Fund has undistributed net income, the net asset value of the various classes of shares of the Fund
may differ.

7. Applicants contemplate that any class of shares of a Fund may be exchanged for shares of the corresponding class
of other Funds. Exchanges also are permitted into money market Funds managed by the Adviser. All exchanges will comply
with rule 11a-3 under the Act.

8. Applicants also seek exemptive relief to permit the Funds to impose a CDSC on redemptions of Class B shares, and possibly
other future classes of shares. The period during which the CDSC will apply (the ``CDSC period'') and the CDSC percentage
will vary with the amount of the investment, and is expected to vary in the future depending on any Plan Fees, if any,
imposed by a Fund with respect to the shares subject to the CDSC. The CDSC only would be imposed on shares issued on or
after the date that the requested order is granted. In addition, any amendments to the CDSC will apply only when they
are reflected in an amended and supplemented prospectus, and no such amendments adversely would affect shares issued
prior to the effective date of such amendment.

9. The applicable CDSC will be calculated on the lesser of the net asset value at the time the shares were issued or redeemed.
No CDSC will be imposed on amounts representing capital appreciation, shares or amounts representing shares purchased
through the reinvestment of dividends or capital gains distributions, or shares held for longer than the CDSC period.
It will be assumed that redemptions will be made first of shares not subject to a CDSC in the order purchased, and then
of shares subject to a CDSC in the order purchased. If a shareholder owns more than one class of shares and does not specify
which shares are to be redeemed, shares not subject to a CDSC with the highest Plan Fees will be redeemed in full prior
to any redemptions of shares not subject to a CDSC with lower Plan Fees.

10. Applicants intend to waive the CDSC on redemptions of shares (a) resulting from the exercise of a Fund's right to
liquidate a shareholder's account whose aggregate net asset value is less than the effective minimum size set forth
in the Fund's then-current prospectus, and (b) in the event of the death or disability of a shareholder within the meaning
of section 72(m)(7) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, provided that the shareholder held the shares
at the time of death or initial determination of disability, and provided that the shareholder owned the shares as
an individual or as a joint tenant with the right of survivorship or as a tenant-in-common.

Applicants' Legal Analysis 



1. Applicants request an exemptive order to the extent that the proposed issuance and sale of various classes of shares
representing interests in the same Fund might be deemed: (a) To result in a ``senior security'' within the meaning
of section 18(g); (b) prohibited by section 18(f)(1); and (c) to violate the equal voting provisions of section 18(i).


2. Applicants believe that the proposed multi-class arrangement will better enable the Funds to meet the competitive
demands of today's financial services industry. Under the multi-class arrangement, an investor will be able to choose
the method of purchasing shares that is most beneficial given the amount of his or her purchase, the length of time the
investor expects to hold his or her shares, and other relevant circumstances. The proposed arrangement would permit
the Funds to facilitate both the distribution of their securities and provide investors with a broader choice as to
the method of purchasing shares without assuming excessive accounting and bookkeeping costs or unnecessary investment
risks. 

3. Applicants further believe that the proposed allocation of expenses and voting rights relating to the Plans in
the manner described in the application is equitable and would not discriminate against any group of shareholders.
In addition, such arrangements should not give rise to any conflicts of interest because the rights and privileges
of each class of shares are substantially identical. 

4. Applicants submit that the proposed multi-class arrangement does not present any concerns that section 18 was
designed to ameliorate. The multi-class arrangement does not involve borrowings, does not affect a Fund's existing
assets or reserves, and does not involve a complex capital structure. The multi-class arrangement will not increase
the speculative character of the shares of the Funds. No class of shares will have preference or priority over any other
class of shares in a Fund with respect to particular assets, and no class of shares will be protected by any reserve or
other account. 

5. Applicants submit that the requested exemption to permit the Funds to implement the proposed CDSC is appropriate
in the public interest, and is consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the
policy and provisions of the Act. The proposed CDSC arrangements will provide shareholders the option of having greater
investment dollars working for them from the time of their purchase than if a sales load had been imposed at such time.




Applicants' Conditions 



Applicants agree that any order granting the requested relief shall be subject to the following conditions: 

1. Each class of shares will represent interests in the same portfolio of investments of a Fund and be identical in all
respects, except as set forth below. The only differences among various classes of shares of the same Fund will relate
solely to: (a) The designation of each class of shares of the Fund; (b) expenses assessed to a class as a result of a Plan
providing for Plan Fees; (c) different expenses which the board of directors of a Fund may in the future determine to
allocate to a specific class, which will be limited to: (i) Transfer agency fees as identified by the transfer agent
as being attributable to a specific class; (ii) printing and postage expenses related to preparing and distributing
materials such as shareholder reports, prospectuses, and proxies to current shareholders; (iii) Blue Sky registration
fees incurred by a class of shares; (iv) SEC registration fees incurred by a class of shares; (v) the expenses of administrative
personnel and services as required to support the shareholders of a specific class; (vi) litigation or other legal
expenses relating solely to one class of shares; and (vii) directors' fees incurred as a result of issues relating
to one class of shares; (d) voting rights on matters exclusively affecting one class of shares (

e.g.

, the adoption, amendment, or termination of a Plan) in accordance with the procedures set forth in rule 12b-1,
except as provided in condition 15 below; (e) the different exchange privileges of the various classes of shares as
described in the prospectuses (and as more fully described in the statements of additional information) of the Funds;
and (f) classes that impose a Plan Fee may convert to another Class. Any additional incremental expenses not specifically
identified above that are subsequently identified and determined to be properly allocated to one class of shares
shall not be so allocated until approved by the SEC pursuant to an amended order. 

2. The directors of each of the Funds, including a majority of the independent directors, shall have approved the multi-class
distribution system prior to the implementation thereof by a particular Fund. The minutes of the meetings of the directors
of each of the Funds regarding the deliberations of the directors with respect to the approvals necessary to implement
the multi-class distribution system will reflect in detail the reasons for determining that the proposed multi-class
distribution system is in the best interest of both the Fund and its shareholders. 

3. The initial determination of the class expenses, if any, that will be allocated to a particular class of a Fund and
any subsequent changes thereto will be reviewed and approved by a vote of the directors of the affected Fund, including
a majority of the independent directors. Any person authorized to direct the allocation and disposition of monies
paid or payable by a Fund to meet class expenses shall provide to the directors, and the directors shall review, at least
quarterly, a written report of the amounts so expended and the purpose for which the expenditures were made.

4. On an ongoing basis, the directors of the Funds, pursuant to their fiduciary responsibilities under the Act and
otherwise, will monitor each Fund for the existence of any material conflicts among the interests of the various classes
of shares. The directors, including a majority of the independent directors, shall take such action as is reasonably
necessary to eliminate any such conflicts that may develop. The Adviser and the Distributor will be responsible for
reporting any potential or existing conflicts to the directors. If a conflict arises, the Adviser and the Distributor
at their own costs will remedy such conflict up to and including establishing a new registered management investment
company.
5. The directors of the Funds will receive quarterly and annual statements concerning distribution and shareholder
servicing expenditures complying with paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of rule 12b-1, as it may be amended from time to
time. In the statements, only expenditures properly attributable to the sale or servicing of a particular class of
shares will be used to justify any Plan Fee charged to that class. Expenditures not related to the sale or servicing
of a particular class will not be presented to the directors to justify any Plan Fee attributable to that class. The
statements, including the allocations upon which they are based, will be subject to the review and approval of the
independent directors in the exercise of their fiduciary duties.
6. Dividends paid by a Fund with respect to each class of shares, to the extent any dividends are paid, will be calculated
in the same manner, at the same time, on the same day, and will be in the same amount, except that fee payments made under
the Plan relating to a particular class will be borne exclusively by each such class and except that any class expenses
will be borne by the applicable class of shares.
7. The methodology and procedures for calculating the net asset value and dividends/distributions of the various
classes and the proper allocation of income and expenses among the various classes has been reviewed by an expert (the
``Expert''). The Expert has rendered a report, which has been provided to the staff of the SEC, stating that such methodology
and procedures are adequate to ensure that such calculations and allocations will be made in an appropriate manner.
On an ongoing basis, the Expert, or an appropriate substitute Expert, will monitor the manner in which the calculations
and allocations are being made and, based upon such review, they will render at least annually a report to the Funds
that the calculations and allocations are being made properly. The reports of the Expert shall be filed as part of the
periodic reports filed with the SEC pursuant to section 30(a) and 30(b)(1) of the Act. The work papers of the Expert
with respect to such reports, following request by the Funds which the Funds agree to make, will be available for inspection
by the SEC staff upon the written request for such work papers by a senior member of the Division of Investment Management
or of a Regional Office of the SEC, limited to the Director, an Associate Director, the Chief Accountant, the Chief
Financial Analyst, an Assistant Director, and any Regional Administrators or Associate and Assistant Administrators.
The initial report of the Expert is a ``report on policies and procedures placed in operation'' and the ongoing reports
will be ``reports on policies and procedures placed in operation and tests of operating effectiveness'' as defined
and described in SAS No. 70 of the AICPA, as it may be amended from time to time, or in similar auditing standards as may
be adopted by the AICPA from time to time.

8. Applicants have adequate facilities in place to ensure implementation of the methodology and procedures for calculating
the net asset value and dividends/distributions among the various classes of shares and the proper allocation of
income and expenses among such classes of shares and this representation has been concurred with by the Expert in its
initial report referred to in condition 7 above and will be concurred with by the Expert, or an appropriate substitute
Expert, on an ongoing basis at least annually in the ongoing reports referred to in condition 7 above. Applicants agree
to take immediate corrective action if the Expert, or an appropriate substitute Expert, does not so concur in the ongoing
reports.

9. The prospectuses of the Funds will contain a statement to the effect that a salesperson and any other person entitled
to receive compensation for selling or servicing Fund shares may receive different levels of compensation for selling
one particular class of shares over another in a Fund.

10. The Distributor will adopt compliance standards as to when shares of a particular class may appropriately be sold
to particular investors. Applicants will require all persons selling shares of the Funds to agree to conform to these
standards.

11. The conditions pursuant to which the exemptive order is granted and the duties and responsibilities of the directors
of the Funds with respect to the multi-class distribution system will be set forth in guidelines which will be furnished
to the directors.

12. Each Fund prospectus (regardless of whether all classes of shares of such Fund are offered through such prospectus)
will disclose the respective expenses, performance data, distribution arrangements, services, Plan Fees, FESC,
CDSC, exchange privileges, and conversion features applicable to each class of shares. The shareholder reports
of each Fund will disclose the respective expenses and performance data applicable to each class of shares in every
shareholder report. The shareholder reports will contain, in the statement of assets and liabilities and statement
of operations, information related to the Fund as a whole generally and not on a per class basis. Each Fund's per share
data, however, will be prepared on a per class basis with respect to all classes of shares of such Fund. To the extent
any advertisement or sales literature describes the expenses or performance data applicable to any class of shares,
it will disclose the expenses and/or performance data applicable to all classes. The information provided by applicants
for publication in any newspaper or similar listing of the Funds' net asset values and public offering prices will
separately present each class of shares.

13. Applicants acknowledge that the grant of the exemptive order requested by this application will not imply SEC
approval, authorization, or acquiescence in any particular level of payments that the Funds may make pursuant to
any Plans in reliance on the exemptive order.

14. Any class of shares with a conversion feature (``Purchase Class'') will convert into another class (``Target
Class'') of shares on the basis of the relative net asset values of the two classes, without the imposition of any sales
load, fee, or other charge. After conversion, the converted shares will be subject to an asset-based sales charge
and/or service fee (as those terms are defined in article III, section 26 of the NASD's Rules of Fair Practice), if any,
that in the aggregate are lower than the asset-based sales charge and service fee to which they were subject prior to
the conversion.

15. If a Fund implements any amendment to its rule 12b-1 plan (or, if presented to shareholders, adopts or implements
any amendments of a non-rule 12b-1 shareholder services plan) that would increase materially the amount that
may be borne by the Target Class shares under the Plan, existing Purchase Class shares will stop converting into Target
Class unless the Purchase Class shareholders, voting separately as a class, approve the proposal. The directors
shall take such action as is necessary to ensure that existing Purchase Class shares are exchanged or converted into
a new class of shares (``New Target Class''), identical in all material respects to Target Class as it existed prior
to implementation of the proposal, no later than such shares previously were scheduled to convert into Target Class
shares. If deemed advisable by the directors to implement the foregoing, such action may include the exchange of all
existing Purchase Class shares for a new class (``New Purchase Class''), identical to existing Purchase Class shares
in all material respects except that New Purchase Class will convert into New Target Class. New Target Class or New
Purchase Class may be formed without further exemptive relief. Exchanges or conversions described in this condition
shall be effected in any manner that the directors reasonably believe will not be subject to federal taxation. In accordance
with condition 4, any additional cost associated with the creation, exchange, or conversion of New Target Class or
New Purchase Class shall be borne solely by the Adviser and the Distributor. Purchase Class shares sold after the implementation
of the proposal may convert into Target Class shares subject to the higher maximum payment, provided that the material
features of the Plan of the Target Class and the relationship of such Plan to the Purchase Class shares are disclosed
in an effective registration statement.

16. The shareholder services plan will be adopted and operated in accordance with the procedures set forth in rule
12b-1 (b) through (f) as if the expenditures made thereunder were subject to rule 12b-1, except that shareholders
need not enjoy the voting rights specified in rule 12b-1.

17. Applicants will comply with the provisions of proposed rule 6c-10 under the Act, Investment Company Act
Release No. 16619 (Nov. 2, 1988), as such rule is currently proposed and as it may be reproposed, adopted or amended.

American Electric Power Company Inc., et al. (70-7022)



American Electric Power Company, Inc. (``AEP''), a registered holding company, and AEP Generating Company (``Generating''),
an electric public utility subsidiary of AEP, both of 1 Riverside Plaza, Columbus, Ohio 43215, have filed a post-effective
amendment to their application-declaration filed under Sections 9(a), 10, 12(b) and 12(d) of the Act and Rules 44
and 45 thereunder.

By order dated August 17, 1984 (HCAR No. 23399), Generating acquired a 1/2 undivided interest in the Rockport Generating
Station (``Plant'') with Indiana & Michigan Electric Company, now Indiana Michigan Power Company (``I&M''),
also a subsidiary of AEP, including responsibility for 50% of the costs associated with acquiring certain air and
water pollution control devices (``Project'').

By order dated October 4, 1984 (HCAR No. 23445) (``October 1984 Order''), Generating was authorized to enter into
an Agreement of Sale (``Agreement'') with the City of Rockport, Indiana (``City'') providing for the construction
and installation of the Project by the City, and the issuance by the City of pollution control revenue bonds (``Series
1984 A bonds'') to finance Generating's share of the Project. The October 1984 Order authorized the issuance of the
Series 1984 A Bonds in a principal amount of $150 million. In addition, the October 1984 Order reserved jurisdiction
``with respect to the fees and commissions to be incurred by [Generating] and AEP in connection with this transaction,
and the terms of sale under the Agreement.''

By order dated September 6, 1985 (HCAR No. 23821) (``1985 Order''), Generating was authorized to enter into a First
Amendment to Agreement of Sale (``1985 Agreement'') with the City providing for the issuance and sale of three additional
series of pollution control bonds (collectively, ``Series 1985 Bonds''), each in the principal amount of $55 million
with a maturity of September 1, 2014. One series of the Series 1985 Bonds was issued with a variable interest rate (``Variable
Rate Bonds'') the rate of which was based upon an index and not to exceed 12% per annum, determined weekly and payable
monthly. A second series of the Series 1985 Bonds was issued with the interest payable semi-annually at a rate which
will be adjusted every five years based upon an index (``Adjustable Bonds''). A third series of the Series 1985 Bonds
was issued with the interest rate fixed at 93/8% per annum, payable semi-annually (``Fixed Rate Bonds''), and these
Fixed Rate Bonds were issued subject to optional redemption following an initial period not to exceed ten years. The
proceeds of the Series 1985 Bonds were used to cover a portion of the cost of construction of the Project and to refund
the outstanding short-term Series 1984 A Bonds in the principal amount of $150 million. The 1985 Order included no
reservation of jurisdiction.

AEP and Generating now propose that Generating entire into an agreement with the City whereby the City will issue and
sell up to $55 million of a series of refunding bonds (``Refunding Bonds'') the net proceeds from the sale of which will
be used to provide for the payment of principal required for the refunding prior to their stated maturity of $55 million
principal amount of the Fixed Rate Bonds. The Refunding Bonds will be issued under and secured by the existing indenture
(``Indenture'') between the City and the Lincoln National Bank and Trust Company, as trustee (``Trustee'') and a
fifth supplemental indenture (``Fifth Supplemental Indenture'') to be execute pursuant to Commission authorization
under this post-effective amendment. Pursuant to the Indenture and the Fifth Supplemental Indenture, the proceeds
of the sale of the Refunding Fixed Rate Bonds will be deposited with the Trustee and applied by the Trustee, together
with other funds supplied by Generating, to the redemption of the Series 1985 A Bonds at a price of 102% of the principal
amount thereof.

It is stated that the Refunding Fixed Rate Bonds will bear interest semi-annually and mature at a date or dates not more
than 40 years from the date of their issuance. The Refunding Fixed Rate Bonds may be subject to mandatory or optional
redemption under circumstances and terms specified at the time of pricing, and, if it is deemed advisable, may also
include a sinking fund provision. In addition, the Refunding Fixed Rate Bonds may not, if it is deemed advisable, be
redeemable at the option of the City in whole or in part at any time for a period to be determined at the time of pricing
the Refunding Fixed Rate Bonds.

Generating has been advised that, depending on maturity and other factors, the annual interest rate on obligations,
interest on which is so excludable from gross income, historically has been, and can be expected at the time of issuance
of the Refunding Fixed Rate Bonds to be, 11/2% to 21/2% or more lower than the rates of obligations of like terms and comparable
quality, interest on which is fully subject to Federal income tax. In any event, on series or Refunding Fixed Rate Bonds
will be issued at rates in excess of those generally obtained at the time of pricing for sales of substantially similar
tax-exempt bonds (having the same maturity, issued by entities of comparable credit quality and having similar terms,
conditions and features). As of June 1, 1994, Generating anticipated that the interest rate for the Refunding Fixed
Rate Bonds would be 7.25% without any credit enhancement and 6.75% with bond insurance. 

Generating will not agree, without further Commission authorization, to the issuance of any Refunding Fixed Rate
Bond by the City (i) if the stated maturity of any such Bond shall be more than forth (40) years, (ii) if the rate of interest
to be borne by any such Bond shall exceed 8% per annum, (iii) if the discount from the initial public offering price of
any such Bond shall exceed 5% of the principal amount thereof, or (iv) if the initial public offering price shall be
less than 95% of the principal amount thereof. 


Generating also proposes to provide credit enhancement for the Refunding Bonds in the form of a letter of credit, surety
bond or bond insurance and pay any related fees. As a supplement or alternative to a letter of credit, surety bond or
bond insurance, AEP proposes to guarantee the Refunding Bonds. Any letter of credit would not exceed $55 million and
would be for a term ranging from one to five years and would be renewable. Drawings under the letter of credit would bear
interest at no more than 1% above the bank's prime rate. Generating may pay an annual fee which would not exceed 1.25%
of the face amount of the letter of credit.

<DOCTITLE>The Wright Managed Money Market Trust: Notice of Application For Deregistration June 10, 1994</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'').



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of Application for Deregistration under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (``Act'').







APPLICANT: 

The Wright Managed Money Market Trust.



RELEVANT ACT SECTION: 

Section 8(f).


</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY OF APPLICATION: 

Applicant requests an order declaring that it has ceased to be an investment company.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The following is a summary of the application. The complete application is available for a fee from the SEC's Public
Reference Branch.




Applicant's Representations




1. Applicant, a Massachusetts business trust, registered as an open-end, diversified management investment company
on August 12, 1981, by filing a notification of registration on Form N-8A pursuant to section 8(a) of the Act.
On the same date, applicant filed a registration statement on Form N-1A under the Securities Act of 1933 and pursuant
to section 8(b) of the Act. The registration statement was declared effective on March 12, 1982. Applicant's public
offering commenced soon thereafter.

2. On January 19, 1994, the board of trustees of applicant, including a majority of trustees who were not interested
persons of applicant, approved a plan of reorganization (the ``Plan''). The Plan provided that applicant would transfer
all its assets and stated liabilities to the Wright Managed U.S. Treasury Money Market Fund (``Treasury Fund''),
a series of The Wright Managed Income Trust (a Massachusetts business trust), in exchange for shares of Treasury Fund.
Pursuant to rule 17a-8, applicant's trustees determined that the sale of applicant's assets to Treasury Fund
was in the best interests of applicant's shareholders, and that the interests of the existing shareholders would
not be diluted as a result.








3. Preliminary copies of proxy materials to solicit shareholder approval of the reorganization were filed with the
SEC on January 28, 1994. Definitive proxy materials were distributed to applicant's shareholders of record as of
February 28, 1994, and filed with the SEC on March 10, 1994. At a meeting of shareholders of applicant held on March 28,
1994, applicant's shareholders approved the Plan.

4. On March 31, 1994, the reorganization was consummated. Applicant transferred all its assets to Treasury Fund in
exchange for shares of beneficial interest in Treasury Fund and the assumption by Treasury Fund of the stated liabilities
of applicant. The exchanges were made at net asset value determined as of the close of business on March 30, 1994. As
of such date, applicant had an aggregate net asset value of $16,978,270.79. Each of applicant's shareholders received
shares of Treasury Fund that represented the same aggregate net asset value as the shares of applicant owned by such
shareholder immediately before the reorganization.



5. Applicant and Treasury Fund assumed their own expenses in connection with the reorganization. Applicant incurred
legal, accounting, and printing and mailing expenses in the approximate amounts of $12,200, $2,500, and $1,300,
respectively. Treasury Fund incurred reorganization expenses for legal and accounting services of $12,200 and
$2,500, respectively.

6. As of the date of the application, applicant had no shareholders, assets, or liabilities. Applicant is not a party
to any litigation or administrative proceeding. Applicant is not presently engaged in, nor does it propose to engage
in, any business activities other than those necessary for the winding up of its affairs.

7. Applicant was terminated as a business trust under the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts as of May 20, 1994.

ACTION: 

Notice of Action Subject to Intergovernmental Review Under Executive Order 12372.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This notice provides for public awareness of SBA's intention to refund twenty-two existing Small Business Development
Centers (SBDCs) on October 1, 1994. Currently there are 56 SBDCs operating in the SBDC program. The following SBDCs
are intended to be refunded, subject to the availability of funds: Alabama, Alaska, Connecticut, Delaware, Iowa,
Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, New York, Ohio, Puerto Rico,
Dallas, Houston, Lubbock, San Antonio, Vermont, Virgin Islands, and West Virginia. This notice also provides a description
of the SBDC program by setting forth a condensed version of the program announcement which has been furnished to each
of the SBDCs to be refunded. This publication is being made to provide the State single points of contact, designated
pursuant to Executive Order 12372, and other interested State and local entities, the opportunity to comment on the
proposed refunding in accord with the Executive Order and SBA's regulations found at 13 CFR Part 135.

The State single points of contact and other interested State and local entities are expected to advise the relevant
SBDC of their comments regarding the proposed refunding in writing as soon as possible. The SBDC proposal cannot be
inconsistent with any area-wide plan providing assistance to small business, if there is one, which has been adopted
by an agency recognized by the State government as authorized to do so. Copies of such written comments should also
be furnished to Ms. Johnnie L. Albertson, Associate Administrator for SBDC Program, U.S. Small Business Administration,
409 Third Street, SW., Fifth Floor, Washington, DC 20416. Comments will be accepted by the relevant SBDC and SBA for
a period of 90 days from the date of publication of this notice. The relevant SBDC will make every effort to accommodate
these comments during the 90-day period. If the comments cannot be accommodated by the relevant SBDC, SBA will, prior
to refunding the SBDC, either attain accommodation of any comments or furnish an explanation of why accommodation
cannot be attained to the commentor prior to refunding the SBDC.



Description of the SBDC Program



The SBDC operates under the general management and oversight of SBA, but with recognition that a partnership exists
between the Agency and the SBDC for the delivery of assistance to the small business community. SBDC services shall
be provided pursuant to a negotiated Cooperative Agreement with full participation of both parties.

SBDCs operate on the basis of a state plan to provide assistance within a state or designated geographical area. The
initial plan must have the written approval of the Governor. As a condition to any financial award made to an applicant,
non-Federal funds must be provided from sources other than the Federal Government. SBDCs operate under the provisions
of P.L. 96-302, as amended by P.L. 98-395, a Notice of Award (Cooperative Agreement) issued by SBA, and
the provisions of this Program Announcement.



Purpose and Scope



The SBDC Program is designed to provide quality assistance to small businesses in order to promote growth, expansion,
innovation, increased productivity and management improvement. To accomplish these objectives, SBDCs link resources
of the Federal, State, and local governments with the resources of the educational system and the private sector to
meet the specialized and complex needs of the small business community. SBDCs also coordinate with other SBA programs
of business development and utilize the expertise of these affiliated resources to expand services and avoid duplication
of effort.



Program Objectives



The overall objective of the SBDC Program is to leverage Federal dollars and resources with those of the state, academic
community and private sector to:

(a) strengthen the small business community;

(b) contribute to the economic growth of the communities served;

(c) make assistance available to more small businesses than is now possible with present Federal resources;

(d) create a broader based delivery system to the small business community.



SBDC Program Organization



SBDCs are organized to provide maximum services to the local small business community. The lead SBDC receives financial
assistance from the SBA to operate a statewide SBDC Program. In states where more than one organization receives SBA
financial assistance to operate an SBDC, each lead SBDC is responsible for Program operations throughout a specific
regional area to be served by the SBDC. The lead SBDC is responsible for establishing a network of SBDC subcenters to
offer service coverage to the small business community. The SBDC network is managed and directed by a full-time Director.
SBDCs must ensure that at least 80 percent of Federal funds provided are used to provide services to small businesses.
To the extent possible, SBDCs provide services by enlisting volunteer and other low cost resources on a statewide
basis.

SBDC Services



The specific types of services to be offered are developed in coordination with the SBA district office which has jurisdiction
over a given SBDC. SBDCs emphasize the provision of indepth, high-quality assistance to small business owners or
prospective small business owners in complex areas that require specialized expertise. These areas may include,
but are not limited to: management, marketing, financing, accounting, strategic planning, regulation and taxation,
capital formation, procurement assistance, human resource management, production, operations, economic and
business data analysis, engineering, technology transfer, innovation and research, new product development,
product analysis, plant layout and design, agri-business, computer application, business law information, and
referral (any legal services beyond basic legal information, and referral require the endorsement of the State Bar
Association), exporting, office automation, site selection, or any other areas of assistance required to promote
small business growth, expansion, and productivity within the State. The SBDC shall also ensure that a full range
of business development and technical assistance services are made available to small businesses located in rural
areas.

The degree to which SBDC resources are directed towards specific areas of assistance is determined by local community
needs, SBA priorities and SBDC Program objectives and agreed upon by the SBA district office and the SBDC.

The SBDC must offer quality training to improve the skills and knowledge of existing and prospective small business
owners. As a general guideline, SBDCs should emphasize the provision of training in specialized areas other than
basic small business management subjects. SBDCs should also emphasize training designed to reach particular audiences
such as members of SBA priority and special emphasis groups.



SBDC Program Requirements



The SBDC is responsible to the SBA for ensuring that all programmatic and financial requirements imposed upon them
by statute or agreement are met. The SBDC must assure that quality assistance and training in management and technical
areas are provided to the State small business community through the State SBDC network. As a condition of this agreement,
the SBDC must perform, but not be limited to, the following activities:

(a) the SBDC ensures that services are provided as close as possible to small business population centers. This is
accomplished through the establishment of SBDC subcenters.

(b) the SBDC ensures that lists of local and regional private consultants are maintained at the lead SBDC and each SBDC
subcenter. The SBDC utilizes and provides compensation to qualified small business vendors such as private management
consultants, private consulting engineers, and private testing laboratories.

(c) the SBDC is responsible for the development and expansion of resources within the State, particularly the development
of new resources to assist small businesses that are not presently associated with the SBA district office.

(d) the SBDC ensures that working relationships and open communications exist within the financial and investment
communities, and with legal associations, private consultants, as well as small business groups and associations
to help address the needs of the small business community.

(e) the SBDC ensures that assistance is provided to SBA special emphasis groups throughout the SBDC network. This
assistance shall be provided to veterans, women, exporters, the handicapped, and minorities as well as any other
groups designated a priority by SBA. Services provided to special emphasis groups shall be performed as part of the
Cooperative Agreement.



Advance Understandings



The Lead SBDC and all SBDC subcenters shall operate on a forty (40) hour week basis, or during the normal business hours
of the State or Host Organization, throughout the calendar year.


The amount of time allowed the Lead SBDC and subcenters for staff vacations and holidays shall conform to the policy
of the Host organization.

 This notice announces a determination, under Notice 
89-61, that the list of taxable substances in section 
4672(a)(3) will be modified to include dimethyl 
terephthalate.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 


Background 


Under section 4672(a), an importer or exporter of any 
substance may request that the Secretary determine whether 
such substance should be listed as a taxable substance. The 
Secretary shall add such substance to the list of taxable 
substances in section 4672(a)(3) if the Secretary determines 
that taxable chemicals constitute more than 50 percent of the 
weight, or more than 50 percent of the value, of the 
materials used to produce such substance. This determination 
is to be made on the basis of the predominant method of 
production. Notice 89-61, 1989-1 C.B. 717, sets forth the 
rules relating to the determination process. 


Determination 


On June 10, 1994, the Secretary determined that dimethyl 
terephthalate should be added to the list of taxable 
substances in section 4672(a)(3), effective April 1, 1992. 
The rate of tax prescribed for dimethyl terephthalate, 
under section 4671(b)(3), is $3.23 per ton. This is based 
upon a conversion factor for xylene of 0.547 and a conversion 
factor for methane of 0.165. 
The petitioner is Cape Industries, a manufacturer and 
exporter of this substance. No material comments were 
received on this petition. The following information is the 
basis for the determination.

 

HTS number: 2917.37.00.00 
CAS number: 120-61-6 


Dimethyl terephthalate is derived from the taxable 
chemicals xylene and methane. Dimethyl terephthalate is a 
solid produced predominantly by oxidation of xylene followed 
by esterification with methanol. 
The stoichiometric material consumption formula for 
dimethyl terephthalate is:

 

C

Dimethyl terephthalate has been determined to be a taxable 
substance because a review of its stoichiometric material 
consumption formula shows that, based on the predominant 
method of production, taxable chemicals constitute 51.8 
percent by weight of the materials used in its production.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Background 
 


Under section 4672(a), an importer or exporter of any 
substance may request that the Secretary determine whether 
such substance should be listed as a taxable substance. The 
Secretary shall add such substance to the list of taxable 
substances in section 4672(a)(3) if the Secretary determines

rules relating to the determination process. 


Determination 
 


On June 10, 1994, the Secretary determined that glycerine 
and phenol should be added to the list of taxable substances 
in section 4672(a)(3), effective January 1, 1991. 
 
The rate of tax prescribed for glycerine, under section 
4671(b)(3), is $9.52 per ton. This is based upon a 
conversion factor for propylene of 0.67, a conversion factor 
for chlorine of 2.16, and a conversion factor for sodium 
hydroxide of 1.54. 
 
The rate of tax prescribed for phenol, under section 
4671(b)(3), is $6.33 per ton. This is based upon a 
conversion factor for benzene of 0.9 and a conversion factor 
for propylene of 0.4. 
 
The petitioner is Dow Chemical Company, a manufacturer and 
exporter of these substances. No material comments were 
received on these petitions. The following information is 
the basis for the determinations. 


Glycerine 


HTS number: 1520.90.00.00 
CAS number: 56-81-5

 
 

Glycerine is derived from the taxable chemicals propylene, 
chlorine, and sodium hydroxide. Glycerine is a liquid 
produced predominantly by the reaction of epichlorohydrin 
with an aqueous caustic carbonate solution, followed by the 
removal of water, sodium chloride, and other impurities by 
mechanical means, chemical extraction, and distillation. 
 
The stoichiometric material consumption formula for 
glycerine substance is: 



C

3

H

6

 (propylene) + 2 Cl

2

 (chlorine) + 2 NaOH (sodium 
hydroxide) + H

2

O (water) 

c

 C

3

H

8

O

3

 (glycerine) + 2 NaCl 
(sodium chloride) + 2 HCl (hydrogen chloride)

 
 

Glycerine has been determined to be a taxable substance 
because a review of its stoichiometric material consumption 
formula shows that, based on the predominant method of 
production, taxable chemicals constitute 93.5 percent by 
weight of the materials used in its production. 


Phenol 


HTS number: 2907.11.00.00 
CAS number: 108-95-2 


 

Phenol is derived from the taxable chemicals benzene and 
propylene. Phenol is a solid produced predominantly based on 
cumene peroxidation. 
 
The stoichiometric material consumption formula for phenol 
is: 



C

Phenol has been determined to be a taxable substance 
because a review of its stoichiometric material consumption 
formula shows that, based on the predominant method of 
production, taxable chemicals constitute 78.9 percent by weight of the materials used in its production.

 This notice announces determinations, under Notice 89-61, that the list of taxable substances in section 4672(a)(3)
will be modified to include tetrahydrofuran and 1,4 butanediol. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Background 
 


Under section 4672(a), an importer or exporter of any substance may request that the Secretary determine whether
such substance should be listed as a taxable substance. The Secretary shall add such substance to the list of taxable
substances in section 4672(a)(3) if the Secretary determines that taxable chemicals constitute more than 50 percent
of the weight, or more than 50 percent of the value, of the materials used to produce such substance. This determination
is to be made on the basis of the predominant method of production. Notice 89-61, 1989-1 C.B. 717, sets forth
the rules relating to the determination process. 


Determination 
 


On June 10, 1994, the Secretary determined that tetrahydrofuran and 1,4 butanediol should be added to the list of taxable
substances in section 4672(a)(3), effective October 1, 1994. However, if these substances are produced from acetylene
derived from coal they are not taxable substances. 
 
The rate of tax prescribed for tetrahydrofuran, under section 4671(b)(3), is $5.28 per ton unless it is produced from
acetylene derived from coal. This is based upon a conversion factor for acetylene of 0.40 and a conversion factor for
methane of 0.97. 
 
The rate of tax prescribed for 1,4 butanediol, under section 4671(b)(3), is $4.20 per ton unless it is produced from
acetylene derived from coal. This is based upon a conversion factor for methane of 0.77 and a conversion factor for
acetylene of 0.32. 
 
The petitioner is E. I. DuPont de Nemours and Company, a manufacturer and exporter of these substances. No material
comments were received on these petitions. The following information is the basis for the determinations. 


Tetrahyrofuran 


HTS number: 2932.11.00.00 
CAS number: 109-99-9 


 

Tetrahyrofuran is derived from the taxable chemicals methane and acetylene. Tetrahyrofuran is a liquid produced
predominantly by the reaction of acetylene (derived from methane in natural gas) with formaldehyde made by air oxidation
and dehydrogenation of methanol (derived from methane in natural gas) producing the intermediate butynediol which
is in turn reacted with hydrogen (derived from methane in natural gas) to produce 1,4 butanediol. The 1,4 butanediol
is ring closed using an acid catalyst to produce tetrahydrofuran. 
 
The stoichiometric material consumption formula for tetrahyrofuran is: 




C

2

H

2

 (acetylene) + 3 CH

4

 (methane) + 0.5 O

2

 (oxygen) + 2 H

2

O (water) 

c

 C

Tetrahyrofuran has been determined to be a taxable substance because a review of its stoichiometric material consumption
formula shows that, based on the predominant method of production, taxable chemicals constitute 58.7 percent by
weight of the materials used in its production. 


1,4 butanediol 


HTS number: 2905.39.10.00 
CAS number: 110-63-4 


 

1,4 butanediol is derived from the taxable chemicals methane and acetylene. 1,4 butanediol is a liquid produced predominantly
by the reaction of acetylene (derived from methane in natural gas) with formaldehyde made by air oxidation and dehydrogenation
of methanol (derived from methane in natural gas) producing the intermediate butynediol which is in turn reacted
with hydrogen (derived from methane in natural gas) to produce 1,4 butanediol. 
 
The stoichiometric material consumption formula for 1,4 butanediol is: 




3 CH

1,4 butanediol has been determined to be a taxable substance because a review of its stoichiometric material consumption
formula shows that, based on the predominant method of production, taxable chemicals constitute 51.3 percent by
weight of the materials used in its production.

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Department of Veterans Affairs is announcing the availability of funds for applications for assistance under
VA's Homeless Providers Grant and Per Diem program. This Notice contains information concerning the program, application
process and amount of funding available.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 This Notice announces the availability of funds for assistance under VA's Homeless Providers Grant and Per Diem program.
This is a new program authorized by Pub. L. 102-590, the Homeless Veterans Comprehensive Service Programs Act
of 1992. Funding was appropriated by the Department's appropriations act for fiscal year 1994 (Pub. L. 103-124,
approved October 28, 1993). Funding applied for under this Notice may be used for: (1) Expansion, remodeling or alteration
of existing buildings; (2) acquisition of buildings, and acquisition and rehabilitation of buildings; (3) new construction;
(4) procurement of vans; and (5) per diem payments, or in-kind assistance through VA in lieu of per diem payments, for
eligible applicants who established supportive housing or supportive services programs after November 10, 1992.
Applicants may apply for more than one type of assistance.



Applicants may not receive assistance to replace funds provided by any State or local government to assist homeless
persons. For existing projects, VA will fund only the portion of the project that will expand the program. A proposal
for an existing project that seeks to shift its focus by changing the population to be served or the precise mix of services
to be offered is not eligible for consideration. Not more than 25 percent of services available in projects funded
through this grant program may be provided to clients who are not receiving those services as veterans.



Authority.

 VA's Homeless Providers Grant and Per Diem Program is authorized by sections 3 and 4 of Public Law 102-590, the
Homeless Veterans Comprehensive Service Programs Act of 1992; 38 U.S.C. 7721 note. An interim final rule for the program,
38 CFR  17.700, was published in the

 Notice of Fund Availability for Fiscal Year 1994.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This notice announces HUD's funding for that portion of the Capital Improvement Loan component of the Flexible Subsidy
Program set aside for Fiscal Year 1994 to support approved plans of action under the Emergency Low-Income Housing
Preservation Act of 1987 (ELIHPA). This document includes information concerning the following:


(a) The purpose of the NOFA and information regarding eligibility, available amounts, and selection criteria;
(b) Application processing, including how to apply and how selections will be made; and
(c) A checklist of steps and exhibits involved in the application process.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:


Paperwork Reduction Statement


The Office of Management and Budget has approved the use of the Flexible Subsidy forms under OMB control number 2502-0395.


I. Purpose and Substantive Description


A. Statutory Background and Authority


Section 201 of the Housing and Community Development Amendments (HCDA) of 1978 created the Flexible Subsidy Program
to provide Operating Assistance to eligible projects experiencing financial difficulty. Operating Assistance
is provided in the form of a deferred loan and, in conjunction with other resources, is designed to restore or maintain
the physical and financial soundness of eligible projects. The 1983 amendments to section 201 of the HCDA expanded
the universe of eligible projects and clarified that a project need not have an FHA-insured mortgage to be eligible
for Flexible Subsidy assistance (e.g., a non-insured section 236 project is eligible).
The Housing and Community Development Act of 1987 amended section 201 of HCDA to create a new category of assistance
to be provided under the Flexible Subsidy Program for projects that needed capital improvements to achieve physical
soundness that cannot be funded from project reserve funds without jeopardizing other major repairs or replacements
that are reasonably expected to be required in the near future.
The 1987 amendments to the Flexible Subsidy statute (Sections 185 and 186 of the Housing and Community Development
Act of 1987) also recognized the need to coordinate assistance under the Flexible Subsidy Program with the initiative
to preserve low- and moderate-income housing, enacted in Title II of that Act. (In its comprehensive revision of the
1987 Act, Title VI of the 1990 Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act, at the new section 219, repeated
the listing of incentives the Secretary could agree to provide an owner as part of a plan of action to prevent prepayment
of a mortgage on a project serving low- and moderate-income tenants. A capital improvement loan was included as an
incentive to owners.)

<TEXT>
 

Section 405 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992, in addition to making other amendments, removed
the priority for ELIHPA-eligible projects and imposed certain exclusivity restrictions on Flexible Subsidy-assisted
and ELIHPA- and LIHPRHA-eligible projects. These provisions have been repealed by section 103(b) of the Multifamily
Housing Property Disposition Reform Act of 1994 (the 1994 Act).

Section 201(n)(1) of the HCDA, as amended by section 103(b)(3) of the 1994 Act, authorizes the Department to set aside
assistance for Capital Improvement Loans for projects that are eligible for incentives under ELIPHA. In addition,
under section 201(n)(1), the Department is authorized to make this assistance available on a noncompetitive basis.

This notice supports preservation efforts by announcing a set-aside of $20 million for Flexible Subsidy Capital
Improvement funding to insured projects that are eligible under ELIHPA to receive incentives in exchange for extending
the low- to moderate-income use of the projects under plans of action approved in accordance with 24 CFR part 248, subpart
C.



B. Allocation Amounts



The Flexible Subsidy Fund is comprised of excess rental receipts paid to HUD from owners of Section 236 projects, interest
earned on the fund, repayment of Operating Assistance loans made by the Department in past fiscal years, and amounts
appropriated by Congress, if any, to carry out the purposes of the Flexible Subsidy Program.

The Capital Improvement Loan portion of the program is required by statute (Section 201(j)(4)) to be funded at a minimum
level of $30 million or 40 percent of the amount in the Flexible Subsidy fund, whichever is less. This year, $30 million
is less than 40 percent of the fund, and therefore, is the amount designated for Capital Improvement Loans. Of the $30
million set aside for Capital Improvement funding, $20 million is available under this NOFA for preservation projects.
The remaining $10 million was made available under the Flexible Subsidy NOFA, published on January 13, 1994, at 59
FR 2270.



C. Eligibility.





1. Types of Projects. 

The following types of rental or cooperative housing are eligible for Capital Improvement Loans:

a. A project which meets the definition of ``eligible low-income housing'' as set forth at 24 CFR 248.201; 

and

b. Has received preliminary approval of a plan of action pursuant to 24 CFR 248.233 which provides for a sale to a nonprofit
or a limited equity cooperative.

2. Conditions. 

Flexible Subsidy assistance will be made available in accordance with Section 201 of the Housing and Community Development
Amendments (HCDA) of 1978, as amended by Section 103 of the Multifamily Housing Property Disposition Reform Act of
1994. Assistance can be provided only if the following conditions are determined to exist when a plan of action is approved:

a. The assistance is necessary, when considered with other resources available to the project; it will restore or
maintain the financial or physical soundness of the project; and it will preserve the low- and moderate-income character
of the project.

b. The owner has agreed to maintain the low- and moderate-income character of the project for a period at least equal
to the remaining term of the project mortgage.

c. The assistance will be less costly to the Federal Government over the useful life of the project than other reasonable
alternatives of preserving the occupancy character of the project.

d. The project is or can reasonably be made structurally sound, as determined in accordance with an on-site inspection.

e. All reasonable attempts have been made to take all appropriate actions and provide suitable housing for project
residents.

f. There is evidence of the existence of a feasible plan to involve the residents in project decisions.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940617-2-00206 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940617-2-00116 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

g. The project will be operated competently, as determined by HUD in a management review.

h. Project management is in accordance with any management improvement and operating plan approved by HUD for the
project.

i. The Affirmative Fair Housing Marketing plan meets applicable requirements.

j. The purchaser certifies that it will comply with all applicable equal opportunity statutes, including the provisions
of the Fair Housing Act, Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Executive Orders 11063, 11246 and 11375, Section 504
of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, the Age Discrimination Act of 1975, the Americans with Disabilities Act, Section
3 of the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968, and all regulations issued pursuant to these authorities.

k. The purchaser has funded the reserve for replacements account in accordance with HUD requirements, and yet the
reserve account (and any other project funds available to fund the reserve account) is insufficient to finance both
the capital improvements for which assistance is being requested and other capital improvements that are reasonably
expected to be required within the next 24 months.



D. Selection Criteria and Ranking Factors



Each application for a Capital Improvement Loan will be reviewed by the HUD Field Office having jurisdiction over
the project in question. Field Offices will recommend applications for funding to HUD Headquarters.

Under section 201(n)(1), as amended by section 103(b) of the 1994 Act, Capital Improvement Loans for ELIHPA projects
that are eligible for incentives may be made available on a noncompetitive basis. Submission and approval of the notices
of intent and plans of action are subject to the eligibility of the owner filing them.



E. Other Loan Terms and Conditions



Repair items eligible for funding as a Capital Improvement Loan include any major repair or replacement of building
components or other on-site improvements included in allowable costs when the project was built, (e.g., sewer laterals,
roof structures, ceilings, wall or floor structures, foundations, plumbing, heating, cooling, electrical systems
and major equipment), as well as any major repair or replacement of any short-lived building equipment or component
before the expiration of its useful life.

Improvements eligible for funding may also include limited supplements or enhancements to mechanical equipment,
to the extent they are needed for the health and safety of the residents (e.g., air conditioning, heating equipment,
and building sprinkler systems), where they do not exist; improvements necessary to comply with HUD's standards
in 24 CFR part 8 for accessibility to individuals with handicaps; and cost effective energy efficiency improvements.
Improvements eligible for funding as a Capital Improvement Loan do not include maintenance of any building components
or equipment.

Capital Improvement assistance may be provided in the form of an amortizing loan. The interest rate on the loan may
not be less than three (3) percent (unless HUD determines that a lower rate is necessary to maintain rental rates, in
accordance with Chapter 12 of HUD Handbook 4350.6, Processing Plans of Action Under the Low-Income Housing Preservation
and Resident Homeownership Act of 1990 and Form HUD-90010, Owner's Calculation of Tenant Rent Phase-In Due
to POA approval, but in no case less than one percent) nor more than six (6) percent. The rate is determined taking into
consideration the project's ability to absorb the rent increase and the percentage of the tenants receiving rental
assistance. Interest on the Capital Improvement Loan starts to accrue and the loan amortization period begins immediately
upon disbursement of loan proceeds.

A Capital Improvement Loan to a nonprofit organization may be in the form of a deferred note with a term coincident with
the expiration of the project's insured mortgage note, accruing interest at a rate of one (1) percent. The deferred
note will become due and payable upon a sale or refinancing of the project or at the expiration of the insured mortgage
note.



II. Application and Funding Award Process



A. Obtaining and Preparing Applications



Applicants may obtain application packages from the local HUD Field Office.

An application must reflect the improvements required as a condition of approval of the plan of action. In addition,
all other deficiencies, which are to be corrected with funds from sources other than Flexible Subsidy, must be identified
on the work write-up and cost estimate and Management Improvement and Operation (MIO) plan Part II (Forms HUD-9835,
HUD-9835-A, and HUD-9835-B) as if Flexible Subsidy were being requested.



B. Submitting Applications



Complete applications for a Flexible Subsidy Capital Improvement Loan pursuant to plans of action receiving preliminary
approval under ELIHPA must be received in the HUD field office not more than 30 days following the issuance of preliminary
approval. Timeliness of submission will allow the Department to review the application within the 30-day mandatory
review period and in time to issue final approval of the plan of action in the period required by Part 248.219.

<PARENT> FR940617-2-00116 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

After HUD receives the application, it will review it against the improvements agreed upon in the plan of action. HUD
may also conduct a comprehensive management review to ensure that all management issues are addressed as part of the
MIO plan requirements. 



C. Funding Award Process: Compliance with HUD Reform Act. 





1. Section 103. 

In accordance with the requirements of section 103 of the Department of Housing and Urban Development Reform Act of
1989 (HUD Reform Act) and HUD's implementing regulations at 24 CFR part 4, no selection information will be made available
to applicants or other persons not authorized to receive this information during the period of HUD review and evaluation
of the applications. However, applicants that are declared ineligible will be notified of their ineligibility at
the time such determination is made. 

Noncompetitive individual funding allocations and announcements will be made, as funding determinations are completed,
through the HUD Regional or Field Offices after notification to the Congressional delegation. No information regarding
any unfunded application will be made available to the public. All awards will be disclosed publicly at the conclusion
of each selection. 



2. Section 102. 

Section 102 contains a number of provisions that are designed to ensure greater accountability and integrity in the
provision of certain types of assistance administered by HUD. The following requirements concerning documentation
and public access, disclosures, and subsidy layering determinations are applicable to assistance awarded under
this NOFA. 

a. 

Documentation and public access. 

HUD will ensure that documentation and other information regarding each application submitted pursuant to this
NOFA are sufficient to indicate the basis upon which assistance was provided or denied. This material, including
any letters of support, will be made available for public inspection for a five-year period beginning not less than
30 days after the award of the assistance. Material will be made available in accordance with the Freedom of Information
Act (5 U.S.C. 552) and HUD's implementing regulations at 24 CFR part 15. In addition, HUD will include the recipients
of assistance pursuant to this NOFA in a 

Federal Register

 notice of recipients of HUD assistance awarded. (See 24 CFR 12.14(a) and 12.16(b), and the notice published in the


Federal Register

 on January 16, 1992 (57 FR 1942), for further information on these requirements.) 

b. 

Disclosures. 

HUD will make available to the public for five years all applicant disclosure reports (Form HUD-2880) submitted
in connection with this NOFA. Update reports (also Form HUD-2880) will be made available along with the applicant
disclosure reports, but in no case for a period generally less than three years. All reports_both applicant disclosures
and updates_will be made available in accordance with the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) and HUD's implementing
regulations at 24 CFR part 15. (See 24 CFR subpart C, and the notice published in the

12, Accountability in the Provision of HUD Assistance. 


IV. Deficient Applications


A. Application Review 


Within 30 days of receipt by HUD of the application from the owner, HUD will advise the owner, in writing, whether or
not the application meets the submission requirements as stated in Part III above. Should HUD fail to inform the owner
of its disapproval within the 30-day time frame, the application shall be considered to be approved. If HUD disapproves
the application, an ELIHPA plan of action may not receive final approval. 


B. Submission of Substantive Changes 


Substantive changes or supplements to the application may be submitted by the applicant at any time. These include
changes to the work write up, cost estimates or Form HUD-9835. However, submission of substantive changes will
cause HUD's 30-day mandatory review time to recommence upon resubmission and will delay consideration of approval
of a plan of action.

V. Other Matters


Prohibition Against Lobbying Activities 


The use of funds awarded under this NOFA is subject to the disclosure requirements and prohibitions of section 319
of the Department of Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 1990 (31 U.S.C. 1352), and the
implementing regulations at 24 CFR part 87. These authorities prohibit recipients of Federal contracts, grants,
or loans from using appropriated funds for lobbying the Executive or Legislative Branches of the Federal Government
in connection with a specific contract, grant, or loan. The prohibition also covers the awarding of contracts, grants,
cooperative agreements, or loans unless the recipient has made an acceptable certification regarding lobbying.
Under 24 CFR part 87, applicants, recipients, and subrecipients of assistance exceeding $100,000 must certify that
no Federal funds have been or will be spent on lobbying activities in connection with the assistance. 


Prohibition Against Lobbying of HUD Personnel


Section 13 of the Department of Housing and Urban Development Act (42 U.S.C. 3537b) contains two provisions dealing
with efforts to influence HUD's decisions with respect to financial assistance. The first imposes disclosure requirements
on those who are typically involved in these efforts_those who pay others to influence the award of assistance or the
taking of a management action by the Department 

and 

those who are paid to provide the influence. The second restricts the payment of fees to those who are paid to influence
the award of HUD assistance, if the fees are tied to the number of housing units received or are based on the amount of
assistance received, or if they are contingent upon the receipt of assistance. 
Section 13 was implemented by final rule published in the 

Federal Register

 on May 17, 1991 (56 FR 29912). See 24 CFR Part 86. If readers are involved in any efforts to influence the Department in
these ways, they are urged to read 24 CFR Part 86, particularly the examples contained in Appendix A. 
Any questions concerning Part 86 should be directed to Garry L. Phillips, Acting Director, Office of Ethics, Room
2158, Department of Housing and Urban Development, 451 Seventh Street, SW, Washington, DC 20410-3000. Telephone:
(202) 708-3815 (TDD Voice). (This is not a toll-free number.) Forms necessary for compliance with the rule may
be obtained from the local HUD office. 


Prohibition Against Advance Information on Funding Decisions


Section 103 of the Reform Act proscribes the communication of certain information by HUD employees to persons not
authorized to receive that information during the selection process for the award of assistance that entails a competition
for its distribution. HUD's regulations implementing section 103 are codified at 24 CFR part 4 (see 56 FR 22088, May
13, 1991). (See also Section II.C. of this NOFA.) In accordance with the requirements of Section 103, HUD employees
involved in the review of applications and in the making of funding decisions under a competitive funding process
are restrained by 24 CFR part 4 from providing advance information to any person (other than an authorized employee
of HUD) concerning funding decisions, or from otherwise giving any applicant an unfair competitive advantage. Persons
who apply for assistance in this competition should confine their inquiries to the subject areas permitted by 24 CFR
part 4. Applicants who have questions should contact the HUD Office of Ethics (202) 708-3815. (This is not a toll-free
number.)


 
Environmental Impact


A Finding of No Significant Impact with respect to the environment has been made in accordance with HUD regulations
that implement Section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4332). The Finding of
No Significant Impact is available for public inspection during business hours in the Office of the Rules Docket Clerk,
Office of General Counsel, Room 10276, Department of Housing and Urban Development, 451 Seventh Street, SW, Washington,
DC 20410. 


Federalism Executive Order


The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under Section 6(a) of Executive Order 12612, Federalism, has determined
that this Notice of Fund Availability will not have substantial, direct effects on States, on their political subdivisions,
or on their relationship with the Federal Government, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities between
them and other levels of government. 


Family Executive Order


The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under Executive Order 12606, the Family, has determined that this
Notice of Fund Availability will not have a significant impact on family formation, maintenance or well being, and
therefore, is not subject to review under the order. The NOFA, insofar as it funds emergency repairs to multifamily
housing projects, will assist in preserving decent housing stock for families residing there. Catalog. The Catalog
of Federal Domestic Assistance Program number is 14.164.

Part V


Environmental Protection Agency




Solicitation Notice for Fiscal Year 1995; Environmental Education Grants Program








Federal Register

  Vol. 59, No. 116  Friday, June 17, 1994  Notices



<USDEPT>ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY</USDEPT>






Solicitation Notice for Fiscal Year 1995; Environmental Education Grants Program


Section I. Important Pre-Application Information


A. What is the purpose of this solicitation notice:


This notice solicits pre-applications from eligible organizations and institutions for grants to support projects
to design, demonstrate, or disseminate practices, methods, or techniques related to environmental education as
specified under Section 6 of the National Environmental Education Act of 1990 (the Act). The Section 6 Environmental
Education Grants Program is separate from the Environmental Education and Training Program authorized under Section
5 of the Act in which EPA awards a cooperative agreement on a three year basis to support a national teacher training
program. For information on the teacher training program, contact the EPA representative listed at the end of this
notice.


B. When is my pre-application due to EPA and when will EPA announce the grant awards?


Pre-applications (a signed original plus two copies of the original) must be mailed to EPA postmarked no later than
Friday, October 14, 1994. Pre-applications which are postmarked after October 14, 1994 will not be considered for
funding. EPA expects to announce the grant awards in the Spring of 1995.

<TEXT>
 

C. Do I mail my pre-application to EPA headquarters or an EPA regional office? Is there a difference between the type
of project that is funded by EPA headquarters as opposed to EPA's regional offices?



Pre-applications requesting between $25,001 and $250,000 in federal environmental education grant funds must
be mailed to EPA headquarters in Washington, DC. Pre-applications requesting $25,000 or less in federal environmental
education grant funds must be mailed to the EPA regional office where the project will take place (rather than to the
regional office where the applicant is located, if these locations are different). A list of addresses is included
at the end of this notice. The EPA headquarters and regional grants will be evaluated using the same criteria as defined
in this solicitation. The only difference between grants that are awarded by EPA headquarters and by EPA's regional
offices is the size of the grant.



D. Where do I get the information and forms needed to prepare my pre-application?



EPA strongly encourages applicants to read the solicitation notice carefully. This notice contains all the information
and forms necessary to prepare a pre-application. If your project is selected as a finalist after the evaluation process
is concluded, EPA will provide you with additional forms that must be completed in order to process your pre-application
further.



E. How much money can I request and how does the dollar amount requested affect my chance of being funded?



Applicants may request up to the statutory ceiling of $250,000 in environmental education grant funds for any one
grant. However, pre-applications which request relatively small amounts of funding have a much better chance of
being funded because EPA awards a much greater number of grants at lower funding levels. A significant number of small
awards are made because EPA is required, under Section 6(i) of the Act, to award 25% of funds for grants of $5,000 or less.
In addition, EPA has chosen to award very few of the largest grants (e.g., those over $100,000) so that we may support
a greater number of efforts. Thus, your chance of being funded increases dramatically as the amount of money you request
decreases as illustrated below.

EPA has awarded grants under the Environmental Education Grants Program in Fiscal Years 1992, 1993, and 1994. Individual
awards have ranged from less than $5,000 up to $250,000. During this three year period, EPA has funded only about 10
proposals annually for projects requesting between $25,001 and $250,000; only 1 proposal each year has been funded
at or near the $250,000 level. By contrast, EPA has funded about 30 proposals annually for projects requesting between
$5,001 and $25,000. Furthermore, EPA has funded about 200 proposals annually for projects requesting $5,000 or less.
EPA has received between 1,500 and 3,000 pre-applications each year. To increase your chance of obtaining funding
in FY 1995, EPA strongly encourages applicants to request regional grants of $5,000 or less. If larger sums are needed,
EPA strongly encourages applicants to request a headquarters grant closer to $25,000 rather than the maximum of $250,000.



Section II. Laws and Regulations Governing Grants Program



F. Under what authority has this grants program been established and what laws and regulations do I need to follow in
applying for a grant?



On November 16, 1990, the President signed the National Environmental Education Act (Pub. L. 101-619) into
law. Section 6 of the Act requires that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) administer an environmental
education grants program to support projects that design, demonstrate, or disseminate practices, methods, or techniques
related to environmental education. The Act also requires that EPA establish a program which includes a process for
soliciting, selecting, supervising, evaluating results, and disseminating information on the effectiveness
of projects funded under this program.

EPA published the Environmental Education Grant Program Regulations in the 

Federal Register

 on March 9, 1992 which provides additional information on how EPA is administering this program (57 FR 8390; Title
40 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Part 47 (40 CFR part 47). In addition to the requirements of the Act and part 47,
recipients of section 6 grants must comply with EPA's general assistance regulations at 40 CFR part 31 for states,
local governments, and Indian tribes and Part 30 for all others.



G. How much money has Congress appropriated for this grants program?



The Act requires that 38% of the total funds Congress appropriates in a given fiscal year under the National Environmental
Education Act be awarded as grants under the section 6 environmental education grants program. Based on this percentage,
EPA has awarded approximately $8.1 million in grants under section 6 of the Act over the past three years (approximately
$2.5 in Fiscal Year 1992, $2.7 in Fiscal Year 1993, and $2.9 in Fiscal Year 1994). EPA will award grants in Fiscal Year
1995 subject to the amount of funds appropriated by Congress. EPA may use up to 15% of these funds to support environmental
education projects which meet the requirements under section 6, but are outside of the competitive process established
under the solicitation notice. If funds are used in this manner, EPA will publish a separate solicitation notice in
the 

Federal Register

 to cover the award of these funds.

Section III. Eligible Applicants


H. Who is eligible to submit pre-applications?


Any local or tribal education agency, college or university, state education or environmental agency, not-for-profit
organization, or noncommercial educational broadcasting entity may submit a pre-application. These terms are
defined in Section 3 of the Act and 40 CFR 47.105.


I. May an organization submit more than one pre-application for Fiscal Year 1995?


Yes, an organization may submit more than one pre-application for Fiscal Year 1995, but only if the pre-applications
are for completely different projects. For example, a national non-profit organization or a large university may
wish to submit pre-applications from different chapters or departments for different projects. No organization
will be awarded more than one grant for the same project during the same fiscal year.


J. May I submit a pre-application for Fiscal Year 1995 even though I have been awarded funding under this program for
Fiscal Years 1992, 1993, and/or 1994?


Yes, applicants who were awarded funding previously may submit a pre-application for Fiscal Year 1995. The Fiscal
Year 1995 pre-application may or may not have any relationship to the project funded in a previous year. Every pre-application
for Fiscal Year 1995 will be evaluated based upon the merit of the proposed project in relation to the other Fiscal Year
1995 pre-applications and the new criteria set forth in this solicitation, regardless of whether the proposal would
expand a project funded in a previous year.


K. May a teacher or educator apply?


No, an individual teacher or educator cannot apply. Only education agencies and organizations_not individuals_are
eligible to apply for grants. For example, a teacher's school, school district, or state or local education agency
or organization may apply.


Section IV. Eligible Activities and Funding Priorities


L. What type of activities are eligible for funding under this program?


As specified in the Act, the environmental education activities that are eligible to receive funding under this program
must include at least one of, but are not limited to, the following:
1. The design, demonstration, or dissemination of environmental curricula, including development of educational
tools and material;
2. The design and demonstration of field methods, practices, and techniques, including assessment of environmental
and ecological conditions and analysis of environmental pollution problems;
3. The assessment of a specific environmental issue or a specific environmental problem;
4. The provision of training or related education for teachers, faculty, or related personnel in a specific geographic
area or region; and
5. The design and demonstration of projects to foster international cooperation in addressing environmental issues
and problems involving the United States and Canada or Mexico.
In reference to Section IV.L.1. above, EPA strongly encourages applicants to focus on the demonstration or dissemination
of existing environmental curricula rather than the design or development of new curricula. Environmental educators
and other experts have conveyed to EPA that the field needs to improve its use and dissemination of existing curricula
more than it needs to develop new curricula. Focusing on demonstrating or disseminating existing curricula will
also help ensure that federal funds are not used to duplicate already existing curricula.
Nonetheless, EPA does recognize that there are gaps in the types of curricula that presently exist and that there is
some difficulty in gaining access to quality materials. Thus, applicants who propose to design new curricula in their
pre-applications must demonstrate that there is a need to develop these new materials.
For example, the applicant may show that the curriculum proposed for development has not been designed for a particular
target audience, that existing curricula cannot be adapted well to a particular local environmental concern, or
that existing curricula are not otherwise readily accessible. In demonstrating the need for new curricula, the applicant
must specify what steps they have taken to determine this need (e.g., the applicant may cite a conference where this
need was discussed, the results of inquiries made within the community or with various educational institutions
or organizations, or a published survey or research document).


M. What activities are not eligible for funding under this program?


Funds cannot be used for:
1. construction projects;
2. technical training of environmental management professionals;
3. non-educational research and development; and/or
4. environmental information projects.


</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940617-2-00213 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940617-2-00117 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 


In reference to Section IV.M.1., EPA will not fund construction activities such as the acquisition of real property
(including buildings) or the construction or modification of any building. EPA may, however, fund activities such
as creating a nature trail or building a bird watching station as long as these items are an integral part of the proposed
project. 

In reference to Section IV.M.4., EPA will fund only environmental education projects as opposed to projects that
are solely designed to develop or disseminate environmental information. The long term goal of environmental education
is to increase public awareness and knowledge about environmental issues as well as provide the public with the skills
necessary to make informed decisions and the motivation to take responsible actions. Environmental education enhances
critical-thinking, problem-solving, and effective decision-making skills and may take place in formal or informal
settings. Environmental education engages and motivates individuals, and enables them to weigh various sides of
an environmental issue to make informed and responsible decisions. 

Environmental information provides facts or opinions about environmental issues or problems, but does not enhance
critical-thinking, problem-solving, or effective decision-making skills. Although information is an essential
element of an educational effort, environmental information is not, by itself, environmental education. 


N. What kind of projects will EPA consider funding?


EPA will consider funding only those proposed projects which meet the criteria specified under 

#1

 and 

#2

 below. Any proposed project which does not meet these criteria will not be funded. 
1. As required under the Act, all projects must develop an environmental education practice, method, or technique
which meets all three of the following criteria: 
a. Is new or significantly improved; 
b. Demonstrates the potential for wide application; and 
c. Addresses a high priority environmental issue. 
EPA defined the terms ``new or significantly improved,'' ``wide application,'' and ``a high priority environmental
issue'' in ``relative terms'' (i.e., applicants must define these terms as they relate to their individual projects).
For example, in reference to Section IV.N.1.a., EPA may consider a project new or significantly improved if it reaches
a specific community or audience for the first time, develops a new or improved teaching strategy, or uses a new or improved
method of applying existing materials. 

In reference to Section IV.N.1.b., EPA may consider a project to have wide application if it targets a large and diverse
audience in terms of numbers and demographics. It may also have wide application if it can serve as a model program elsewhere
such as another school, community, state, or region. 

In reference to Section IV.N.1.c., EPA may consider that a project addresses a high priority environmental issue
if the applicant demonstrates that a particular issue is important to the community, state, or region being targeted
by the project. For example, one community may have significant air pollution problems which would make teaching
about solutions to air pollution important to that community. In another community, unplanned development may threaten
a nearby wildlife habitat, thus, making habitat or ecosystem protection a high priority issue. In still another community,
urban decay may make education about lead poisoning from paint or lead pipes important, especially for culturally
diverse or low-income residents who often live in inner-city communities. 
2. 

All proposals must also focus on one of the following types of projects: 
a. Projects that improve educators' environmental education teaching skills (e.g., through workshops); 
b. Projects that build state, local, or tribal capacity to develop and deliver environmental education programs;

c. Projects that educate members of a community through a grassroots community-based organization; or 
d. Projects that motivate the general public to be more environmentally conscious in making informed decisions and
taking responsible actions through vehicles such as print, film, or broadcast media. 

All pre-applications must clearly identify which type of project, described under Section IV.N.2.a, b, c, or d above,
the proposal will focus on. Note that these types of projects have been chosen precisely because they reach different
audiences through different means. EPA believes that requiring you to focus on one of the above types of projects will
help ensure that your proposal has a clear target audience and a well defined vehicle for reaching that audience. Although
your proposal may include more than one of the types of projects described above, doing so will not likely improve your
chance of being funded (unless focusing on more than one strengthens rather than dilutes the focus of your proposal).
EPA's overall goal is to fund a balanced range of projects to increase environmental literacy throughout the country
as described under Section VI.V.1-6. 

In reference to Section IV.N.2.a., the term workshop 

refers to training activities that better prepare educators to utilize existing or new environmental education
materials. Such workshops may be directed toward young people and/or adults in formal and/or informal settings.
A formal setting is a school or other similar institution devoted to learning and an informal setting includes institutions
such as museums, nature centers, parks, and community centers. 

Workshops should emphasize the process, problem-solving, and investigative approach to learning that is a fundamental
aspect of most established environmental education materials and curricula. Workshops should, in all cases, use
a ``hands-on'' process approach to learning that leads to the development of problem-solving and critical-thinking
skills. Workshops may be specific to a particular set of environmental education materials and may include youth
leaders and other professionals who work in the environmental education field. 

In reference to Section IV.N.2.b., the term 

building state, local, or tribal capacity 

refers to the development and implementation of plans designed to improve the coordinated delivery of environmental
education at the state, local, or tribal level. Pre-applications addressing this priority should involve a coordinated
effort by the primary environmental education providers from the respective state, local, or tribal government
in the planning and implementation of the project. Examples of primary environmental education providers includes
State Departments of Education or Natural Resources, local school districts, and state, local, and tribal environmental
education coordinating councils or associations. Examples of how an applicant may propose to build state, local,
or tribal capacity includes the development of plans for: 
 Identifying and assessing needs as well as setting priorities for environmental education; 
 Creating grant programs or identifying funding sources for environmental education providers; and/or 
 Identifying environmental education teacher training needs. 

In reference to Section IV.N.2.c., the term 

grassroots community-based organization 

refers to organizations in which local problems are addressed by individuals who reside in the community being served.




Section V. The Pre-Application 



O. What is a pre-application?



The pre-application contains three parts: (1) The ``Application for Federal Assistance'' (Standard Form 424/SF
424, attached), (2) the ``Budget Information: Non-Construction Programs'' (Standard Form 424A/SF 424A, attached),
and (3) a work plan (described below). To ensure your pre-application is completed properly, carefully follow the
instructions on the SF 424, SF 424A, and those provided below. The SF 424, SF 424A, and the completed work plan contain
all the information EPA will use to evaluate the merits of your pre-application. Applicants will not be asked to submit
additional information to support their projects unless applicants are identified as finalist. Finalists will
be asked to submit various other forms necessary to complete formal application.

<TEXT>
 

P. Are matching funds required?



Yes, non-federal matching funds of at least 25% of the total cost of the project are required, although EPA encourages
matching funds of greater than 25%. Federal funds to support the project must not exceed 75% of the total cost of the
project. The 25% match may be provided by the applicant or any other organization or institution, except that no portion
of the 25% match can include federal funds (unless specifically authorized by statute). The 25% match may be provided
in cash or by in-kind contributions and other non-cash support. In-kind contributions often include salaries or
other verifiable costs. In the case of salaries, applicants may use either minimum wage or fair market value. The proposed
match, including the value of in-kind contributions, is subject to negotiation with EPA. All grants are subject to
audit, so the value of in-kind contributions must be carefully documented.

The matching non-federal share is a percentage of the entire cost of the project. For example, if the 75% federal portion
is $5,000, then the entire project should, at a minimum, have a budget of $6,667, with the recipient providing a contribution
of $1,667. The amount of non-federal funds, including in-kind contributions, must be briefly itemized in Block 15
of the SF 424 included at the end of this notice.



Q. Can I use federal funds other than those provided by this program to support the same project?



Yes, you may use federal funds other than those provided by the Environmental Educational Grants Program to support
the same project, but only for different activities. Furthermore, you may not use any federal funds to meet all or any
part of the required 25% match as stated in Section V.P. above. If you have already been awarded federal funds for a project
in which you are seeking additional support from this program, you must indicate in the budget section of the work plan
that you have been awarded other federal support for this project. You must also identify the project officer, agency,
office, address, phone number, and the amount of the award.



R. Can I request funding for any budget category on the SF 424A (i.e., personnel/salaries, fringe benefits, travel,
equipment, supplies, contractual, construction, and indirect charges)?



Yes, you may request funding for any of the budget categories identified above with the following exceptions. First,
as indicated under Section VI.M.1. above, EPA will not fund the acquisition of real property (including buildings)
or the construction or modification of any building under this program.

Second, you may request funds to pay for salaries, but only for those personnel who are directly involved in implementing
the proposed project and whose salaries are directly related to specific products or outcomes of the proposed project.
EPA also strongly encourages applicants to request reasonable amounts of funding for salaries. Third, you may include
a request for indirect costs if your organization has already negotiated and received an indirect cost rate from the
federal government.



S. What must the pre-application contain and how must the information be presented in the pre-application?



The pre-application must contain an SF 424, and SF 424A, and a work plan as described below:

1. 

Application for Federal Assistance (SF 424

proposed activity and a timetable showing the month/year they will be completed.

This subsection will be scored on the extent to which (a) the budget information clearly and accurately shows how funds
will be used, and (b) the funding request is reasonable given the activities proposed. Subsection maximum score:
10 points (5 points for each of the two elements described in this paragraph)

(2) Key Personnel and Letters of Commitment: An appendix with one or two page resumes for up to three key personnel implementing
the project. Also, you are required to include one page letters of commitment from any partner with a significant role
in the proposed project. Letters of endorsement will not be considered in evaluating pre-applications.

This subsection will be scored based upon whether resumes of key personnel are included and the extent to which the
resumes show that the key personnel are qualified to implement the proposed project. In addition, the score will reflect
whether letters of commitment are included (if partners are used) and the extent to which a firm commitment is made.
Subsection maximum score: 10 points


Appendices Maximum Score: 20 Points




Work plans must be no more than 10 pages for requests for federal funds of more than $5,000 from this environmental education
grants program and no more than 5 pages for requests of $5,000 or less. These page limits apply only to Section V.S.3.a,
b, and c. of the work plan (i.e., the ``summary,'' ``project description,'' and ``project evaluation and sustainability'').
These page limits do not apply to Section V.S.3.d. (i.e., the ``appendices''). ``One page'' refers to one side of a
single-spaced typed page. The pages must be letter sized (81/2  x  11 inches), with normal type size (10 or 12 cpi)
and at least 1 inch margins. To conserve paper, please provide double-sided copies of the pre-application.

The only appendices EPA will accept are a budget, resumes of key personnel, and commitment letters from organizations
with a significant role in the project. EPA will not accept brochures, video tapes, notebooks, photographs, curriculum
samples, or any other supporting material not described as part of the work plan under Section V.S.3.a, b, c, and d.


T. How Must the Pre-Application Be Submitted?






The applicant must submit one original and two copies of the preapplication (a signed SF 424, an SF 424A, and a work plan).

 The pre-application must be signed by a person authorized to receive funds. Please sign the original pre-application
in blue ink to help EPA distinguish which document is the signed original and which documents are copies. Pre-applications
must be reproducible. They should be stapled once in the upper left hand corner, on white paper, and with page numbers
in the upper right hand corner.

Section VI. Review and Selection Process



U. How will pre-applications be reviewed and who will conduct the reviews?



Pre-applications will be reviewed in two phases_the screening phase and the evaluation phase. During the screening
phase, pre-applications will be reviewed to determine whether they are consistent with the requirements described
in Section IV.L.1-5., Section IV.M.1-4., and Section V.S.3.a-d. Only those pre-applications which
meet all of these requirements will enter the evaluation phase of the review process. During the evaluation phase,
pre-applications will be evaluated based upon the quality of their work plans, especially the degree to which the
work plan meets the requirements set forth in Section IV.N.1.a-c. and Section IV.N.2.a-d.

Reviewers conducting the screening and evaluation phases of the review process will include EPA officials and external
environmental educators approved by EPA. At the conclusion of the evaluation phase, the reviewers will rank each
applicant's work plan based upon the scoring system identified in Section V.S.3.a, b, c, and d.



V. How will the final selections be made?



After individual projects are evaluated and ranked by the reviewers as described under Section VI.U. above, EPA officials
in the regions and at headquarters will identify finalists among the highest ranking pre-applications. In identifying
finalists and making final selections, EPA's goal is to fund projects that, when viewed together, provide a balance
among the types of projects being funded, by taking into account the following:

1. The target audience and their socioeconomic status;
2. The methods used to reach the target audience;
3. The type of organization submitting the proposal and/or whether the proposal makes effective use of partnerships;
4. The type of environmental issue addressed;
5. The geographic location of the project; and
6. The cost.

In reference to 

socioeconomic status,

 under Section VI.V.1. above, EPA's goal is to encourage applicants to submit proposals that promote environmental
justice for culturally-diverse and low-income populations. EPA hopes to fund many proposals which score high in
the evaluation process and which promote environmental justice. The term 

environmental justice

 refers to the fair treatment of people of all races, cultures, and income with respect to the development, implementation
and enforcement of environmental laws, regulations, and policies. Fair treatment means that no racial, ethnic,
or socioeconomic group should bear a disproportionate share of the negative environmental consequences resulting
from the operation of industrial, municipal, and commercial enterprises and from the execution of federal, state,
local, and tribal programs and policies.

Efforts to address environmental justice through environmental education may include educational programs that
provide culturally-diverse and low-income populations with critical-thinking, problem-solving, and decision-making
skills to identify, assess, and address an environmental problem that has a disproportionately high and adverse
human health or environmental impact in their community.

In reference to the 

effective use of partnerships,

 under Section VI.V.3. above, EPA's goal is to encourage applicants to submit proposals which form partnerships,
where possible. EPA hopes to fund many proposals which score high in the evaluation process and which promote the effective
use of partnerships between organizations. The term 

partnerships

 refers to forming a collaborative working relationship between two or more organizations such as governmental agencies,
non-profit organizations, educational institutions, and/or the private sector.

In reference to the 

type of environmental issue,

 under Section VI.V.4. above, EPA's goal is to encourage applicant to submit proposals which use pollution prevention
concepts or techniques to address a high priority environmental issue (as discussed under Section IV.N.1.c.). EPA
hopes to fund many proposals which score high in the evaluation process and which convey the importance of pollution
prevention. The term pollution prevention refers to reducing or eliminating waste or pollution at the source. It
means not creating waste or pollution in the first place, instead of deciding how to recycle, treat, or dispose of waste
and pollution that has already been created. Pollution prevention may include increasing energy efficiency and
resource conservation efforts, as well as finding non-polluting substitutes for existing products and activities.

Pollution prevention is not the only strategy that EPA uses to reduce risk to public health and the environment, but
it is EPA's preferred approach. Efforts to promote pollution prevention through environmental education may include
projects that educate the public about the value of preventive approaches to environmental problems and the choices
they can make in their everyday lives to minimize adverse effects of human activities on the environment (e.g., in
the home, work place, market place, and/or community).

EPA Regional Administrators will select grant recipients for projects with federal environmental education grant
funding of $25,000 or less, taking into account the recommendations of the regional environmental education coordinators
who will base their recommendations on the factors discussed above. The Associate Administrator for Communications,
Education, and Public Affairs at EPA headquarters will select the grant recipients for projects with federal environmental
education grant funding of more than $25,000 and up to $250,000, taking into account the recommendations of the Environmental
Education Division Director who will base the recommendations on the factors discussed above. 



W. How and when will I be notified about the status of my proposal?



Headquarters and each regional office set up their own processes for notifying applicants about the status of their
proposals. Our goal is to keep applicants informed as much as possible about the status of their proposals and to assist
those applicants who do not receive funding to successfully compete in future years. To this end, all applicants will
be notified (in mid-December 1994) after their pre-applications have been received and entered into a computerized
data base, and again (in late April to early May 1995) after awards have been announced. To the extent possible, EPA
will also provide applicants with feedback on those proposals which were screened out of the process early and on how
proposals were evaluated. The degree to which EPA can provide such feedback will vary among EPA offices depending
upon the availability of resources to conduct these activities.



X. Where may I obtain more information on possible sources of funding other than this program?



The large number of pre-applications EPA received in Fiscal Years 1992, 1993, and 1994 demonstrates the strong demand
for funding environmental education projects. EPA expects an equally large demand for funding for Fiscal Year 1995.
Unfortunately, EPA alone cannot meet this demand. Thus, in cooperation with EPA, the North American Association
for Environmental Education (NAAEE) has developed a publication called ``Grant Funding For Your Environmental
Education Program'' which provides strategies for identifying potential sources of funding. This publication
can be purchased for a $5.00 fee by writing to NAAEE, Publications and Member Services, P.O. Box 400, Troy, Ohio, 45373.



Section VII. Grant Recipient Activities



Y. When can I begin incurring costs?



Grant recipients may begin incurring costs on the start date that is identified in your grant agreement with EPA. Since
EPA plans to announce awards in the Spring of 1995, EPA recommends that you do not plan to begin incurring costs until
June of 1995. 



Z. When must proposed activities be completed?



EPA strongly encourages grant recipients to complete their projects within the time period specified in the pre-application.
Extensions may be granted only in extenuating circumstances.



AA. May an applicant request Fiscal Year 1995 funds for a project that extends beyond a one-year budget period?



Pre-applications submitted to EPA regional offices for up to $5,000 may request funds for only a one-year budget period.
Pre-applications submitted to EPA regional offices or headquarters requesting funds of more than $5,000 may request
funds for up to a two-year budget period, although EPA strongly encourages applicants to request funds for only a one-year
budget period. 



BB. Who will perform projects and activities?



The Act requires that projects be performed by the applicant or by a person satisfactory to the applicant and EPA. All
pre-applications must identify any person other than the applicant that will assist in carrying out the project.




CC. What reports and work products must grant recipients submit to EPA and when are they due?



All grant recipients must submit three copies of their final report and three copies of all work products to the EPA
project officer within 30 days after the expiration of the budget period. This report will be accepted as the final
report unless the EPA project officer notifies you, within 30 days of your submittal date, that changes must be made.
Grant recipients with projects that have a two-year budget period must also submit a progress report at the end of the
first year. Grant recipients with a federal environmental education grant share greater than $5,000 may also be required
to submit a quarterly or semi-annual progress report. Specific report requirements will be identified in your award
agreement with EPA.



DD. What does EPA plan to do with the grant recipients' final reports and final work products?



Copies of all final reports and final work products will be assembled in a central library at EPA headquarters. EPA
will evaluate these final reports and final work products and may disseminate these items to others to serve as model
programs.

Section VIII_Additional Information on Preparing Pre-Applications and for Fiscal Year 1996 Program


EE. Where can I get additional information in preparing my pre-application?


EPA strongly encourages applicants to carefully read the solicitation notice. Many questions, such as when is the
deadline for submitting pre-applications and what activities can be funded under this program, are answered in this
solicitation. Nonetheless, if you need more information about this grant program or clarification about specific
requirements in this solicitation notice, you may contact the EPA Environmental Education Division in Washington,
DC for grant requests of more than $25,000 or your EPA regional office for grant requests of $25,000 or less. A list of
the names and telephone numbers of EPA representatives are listed at the end of this notice.
In addition, you may contact the National Consortium for Environmental Education and Training (NCEET) at the University
of Michigan for general information on current environmental education activities and recent developments in the
field (

e.g.,

 information about current in-service teacher education needs and opportunities as well as resources that identify
environmental education organizations, curricula, and research). NCEET can also provide you with a list of all environmental
education grants awarded by EPA in FY 1992, FY 1993, and FY 1994 as well as summaries of those projects completed under
the FY 1992 program. NCEET will not provide sample curricula nor will they evaluate products or funding proposals.
NCEET was established in 1992 with financial support from EPA to facilitate teacher training opportunities. You
may contact NCEET by writing to NCEET, School of Natural Resources, University of Michigan, Dana Building Ann Arbor,
Michigan 48109-1115 or by calling 313-998-6726.


FF. How can I get information on the Fiscal Year 1996 EPA Environmental Education Grants Program?


After the Fiscal Year 1995 grants process is completed, EPA will develop an entirely new mailing list for the Fiscal
Year 1996 solicitation. The Fiscal Year 1996 mailing list will include all applicants who submitted pre-applications
for Fiscal Year 1995 as well as anyone else who specifically requests to be placed on the mailing list. If you did not
submit a pre-application for Fiscal Year 1995 and you wish to be added to our mailing list to receive information on
the Fiscal Year 1996 Environmental Education Grants Program, you must mail your request_please do not telephone_along
with your name, organization, address, and phone number to: U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Environmental
Education Division (1707), FY 1996 Environmental Education Grants Program, 401 M Street SW., Washington, DC 20460.

Part I. Introduction


Title III of the Child Abuse Amendments of 1984, (Pub. L. 98-457, 42 U.S.C. 10401, 

et seq.

) is entitled the Family Violence Prevention and Services Act (the Act). It was first implemented in FY 1986 and reauthorized
and amended for fiscal years 1993 through 1995 by Congress on May 28, 1992 by Public Law 102-295. Funds under the
Act are awarded to States and Indian Tribes to assist in supporting programs and projects to prevent incidents of family
violence and to provide immediate shelter and related assistance for victims of family violence and their dependents.
Family violence prevention funds have served to supplement many already established community-based family violence
prevention and service activities. These funds also have allowed States and Tribes to expand current service programs
and establish additional new centers in rural and underserved areas, on Native American Reservations, and in Alaskan
Native Villages and Regional Corporation areas. In most areas, there is private sector as well as State and local funding
for these emergency shelters.
The Department, through the Family Violence Prevention and Services Act, has provided technical assistance grants
to several State Coalitions Against Domestic Violence, and to several nonprofit organizations to assist shelter
operators and service providers to improve their service delivery, and also to support better planning, coordination
and information exchange.
In addition to the grants that were initially made available in FY 1986, the Department also has supported: The operation
of the Clearinghouse on Family Violence Information; research activities with the Department of Justice; regionally
based training and technical assistance for State and local law enforcement personnel through the Department of
Justice; and grants for technical assistance and training for State and local public and private nonprofit agencies
administering the family violence program.
During FY 1993, the Department continued to make grant awards that enhanced public information and community awareness
strategies and activities. Twenty-one grant awards for public information and community awareness were made during
FY 1993 to private non-profit organizations representing Native Americans, Haitian Americans, Asian Americans,
and community coalitions. These grant awards provided support to various organizations in their efforts to prevent
family violence and to make their communities aware of the nature and prevalence of domestic violence as well as the
services available for prevention activities.
Six grant awards were made during FY 1993 to demonstrate model training for domestic violence prosecutors that would
provide improved access and legal representation for domestic violence victims. A national resource center for
domestic violence and three special issue resource centers also were established during FY 1993. The national resource
center and the special-issue resource centers will provide resource and service information, training, and technical
assistance to Federal, State, and Indian tribal agencies, as well as to local domestic violence programs and to professionals
and other individuals who provide services to victims of domestic violence.


Part II. Fiscal Year 1994 Family Violence Projects


1. Priority Area Number FV01-94:


Public Information/Community Awareness Campaign Projects for the Prevention of Family Violence





Purpose:

 To assist in the development of public information and community awareness campaign projects and activities that
will serve as information models for the prevention of family violence. These projects should provide information
on resources, facilities, and service alternatives available to family violence victims and their dependents,
community organizations, local school districts, and other individuals seeking assistance.

Eligible Applicants:

 State and local agencies, Territories, and Native American Tribes and Tribal Organizations who are, or have been,
recipients of Family Violence Prevention and Services Act grants; State and local private non-profit agencies experienced
in the field of family violence prevention; and public and private non-profit educational institutions, community
organizations and community-based coalitions, and other entities that have designed and implemented family violence
prevention information activities or community awareness strategies. 



Background:

 Based on the encouraging response to the announcement for public information and community awareness grants for
family violence prevention in Federal fiscal years 1992 and 1993, ACF plans to again make these grants available in
FY 1994. 

The public information/community awareness grant awards have spawned very effective informational activities
at the local levels. These grants have assisted community organizations to focus on and emphasize prevention, helped
to make available public service announcements and legal brochures in several different languages, including Russian
and Vietnamese, and have assisted in the implementation of conflict resolution activities in elementary, middle
and high school curricula. 

The goal of this priority area is to continue to add credible and persuasive information to the arsenal of weapons necessary
and available to community organizations to help break the so-called ``cycle of family violence.'' The continuation
of these efforts will help assure that individuals, particularly within minority communities, are aware of available
resources and alternative responses for the resolution and the prevention of violence. The proposed grant awards
will provide support for a model that provides for a more informed individual and thus, more effective prevention
strategies on the part of that individual. 

The focus of this priority area requires the development and implementation of an innovative public information
campaign model that may be used, for example, by public and private agencies, schools, churches, boys and girls clubs,
community organizations, and individuals. The ACF support for the continued increase of information on services
and other alternatives for the prevention of family violence promotes the concepts that this behavior is unacceptable
and that victims, their dependents, and perpetrators need to be provided with remedial and service options for their
particular situations. 

Accurate information is critical to any community awareness 
strategy and activity. How information is communicated must be modified where communication barriers may exist
because of perceived or real language differences and cultural insensitivities.

Minimum Requirements for Project Design: 

In order to successfully compete under the priority area, the applicant should: 
 Present a plan for community awareness and public information activities that clearly reflect how the applicant
will coordinate with public agencies and with other community organizations and institutions active in the field
of family violence prevention. 
 Describe, as an element of the plan, a proposed model approach to the development of a public information campaign
and identify the specific audience(s), community(ies), and groups with the highest prevalence of domestic violence
that will be educated in the prevention of family violence. 
 Include, as critical elements in the plan: 
 A set of achievable objectives and a description of the population groups, relevant geographic area, and the
evaluation components to be used to measure progress and the overall effectiveness of the campaign; 
 Applicants must also describe their intended strategies for test marketing their development plans and give
assurances that effectiveness criteria will be implemented prior to finalizing the plan; 
 The development and use of non-traditional sources as information providers (applicants should present
specific plans for the use of local organizations, businesses and individuals in the distribution of information
and materials); 
 The identification of the media to be used in the campaign and the geographic distribution of the campaign;

 How the applicant would be responsive to and demonstrate its sensitivity towards minority communities and
their cultural perspectives; and 
 Provide a description of the kind, volume, distribution, and timing of the proposed information with assurances
that the public information campaign activities will not supplant or lower the current frequency of public service
announcements. 


Project Duration: 

The length of the project should not exceed 12 months. 


Federal Share of the Project: 

The maximum Federal share of the project is not to exceed $35,000 for the 1-year project period. Applications for lesser
amounts also will be considered under this priority area. 


Matching Requirement: 

Grantees must provide at least 25 percent of the total cost of the project. The total approved cost of the project is
the sum of the ACF share and the non-Federal share. The non-Federal share maybe met by cash or in-kind contributions,
although applicants are encouraged to meet their match requirements through cash contributions. Therefore, a project
requesting $35,000 in Federal funds (based on an award of $35,000 per budget period), must include a match of at least
$11,660 (25% of total project cost). 


Anticipated Number of Projects to be Funded: 

It is anticipated that three projects will be funded at the maximum level; more than three projects may be funded depending
on the number of acceptable applications for lesser amounts which are received. 
CFDA: 93.671 Family Violence Prevention and Services: Family Violence Prevention and Services Act, as amended.

 

2. Priority Area Number FV02-94: 


Historical Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) Institutional Outreach Activities in Support of Comprehensive
Family Violence Prevention Activities (Outreach and Prevention);

 



Purpose: 

To assist in the development of public information materials, educational strategies, and community activities
for families that will focus on family violence prevention as a part of a comprehensive approach to improve and enable
family-focused interventions. It is expected that these interventions which are directed towards families will
increase the awareness of violence and decrease its incidence and impact in minority communities. In these efforts
the responding institutions should enlist the energy and cooperation of significant community institutions, community
organizations, and individuals to serve as models and to provide information on resources, services, facilities,
and alternatives to violence in the family. 


Eligible Applicants: 

The Office of Community Services, Administration for Children and Families invites Historically Black Universities
and Colleges to submit applications for projects that will provide for the development, implementation and operation
of comprehensive family violence prevention strategies and for the dissemination of informational and resource
materials for the prevention of family violence in our minority communities. Successful applicants for this priority
area will not be precluded from applying in response to a subsequent announcement.

Background: 

The goal of this priority area is to provide support for the inclusion of ``family violence prevention'' in a comprehensive
approach which considers environmental and cultural factors in plans for intervention and violence prevention
strategies in minority communities. Historical Black Colleges and Universities in their relationships with minority
communities and their residents offer an opportunity for the exchange and development of innovative ideas and approaches
to the prevention of violence in general. This effort will make it possible to capture, consider and utilize the ideas
for violence prevention that exist in the minority communities, particularly in response to the problems of racism
and poverty. The utilization of HBCUs in this effort will make available the considerable expertise, experience,
and resources to be found in these institutions. 

Family violence prevention activities encompass a wide range of activities that include the teaching of conflict
resolution skills, the implementation of intervention strategies, and the development of informational materials
on available resources and services. Family violence prevention may be viewed as the sum of activities which are guides
to acceptable behavior. For example, activities that may be a part of the family violence prevention equation provide
parenting skills and techniques, emphasize self-esteem for our youth, stress the importance of higher education
as a conduit to a better lifestyle, and identify the means of avoiding negative health consequences such as AIDS and
other sexually transmitted diseases. 

Family violence prevention needs to be considered as a part of an overall violence prevention strategy. With this
particular perspective the Administration for Children and Families is interested in applications that address:


Overall strategies for violence prevention activities that focus on educational and training efforts, outreach
activities and supportive services, and the role and impact of community institutions; 

Cooperative networks and collaborative approaches within the minority communities for the prevention of anti-social
and violent behavior and that facilitate the implementation of family violence preventive efforts; 

Intervention approaches concerned with building upon family values within minority families; 

Institutional intervention strategies utilizing resources such as alumni, fraternities and sororities, the African
American religious community, and volunteers from the community in general; and 

The identification of data gathering, informational and research activities that are needed to identify, support,
and implement the long-term strategic interventions to reduce ``Black on Black'' crime in general and family violence
in the African American community in particular. 



Minimum Requirements for Project Design: 



In order to successfully complete under this priority area, the applicant should: 

 Prepare and submit an application that clearly reflects how the applicant will coordinate with other community
organizations, agencies, institutions, and individuals active in the field of family violence prevention; 

 Describe, as a major element, the significant prevention efforts that are a part of the educational and training,
outreach, and supportive service strategies; and 

 Describe, as an element of the plan, the proposed approach to a public information/community awareness strategy
and identify the specific audience, community(s), and target group(s) on which the efforts will be focused. 

 Describe, as an element of the plan, the intended strategies for test marketing the development plans and give
assurances that effectiveness criteria will be implemented prior to finalizing the plan; 

 Include as critical elements in the plan: 

 The development and use of non-traditional sources as information providers and in outreach efforts; 

 The specific interventions to be modeled and their responsiveness and sensitivity to the general violence
in the African American community; 

 A set of achievable objectives and the evaluation components that are to be used to measure the degree of success
in achieving the objectives as well as the assessment of the programs impact. 



Project Duration: 

The length of the project should not exceed 17 months. 



Federal Share of the Project: 

The maximum Federal share of the project is not to exceed $40,000 for the 17-month project period. Applications for
lesser amounts also will be considered under this priority area.

requesting $40,000 in Federal funds (based on an award of $40,000 per budget period), must include a match of at least
$13,333 (25% of total project cost). 



Anticipated Number of Projects to be Funded: 

It is anticipated that three projects may be funded at the maximum level; more than three projects may be funded depending
on the number of acceptable applications for lesser amounts which are received. 

CFDA: 93.671 Family Violence Prevention and Services: Family Violence Prevention and Services Act, as amended.




3. Priority Area Number FV03-94: 



Domestic Violence/Child Protective Services Collaboration: 





Eligible Applicants: 

State and local child protection agencies; Other State and local agencies, Territories, and Native American Tribes
and Tribal Organizations who are recipients, or have been recipients, of Family Violence Prevention and Services
Act grants; private nonprofit child welfare agencies; domestic violence advocacy organizations; and domestic
violence State coalitions. Applicants must submit a signed Letter of Agreement between the public agency representing
the child welfare/child protection responsibilities and the organization or coalition representing domestic
violence advocacy organizations and their concerns. Either signatory to the Agreement may be the principal grantee.
The Agreement to be submitted will specifically indicate the role each participant organization has in the implementation
of the proposed project. Because the successful implementation of a proposed project would have implications for
systemic/procedural change in the child welfare and/or the domestic violence community, the Letter of Agreement
is mandatory. 



Purpose: 

To develop effective strategies for domestic violence services integration into child protection systems and strategies.
To offer the applicant organizations an opportunity to design, develop, and collaborate on one of several issues
or areas of concern between the child protection system and the domestic violence community. Efforts are to be focused
on the development of curricula and materials and the implementation of training to be available. The training of
child protection representatives and domestic violence advocates will be to enable the most efficient and effective
response when encountering woman abuse in the course of child abuse and neglect investigations. Protocols for effective
strategies of intervention need to be designed, developed and put in place to allow for the child protection system
to assist and utilize the non-offending parent to protect her children. 

Applicants may propose to do one or more of the following: Plan and implement the training of child protection service
workers, supervisors and social services providers on the relationship of domestic violence and child abuse and
neglect; develop and implement domestic violence responsive policies to be adopted by the Statewide child protection
services system; develop and implement through the child protection system a domestic violence specific curriculum
which will become part of a mandatory training program; develop and implement Memoranda of Understanding between
the child protection system and the domestic violence statewide system; and gather and submit data correlating abuse
between adult partners and child abuse and neglect. 



Background: 

Based on a recent review of the literature, it has become evident that in the homes where the woman is battered the children
were themselves more likely to be victims of child abuse and neglect. Domestic violence is surfacing as one of the highest
risks to children. Domestic violence represents physical endangerment to the child as well as the possibility for
developmental delay. 

In 1985, there were an estimated 795,000 abused children between the ages of 3 and 17 living in two-parent households
(Gelles, Strauss, 1987). According to these studies, men are the main perpetrators of domestic violence and commit
95 percent of all assaults on women. In 70 percent of households in which women are abused, the men also commit child
abuse (Schecter, 1982). Also, in 70 percent of child abuse cases treated at Boston Children's Hospital in 1991, the
mother was abused as well. 

In an attempt to establish the actual relationship between child abuse and battering in families, 116 mothers of children
``darted'' or flagged in a single year for abuse or neglect at a metropolitan hospital were studied by Stark and Flitcraft
(1984). These examinations revealed that 45 percent of the abused children had mothers who themselves were being
physically abused and another 5 percent had mothers whose relationships were ``full of conflict,'' although abuse
was not verified. Bowker, Arbitell and McFerron (1988) reported that children whose mothers had been battered were
more likely to be physically abused and less likely to be ``neglected'' than children whose mothers had not been battered.
In Hilberman and Munson's (1987) research, they found evidence of physical and/or sexual abuse of children in 20 of
the 60 cases they studied. They concluded: ``There seems to be two styles of abuse: the husband beats the wife who beats
the children, and/or the husband beats both his wife and children.'' 



Project Duration: 

The length of the project should not exceed 17 months.

Federal Share of the Project: 

The maximum Federal share of the project is not to exceed $50,000 for the 17 month project period. Applications for
lesser amounts also will be considered for this project. 



Matching Requirement:

 Grantees must provide at least 25 percent of the total cost of the project. The total approved cost of the project is
the sum of the ACF share and the non-Federal share. The non-Federal share maybe met by cash or in-kind contributions,
although applicants are encouraged to meet their match requirements through cash contributions. Therefore, a project
requesting $50,000 in Federal funds (based on an award of $50,000 per budget period), must include a match of at least
$16,666 (25% of total project cost). 



Anticipated Number of Projects to be Funded:

 It is anticipated that five projects may be funded at the maximum level; more than five projects may be funded depending
on the number of acceptable applications for lesser amounts which are received. 

CFDA: 93.671 Family Violence Prevention and Services: Family Violence Prevention and Services Act, as amended.




Part III_The Review Process 



A. Eligible Applicants 



Before applications are reviewed, each application will be screened to determine that the applicant organization
is an eligible applicant as specified under the selected priority area. Applications from organizations which do
not meet the eligibility requirements for the priority area will not be considered or reviewed in the competition,
and the applicant will be so informed. 

Each priority area description contains information about the types of agencies and organizations which are eligible
to apply under that priority area. Since eligibility varies among priority areas, it is critical that the ``Eligible
Applicants'' section under each specific priority area be read carefully. 

Only agencies and organizations, not individuals, are eligible to apply under any of the priority areas. On all applications
developed jointly by more than one agency or organization, the applications must identify only one organization
as the lead organization and official applicant. The other participating agencies and organizations can be included
as co-participants, subgrantees or subcontractors. 

Any non-profit agency which has not previously received an award from the U. S. Department of Health and Human Services
must submit proof of non-profit status with its grant application. 

The non-profit agency can accomplish this by either making reference to its listing in the Internal Revenue Service's
(IRS) most recent list of tax-exempt organizations or submitting a copy of its letter from the IRS under IRS Code Section
501(c)(3). ACF cannot fund a non-profit applicant without acceptable proof of its non-profit status. 



B. Review Process and Funding Decisions 



Timely applications will be reviewed and scored competitively. Experts in the field, generally persons from outside
of the Federal government, will use the appropriate evaluation criteria listed later in this Part to review and score
the applications. The results of this review are a primary factor in making funding decisions. 

OCS reserves the option of discussing applications with, or referring them to, other Federal or non-Federal funding
sources when this is determined to be in the best interest of the Federal government or the applicant. It may also solicit
comments from ACF Regional Office staff, other Federal agencies, interested foundations, national organizations,
specialists, experts, States and the general public. These comments, along with those of the expert reviewers, will
be considered by OCS in making funding decisions. 

In making decisions on awards, OCS may give preference to applications which focus on or feature: Minority populations;
a substantially innovative strategy with the potential to improve theory or practice in the field of human services;
a model practice or set of procedures that holds the potential for replication by organizations involved in the administration
or delivery of human services; substantial involvement of volunteers; substantial involvement (either financial
or programmatic) of the private sector; a favorable balance between Federal and non-Federal funds available for
the proposed project; the potential for high benefit for low Federal investment; a programmatic focus on those most
in need; and/or substantial involvement in the proposed project by national or community foundations. 

To the extent possible, efforts will be made to ensure that funding decisions reflect an equitable distribution of
assistance among the States and geographical regions of the country, rural and urban areas, and ethnic populations.
In making these decisions, OCS may also take into account the need to avoid unnecessary duplication of effort.

C. Evaluation Criteria 



Using the appropriate evaluation criteria below, a panel of at least three reviewers (primarily experts from outside
the Federal government) will review each application. Applicants should ensure that they address each minimum requirement
in the priority area description under the appropriate section of the Program Narrative Statement. 
Reviewers will determine the strengths and weaknesses of each proposal in terms of the appropriate evaluation criteria
listed below, provide comments and assign numerical scores. The point value following each criterion heading indicates
the maximum numerical weight that each section may be given in the review process. 


Review Criteria for All Priority Areas 


Applications under all priority areas will be evaluated against the following criteria. 
1. 

Objectives and Need for the Project (20 points). 

State the specific objectives and needs addressed by the project in terms of its national or regional significance,
its theoretical importance, its applicability to policy and practice. Provide a detailed discussion of the ``state-of-the-art''
relative to the problem or area addressed by the proposal and indicate how the proposed effort will impact on it. State
the goals or service objectives of the proposal. Provide supporting documentation or other testimonies from concerned
interests other than the applicant. Summarize, evaluate and relate relevant data, based on planning or demonstration
studies to the proposed project. The application must identify the specific topics or program areas to be served by
the proposed project. 
2. 

Results or Benefits Expected (20 points). 

The extent to which the application identifies the results and benefits to be derived, the extent to which they are
consistent with the objectives of the proposal, the extent to which the application indicates the anticipated contributions
to policy, practice, and theory, and the extent to which the proposed project costs are reasonable in view of the expected
results. Identify, in specific terms, the results and benefits, for target groups and human service providers, to
be derived from implementing the proposed project. Describe how the expected results and benefits will relate to
previous demonstration efforts. Describe in detail evaluation plans and procedures which are capable of measuring
the degree to which the project objectives have been accomplished. 
3. 

Approach (35 points). 

The extent to which the application outlines a sound and workable plan of action pertaining to the scope of the project,
and details how the proposed work will be accomplished; relates each task to the objectives and identifies the key
staff member who will be the lead person; provides a chart indicating the timetable for completing each task, the lead
person, and the time committed; cites factors which might accelerate or decelerate the work, giving acceptable reasons
for taking this approach as opposed to others; describes and supports any unusual features of the project, such as
design or technological innovations, reductions in cost or time, or extraordinary social and community involvements;
and provides for projections of the accomplishments to be achieved. 
The extent to which, when applicable, the application describes the evaluation methodology that will be used to determine
if the needs identified and discussed are being met and if the results and benefits identified are being achieved.
The application also lists each organization, agency, consultant, or other key individuals or groups who will work
on the project, along with a description of the activities and nature of their effort or contribution. 
4. 

Level of Effort: (25 Points). Staffing pattern

_Describe the staffing pattern for the proposed project, clearly linking responsibilities to project tasks and
specifying the contributions to be made by key staff. 


Competence of staff

_Describe the qualifications of the project team including any experiences working on similar projects. Also, describe
the variety of skills to be used, relevant educational background and the demonstrated ability to produce final results
that are comprehensible and usable. One or two pertinent paragraphs on each key member are preferred to vitae/r&eacute;sum&eacute;s.
However, vita/r&eacute;sum&eacute;s may be included in the ten pages allowed for attachments/appendices. 


Adequacy of resources

_Specify the adequacy of the available facilities, resources and organizational experience with regard to the tasks
of the proposed project. List the financial, physical and other sources to be provided by other profit and nonprofit
organizations. Explain how these organizations will participate in the day to day operations of the project. 


Budget

_Relate the proposed budget to the level of effort required to obtain project objectives and provide a cost/benefit
analysis. Demonstrate that the project's costs are reasonable in view of the anticipated results. 


Collaborative efforts

_Discuss in detail and provide documentation for any collaborative or coordinated efforts with other agencies or
organizations. Identify these agencies or organizations and explain how their participation will enhance the project.
Letters from these agencies and organizations discussing the specifics of their commitment must be included in the
application. 


Authorship

_The authors of the application must be clearly identified together with their current relationship to the applicant
organization and any future project role they may have if the project is funded. 
Applicants should note that non-responsiveness to the section 

``Minimum Requirements for Project Design'' 

will result in a low evaluation score by the panel of expert reviewers. Applicants must clearly identify the specific
priority area under which they wish to have their applications considered, and tailor their applications accordingly.
Previous experience has shown that an application which is broader and more general in concept than outlined in the
priority area description is less likely to score as well as one which is more clearly focused on and directly responsive
to the concerns of that specific priority area. 


D. Available Funds 


OCS intends to award grants resulting from this announcement during the fourth quarter of FY 1994. The size of the actual
awards will vary. Each priority area description includes information on the maximum Federal share of the project
costs and the anticipated number of projects to be funded. 
The term ``project period'' refers to the total time a project is approved for support, including any extensions.

Where appropriate, applicants may propose project periods which are shorter than the maximums specified in the various
priority areas. Non-Federal share contributions may exceed the minimums specified in the various priority areas
when the applicant is able to do so.

E. Grantee Share of Project Costs 



Federal funds will be provided to cover up to 75% of the total allowable project costs. Therefore, the non-Federal
share must amount to at least 25% of the total (Federal plus non-Federal) project cost. This means that, for every $3
in Federal funds received, up to the maximum amount allowable under each priority area, applicants must contribute
at least $1. 

For example, the cost breakout for a project with a total cost of $56,666 to implement would be: 







Part IV_Instructions for the Development and Submission of Applications 



This Part contains information and instructions for submitting applications in response to this announcement.
Application forms are provided as part of this publication along with a checklist for assembling an application package.
Please copy and use these forms in submitting an application. 

Potential applicants should read this section carefully in conjunction with the information contained within the
specific priority area under which the application is to be submitted. The priority area descriptions are in part
II. 


A. Required Notification of the State Single Point of Contact 



This program is covered under Executive Order 12372, (E.O.) ``Intergovernmental Review of Federal Programs,''
and 45 CFR part 100, ``Intergovernmental Review of Department of Health and Human Services Program and Activities.''
Under the E.O., States may design their own processes for reviewing and commenting on proposed Federal assistance
under covered programs. 

All States and territories, except Alabama, Alaska, Connecticut, Hawaii, Idaho, Kansas, Louisiana, Minnesota,
Montana, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Virginia, Washington, American Samoa and Palau,
have elected to participate in the E.O. process and have established a Single Points of Contact (SPOCs). Applicants
from these eighteen jurisdictions need take no action regarding E.O. 12372. Applicants for projects to be administered
by Federally-recognized Indian tribes are also exempt from the requirements of E.O. 12372. Otherwise, applicants
should contact their SPOCs as soon as possible to alert them of the prospective applications and receive any necessary
instructions. Applicants must submit any required material to the SPOCs as soon as possible so that OCS can obtain
and review SPOC comments as part of the award process. It is imperative that the applicant submit all required materials,
if any, to the SPOC and indicate the date of this submittal (or the date of contact if no submittal is required) on the
Standard Form 424, item 16a. 

Under 45 CFR 100.8(a)(2), a SPOC has 60 days from application deadline to comment on proposed new or competing continuation
awards. 

SPOCs are encouraged to eliminate the submission of routine endorsements as official recommendations. Additionally,
SPOCs are requested to differentiate clearly between mere advisory comments and those official State process recommendations
which may trigger the ``accommodate or explain'' rule. 

When comments are submitted directly to ACF, they should be addressed to: Department of Health and Human Services,
Administration for Children and Families, Division of Discretionary Grants, 370 L'Enfant Promenade, SW., 6th Floor,
Washington, DC 20447.

should be included on line 6h, ``Other.'' 





Justification: 

Identify the project director, if known. Specify by title or name the percentage of time allocated to the project,
the individual annual salaries, and the cost to the project (both Federal and non-Federal) of the organization's
staff who will be working on the project.

Justification: 

Provide a break-down of amounts and percentages that comprise fringe benefit costs, such as health insurance, FICA,

Enter total costs of out-of-town travel (travel requiring per diem) for staff of the project. Do not enter costs for
consultant's travel or local transportation, which should be included on line 6h, ``Other.'' 





Justification:

Enter the total costs of all equipment to be acquired by the project. For State and local governments, including Federally
recognized Indian Tribes, ``equipment'' is non-expendable, tangible, personal property having a useful life of
more than one year and an acquisition cost of $5,000 or more per unit. For all other applicants, the threshold for equipment
is $500 or more per unit. The higher threshold for State and local governments became effective October 1, 1988, through
the implementation of 45 CFR part 92, ``Uniform Administrative Requirements for Grants and Cooperative Agreements
to State and local governments.''

Equipment to be purchased with Federal funds must be justified. The equipment must be required to conduct the project,
and the applicant organization or its subgrantees must not have the equipment or a reasonable facsimile available

Enter the total costs of all contracts, including procurement contracts (except those which belong on other lines
such as equipment, supplies, etc.) and contracts with secondary recipient organizations. Also include any contracts
with organizations for the provision of technical assistance. Do not include payments to individuals on this line.



Justification: 

Attach a list of contractors, indicating the names of the organizations, the purposes of the contracts, and the estimated
dollar amounts of the awards as part of the budget justification. Whenever the applicant/grantee intends to delegate
part or all of the program to another agency, the applicant/grantee must complete this section (Section B, Budget
Categories) for each delegate agency by agency title, along with the supporting information. The total cost of all
such agencies will be part of the amount shown on Line 6f. Provide backup documentation identifying the name of contractor,
purpose of contract, and major cost elements. 


Construction_Line 6g.

this line should be used when the applicant (except local governments) has a current indirect cost rate agreement
approved by the Department of Health and Human Services or another Federal agency. 
Local and State governments should enter the amount of indirect costs determined in accordance with HHS requirements.
When an indirect cost rate is requested, these costs are included in the indirect cost pool and should not be charged
again as direct costs to the grant. In the case of training grants to other than State or local governments (as defined
in title 45, Code of Federal Regulations, part 74), the Federal reimbursement of indirect costs will be limited to
the lesser of the negotiated (or actual) indirect cost rate or 8 percent of the amount allowed for direct costs, exclusive
of any equipment charges, rental of space, tuition and fees, post-doctoral training allowances, contractual items,
and alterations and renovations. 
For training grant applications, the entry under line 6j should be the total indirect costs being charged to the project.
The Federal share of indirect costs is calculated as shown above. The applicant's share is calculated as follows:

(a) Calculate total project indirect costs (a*) by applying the applicant's approved indirect cost rate to the total
project (Federal and non-Federal) direct costs. 
(b) Calculate the Federal share of indirect costs (b*) at 8 percent of the amount allowed for total project (Federal
and non-Federal) direct costs exclusive of any equipment charges, rental of space, tuition and fees, post-doctoral
training allowances, contractual items, and alterations and renovations.

of indirect costs for training grants should specify this. 



Total_Line 6k.

 Enter the total amounts of lines 6i and 6j.

This section summarizes the amounts of non-Federal resources that will be applied to the grant. Enter this information
on line 12 entitled ``Totals.'' In-kind contributions are defined in title 45 of the Code of Federal Regulations,
Part 74.51, as ``property or services which benefit a grant-supported project or program and which are contributed
by non-Federal third parties without charge to the grantee, the subgrantee, or a cost-type contractor under the grant
or subgrant.'' 



Justification:

 Describe third party in-kind contributions, if included.

for each of the remaining years of the project. 



3. Project Summary Description 



Clearly mark this separate page with the applicant name as shown in item 5 of the SF 424, and the title of the project as
shown in item 11 of the SF 424. The summary description should not exceed 300 words. These 300 words become part of the
computer database on each project. 


Care should be taken to produce a summary description which accurately and concisely reflects the proposal. It should
describe the objectives of the project, the approaches to be used and the outcomes expected. The description should
also include a list of major products that will result from the proposed project, such as software packages, materials,
management procedures, data collection instruments, training packages, or videos (please note that audiovisuals
should be closed captioned). The project summary description, together with the information on the SF 424, will constitute
the project ``abstract.'' It is the major source of information about the proposed project and is usually the first
part of the application that the reviewers read in evaluating the application. 



4. Program Narrative Statement 



The Program Narrative Statement is a very important part of an application. It should be clear, concise, and address
the specific requirements mentioned under the priority area description in Part II. The narrative should also provide
information concerning how the application meets the evaluation criteria using the following headings: 

(a) Objectives and Need for the Project; 

(b) Results and Benefits Expected; 

(c) Approach; and 

(d) Level of Effort. 

The specific information to be included under each of these headings is described in Section C of Part III, Evaluation
Criteria. 

The narrative should be typed double-spaced on a single-side of an 81/2
'
'  x  11
'
' plain white paper, with 1
'
' margins on all sides. All pages of the narrative (including charts, references/footnotes, tables, maps,
exhibits, etc.) must be sequentially numbered, beginning with ``Objectives and Need for the Project'' as page number
one. Applicants should not submit reproductions of larger size paper, reduced to meet the size requirement.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940617-2-00236 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940617-2-00118 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The length of the application, including the application forms and all attachments, should not exceed 60 pages. A
page is a single side of an 81/2
'
'  x  11
'
' sheet of paper. Applicants are requested not to send pamphlets, brochures or other printed material along
with their application as these pose photocopy difficulties. These materials, if submitted, will not be included
in the review process if they exceed the 60-page limit. Each page of the application will be counted to determine the
total length. 


5. Organizational Capability Statement 


The Organizational Capability Statement should consist of a brief (two to three pages) background description of
how the applicant organization (or the unit within the organization that will have responsibility for the project)
is organized, the types and quantity of services it provides, and/or the research and management capabilities it
possesses. This description should cover capabilities not included in the Program Narrative Statement. It may include
descriptions of any current or previous relevant experience, or describe the competence of the project team and its
demonstrated ability to produce a final product that is readily comprehensible and usable. An organization chart
showing the relationship of the project to the current organization should be included. 


6. Part V_Assurances/Certifications 


Applicants are required to file an SF 424B, Assurances_Non-Construction Programs, and the Certification Regarding
Lobbying. Both must be signed and returned with the application. In addition, applicants must certify their compliance
with: (1) Drug-Free Workplace Requirements; and (2) Debarment and Other Responsibilities. These certifications
are self-explanatory. Copies of these assurances/certifications are reprinted at the end of this announcement
and should be reproduced, as necessary. A duly authorized representative of the applicant organization must certify
that the applicant is in compliance with these assurances/certifications. A signature on the SF 424 indicates compliance
with the conditions set forth in the Drug Free Workplace Requirements, and Debarment and Other Responsibilities
certifications located in Appendices and of this announcement.
