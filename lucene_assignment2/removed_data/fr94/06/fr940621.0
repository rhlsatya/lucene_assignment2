Sweet Cherries Grown In Designated Counties in Washington; Establishment of Minimum Size and Maturity Requirements
for Rainier Variety Cherries



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Agricultural Marketing Service, USDA.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This final rule establishes a minimum size requirement of 11 row size (61/64 inch diameter) and a minimum maturity
requirement of 17 percent soluble solids for Rainier variety cherries that can be shipped to fresh market outlets
under Marketing Order No. 923. This final rule ensures that consumers receive cherries of acceptable size and maturity.
This is intended to enhance the quality and image of Washington Rainier cherries in the fresh market, thereby increasing
sales and improving returns to producers. This final rule was recommended by the Washington Cherry Marketing Committee
(committee), which works with the Department of Agriculture (Department) in administering the marketing order
covering sweet cherries grown in designated counties in Washington.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 This final rule is issued under Marketing Agreement No. 134 and Marketing Order No. 923 (7 CFR Part 923), 
regulating the handling of sweet cherries grown in designated counties in Washington, hereinafter referred to as
the ``order.'' The order is effective under the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended 
(7 U.S.C. 601-674), hereinafter referred to as the ``Act.'' 



The Department is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. 

This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This final rule is not intended
to have retroactive effect. This final rule will not preempt any State or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless
they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule. 

The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section
608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order,
any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and
request a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing
on the petition. After the hearing the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court
of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of business,
has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not
later than 20 days after the date of the entry of the ruling. 

Pursuant to requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural
Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this action on small entities. 

The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small
businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and rules
issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities acting
on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility. 

There are approximately 50 handlers of Washington sweet cherries that are subject to regulation under the order.
In addition, there are approximately 1,100 producers in the regulated area. Small agricultural service firms, which
include handlers of Washington sweet cherries, have been defined by the Small Business Administration [13 CFR 121.601]
as those whose annual receipts are less than $5,000,000, and small agricultural producers are defined as those whose
annual receipts are less than $500,000. A majority of these handlers and producers may be classified as small entities.


This final rule revises  923.322 to establish a minimum size requirement of 11 row (61/64 inch diameter) and
a minimum maturity requirement of 17 percent soluble solids for Rainier variety cherries under the order. The committee
recommended these minimum size and maturity requirements by a vote of 13 to 1. 

Section 923.52 of the order authorizes the establishment of grade, size, quality, maturity, pack and container regulations
for any variety or varieties of cherries grown in the production area. Section 923.53 further authorizes the modification,
suspension, or termination of regulations issued under  923.52. Section 923.55 provides that whenever cherries
are regulated pursuant to  923.52 or  923.53, such cherries must be inspected by the Federal-State Inspection
Service, and certified as meeting the applicable requirements of such regulations.

Currently, the regulations require that dark sweet cherries such as Bing cherries, the predominant variety grown
in the production area, meet certain grade, size, pack and container requirements. Such cherries are also required
to be inspected. Light sweet cherries, including the Rainier variety, are currently exempt from these requirements.


The Rainier variety was developed at Washington State University's Irrigated Agricultural Research and Extension
Center in Prosser, Washington, and was first released to the Northwest cherry industry in 1960. Rainiers were initially
used primarily as canning cherries. However, since the 1980s, production of the Rainier variety for the fresh market
has increased substantially. Less than 600 tons were marketed fresh in 1987, but that increased to 1,543 tons in 1989
and 1,937 tons in 1992. A record crop of 2,427 tons was marketed in 1993, about 5 percent of Washington's total sweet
cherry crop. 

As the Rainier variety gained in importance as a fresh market cherry, the Washington cherry industry began to consider
the need to establish minimum standards of size and quality for the variety. At its December 15, 1993, meeting, the
committee made its first recommendation to regulate Rainier cherries. Specifically, the committee recommended
that a minimum size requirement be established at 101/2 row size (1 inch in diameter) for fresh market shipments of
Rainier variety cherries. No minimum maturity requirement was recommended at that time, although concerns were
expressed about ensuring that only ripe cherries be marketed. 

Subsequent to the December meeting, the Department received correspondence from 19 cherry producers, packers,
and marketers concerning the committee's recommended regulation. The majority (13 of 19) were in favor of the recommendation,
and 6 were in opposition to regulating the Rainier variety. 

Comments supporting the proposed minimum size requirement stated that such a regulation would be in the best interests
of producers. Growing Rainier cherries is more labor intensive and costly than producing other varieties. Producers
need to offer a quality product in order to recoup these higher production costs. The sale of small, immature cherries
results in buyer dissatisfaction, which reduces repeat purchases and damages the market for all cherries. Good cultural
practices (e.g., proper pruning) will result in acceptable sizes. Fruit quality and maturity are enhanced by fruit
size. 

Those opposed to the recommendation stated that it would reduce the volume of Rainier cherries permitted to be marketed
fresh, thus reducing returns on the crop. Further, they stated that taste and appearance are more important to cherry
buyers than size. Those in opposition also claimed that a minimum size requirement would be detrimental to producers
who farm at higher elevations, where fruit tends to be smaller, but may be sweeter. 

Given the lack of industry consensus on this issue, the Department asked the committee to reconsider the need to regulate
Rainier variety cherries, particularly in light of the concerns raised in the above-mentioned letters. The committee
met again on March 15, 1994, and rescinded its earlier recommendation. The committee recommended a lower size requirement_at
least 11 row size (61/64 inch in diameter)_coupled with a minimum maturity requirement of 17 percent soluble solids.
The vote on this recommendation was 13 to 1, with the dissenting voter in favor of a smaller minimum size of 111/2 row
(57/64 inch in diameter). 

The Rainier cherry is distinct from other cherry varieties marketed by the Washington cherry industry. It is a yellow-colored
cherry, with some rosy blush. It is considered a specialty item, compared with the darker colored varieties. 

The committee reports the costs of producing and handling Rainier cherries are higher than those associated with
other cherry varieties. Rainier cherry trees need to be pruned more heavily than other cherry trees to ensure acceptable
sized fruit. Rainier cherry trees are picked several times during a season, reflecting the fact that not all the fruit
matures at the same time and that the cherries will not ripen after harvest. Rainier cherries are also fragile and susceptible
to damage during handling. Thus, most Rainier cherries are sorted and packed by hand. 

Rainier cherries are typically marketed from mid-June through July. AMS Market News data show that prices are highest
for the earliest offerings of these cherries, and that such prices decline as the season progresses. In 1992, for example,
the opening f.o.b. price on June 18 was $35.00 per carton. This declined to $25.00 to $28.00 per carton a week later,
and f.o.b. prices were $22.00 to $28.00 per carton at season's end. This price trend serves as an incentive for producers
to harvest early, which has resulted in immature, sour Rainier cherries being marketed. 

The committee reports that cherry size and quality are important to buyers. Consistency and dependability are equally
important. Shipments of immature, low quality, under-sized Rainier cherries in recent seasons have resulted in
disappointment by buyers and consumers. This reduces repeat purchases, and results in declines in prices and overall
sales volumes. The general consensus of the industry is that some mandatory quality standards are needed to ensure
buyer confidence. Voluntary standards have been unsuccessful. 

Cherry size is related to maturity and other quality factors. That is, larger sized cherries tend to be sweeter and
of higher overall quality. This is supported by prices received for different sizes of Bing cherries. Market News
data show that f.o.b. prices for 12 row sized Bings (54/64 inch diameter) averaged about $15.00 per carton in mid-June
1992. At the same time, 101/2 row sized (1 inch diameter) Bings were selling for about $25.00 per carton. This price
relationship held steady throughout the season. Further, the committee has conducted research that shows that larger
sizes correlate with higher maturity levels, and that larger sizes are preferred by cherry consumers. While research
results and prices by size specifically for Rainier variety cherries are currently unavailable, industry consensus
is that the same relationships are true for Rainier cherries. 

The Washington cherry industry promotes the sale of Rainier variety cherries through the Washington State Fruit
Commission (WSFC), a State research and promotion program funded by industry assessments. The WSFC publicizes the
current voluntary 1-inch minimum size standard for Rainier variety cherries in its promotion efforts. The WSFC has
reported that it receives buyer complaints when such standards are not upheld. For example, three large retail chains
cancelled all of their in-store promotions of Rainier variety cherries planned for the 1993 season due to the receipt
of small, immature Rainier cherries early in the season. Thus, the industry believes it needs to establish minimum
size and maturity standards to protect its investment in promoting the crop.

The general consensus of the Washington cherry industry is that the shipment of poor quality Rainier cherries is disrupting
the marketplace and that some minimum quality standards are needed to maintain the Rainier cherry market. However,
some disagreement was expressed at the committee meeting as to precisely what those minimum standards should be.


Some questioned, for example, the 101/2 row size requirement initially recommended by the committee, saying that
this requirement would result in too many cherries being diverted to processors (an outlet exempt from regulation).
Others stated that the smaller 11 row cherries have adequate sugar content. Still others opposed any size requirement,
believing that other criteria (e.g., maturity levels) are more important than size and that size bears no relationship
to those criteria. Additionally, concern was expressed that producers at higher elevations would be more adversely
impacted than other producers by a minimum size requirement. 

In regards to this last concern, the committee concluded that producers at higher elevations should not be adversely
impacted by the 11 row minimum size regulation, since these producers have demonstrated the ability to produce other
varieties at acceptable sizes (e.g., Bing cherries). Further, a number of producers who farm at higher elevations
attended the meeting, and stated that they would not have a problem meeting the proposed minimum size requirement,
and that proper cultural practices (including pruning) would ensure that other producers achieve appropriate sizing.


In an attempt to reach an industry compromise, the committee rescinded its December recommendation to establish
a minimum size requirement for Rainier cherries at 101/2 row size. It recommended instead a lower minimum size requirement
of 11 row, coupled with a maturity requirement of at least 17 percent soluble solids. This recommendation is considered
to be conservative, in that most handlers in the Washington cherry industry pack to higher standards. The committee
intends to conduct research during the 1994 and subsequent seasons to determine whether further refinements in Rainier
variety cherry standards are needed. 

This final rule adds a new provision to  923.322, Washington Cherry Regulation 22, to establish a minimum size
requirement of 61/64 inch in diameter for Rainier variety cherries, which corresponds to the 11 row size. To provide
for variances in packing, a tolerance of 10 percent will be provided for undersized Rainier cherries. Further, the
regulation will provide that not more than 5 percent of the Rainier cherries in any lot could be less than 57/64 inch
in diameter, which is 111/2 row size, one size lower than the 11 row size. These tolerances are comparable to those in
effect for other Washington cherry varieties.

Section 923.322 is also revised by adding a new section to require that any lot of Rainier cherries would have to contain
a minimum of 17 percent soluble solids. The percentage of soluble solids would be determined by using a refractometer
to measure the sugar level in a composite sample of cherries. This maturity test would be taken at the time of packing
or just prior to shipment, at the option of the handler. 
As previously discussed,  923.55 of the order provides that whenever cherries are subject to grade, size, quality,
maturity, pack or container regulations, those cherries must be inspected by the Federal-State Inspection Service
(FSIS). Since this rule would establish minimum size and maturity requirements for Rainier variety cherries, such
cherries would have to be inspected and certified by the FSIS as meeting the applicable requirements of the regulation.

A proposed rule concerning this action was published in the 

Federal Register

 on May 19, 1994, (59 FR 26148), which provided a 15 day comment period ending June 3, 1994. Three comments were received.
The Washington Cherry Committee recommended a modification to the original minimum maturity requirement. Mr. Mike
Hambelton of Stemilt Growers, Inc. did not support the original minimum maturity requirement, but supported the
committee's recommended modification. Mr. Grady Auvil of Auvil Fruit Company also supported the modification recommended
by the committee. Both Mr. Hambelton and Mr. Auvil did not support the minimum size requirement. 
The Washington Cherry Committee's comment stated that the modification to its recommended minimum maturity requirement
for Rainier cherries was to provide more flexibility for handlers. The proposed rule stated that maturity testing
was to be conducted at the time of packing or shipment only. Since handlers use different methods of packing Rainier
cherries, the committee agreed that it is important that handlers have the option to determine when the maturity test
will be conducted. This will prevent the unnecessary packing and repacking of Rainier cherries that do not meet the
minimum size requirements. The new language will accommodate different methods by permitting maturity inspection,
prior to packing, at the time of packing, or just prior to shipment. The Department believes that the comments concerning
modifying the minimum maturity requirements for Rainier cherries have merit. Therefore, this final rule is modified
to revise  923.322(c) of Washington Cherry Regulation 22, to provide more flexibility in inspection. 
Mr. Hambelton and Mr. Auvil also filed comments requesting that the Department not approve the committee's size recommendation.
Mr. Hambelton suggested that the committee lacked formal research in the areas of Rainier cherry maturity and size.
The committee has done research concerning cherries showing that size and quality are very important to buyers. Although
no formal research was specifically conducted on Rainier cherries, there is among growers and handlers a tremendous
amount of knowledge and experience about the marketing of Rainier cherries. The overwhelming view of the committee,
which is made up of growers and handlers, is that shipments of small, sour Rainier cherries has been poorly received
by consumers. In addition, the committee gave the issue full and timely consideration, as noted in the two meetings
which were held. The committee in its final decision voted 13 to 1 in favor of its recommendation. 
Mr. Auvil also stated that the minimum size requirement would limit supply, resulting in higher prices. Mr. Hambelton
also claimed that the size regulation would reduce Rainier cherry supplies and result in grower prices exceeding
parity levels. He cited that the 1993 parity price for sweet cherries was $1,640 per ton, and that Rainier cherry producers
received on average $1,822 per ton. However, the $1,640 figure used by Mr. Hambelton is a national sweet cherry parity
figure from the July 1993 National Agricultural Statistics Service report. This figure reflects prices for all sweet
cherries grown in the United States, including Rainier cherries and other varieties of sweet cherries grown in the
regulated area. There are no separate official data on Rainier cherries. The AMS has calculated an equivalent parity
price for Washington sweet cherries of $2,083 per ton, and does not expect that prices received during the 1994 season
will exceed parity levels. 
More importantly, however, the intent of this action is to establish minimum levels of size and maturity to ensure
consumer satisfaction and maintain current markets. The objective of this action is not to reduce supplies of Rainier
cherries. As previously discussed, higher prices for earliest offerings of Rainier cherries provide an incentive
for producers to harvest early, which has resulted in immature, sour Rainier cherries being marketed. The establishment
of minimum size and maturity requirements should reduce this propensity to harvest prematurely, but should not reduce
the overall volume of Rainier cherries. 
Considering complaints received from consumers last season about immature Rainier cherries, the committee made
its recommendation to make 11 row size the minimum for such cherries. The size recommendation ensures cherries of
a good size will be shipped to market. 
For the reasons stated above, the Department is not making any changes to the size requirements for Rainier cherries.

Based on available information, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this action will not have a significant
impact on a substantial number of small entities. 
After consideration of all available information, it is found that establishing minimum size and maturity requirements,
as set forth in this final rule, will tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act. 
Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553, it is also found and determined that good cause exist for not postponing the effective date
of this final rule until 30 days after publication in the 

Federal Register

 because: (1) The committee held several meetings concerning the need to regulate Rainier variety cherries and all
interested persons were invited to participate and express their opinions on this issue; (2) the proposed rule provided
a comment period and modifications were made based on the comments; and (3) to be of maximum benefit to the industry,
any regulation covering Rainier cherries should be in place for the 1994 season which begins in mid-June, and adequate
time is needed to advise producers and shippers.

Tuberculosis in Cattle and Bison; State Designation



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, USDA.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Interim rule and request for comments.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 We are amending the tuberculosis regulations concerning the interstate movement of cattle and bison by reducing
the designation of Virginia from an accredited-free State to an accredited-free (suspended) State. We have determined
that Virginia no longer meets the criteria for designation as an accredited-free State but meets the criteria for
designation as an accredited-free (suspended) State. This change is necessary to prevent the spread of tuberculosis
in cattle and bison.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:


Background



Bovine tuberculosis is the contagious, infectious, and communicable disease caused by 

Mycobacterium bovis. 

The tuberculosis regulations contained in 9 CFR part 77 (referred to below as the regulations), regulate the interstate
movement of cattle and bison because of tuberculosis. Cattle or bison not known to be affected with or exposed to tuberculosis
are eligible for interstate movement without restriction if those cattle or bison are moved from jurisdictions designated
as accredited-free States, accredited-free (suspended) States, or modified accredited States. The regulations
restrict the interstate movement of cattle or bison not known to be affected with or exposed to tuberculosis if those
cattle or bison are moved from jurisdictions designated as nonmodified accredited States.

The status of a State is based on its freedom from evidence of tuberculosis, the effectiveness of the State's tuberculosis
eradication program, and the degree of the State's compliance with the standards contained in a document captioned
``Uniform Methods and Rules_Bovine Tuberculosis Eradication,'' which is part of the regulations via incorporation
by reference in part 77.


</SUPPLEM>

<TEXT>
 

An accredited-free State, as defined in  77.1 of the regulations, is a State that has no findings of tuberculosis
in any cattle or bison in the State for at least 5 years. The State must also comply with all the provisions of the ``Uniform
Methods and Rules_Bovine Tuberculosis Eradication'' regarding accredited-free States.

An accredited-free (suspended) State is defined as a State with accredited-free status in which tuberculosis has
been detected in any cattle or bison in the State. A State is qualified for redesignation of accredited-free status
after the herd in which tuberculosis is detected has been quarantined, an epidemiological investigation has confirmed
that the disease has not spread from the herd, and all reactor cattle and bison have been destroyed. However, if tuberculosis
is detected in two or more herds in the State within 48 months, the State's accredited-free status is revoked.

Before publication of this interim rule, Virginia was designated in 
 77.1 of the regulations as an accredited-free State. However, because tuberculosis has recently been confirmed
in one herd within the State, the Administrator has determined that Virginia no longer meets the criteria for designation
as an accredited-free State, but instead meets the criteria for designation as an accredited-free (suspended) State.
Therefore, we are amending the regulations by removing Virginia from the list of accredited-free States in  77.1
and adding it to the list of accredited-free (suspended) States in that section.



Immediate Action



The Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that there is good cause for publishing
this interim rule without prior opportunity for public comment. Immediate action is necessary to change the regulations
so that they accurately reflect the current tuberculosis status of Virginia as an accredited-free (suspended) State.
This will provide prospective cattle and bison buyers with accurate and up-to-date information.

Because prior notice and other public procedures with respect to this action are impracticable and contrary to the
public interest under these conditions, we find good cause under 5 U.S.C. 553 to make it effective upon publication
in the 

Federal Register

. We will consider comments that are received within 60 days of publication of this rule in the 

Federal Register

. After the comment period closes, we will publish another document in the 

Federal Register

. It will include a discussion of any comments we receive and any amendments we are making to the rule as a result of the

Executive Order 12866 and Regulatory Flexibility Act



This interim rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12866.

For this action, the Office of Management and Budget has waived its review process required by Executive Order 12866.

Virginia has approximately 29,000 cattle herds containing 1,710,000 cattle and bison. An estimated 90 percent of
these herds are owned by small businesses. Changing the status of Virginia may affect the marketability of cattle
and bison from the State, since some prospective cattle and bison buyers prefer to buy cattle and bison from accredited-free
States. This may result in a small detrimental economic impact on some small entities. We anticipate that this action
will not have a significant effect on marketing patterns in Virginia and will therefore not have a significant effect
on those persons affected by this action.

Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that
this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.

Official Brucellosis Tests 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, USDA.

 

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 We are amending the brucellosis regulations by revising standards established for the brucellosis testing of cattle
and bison with the particle concentration fluorescence immunoassay test. By revising the standards for this test,
we will help designated epidemiologists avoid incorrectly classifying cattle and bison as brucellosis suspects.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Background 


Brucellosis is a serious infectious and contagious disease, caused by 
bacteria of the genus Brucella, that affects animals and man. The Secretary 
of Agriculture is authorized to cooperate with the States in conducting a 
brucellosis eradication program and in preventing the interstate spread of 
brucellosis. The regulations in 9 CFR part 78 (referred to below as the regulations) govern the interstate movement
of cattle, bison, and swine in 
order to help prevent the spread of brucellosis. 
Official brucellosis tests are used to determine the brucellosis status of cattle, bison, and swine. The regulations
stipulate that testing negative to an official brucellosis test is a condition for certain interstate movements.
Additionally, official tests are used to determine eligibility for indemnity payments for animals destroyed because
of brucellosis. 
On March 2, 1994, we published in the 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 9938-9939, Docket No. 93-120-1) a proposal to revise the standards for one such official test,
the particle concentration fluorescence immunoassay (PCFIA) test. We solicited comments concerning our proposal
for a 60-day comment period ending May 2, 1994. During that period, we received one comment, from a national veterinary
medical association. The commenter supported the proposal. 
Therefore, based on the rationale set forth in the proposed rule, we are adopting the provisions of the proposal as
a final rule. 


Executive Order 12866 and Regulatory Flexibility Act 


This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12866. The rule has been determined to be not significant for
purposes of Executive Order 12866, and, therefore, has not been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget. 
Incorrect brucellosis classification of cattle and bison as a result of 
the current PCFIA test standards creates marketing delays and unnecessary costs for farmers. Under the regulations,
cattle and bison classified as brucellosis suspects must either be quarantined and retested within 30 days or sold
for slaughter (usually at a loss). Consequently, farmers may unnecessarily quarantine or slaughter, at a loss, incorrectly
classified cattle and bison. Therefore, revising the PCFIA test result standards will save farmers both time and
money. 
Though we believe that the economic impact of this action will be positive, we also believe it will be minimal. We anticipate
that only about 7,200 cattle and bison in 560 herds (less than one thousandth of a percent of all cattle and bison in the
United States) are classified incorrectly as brucellosis suspects under our current regulations. We estimate that
all of the cattle and bison affected by this action will be owned by farms classified as small entities under Small Business
Administration standards. 
Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that
this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.

Quarantine Fee for Horses, Ruminants, and Swine 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, USDA.

 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 We are amending the regulations to require importers of horses, ruminants, and swine wishing to use a United States
Department of Agriculture quarantine facility to pay a reservation fee covering 100 percent of the estimated cost
of care, feed, and handling of the animals. This requirement will protect the Department from financial losses in
the event an importer places animals in quarantine and then fails to pay outstanding bills.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Background 


The animal import regulations contained in 9 CFR part 92 (referred to below as the regulations) govern the importation
of certain animals into the United States, and require certain animals to be quarantined in the United States as part
of their importation. The regulations in   92.304, 92.404, and 92.504 require importers to pay a reservation
fee covering 25 percent of the estimated cost of care, feed, and handling of horses, ruminants, and swine, respectively,
to be quarantined in U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) facilities. The fee may not exceed $2,500. 
On September 14, 1993, we published in the 

Federal Register

 (58 FR 48003-48004, Docket No. 93-073-1) a proposal to amend the regulations to require importers
of horses, ruminants, and swine wishing to use a USDA quarantine facility to pay a reservation fee covering 100 percent
of the estimated cost of care, feed, and handling of the animals. We solicited comments concerning our proposal for
a 30-day comment period ending October 14, 1993. During that period, we received one comment. The comment, from a horse
importer, opposed the proposal, arguing that it would place an undue economic hardship on horse importers. The importer
also stated his belief that the majority of horse importers have established credit histories with USDA and that this
proposal, if enacted, would punish those importers for the actions of a few. 
We recognize that raising the quarantine reservation fee to 100 percent of estimated quarantine costs may inconvenience
importers. However, based on our experience conducting quarantines at USDA facilities, we have discovered that
requiring only a partial payment of estimated costs prior to quarantine leaves USDA vulnerable to significant financial
losses in the event importers abandon their animals in quarantine facilities. 
For example, in 1993, an importer abandoned at a USDA quarantine facility a shipment of camels discovered to be tubercular.
Quarantine and subsequent destruction of the camels cost USDA over $100,000. We were unable to recover any expenses
beyond the prepaid maximum reservation fee of $2,500, as the importer, who was neither a United States citizen nor
resident, left the country. There have been several other cases in the last few years where USDA lost considerable
sums due to nonpayment for quarantine services and/or abandonment of animals in quarantine. Two cases have involved
horse imports; in one case, USDA lost more than $30,000, in the other, about $11,000. 
By requiring quarantine reservation fees of 100 percent of estimated costs, this action will provide USDA with protection
against these sorts of financial losses. Though this action undoubtedly will inconvenience importers, we believe
it is imperative to prevent any further loss of Federal resources because of nonpayment for quarantine services and/or
abandonment of animals in quarantine. 


Forfeiture of Quarantine Reservation Fees 


The regulations in   92.304(a)(3)(iv), 92.404(a)(4)(iv), and 92.504(a)(4)(iv) require importers
to forfeit 100 percent of their quarantine reservation fees in the event they fail to present their animals for entry
at USDA quarantine facilities within 24 hours of the designated time of arrival, and if they fail to qualify for any
of the exemptions from forfeiture specified in the regulations. This action does not revise those regulations. However,
animal importers failing to present their animals as required will stand to forfeit a larger sum since this action
raises the quarantine fee from 25 percent to 100 percent of estimated quarantine costs. Increasing the possible forfeiture
amount hopefully will deter importers from frivolously reserving quarantine space and will further protect USDA
from financial losses in the event we reserve space at a quarantine facility for an importer who fails to present his
animals for quarantine. 
Therefore, based on the rationale set forth in the proposed rule and in this document, we are adopting the provisions
of the proposal as a final rule. 

Executive Order 12866 and Regulatory Flexibility Act 


This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12866. The rule has been determined to be not significant for
purposes of Executive Order 12866, and, therefore, has not been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget. 
Requiring horse, ruminant, and swine importers to pay reservation fees covering 100 percent of estimated quarantine
costs will have no significant economic consequences. Importers will pay the same fees as previously required, only
sooner. 
Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that
this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. 


Executive Order 12778 


This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This rule: (1) Preempts all State and
local laws and regulations that are in conflict with this rule; (2) has no retroactive effect; and (3) does not require
administrative proceedings before parties may file suit in court challenging this rule.

Lead-Based Paint Liability Insurance 
Coverage for Housing Authorities 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Office of the Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing, HUD. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 Public housing agencies and Indian housing authorities (collectively, housing authorities or HAs) conducting
lead-based paint testing and abatement activities need to assure that they have adequate liability insurance coverage
to cover the hazards inherent in these activities, in order to comply with insurance requirements of their Annual
Contributions Contracts with HUD. This rule prescribes the nature and quality of liability insurance to protect
HAs and contractors performing this work for HAs. The rule is being issued to comply with directions in the Department's
appropriation act for Fiscal Year 1992 to adopt regulations specifying the nature and quality of insurance to cover
HAs in the performance of this work. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
I. Paperwork Reduction Act Statement 


The information collection requirements contained in this rule have been submitted to the Office of Management and
Budget (OMB) for review under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501-3520) and approved under OMB
control number 2577-0187, which is valid through August 1994. 


II. Background 


A. HUD Contract Requirements for Insurance 


Under their Annual Contributions Contract (ACC) or Mutual Help Annual Contributions Contract (MHACC) with HUD,
Public Housing Agencies (PHAs) and Indian Housing Authorities (IHAs) (hereinafter referred to as HAs) must carry
adequate (1) owner's, landlord's, and tenant's public liability insurance; and (2) manufacturer's and contractor's
public liability insurance (both now combined and referred to by the insurance industry as commercial general liability
insurance). When the conditions of the ACC or MHACC were formulated in 1969, it was not anticipated that there was any
reason to address the issue of bodily injury due to the ingestion of lead-based paint, since the health hazard of this
chemical was not well-known. Also, at that time, no pollution exclusion in the general liability policy was thought
to apply to claims of this nature. 
However, during subsequent years, as environmental claims started arising, insurance companies began to exclude
pollution and environmental liability; and it is the opinion of most insurance companies that, since lead is a chemical
which is included in the definition of a ``pollutant'', claims arising from lead poisoning are excluded from current
policies. However, some courts have differed with the insurance companies' position on pollution exclusions. 
HAs are engaging in lead-based paint testing and abatement, often funded by HUD under the Comprehensive Improvement
Assistance Program or Comprehensive Grant Program, which support rehabilitation work needed to improve the condition
of public housing units. The Department published a document in the 

Federal Register

 to guide these activities, entitled ``Lead-Based Paint: Interim Guidelines for Hazard Identification and Abatement
in Public and Indian Housing'' (55 FR 14556, April 18, 1990, and revised 55 FR 39874, September 28, 1990, and 56 FR 21556,
May 9, 1991). Use of these guidelines is the subject of other program regulations and notices of funding availability,
and it is not addressed in this rule. 



B. Appropriations Act


The Departments of Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban Development Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 1992, Pub
L. 102-139, 105 Stat. 736 (approved October 28, 1991) (``1992 Act'') included an express provision concerning
selection of insurance to protect against the liability hazards involved in the testing and abatement of lead-based
paint, at 758 and 759:

Hereafter, until the Department of Housing and Urban Development has adopted regulations specifying the nature
and quality of insurance covering the potential personal injury liability exposure of public housing authorities
and Indian housing authorities (and their contractors, including architectural and engineering services) as a
result of testing and abatement of lead-based paint in federally subsidized public and Indian housing units, said
authorities shall be permitted to purchase insurance for such risk, as an allowable expense against amounts available
for capital improvements (modernization): Provided, That such insurance is competitively selected and that coverage
provided under such policies, as certified by the authority, provides reasonable coverage for the risk of liability
exposure, taking into consideration the potential liability concerns inherent in the testing and abatement of lead-based
paint, and the managerial and quality assurance responsibilities associated with the conduct of such activities.

 

In other words, until a final rule is effective, HAs may proceed with lead-based paint abatement activities, selecting
their own lead-based paint liability coverage so long as they determine it is appropriate for their needs. 
A proposed rule was published on November 2, 1993 (FR 58513) which covered this subject. This final rule responds to
comments received on that proposed rule. 


III. Public Comments 


The Department received comments from nine public sources. Three were from housing authorities. Two were from testing/abatement
contractors or consultants. Three were from PHA-owned insurance entities or their administrators, and one was from
a trade association. 


Comment.

 Three sources questioned HUD's reasoning in not attempting to secure another master insurance policy that would
provide liability coverage for both the contractor performing testing and abatement work, as well as the HA, and requested
reconsideration of this decision. Two of the sources also recommended that such master policy also cover any type
of contractor (plumbing, heating, mechanical, electrical, painting and decorating) who might come in contact with
lead-based paint while performing their work. 


Response.

 The Department rejects this recommendation for a number of reasons. In its report to Congress dated September 24,
1991, concerning the previous master policy which expired on October 1, 1993, the HUD Inspector General questioned
the involvement of HUD staff in the procurement of that policy. The IG felt that since this was not a Federal procurement,
but an HA procurement subject to State procurement statutes and regulations, HUD's involvement should have been
only in an advisory capacity. In addition, it is extremely doubtful that any insurance company would consider issuing
a liability insurance policy to a HA that would cover as insured parties, contractors engaged in performing various
types of skilled work only while working on HA premises. Should the housing authorities or any contractor trade associations
desire to secure a master policy that meets the requirements of this rule and provides adequate protection for the
exposure, they are free to do so. Also, since the passage of the Residential Lead-Based Paint Hazard Reduction Act
of 1992, which is Title X of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 (42 U.S.C. 4851-4856), other public
and private housing owners are required to engage in lead-based paint testing and abatement. Since contractors performing
these operations need insurance when working for other housing owners, a master policy obtained by HUD insuring them
only while performing work for HAs would not fill all of their needs. In addition, there appears to be a more available
market for this type of insurance than prevailed in 1990 when the previous master policy was obtained. 


Comment

. The rule should have a ``grandfather clause'' allowing HAs and contractors to continue coverage that was obtained
prior to the effective date of the rule even though the policy does not meet the rule requirements. 


Response

. The Department agrees that it should not require midterm cancellation of any policy that would result in a short rate
penalty in order to comply with the rule and has modified the rule accordingly. It will be necessary, however, to comply
with the requirements of the rule when the policy in force on the effective date of the rule expires. 


Comment

. In order to expand the availability of insurance policies that would qualify under the rule, allow a ``claims made''
form as long as it has a discovery period. 


Response

. The Department is willing to allow a ``claims made'' form, as long as it has a discovery period of at least five years,
and the rule has been changed to that effect. 


Comment

. Professional Liability insurance for architects and engineers cannot be obtained on an ``occurrence'' form and
insurance companies insuring the contractors and HAs for liability do not want to add this coverage to their policies.



Response

. It was not the intent that this rule was to apply to Professional Liability policies obtained by architectural and
engineering firms, and the rule has been clarified accordingly. The HA, however, should have these firms provide
evidence that they do have some type of Professional Liability insurance in effect.

Comment.

 Even though the contractor purchases the insurance and names the HA as an additional insured, the HA should also be
required to purchase primary insurance to cover any exposure to liability for claims not directly related to work
being done by the contractor. 


Response.

 While such an exposure may exist, the Department believes that the exposure is more limited than the exposure that
already exists prior to any abatement work, and liability insurance to protect against claims for the mere existence
of lead-based paint has never been required. Although not a requirement, there is no prohibition against the HA purchasing
this insurance if it feels it is necessary and can afford to do so. 


Comment.

 The rule should allow defense costs to be included within the policy limit, since some of the insurance companies providing
this insurance are now issuing policies on this basis. 


Response.

 To make coverage more readily available, the Department is willing to allow a limit being placed on the cost of defense
prior to being deducted from the limit of liability, as long as the defense limit is not less than $250,000 per claim.
The rule has been amended to that effect. 


Comment.

 The rule should encourage insurers to underwrite the risk by requiring them to analyze the risk of each abatement project
and assure that there is proper guidance and technical assistance throughout the abatement process. 


Response.

 The Underwriting Department of each insurance company is charged with the responsibility of approving and accepting
each risk they insure. Most insurance companies also have Loss Control Departments that work with their insureds
in an effort to promote safe work habits and procedures and reduce losses. It would be inappropriate for HUD to attempt
to dictate to the insurance company how they should underwrite and service the accounts they insure. 


Comment. 

Since the statutory requirement found in the 1992 Appropriations Act that coverage be purchased through a competitive
process expires with the promulgation of this regulation, HAs should be entitled to purchase this coverage from a
HA-owned insurance entity without competitive bidding. 


Response.

 We agree. Since issuance of the Final Rule setting Financial Standards for Housing Authority-Owned Insurance Entities
which became effective on November 4, 1993, HAs are now authorized to obtain any line of insurance from a non-profit
insurance entity that is owned and controlled by HAs and approved by HUD. Since this is now permitted by 24 CFR 905.190
and 965.201, no additional clarification in this rule is necessary. 


Comment.

 Paragraph (e) should be eliminated from the rule since it is gratuitous.

Response.

 The provision concerning the HA's responsibility for supervision of testing and abatement activity has been moved
to the general paragraph. 


Comment.

 Requiring small (some as low as one or two persons) contractors to purchase this type of insurance will have an enormous
impact on small businesses due to the high minimum premiums and total cost involved. 


Response.

 While this may very well be true, the Department is not willing to waive the insurance requirement for small businesses.
The underwriting standards of insurance companies may preclude them from insuring accounts that do not generate
a certain minimum premium. However, if the Department were to waive the insurance requirement for small contractors,
it would place both the contractor and the HA at risk for uninsured claims. 


Comment.

 The minimum required limit should be raised to $1,000,000 per occurrence with no annual aggregate being permitted.



Response.

 The $500,000 limit is only a minimum. Higher limits are permitted and highly recommended. It was not felt that the Department
should require substantially higher minimum limits than required for other forms of insurance, particularly automobile
and commercial general liability. The absence of an annual aggregate limit would be very desirable. However, few
insurance companies are willing to issue a policy without one. To insist upon having no annual aggregate limit would
severely restrict the market availability and certainly increase the cost. 


Comment.

 The rule should address all forms of insurance including workers compensation, general liability and professional
liability. 


Response.

 This rule is concerned only with the provisions of Pub. L. 102-139, 105 Stat. 736 concerning selection of insurance
to protect against the liability hazards involved in the testing and abatement of lead-based paint. 


IV. Findings and Certifications 


A. Environmental Review


A Finding of No Significant Impact with respect to the environment was made in accordance with HUD regulations at 24
CFR part 50 that implement section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, 42 U.S.C. 4332, when
the proposed rule was issued. No changes made in this final rule require any changes in that finding. The Finding of
No Significant Impact is available for public inspection and copying between 7:30 a.m. and 5:30 p.m. weekdays in the
Office of the Rules Docket Clerk, room 10276, 451 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 20410-0500. 


B. Federalism Impact


The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under section 6(a) of Executive Order 12612, Federalism, has determined
that the policies contained in this rule will not have substantial direct effects on states or their political subdivisions,
or the relationship between the Federal Government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities
among the various levels of government. This rule merely gives standards used by HUD in approving the sources of insurance
coverage selected by HAs in accordance with longstanding provisions of the contracts between them and HUD. As a result,
the rule is not subject to review under the order. 


C. Impact on the Family


The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under Executive Order 12606, The Family, has determined that this
rule does not have potential for significant impact on family formation, maintenance, and general well-being, and,
thus, is not subject to review under the order. No significant change in existing HUD policies or programs will result
from promulgation of this rule, as those policies and programs relate to family concerns. 


D. Impact on Small Entities


The Secretary, in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), has reviewed this rule before
publication and, by approving it, certifies that this rule does not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities. The rule is limited to specifying the nature and quality of liability insurance for the hazards
of testing for and abatement of lead-based paint; and while it may be more difficult for small entities to obtain the
insurance or to obtain it at a reasonable cost, this is a factor controlled by the insurance marketplace, and not by
the establishment of this rule. 


E. Regulatory Agenda


This rule was listed as item 1703 under the Office of Public and Indian Housing in the Department's Semiannual Agenda
of Regulations published on April 25, 1994 (59 FR 20424, 20474) under Executive Order 12866 and the Regulatory Flexibility
Act. 


F. Catalog


The Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance numbers for the public housing and Indian housing programs affected by
this rule are 14.850 and 14.851.

1. The authority citation for part 905 continues to read as follows: 





Authority:

 25 U.S.C. 450e(b); 42 U.S.C. 1437aa, 1437bb, 1437cc, 1437ee, and 3535(d).

 

2. A new  905.195 is added to subpart B, to read as follows: 


 905.195 

Lead-based paint liability insurance coverage. 


(a) 

General.

 The purpose of this section is to specify what HUD deems reasonable insurance coverage with respect to the hazards
associated with testing for and abatement of lead-based paint that the IHA undertakes, in accordance with the IHA's
ACC or MHACC with HUD. The insurance coverage does not relieve the IHA of its responsibility for assuring that lead-based
paint testing and abatement activities are conducted in a responsible manner. 
(b) 

Insurance coverage requirements.

 When the IHA undertakes lead-based paint testing and abatement, it must assure that it has reasonable insurance coverage
for itself for potential personal injury liability associated with those activities. If the work is being done by
IHA employees, the IHA must obtain a liability insurance policy directly to protect the IHA. If the work is being done
by a contractor, the IHA may obtain, from the insurer of the contractor performing this type of work in accordance with
a contract, a certificate of insurance providing evidence of such insurance and naming the IHA as an additional insured;
or it may obtain such insurance directly. Insurance must remain in effect during the entire period of testing and abatement
and must comply with the following requirements: 
(1) 

Named insured.

 If purchased by the IHA, the policy shall name the IHA as insured. If purchased by an independent contractor, the policy
shall name the contractor as insured and the IHA as an additional insured, in connection with performing work under
the IHA's lead-based paint testing and abatement contract. If the IHA has executed a contract with a Resident Management
Corporation (RMC) to manage a building/project on behalf of the IHA, the RMC shall also be an additional insured under
the policy in connection with the lead-based paint testing and abatement contract. (The duties of the RMC are similar
to those of a real estate management firm.) 
(2) 

Coverage limits.

 The minimum limit of liability shall be $500,000 per occurrence written, with a combined single limit for bodily injury
and property damage. 
(3) 

Deductible.

 A deductible, if any, may not exceed $5,000 per occurrence. 
(4) 

Supplementary payments.

 Payments for such supplementary costs as the costs of defending against a claim must be in addition to, and not as a reduction
of, the limit of liability. However, it will be permissible for the policy to have a limit on the amount payable for defense
costs. If a limit is applicable, it must not be less than $250,000 per claim prior to such costs being deducted from the
limit of liability. 
(5) 

Occurrence form policy.

 The form used must be an ``occurrence'' form, or a ``claims made'' form that contains an extended reporting period
of at least five years. (Under an occurrence form, coverage applies to any loss if the policy was in effect when the loss
occurred, regardless of when the claim is made.) 
(6) 

Aggregate limit.

 If the policy contains an aggregate limit, the minimum acceptable limit is $1,000,000. 
(7) 

Cancellation.

 In the event of cancellation, at least 30 days' advance notice is to be given to the insured and any additional insured.

(c) 

Exception to requirements. 

Insurance already purchased by the IHA or contractor and in force on the date this rule is effective which provides
coverage for the hazards involved in the testing for and abatement of lead-based paint, shall be considered as meeting
the requirements of this rule until the expiration of the policy. This rule is not applicable to architects, engineers,
or consultants who do not physically perform lead-based paint testing and abatement work.

(d) 

Insurance for the existence hazard. 

An IHA may also purchase special liability insurance against the existence hazard of lead-based paint, although
it is not a required coverage. An IHA may purchase this coverage if, in the opinion of the IHA, the policy meets the IHA's
requirements, the premium is reasonable, and the policy is obtained in accordance with applicable procurement standards
of this subpart B. If this coverage is purchased, the premium must be paid from funds available under the Performance
Funding System or from reserves.

5. A new  965.215 is added to subpart B, to read as follows:



 965.215


Lead-based paint liability insurance coverage.



(a) 

General. 

The purpose of this section is to specify what HUD deems reasonable insurance coverage with respect to the hazards
associated with testing for and abatement of lead-based paint that the PHA undertakes, in accordance with the PHA's
ACC with HUD. The insurance coverage does not relieve the PHA of its responsibility for assuring that lead-based paint

If purchased by the PHA, the policy shall name the PHA as insured. If purchased by an independent contractor, the policy
shall name the contractor as insured and the PHA as an additional insured, in connection with performing work under
the PHA's lead-based paint testing and abatement contract. If the PHA has executed a contract with a Resident Management
Corporation (RMC) to manage a building/project on behalf of the PHA, the RMC shall be an additional insured under the
policy in connection with the lead-based paint testing and abatement contract. (The duties of the RMC are similar
to those of a real estate management firm.)

(2) 

Coverage limits. 

The minimum limit of liability shall be $500,000 per occurrence written, with a combined single limit for bodily injury
and property damage.

Drawbridge Operation Regulations; Apponagansett River, Massachusetts



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Coast Guard, DOT.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of temporary deviation from regulations; request for comments.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Coast Guard has authorized the Town of Dartmouth, Massachusetts, to temporarily deviate for ninety (90) days
from the operating regulations governing the Padanaram Bridge mile 1.0 over the Apponagansett River in Dartmouth,
Massachusetts. This deviation limits the number of openings during peak traffic periods of the day. This deviation
will permit evaluation of the regulated opening schedule on both marine and vehicular traffic in conjunction with
the operation of new automatic, in lieu of manual, traffic gates.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
Background and Purpose




The Padanaram Bridge over the Apponagansett River between Dartmouth and South Dartmouth has a vertical clearance
of 9
' above mean high water (MHW) and 12
' above mean low water (MLW). The current operating regulations (33 CFR 117.587) provide that from 1 May to 31
October from 5 a.m. to 9 p.m. daily, the bridge need open on signal only on the hour and half hour. At all other times at
least six hours advance notice must be given.

This deviation permits the bridge to open twice an hour, on the hour and half hour, from 5 a.m. to 9 a.m. and from 8 p.m.
to 9 p.m. and once an hour on the hour from 9 a.m. to 8 p.m.

In the spring of 1993, the Town of Dartmouth requested a change from the operating regulations to permit opening once
an hour rather than twice an hour. The town selectmen felt that the traffic congestion during peak summer months was
a result of the bridge opening every 30 minutes and was causing village commerce to suffer. The selectmen also considered
the 30 minute opening schedule a serious risk to public safety because emergency vehicles could not travel to and from
South Dartmouth during the traffic delays caused by the bridge opening every half hour. The Town of Dartmouth requested
that the bridge be required to open only once an hour for a test period of 60 days to evaluate the effects on vehicular
and marine traffic. This request was approved and the first deviation from the permanent regulations was effective
from July 1, 1993, through August 29, 1993. See (58 FR 38056; July 15, 1993). It provided an opportunity to evaluate
the effects of the deviation on marine and vehicular traffic. The Coast Guard implemented a second deviation for thirty-two
days (32) to the regulations to evaluate alternative opening time periods for the Padanaram Bridge. See (58 FR 47067;
Sep. 7, 1993). There were 29 comment letters received for these deviation periods. Twenty were in favor of the hourly
openings and nine were opposed to the change. Most of the letters in opposition indicated that the lack of facilities
to tie up vessels while waiting for openings was the main concern. The Town of Dartmouth has installed traffic signals,
automatic traffic gates, navigational lights, clearance gauges and regulation signs since the last deviation period
of 32 days was implemented.

Additionally, a detailed engineering study has been prepared for major repairs to the bridge. The town has requested
state funds for the proposed repairs and expects approval in the fall of 1994. The Coast Guard is authorizing a third
deviation for a period of 90 days to evaluate the effects of the recent improvements to the bridge. This third temporary
deviation retains the requirement for the bridge to open on signal as soon as possible for vessels of the United States,
state and local vessels used for public safety and vessels in distress.


Request for Comments


The Coast Guard encourages interested persons to participate in evaluation of possible changes to the regulations
governing the Padanaram Bridge over the Apponagansett River by submitting written data, or arguments for or against
the deviation. Persons submitting comments should include their name and address and identify this Rulemaking (CGD01-94-058)
and the specific section of this deviation to which each comment applies, and give reason for each comment. Persons
wanting acknowledgment of receipt of comments should enclose a stamped self-addressed post card or envelope.
The Coast Guard will consider all comments received during the comment period. If it appears appropriate to propose
a permanent change to the regulations, the Coast Guard will publish a notice of proposed Rulemaking and request additional
comments as part of the Rulemaking process. All comments received from this and the previous deviations will be considered
in the Rulemaking process. Persons may submit comments by writing to the Commander (obr), First Coast Guard District
listed under ADDRESSES

.


Notice


Notice is hereby given that:
(1) The Coast Guard has granted the Town of Dartmouth, Massachusetts, a temporary deviation from the operating requirements
listed in 33 CFR 117.587 paragraph (b) governing the Padanaram Bridge over the Apponagansett River.
(2) This deviation from normal operating regulations is authorized in accordance with the provisions of 33 CFR 117.43
for the purpose of evaluating possible changes to the permanent regulations.
(3) The period of deviation is effective June 3, 1994 to August 31, 1994.
(4) During the deviation period the Padanaram Bridge shall operate as follows:
(i) From 5 a.m. to 9 a.m. and from 8 p.m. to 9 p.m. the bridge shall open on signal, twice an hour, on the hour and the half
hour.
(ii) From 9 a.m. to 8 p.m. the bridge shall open on signal once an hour, on the hour.
(iii) From 9 p.m. to 5 a.m. the bridge shall open on signal if at least 6 hours advance notice is given.

Safety Zone; Crescent Harbor, Sitka, AK


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Coast Guard, DOT.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Coast Guard is establishing a permanent safety zone in Crescent Harbor. The safety zone will protect life, limb
and property during the annual Independence Day fireworks display. The fireworks are launched from a barge or waterfront
facility, creating a safety hazard. Annual notice of these regulations will be published in the Local Notices to Mariners.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
Drafting Information


The drafters of these regulations are LTJG Andrew Tucci, Project Manager, and LT Brian McTague, Project Attorney,
Seventeenth Coast Guard District Legal Office.


Regulatory History


Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553, a notice of proposed rulemaking was published at 59 FR 10773 on March 8, 1994. Interested persons
were requested to submit comments and no comments were received.


Background and Purpose


The community of Sitka, Alaska holds a fireworks display on or about the 4th of July of each year to celebrate Independence
Day. The fireworks are launched from a barge or waterfront facility in Crescent Harbor. There is a well established
need for safety zones around vessels and facilities holding fireworks displays. Such displays draw large numbers
of spectators on vessels. Both persons and vessels could be endangered by coming too close to the source of the displays.
In addition to improving safety, this regulation will reduce the administrative burden associated with the creation
of temporary safety zones each year. Good cause exists for the rule to become effective in fewer than 30 days from the
date of 

Federal Register

 publication because the fireworks display will occur in less than 30 days and public safety must be provided. In addition,
this rule will not unreasonably burden the public or commerce since it will be in effect only a short time each year.


Regulatory Evaluation


This rule is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does not require an
assessment of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that order. It has been exempted from review by
the Office of Management and Budget under that order. It is not significant under the regulatory policies and procedures
of the Department of Transportation (DOT) (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). The Coast Guard expects the economic impact
of this rule to be so minimal that a full Regulatory Evaluation under paragraph 10e of the regulatory policies and procedures
of DOT is unnecessary. The safety zone will not affect commerce and will be in effect for only a few hours each year.


Small Entities


Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq.

), the Coast Guard must consider whether this regulation will have a significant impact on a substantial number of
small entities. ``Small entities'' include independently owned and operated small businesses that are not dominant
in their field and that otherwise qualify as ``small business concerns'' under Section 3 of the Small Business Act
(15 U.S.C. 632). The Coast Guard expects the impact of this regulation to be minimal. The Coast Guard certifies under
5 U.S.C. 605(b) that this regulation will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.


Collection of Information


This regulation contains no collection of information requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C.
3501 

et seq.

).


Federalism


The Coast Guard has analyzed this action in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order
12612 and has determined that this regulation does not raise sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation
of a Federalism Assessment.


Environment


The Coast Guard has considered the environmental impact of this rule and concluded that, under section 2.B.2.c. of
Commandant Instruction M16475.1B, this rule is categorically excluded from further environmental documentation.

Safety Zone; Gastineau Channel, Juneau, AK



<AGENCY>

Coast Guard, DOT.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Coast Guard is establishing a permanent safety zone in Juneau Harbor. The safety zone will protect life, limb and
property during the annual Independence Day fireworks display. The fireworks are launched from a barge or waterfront
facility, creating a safety hazard. Annual notice of these regulations will be published in the Local Notices to Mariners.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
Drafting Information




The drafters of these regulations are LTJG Andrew Tucci, Project Manager, and LT Brian McTague, Project Attorney,
Seventeenth Coast Guard District Legal Office.


Regulatory History



Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553, a notice of proposed rulemaking was published at 59 FR 10774 on March 8, 1994. Interested persons
were requested to submit comments and no comments were received.


Background and Purpose



The City and Borough of Juneau, Alaska holds a fireworks display on or about the 4th of July of each year to celebrate
Independence Day. The fireworks are launched from a barge or waterfront facility in Juneau Harbor. There is a well
established need for safety zones around vessels and facilities holding fireworks displays. Such displays draw
large numbers of spectators on vessels. Both persons and vessels could be endangered by coming too close to the source
of the displays. In addition to improving safety, this regulation will reduce the administrative burden associated
with the creation of temporary safety zones each year. Good cause exists for the rule to become effective in fewer than
30 days from the date of 

Federal Register

 publication because the fireworks display will occur in less than 30 days and public safety must be provided. In addition,
this rule will not unreasonably burden the public or commerce since it will be in effect only a short time each year.


Regulatory Evaluation



This rule is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does not require an
assessment of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that order. It has been exempted from review by
the office of Management and Budget under that order. It is not significant under the regulatory policies and procedures
of the Department of Transportation (DOT) (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). The Coast Guard expects the economic impact
of this rule to be so minimal that a full Regulatory Evaluation under paragraph 10e of the regulatory policies and procedures
of DOT is unnecessary. The safety zone will not affect commerce and will be in effect for only a few hours each year.


Small Entities



Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq.

), the Coast Guard must consider whether this regulation will have a significant impact on a substantial number of
small entities. ``Small entities'' include independently owned and operated small businesses that are not dominant
in their field and that otherwise qualify as ``small business concerns'' under Section 3 of the Small Business Act
(15 U.S.C. 632). The Coast Guard expects the impact of this regulation to be minimal. The Coast Guard certifies under
5 U.S.C. 605(b) that this regulation will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.


Collection of Information



This regulation contains no collection of information requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C.
3501 

et seq.

)


Federalism



The Coast Guard has analyzed this action in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order
12612 and has determined that this regulation does not raise sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation
of a Federalism Assessment.


Environment



The Coast Guard has considered the environmental impact of this rule and concluded that, under section 2.B.2.c. of
Commandant Instruction M16475.1B, this rule is categorically excluded from further environmental documentation.

Safety Zone Regulations; Fireworks Display; Elliott Bay, Seattle, WA



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Coast Guard, DOT.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Temporary final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Coast Guard is establishing a safety zone for the Independence Day fireworks display to be held on July 4 from 9:30
p.m. (PDT) until 11 p.m. (PDT). The fireworks display barge will be positioned near the shoreside of Elliott Bay, Seattle,
Washington in the area of Myrtle Edwards Park. This safety zone is necessary to control spectator craft and to provide
for the safety of life and property on and in the vicinity of navigable waters during the event.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 553, a notice of proposed rulemaking has not been published for these regulations and good
cause exists for making them effective in less than 30 days from the date of publication. Following normal rulemaking
procedures would have been impracticable. The application to hold the event was just recently received leaving insufficient
time to publish proposed rules in advance of the event or to provide for a delayed effective date.



Drafting Information



The drafters of this temporary final rule are LT Andrew W. Connor, project officer, and LT Laticia J. Argenti, project
attorney, Coast Guard District Thirteen Legal Office.



Discussion of Regulations



The Elliott Bay Fireworks Display is being held as part of the celebration for the Fourth of July Independence Day in
Seattle, Washington. This event is sponsored by Ivar's Restaurants. The fireworks display is conducted from a barge
located on the waters of Elliott Bay, Seattle, Washington. This one-day event attracts a large number of spectators
gathered on the waters near the fireworks display. To promote the safety of both the spectators and participants,
this safety zone is required to keep spectators away from the explosive fireworks barge during the fireworks display.
The exclusionary area is designed to keep all spectators away from the fireworks barge.



Regulatory Evaluation



This proposed rule is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does not
require an assessment of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that order. It has been exempted from
review by the Office of Management and Budget under that order. It is not significant under the regulatory policies
and procedures of the Department of Transportation (DOT) (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). The Coast Guard expects
the economic impact of this proposal to be so minimal that a full Regulatory Evaluation under paragraph 10e of the regulatory
policies and procedures of DOT is unnecessary.



Federalism Assessment



This action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612,
and it has been determined that the proposed rulemaking does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant
the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.



Environmental Assessment



This temporary rule has been thoroughly reviewed by the Coast Guard and determined to be categorically excluded from
further environmental documentation in accordance with section 2.B.2.C. of Commandant Instruction M16475.1B.
A Categorical Exclusion Determination statement has been prepared and placed in the rulemaking docket.

This proposed rule is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does not
require an assessment of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that order. It has been exempted from
review by the Office of Management and Budget under that order. It is not significant under the regulatory policies
and procedures of the Department of Transportation (DOT) (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). The Coast Guard expects
the economic impact of this proposal to be so minimal that a full Regulatory Evaluation under paragraph 10e of the regulatory
policies and procedures of DOT is unnecessary.



Federalism Assessment



This action has been analyzed in accordance with the principals and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612,
and it has been determined that the proposed rulemaking does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant
the preparation of a Federal Assessment.



Environmental Assessment



This temporary rule has been thoroughly reviewed by the Coast Guard and determined to be categorically excluded from
further environmental documentation in accordance with section 2.B.2.C. of Commandant Instruction M16475.1B.
A Categorical Exclusion Determination statement has been prepared and placed in the rulemaking docket.

ACTION:

 Final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 NMFS issues this final rule to implement measures in Amendment 5 to the Fishery Management Plan for the American Lobster
Fishery (FMP). Amendment 5 is intended to eliminate overfishing of American lobsters in the exclusive economic zone
(EEZ), with anticipated complementary management action in state waters. A final rule published on May 20, 1994 (59
FR 26454), implemented one of the measures approved under Amendment 5_maintenance of the current 31/4-inch (8.26-cm)
minimum carapace length. This rule implements the remaining measures approved under Amendment 5: Limits on the issuance
of new Federal vessel permits for a 5-year period, change in escape vent width, dealer permits, operator permits,
a framework process to develop a stock rebuilding program, and a revised definition of overfishing.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 


Background


Amendment 5, with some exceptions, was approved by NMFS on May 11, 1994. Background to the amendment was discussed
in the proposed rule (59 FR 11029, March 9, 1994), and is not repeated here.


Approved Management Measures


NMFS is implementing the approved measures of Amendment 5 through two separate final rules. The first was published
on May 20, 1994 (59 FR 26454). That final rule maintained the minimum carapace length for lobsters at 31/4 inches (8.26
cm), thereby rescinding the scheduled increases in the minimum size. This rule implements the remaining approved
provisions of Amendment 5: (1) A 5-year moratorium on the issuance of new Federal vessel permits, (2) dealer and vessel
operator permit requirements, (3) a decrease in the minimum width of the lobster trap escape vent from 6 inches (152.4
mm) to 5-3/4 inches (146.1 mm), and (4) a framework process that requires the development of a stock rebuilding
program in four management areas in the EEZ (Gulf of Maine Near-shore, Southern New England Near-shore, Middle Atlantic
Near-shore, and Offshore) by the end of the first year of implementation of Amendment 5. The framework process calls
for the establishment of Effort Management Teams (EMTs) for each management area to develop area-specific management
measures. 
Amendment 5 also revises the overfishing definition for American lobster to read: 




The resource is recruitment overfished when, throughout its range, the fishing mortality rate (F), given the regulations
in place at that time under the suite of regional management measures, results in a reduction in estimated egg production
per recruit to 10 percent or less of a non-fished population (F
814

10%

)




With respect to the definition, the Amendment also specifies that the development of the status of the stock report
and the evaluation of fishery-induced effects will consider information based upon one or more indices, including
but not limited to: (1) Larval abundance index in surface waters, (2) larval settlement index, (3) pre-recruit indices
by year class, (4) landings, (5) size composition of the landings, (6) spawning stock biomass, (7) numbers of egg-bearing
females, (8) effort levels and catch per unit of effort, and (9) possible relationships of biological parameters
to water temperatures or other environmental parameters. Although much of this information is currently unavailable,
it is NMFS' intent to incorporate this information, as appropriate, into the determination of whether the fishery
is being overfished when such information can be developed into valid, quantifiable indices of overfishing.
Based on the definition, the lobster resource is overfished. To achieve reductions in fishing mortality, Amendment
5 includes a framework process requiring the New England Fishery Management Council (Council) to develop a stock
rebuilding program during the first year of implementation. The management measures may include any of the framework
measures specified under  649.44(d). These measures may be applied to all segments of the harvesting sector
within each management area.
To determine which of these measures will be implemented in each of the management areas, Amendment 5 establishes
an EMT for each management area. Each EMT is charged with recommending to the Council a stock rebuilding program for
its area no later than January 20, 1995. Based on the EMT recommendations, the Council is required to submit framework
management measures to the Director, Northeast Region NMFS (Regional Director). This development timeframe is
designed to provide industry members within each area with the opportunity to reach a consensus by July 20, 1995 as
to which options listed in  649.44(d) should apply in their respective management area. NMFS has informed the
Council, in a letter from the Regional Director dated May 11, 1994, that if the EMTs are unable to make their deadline,
then NMFS will begin the process of withdrawing the FMP.
The Council recommended to NMFS that the initial specification of a seaward boundary line of the Southern New England
Near-shore area, which is contiguous with part of the Offshore area, be as set forth in  649.42 (see Figure 3 of
part 649). The Council will determine the final location of a boundary line after the EMTs for these areas jointly consider
the issue and make a recommendation to the Council. Long Island Sound, under the jurisdiction of the coastal states
and not part of the EEZ, is not specifically part of the Southern New England Near-shore area.
Amendment 5 includes new permitting requirements for vessel operators and dealers, and limits the requirements
for limited access vessel permits for a period of 5 years. During the third year of the new permit requirements, the
Council will conduct a formal review to determine whether the limitation on permits is necessary to the stock rebuilding
program. The Council may choose to extend the limitation on new permits for a specified period or terminate it if it
determines that such action is consistent with the stock rebuilding program. 
Amendment 5 specifies the lobster fishery control date as March 25, 1991, rather than January 9, 1991, as published
in the 

Federal Register

 on March 25, 1991 (56 FR 12366). Shortly after publication of the control date of January 9, 1991, the Council agreed
to adjust that date to the date of publication of the control date notice_March 25, 1991. The EMTs will consider the
following control date guidelines during development of the stock rebuilding program: (1) In the event that a system
of assigning fishing rights is developed as part of the FMP, such assignments shall be based on historical levels of
participation in the fishery prior to March 25, 1991, with consideration for recent investments that have not yet
been reflected in measures of participation; (2) new or re-rigged vessels will be given consideration in the assignment
of fishing rights if (a) the vessel was under construction or re-rigging for directed lobster fishing as of March 25,
1991, as evidenced by written construction contracts, work orders, equipment purchases, or other evidence of substantial
investment and intent to participate in the lobster fishery; and (b) the vessel possessed an American lobster permit
and landed lobster prior to March 25, 1992; (3) historical participation will transfer with a vessel for a transfer
made after March 25, 1991, unless such transfer is accompanied by a written document indicating the agreement of both
the buyer and the seller that any future fishing rights applicable to that vessel are not being transferred with the
vessel; and (4) any system of assigning fishing rights will take into consideration the following concerns relative
to individuals or corporations that have sold a vessel within the time that may be chosen to determine historical fishing
rights: (a) The degree of economic dependence upon the lobster fishery, including, but not limited to the percentage
of income derived from the lobster fishery; (b) the extent of past participation in the lobster fishery; and (c) the
demonstration of intent prior to March 25, 1991, to re-enter the lobster fishery with another vessel.


Delayed and Disapproved Measures and the Reasons for Disapproval


The limited access permit requirements and the vessel operator permit requirements will be implemented in 1995,
so that they can be included as part of the 1995 permitting process. The annual permit renewal begins in August-September
of each year, and limited access lobster vessel permits and vessel operator permits will be required on January 1,
1995. This implementation schedule will ensure that NMFS can administer the requirement with the minimum burden
upon applicants. 
Three measures proposed in Amendment 5 were disapproved. Two measures were disapproved because they were inconsistent
with national standard 4 of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson Act), which requires
that any allocation of fishing privileges be fair and equitable. These measures would have established three vessel
permit categories and would have set a quota for vessels issued a permit and using gear other than lobster pots. The
proposed permit categories and quota would have unfairly impacted, without adequate justification, one segment
of the fishery while allowing unrestrained increases in other sectors of the fishery.
Also disapproved were the Council's proposed mandatory reporting requirements for dealers and vessels. The Council
has not demonstrated that the benefits of the mandatory reporting requirements justify the costs, as required by
E.O. 12866, particularly in light of the fact that the majority of lobsters are harvested from state waters. NMFS will
pursue a cooperative approach with the states to share the costs of such a data collection.


Comments and Responses


NMFS received comments on the proposed rule from one U.S. Senator, the U.S. Coast Guard, the Council, four Maine state
representatives, five fishing industry associations, and nine individuals. All of the comments were carefully
considered during the formulation of this final rule. Specific comments are discussed and responded to below.
The Council submitted comments requesting several clarifications and changes to the regulatory text. Most of these
changes are noted in the Changes from the Proposed Rule section of this preamble. In addition to these changes, the
Council requested that a provision restricting party, charter, and dive boats to six or fewer lobsters per person
on board be expanded to include any fishing vessel. NMFS is not implementing this provision because it was not included
as part of Amendment 5 and, as such, has not received adequate public notice and comment. The Council also requested
that vessel owners not be in violation of the prohibition against selling or transferring fish to unpermitted dealers
unless the sale or transfer were done knowingly. NMFS has not adopted this change because it would make enforcement
of this prohibition almost impossible and because it would be inconsistent with similar prohibitions in other fishery
management plans. In any event, NMFS will exercise discretion in enforcing this prohibition in cases where vessel
owners could not reasonably be expected to know whether a dealer was validly permitted.


Comment

: A U.S. Senator, the Coast Guard, four industry associations, and six individuals stated that the amendment should
be approved.


Response

: The comments have been noted and the amendment was partially approved, as explained above.


Comment

: One individual objected to the specific eligibility criteria for a limited access vessel permit that require a vessel
or vessel owner to have been issued a Federal American lobster permit, or a federally endorsed state American lobster
permit, and to have landed American lobsters prior to March 25, 1991.


Response

: This provision complies with the Magnuson Act requirements for establishing a system for limited access to a fishery.
If a system for limiting access to a fishery is included in a fishery management plan, the Magnuson Act requires the
Council and NMFS to take into account such factors as present participation in the fishery, historical fishing practices
and dependence on the fishery, and capability of vessels to be used in other fisheries. The Council and NMFS considered
all of these factors in establishing criteria required to qualify for full participation in the American lobster
fishery. A control date was announced on March 25, 1991 (56 FR 12366), which gave notice to participants and potential
participants that future participation in the fishery may be limited for vessels that entered the fishery after the
control date. The purpose of the control date was to discourage increases in fishing effort and speculative entry
into the fishery while development of Amendment 5 progressed.
Amendment 5 also establishes an exemption to the limited access fishery for party, charter and dive boats in possession
of six or fewer lobsters per person, or for recreational vessels and vessels that fish exclusively in state waters
for lobsters. Therefore, Amendment 5 provides the opportunity for recreational operators and other types of operators
who fish exclusively in state waters to participate in the fishery while discouraging further increases in fishing
mortality by limiting the number of participants in the fishery.


Comment

: Two individuals requested that the boundary line between Management Areas 2 and 3 be omitted. Another requested
that Management Area 4 be split into two zones.


Response

: The Council decided, and NMFS agrees, that a boundary line between the Southern New England Near-shore area and the
Offshore area is needed to define the areas in the final rule so that appropriate area specific management measures
can be developed. The Council has stated that future boundary lines for the areas will be considered jointly by the
EMTs for these areas and that the EMTs will make recommendation on changes to the Council. 


Comment

: Two individuals requested that the boundary line for the Management Areas be specified by Loran C coordinates, rather
than by latitude and longitude.


Response

: All boundary lines listed in Federal fishery regulations are specified by latitude and longitude, because such
coordinates are more precise and accurate for enforcement purposes.


Comment

: Three individuals stated that the amendment should be disapproved because it violates national standards. One
industry association stated specifically that Amendment 5 violates: (1) National standard 1, because it does nothing
to prevent overfishing; (2) national standard 2, because it does not use the best scientific information available;
(3) national standard 3, because the Amendment establishes management zones that do not manage the lobster stock
throughout the range of the stock; (4) national standard 4, because the Amendment discriminates against the mobile
gear sector; (5) national standard 5, because there are severe restrictions placed on the mobile gear sector and absolutely
none on the trap sector; (6) national standard 6, because the Amendment ignores the fact that mobile gear is a variation
within the lobster fishery; (7) national standard 7, because, by establishing EMTs, the Amendment does not minimize
costs.


Response

: With the exception of the disapproved portions of Amendment 5 noted above, NMFS has determined that the measures
included in Amendment 5 are consistent with all of the national standards. Specific responses to the comments follows.

Amendment 5 is consistent with national standard 1 because it mandates a timetable to implement measures to address
overfishing based on a specific definition of overfishing, and creates a framework system to change management measures
proposed by the Council. The process is designed to develop an industry consensus, through the EMTs and the Council,
concerning the most effective management measures to achieve the objectives of the FMP to reduce fishing mortality
in each of the four management areas. Thus, Amendment 5, as implemented, specifies the process, the timetable, and
the specific biological objectives that will achieve the objectives of the FMP in addressing overfishing. If the
Council fails to submit management measures sufficient to meet the FMP objectives, the regulations require the Secretary
to determine whether preparation of an amendment to the FMP is necessary. In addition, NMFS stated in a letter notifying
the Council of partial disapproval Amendment 5 that it will begin the process to withdraw the American lobster FMP
if the EMTs have not submitted recommendations to the Council concerning management measures within 6 months after
the effective date of the regulations implementing Amendment 5.
Amendment 5 is consistent with national standard 2 because the Council determined, and NMFS agrees, that the NMFS
weighout database is the best scientific information available in determining the conservation and management
measures. Further, any new available data will be considered in reviewing specific management measures submitted
to NMFS under the first-year framework process.
National standard 3 states that ``to the extent practicable,'' an individual stock of fish shall be managed as a unit
throughout the range. The overall objective of the FMP is to support and promote the development and implementation,
on a continuing basis, of a unified, regional management program for lobster. The American lobster FMP and Amendment
5, as implemented by this rule, establishes a system to manage the lobster stock as a unit throughout the range. The
provision for management areas recognizes that individual measures to achieve the overall FMP objectives may need
to vary because of regional and state differences in how the lobster fishery is conducted. This is consistent with
national standard 3, which provides that FMPs need not be identical for each geographic area within the management
unit, if the FMP justifies the differences. Since more than 80 percent of the lobster fishery occurs in state waters,
this approach is needed to insure consistent, comparable management measures among the various states engaged in
the fishery.
The measures that create different categories based on gear were disapproved because national standard 4 requires
that any allocation of fishing privileges be fair and equitable. The permit categories and quota, although intended
only to cap effort and prevent re-direction of effort from other fisheries, impact, without adequate justification,
only one segment of the fishery and continue to allow unrestrained increases in other sectors (with the exception
of the permit moratorium which affects all sectors equally).
Pertaining to national standard 5, the measures that place restrictions on the mobile gear sector have been disapproved
for the reasons stated above.
Pertaining to national standard 6, for the reasons stated above, gear categories were disapproved.
National standard 7 states that, ``where practicable,'' management measures shall minimize costs. This amendment
creates EMTs for each of the four management areas to address concerns of geographic differences in the lobster fishery
as permitted under national standard 3, as discussed above. Since more than 80 percent of the lobster fishery occurs
in state waters, NMFS has determined that this approach is a practicable, cost-efficient way to insure consistent,
comparable management measures among the various states bordering the four management areas established by Amendment
5. In particular, this approach is necessary to be consistent with the agency's guidelines on national standard 7,
which state that a factor in deciding whether a fishery needs management through regulations implementing an FMP
is the need to resolve competing interests and conflicts among user groups and whether a measure can further that resolution.


Comment

: One individual opposed the requirement for mandatory vessel logbooks.


Response

: This requirement was disapproved.


Comment

: Two individuals requested that representation on the EMTs include draggers and divers.


Response

: Members of each EMT will be appointed by the Council, in consultation with appropriate states and NMFS. This final
rule does not restrict or require participation on the EMTs by any specific group or groups.


Comment

: One individual requested that the definition of recreational fishing vessel be changed to include dive vessels.


Response

: The definition for recreational fishing vessels includes dive vessels, provided that lobster harvested by dive
vessels are not intended to be, nor are they, bartered, traded, or sold.


Comment

: A U.S. Senator and two industry associations expressed concern with the 100 lobster possession restrictions and
the target quota for non-lobster pot vessels.


Response

: These provisions have been disapproved.


Comment

: One industry association asked if the wording of the overfishing definition as defined in Amendment 5 will mandate
a change in the way future overfishing will be determined.


Response

: The overfishing definition in the Amendment will be the objective measurement of the status of the lobster stock
and complies with the 50 CFR part 602 guidelines.


Comment

: Four Maine state legislators expressed concern over conflicting state and Federal American lobster regulations.


Response

: The overall objective of the FMP is to support and promote the development and implementation, on a continuing basis,
of a unified, regional management program for lobster. The final rule published on May 20, 1994 (59 FR 26454) is consistent
with this objective by maintaining the minimum size at 31/4 inches (8.26 cm).


Comment

: Four Maine state representatives expressed concern that the Maine Legislature's Joint Standing Committee on Maine
Resources was not contacted to discuss any perceived or actual concerns about the lobster resource.


Response

: The Coastal Zone Management Act requires that the coastal zone agency of each state affected by Amendment 5 be contacted
and asked whether they agree that the amendment is consistent, to the maximum extent practicable, with their federally
approved coastal zone management program. On February 7, 1994, the Council sent a letter to the Coastal Program Manager
for the State of Maine, and on February 11, 1994, the Council received a reply from the State of Maine that determined
the amendment was consistent with the enforceable policies of the Maine Coastal Program. In addition, the Commissioner
of the Maine Department of Marine Resources serves on the Council.


Comment

: One industry association expressed concern that the wording under  649.9(d)(1) does not exempt recreational
vessels.


Response

: NMFS has modified  649.4(a) and  649.9(d)(1) to clarify that recreational vessels are exempt from the
permit requirements. 


 Comment

: One industry association pointed out that recreational fishing vessels, as defined in the proposed rule, were not
limited to six or fewer American lobsters per person aboard the vessel at any time.


Response

: It was not the intent of Amendment 5 to restrict the recreational fishery for American lobsters. However, by definition,
recreational vessels are prohibited from bartering, trading, or selling lobster. 


Comment

: One individual objected to the requirement for an operator permit and stated that it should be the responsibility
of the vessel owner to make sure that the vessel operator is fully aware of, and follows, all regulations.


Response

: The intent of this measure is to improve regulatory compliance by those who are most directly able to control the actions
of the vessel and crew. The number of operators having their permit suspended or revoked is expected to be relatively
small. Penalties would be assessed against a vessel operator only if the vessel operator is determined to have been
involved in a major violation or is a significant repeat offender of Federal fishing regulations. The language gives
notice to the vessel operator that his/her right and privilege to operate and serve on a federally permitted fishing
vessel is subject to the condition that right may be suspended or revoked in certain circumstances. Without the possibility
of suspending or revoking an operator's right to serve in any capacity on a federally permitted vessel, the purpose
of requiring operator's permits would be meaningless. The language also puts the operator on notice that he/she will
be responsible for his/her actions and will not be able to move to another vessel should a suspension occur. It is consistent
with a vessel permit suspension, which takes the vessel out of the fishery during the time of suspension.


Changes from the Proposed Rule


Changes were made to several sections of the proposed rule to clarify the measures and to ensure consistency with other
fishery regulations. In addition, substantive changes are made to the following sections:
In  649.1, the narrative within the first paragraph is modified to add the phrase ``This part implements the
Fishery Management Plan for the American Lobster Fishery (FMP), as amended by the New England Fishery Management
Council in consultation with the Mid-Atlantic Fishery Management Council and the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries
Commission (ASMFC), and approved by the Assistant Administrator for Fisheries'' to clarify further the purpose
and scope of the FMP.
In  649.2, the definition of an ``Effort Monitoring Team'' is modified to add the phrase ``a group of American
lobster industry representatives (appointed by the Council)'' to clarify who the appointing authority is for the
EMT.
In  649.2, the definition of a ``ghost panel'' is modified to add the phrase ``after a period of time if the'' to
clarify the meaning of a ghost panel.
In  649.2, the definition of ``Lobster Plan Development Team'' is not used in these regulations and is deleted
from this final rule. 
In  649.2, the definition of a ``lobster pot trawl'' is added.
In  649.2, the definitions of ``reporting month and reporting week'' are deleted from this final rule. The vessel
and dealer reporting requirement measures were disapproved by NMFS; therefore, these definitions are no longer
necessary.
In  649.2, the definition of ``sixth tail segment'' is not used in these regulations and is deleted from this
final rule. 
In  649.2, the definition of a ``whole American lobster'' is modified to add the phrase ``A cull whole American
lobster is an American lobster with one or both claws missing,'' to clarify the meaning of a whole American lobster.
In  649.4 paragraphs (a)(1), (2), and (3) are added to clarify NMFS' intent to allow 1994 permits to remain effective
until December 31, 1994, and the remaining paragraphs of the section are redesignated accordingly.
In  649.4(b), the narrative in the introductory text is modified to add the phrase ``From January 1, 1995, through
December 31, 1999,'' to clarify NMFS' intent to start issuing limited access American lobster permits in 1995 and
that this permit requirement will expire at the end of 1999. In the same paragraph, the phrase ``not intended for or
resulting in trade, barter or sale'' is added to clarify which vessels do not require a limited access American lobster
permit.
In  649.4(b)(1)(B), the phrase ``or federally endorsed state American lobster permit,'' is added to clarify
that a vessel issued a federally endorsed state American lobster permit can also qualify for a limited access permit.
In  649.4(b)(2), the phrase ``for the years after 1996 - 1999'' is added to clarify the intent of Amendment 5 to
limit the issuance of limited access vessel permits for a period of 5 years.
In  649.4, paragraph (b)(2)(ii) is added to clarify the intent of Amendment 5 to limit the issuance of limited
access vessel permits for a period of 5 years.
In  649.4(e), the word ``overall'' is added to clarify what vessel length information is needed.
In  649.4(h), the phrase ``A Federal American lobster permit will expire upon the renewal date specified in
the permit'' is added to correct a statement in the proposed rule.
In  649.5(a), the phrase ``Beginning on January 1, 1995,'' is added to clarify NMFS' intent to require operator
permits beginning in 1995, the phrase ``not intended for or resulting in trade, barter or sale'' is added to clarify
further who does not require a vessel operator permit, and text is added to clarify further the requirement for an operator
permit.
In  649.5, paragraph (g) was revised to correct an error in the proposed rule.
In  649.6(b), the sentence, ``For 1994, a copy of an applicant's completed application will serve as a temporary
permit until the applicant has received a permanent permit.'' is added. Since dealers are required to have Federal
permits upon the effective date of this final rule, there is not sufficient time for applicants to comply with the requirement
to have their permit application submitted 30 days prior to the date they desire the permit to be effective. This will
alleviate that problem.
In  649.6(e), the phrase ``and the applicant has submitted all applicable reports specified in  649.7(a)''
is deleted. The vessel and dealer reporting requirement measures were disapproved by NMFS; therefore, this phrase
is no longer necessary.
In  649.6, paragraph (f) is revised to correct a statement in the proposed rule.
In  649.8(a)(6), the phrase ``unless such gear has been rendered unfishable'' is added to allow for the retrieval
of lost gear or the unintentional catching of lost lobster pots by trawl vessels and subsequent repairing or destroying
of the gear on shore.
In  649.8(b), the phrase ``or unless the vessel is a recreational vessels or vessel fishing for American lobsters
exclusively in state waters'' is added to clarify exemptions to this prohibition.
In  649.8(c)(5), the phrase ``Beginning on January 1, 1995,'' is added to clarify that the operator permit requirement
is not effective until 1995.
In  649.8, paragraph (c)(10) is added to codify the statutory requirements under section 307(1)(J) of the Magnuson
Act.
In  649.8(c)(1)(iii) is modified to add the phrase ``per person on board the vessel and the'' was added to clarify
further the intent of the prohibition.
In  649.20, the section heading is revised to clarify the meaning of the section, and paragraphs (b)(3), (d)(3),
and (e)(3) were added to codify the statutory requirements under section 307(1)(J) of the Magnuson Act.
In  649.23, the prohibition on transferring fish from one vessel to another while at sea is deleted because the
landing and quota requirements proposed by the Council have been disapproved and this measure is no longer necessary.
In  649.42, point I is added to the table in paragraph (b)(2) because it was inadvertently omitted in the proposed
rule, and the heading of paragraph (b)(4) is modified to add the word ``EEZ'' to clarify that the near-shore waters
referred to in the table are in Federal waters.
In  649.43, paragraph (b)(11) is redesignated paragraph (b)(12), a new paragraph (b)(11) is added to clarify
the Council's intent that the control date guidelines be retained for consideration by the EMTs, and paragraph (b)(12)
is revised to clarify the Council's intent on recommending adjustments or additions to management measures.
In  649.43, paragraph (e) is redesignated paragraph (f), and a new paragraph (e) is added to clarify that the
Council is not precluded from taking necessary management actions in year 1 by the other requirements of  649.43.
In  649.44(c), the references to Plan Development Teams (PDTs) are deleted to clarify that frameworks, as described
in Amendment 5 are tied to EMTs, specifically. PDTs may, at the discretion of the Council, develop independent findings
and recommendations. Also, the phrase ``shall provide the appropriate rationale and economic and biological analysis
for its recommendation, utilizing the most current catch, effort, and other relevant data from the fishery'' is removed
from paragraph (c) of this section, and placed in  649.44(d) to clarify further the Council's intent on who should
prepare the required analysis.
In  649.44, paragraph (d)(11) is redesignated to (d)(12), and a new paragraph (b)(11) is added to clarify the
Council's intent that the control date guidelines be retained. Redesignated paragraph (d)(12) is revised to clarify
the Council's intent on recommending adjustments or additions to management measures.
Since all recordkeeping and reporting requirements contained in  649.7 were disapproved, sections 649.8
(Vessel identification), 649.9 (prohibitions), 649.10 (Facilitation and enforcement), and 649.11 (penalties)
in the proposed rule are redesignated as   649.7, 649.8, 649.9, and 649.10, respectively, in this final
rule.
Since the contents of  649.22 (possession restrictions and target quota), 649.23 (transfer at sea), and 649.24
(restrictions on trawl gear while in the trap fishery) in the proposed rule were disapproved,  649.25 (experimental
fishing exemption) of the proposed rule is redesignated as  649.22 in this final rule.


Republication of Part of 50 CFR Part 649


A revised version of  649.20(b)(1) and (2) was published in the first final rule (59 FR 26454, May 20, 1994) for
Amendment 5, effective May 17, 1994. Those paragraphs are republished here for the convenience of the reader so as
to have the entire 50 CFR part 649 published together.


Classification


The General Counsel of the Department of Commerce certified to the Small Business Administration when this rule was
proposed that if adopted, it would not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. Therefore,
an initial regulatory flexibility analysis was not prepared.
This rule contains two new collection-of-information requirements and two revisions to existing requirements
previously approved by OMB. These collection-of-information requirements have been approved by OMB. Nevertheless,
public comments are invited on the burden-hour estimates for the collection of information requirements as listed
below.
The new reporting requirements are:
1. Dealer permits, OMB Control No. 0648-0202, (5 min./response);
2. Operator permits, OMB Control No. 0648-0202, (1 hour/response).
Revisions to the existing requirements are:
1. Vessel permits, OMB Control No. 0648-0202, (1 hour/response);
2. Vessel permits, appeal of denied vessel permit, OMB Control No. 0648-0202, (3 hours/response);
This final rule has been determined to be not significant for purposes of E.O. 12866.

Vessel permits.


(a) 

1994 vessel permits

. (1) Through December 31, 1994, any vessel of the United States fishing for American lobster in the EEZ must have been
issued and carry on board a valid permit required by or issued under this part. The Regional Director may, by agreement
with State agencies, recognize permits or licenses issued by those agencies endorsed for fishing for lobster in the
EEZ, providing that such permitting programs accurately identify persons who fish in the EEZ, and that the Regional
Director can either individually, or in concert with the state agency, act to suspend the permit or license for EEZ
fishing for any violation under this part.
(2) Alternate State EEZ permitting programs will be established through a letter of agreement between the Regional
Director and the director of the State marine fisheries agency concerned. The letter of agreement will specify the
information to be collected by the alternate EEZ permitting program and the mode and frequency of provision of that
information to the Regional Director. The Regional Director will, in cooperation with the State director, arrange
for notification of the existence and terms of any such agreements to the affected persons. Persons intending to fish
in the EEZ should determine whether an alternate EEZ permitting program is in force for their state before applying
for a Federal permit under paragraph (d) of this section. 
(3) Vessel owners or operators who apply for a fishing vessel permit under this section, or for a State permit endorsed
for EEZ fishing under paragraph (a)(2) of this section, must agree, as a condition of the permit, that all the vessel's
lobster fishing, catch, and gear (without regard to whether such fishing occurs in the EEZ or landward of the EEZ, and
without regard to where such lobster, lobster meats, or parts, or gear are possessed, taken or landed) will be subject
to all the requirements of this part. All such fishing, catch, and gear will remain subject to any applicable state
or local requirements. If a requirement of this part and a conservation measure required by state or local law differ,
any vessel owner or operator permitted to fish in the EEZ must comply with the more restrictive requirement.
(b) 

Limited access American lobster permits

. From January 1, 1995, through December 31, 1999, any vessel of the United States that fishes for, possesses, or lands
American lobster, in or harvested from the EEZ, must have been issued and carry on board a valid Federal limited access
American lobster permit. This requirement does not apply to party, charter and dive boats that possess six or fewer
American lobsters, not intended for or resulting in trade, barter or sale, per person aboard the vessel at any time,
or to recreational vessels, and vessels that fish exclusively in state waters for American lobsters.
(1) 

Eligibility in 1995

. (i) To be eligible to obtain a limited access American lobster permit for 1995, a vessel must meet one of the following
criteria:
(A) The vessel or vessel owner had been issued a Federal American lobster permit, or a federally endorsed state American
lobster permit, and landed American lobsters prior to March 25, 1991; or
(B) The vessel was under written agreement for construction or for re-rigging for directed American lobster fishing
as of March 25, 1991, and the vessel was issued a Federal American lobster permit, or federally endorsed state American
lobster permit, and landed American lobster prior to March 25, 1992; or 
(C) The vessel is replacing a vessel that meets any of the criteria set forth in paragraphs (b)(1)(i)(A) or (B) of this
section. 
(ii) No more than one vessel may qualify, at any one time, for a limited access American lobster permit based on that
or another vessel's fishing and permit history. If more than one vessel owner claims eligibility for a limited access
American lobster permit, based on one vessel's fishing and permit history, the Regional Director shall determine
who is entitled to qualify for the limited access American lobster permit.
(iii) A limited access American lobster permit for 1995 will not be issued unless an application for such permit is
received by the Regional Director on or before December 31, 1995.
(2) 

Eligibility in 1996 and thereafter

. (i) To be eligible to renew or apply for a limited access American lobster permit for the years 1996-1999, a vessel
must have been issued a limited access American lobster permit for the preceding year, or the vessel must be replacing
a vessel that had been issued a limited access American lobster permit for the preceding year. If more than one vessel
owner claims eligibility to apply for a limited access American lobster permit based on one vessel's fishing and permit
history, the Regional Director shall determine who is entitled to qualify for the limited access American lobster
permit.
(ii) Beginning January 1, 2000, any vessel of the United States that fishes for, possesses, or lands American lobster,
in or harvested from the EEZ, must have been issued and carry on board a valid Federal American lobster permit. This
requirement does not apply to party, charter and dive boats that possess six or fewer American lobsters, not intended
for or resulting in trade, barter, or sale, per person aboard the vessel at any time, or to recreational vessels and
vessels that fish exclusively in state waters for American lobsters. The eligibility requirements for limited access
permits for the years 1996 - 1999 are not applicable for obtaining an American lobster permit for the year 2000 and thereafter.
(3) 

Change in ownership

. The fishing and permit history of a vessel is presumed to transfer with the vessel whenever it is bought, sold, or otherwise
transferred, unless there is a written agreement, signed by the transferor/seller and transferee/buyer, or other
credible written evidence, verifying that the transferor/seller is retaining the vessel fishing and permit history
for purposes of replacing the vessel.
(4) 

Notification of eligibility for a limited access permit

. (i) NMFS will attempt to notify all owners of vessels for which NMFS has credible evidence that they meet the criteria
in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
(ii) If a vessel owner has not been notified that the vessel is eligible to be issued a limited access American lobster
permit, and the vessel owner believes that there is credible evidence that the vessel does qualify under the pertinent
criteria, the vessel owner may apply for a limited access American lobster permit by submitting the information described
in paragraphs (d) through (e) of this section. In the event the application is denied, the applicant may appeal as specified
in paragraph (b)(5) of this section. If, through either of these procedures, the Regional Director determines that
the vessel meets the eligibility criteria, a limited access American lobster permit will be issued to the vessel.
(5) 

Appeal of denial of limited access American lobster permit or of permit category assignment

. (i) Any applicant denied a limited access American lobster permit may appeal the denial to the Regional Director
within 30 days of the notice of denial. Any such appeal must be based on one or more of the following grounds, must be in
writing, and must state the grounds for the appeal:
(A) The information used by the Regional Director was based on mistaken or incorrect data;
(B) The applicant was prevented by circumstances beyond his/her control from meeting relevant criteria; or
(C) The applicant has new or additional information.
(ii) The Regional Director will appoint a designee who will make the initial decision on the appeal.
(iii) The appellant may request a review of the initial decision by the Regional Director by so requesting, in writing,
within 30 days of the notice of initial decision. If the appellant does not request a review of the initial decision
within 30 days, the initial decision shall become the final administrative action of the Department of Commerce.
(iv) 

Recommendations to the Regional Director by a hearing officer

. A hearing officer shall be appointed by the Regional Director to review the initial decision. The hearing officer
shall make findings and a recommendation to the Regional Director, which shall be advisory only.
(v) Upon receiving the findings and a recommendation, the Regional Director will issue a final decision on the appeal.
The Regional Director's decision is the final administrative action of the Department of Commerce.
(c) 

Condition

. Vessel owners who apply for a permit under this section must agree, as a condition of the permit, that the vessel and
vessel's fishing, catch, and pertinent gear (without regard to whether such fishing occurs in the EEZ or landward
of the EEZ, and without regard to where such fish or gear are possessed, taken, or landed), are subject to all requirements
of this part. The vessel and all such fishing, catch, and gear shall remain subject to all applicable state or local
requirements. If a requirement of this part and a management measure required by state or local law differ, any vessel
owner permitted to fish in the EEZ must comply with the more restrictive requirement.
(d) 

Vessel permit application

. Applicants for a permit under this section must submit a completed application on an appropriate form obtained from
the Regional Director. The application must be signed by the owner of the vessel, or the owner's authorized representative,
and be submitted to the Regional Director at least 30 days before the date on which the applicant desires to have the
permit made effective. The Regional Director will notify the applicant of any deficiency in the application pursuant
to this section. Applicants for 1995 limited access American lobster permits who have not been notified of eligibility
by the Regional Director shall provide information with the application sufficient for the Regional Director to
determine whether the vessel meets the eligibility requirements specified under paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
Acceptable forms of proof include, but are not limited to, state weigh-out records, packout forms, and settlement
sheets.
(e)

is more than one owner, names of all owners having more than a 25 percent interest; and name and signature of the owner
or the owner's authorized representative.
(f) 

Fees

. The Regional Director may charge a fee to recover the administrative expense of issuing a permit required under this
section. The amount of the fee shall be calculated in accordance with the procedures of the NOAA Finance Handbook for
determining administrative costs of each special product or service. The fee may not exceed such costs and is specified
with each application form. The appropriate fee must accompany each application; if it does not, the application

(q) 

Abandonment or voluntary relinquishment of limited access American lobster permits

. If a vessel's limited access American lobster permit is voluntarily relinquished to the Regional Director, or abandoned
through failure to renew or otherwise, no limited access American lobster permit may be re-issued or renewed based
on that vessel's history, or to any vessel relying on that vessel's history.

Presumption

. American lobsters that are possessed, or landed at or prior to the time when the American lobsters are received by
a dealer, or American lobsters that are possessed by a dealer, are presumed to be harvested from the EEZ or by a vessel
with a Federal lobster permit. A preponderance of all submitted evidence that such American lobsters were harvested
by a vessel without a Federal American lobster permit and fishing exclusively for American lobsters in state waters
will be sufficient to rebut the presumption.
(f) The possession of egg-bearing female American lobsters, V-notched female American lobsters, or American lobsters
that are smaller than the minimum size set forth in  649.20(b), will be 

prima

 

facie

 evidence that such American lobsters were taken or imported in violation of these regulations. Evidence that such
American lobsters were harvested by a vessel not holding a permit under this part and fishing exclusively within state
or foreign waters will be sufficient to rebut the presumption.

Subpart C_Stock Rebuilding Program and Framework Adjustments to Management Measures 


 649.41

Purpose and scope.


The purpose of this subpart is to specify the requirements and framework procedures for implementing the Stock Rebuilding
Program, intended to eliminate overfishing in any resource areas. 


 649.42

Stock rebuilding program requirements and time frame.


(a) 

General

. (1) The Council has until July 20, 1995 to submit to NMFS management measures to achieve the objectives of the FMP.
The measures must be designed to achieve the FMP objectives for reducing fishing mortality within 5 years for the stock
in the Gulf of Maine segment of the fishery and 10 years for the Southern New England segment of the stock. Such measures
may be submitted through the Magnuson Act amendment process or through the first-year area management framework
specifications in  649.43.
(2) In developing such management measures, the Council shall submit management measures to reduce fishing mortality
in each of four management areas specified in paragraph (b) of this section. These management measures shall be implemented
according to the first-year area management framework specifications in  649.43.
(3) If the Council has not submitted management measures sufficient to achieve the objectives of the FMP on or before
July 20, 1995, the Secretary shall determine, according to provisions of 16 U.S.C. 1854(c), whether to prepare an
amendment to the FMP.
(b) 

Management areas

. The Stock Rebuilding Program to be submitted by the Council shall be developed based on the status of stock of American
lobsters and management considerations for each of the areas described and defined in this paragraph (b) (see Figure
2 of this part).

(1) 

Area 1. Near-shore EEZ Waters of the Gulf of Maine. 

This area is defined by the area bounded by straight lines (rhumb lines) connecting the following points, in the order
stated, and the territorial sea: 






(2) 

Area 2. Near-shore EEZ Waters of Southern New England. 

This area is defined by the area bounded by straight lines (rhumb lines) connecting the following points in the order
stated and the territorial sea: 



 


(3) 

Area 3. EEZ Offshore Waters. 

This area is defined by the area bounded by straight lines (rhumb lines) connecting the following points, in the order
stated, and westerly of the U.S. - Canada Maritime Boundary: 






(4) 

Area 4. Near-shore EEZ Waters of the Middle Atlantic. 

This area is defined by the area bounded by straight lines (rhumb lines) connecting the following points, in the order
stated, and the territorial sea:





(c) 

Effort Management Teams (EMT)

. (1) The Council shall establish EMTs for each area specified in paragraph (b) of this section, for the purpose of making
recommendations to the Council on management measures to achieve the objectives of the FMP.
(2) Members of each EMT shall be appointed by the Council, in consultation with appropriate states and NMFS. Members
of the EMT shall consist of a group of technical representatives that serve on each EMT and a group of representatives
from the lobster industry, based on their geographical affiliation with an EMT. The Council may decide the number
of representatives and operating procedures of the EMTs.
(3) No later than January 20, 1995, each EMT shall report its recommendations for management measures for the stock
rebuilding program for the area it represents to the Council.


 649.43

First year framework specifications.


(a) On or before January 20, 1995, each EMT shall submit its recommendations for management measures for the area it
represents to the Council. In developing these recommendations, the EMTs may consider and recommend additional
restrictions or limitations on vessels participating in the lobster fishery according to the categories and guidelines
contained in paragraph (b) of this section.
(b) After receiving the recommendations of the EMTs, the Council shall determine what management measures are necessary
for each management area, in order to achieve the objectives of stock rebuilding specified in the FMP. For the management
measures the Council determines are necessary to meet FMP objectives, the Council shall provide appropriate rationale
and economic and biological analysis of the determinations. The Council shall make these determinations over the
span of at least two Council meetings and provide the public with advance notice of, and opportunity to comment on,
the determinations and the analyses before making final recommendations to be submitted to NMFS. The Council's recommendation
on necessary management measures may come from one or more of the following categories:
(1) Minimum-size changes;
(2) A maximum-size limit;
(3) Trap limits;
(4) Seasonal closures of one or more management areas;
(5) Closed areas or zones within a management area;
(6) Restrictions on allowable fishing time;
(7) Restrictions on allowable catches;
(8) Permitting restrictions;
(9) Additional restrictions on gear;
(10) Overfishing definition;
(11) Limitations on participation in the fishery in accordance with the control date guidelines listed below. These
guidelines will apply until a stock rebuilding program is established.
(i) It is the intent of the Council that in the event that a system of assigning fishing rights is developed as part of
the FMP, such assignments shall be based upon historical levels of participation in the fishery prior to March 25,
1991, with consideration for recent investments that have not yet been reflected in measures of participation.
(ii) New or re-rigged vessels will be given consideration in the assignment of fishing rights if: 
(A) They were under construction or re-rigging for directed lobster fishing as of March 25, 1991, as evidenced by written
construction contracts, work orders, equipment purchases, or other evidence of substantial investment and intent
to participate in the lobster fishery; and 
(B) They possessed an American lobster permit and landed lobster prior to March 25, 1992.
(iii) The public is further notified that it is the intent of the Council that historical participation will transfer
with a vessel, for transfers made after March 25, 1991, unless such transfer is accompanied by a written document indication
the agreement of both buyer and seller that any future fishing rights applicable to that vessel are not being transferred
with the vessel.
(iv) The Council further intends that any system of assigning fishing rights will take into consideration the following
concerns relative to individuals or corporations that have sold a vessel within the time that may be chosen to determine
historical fishing rights:
(A) The degree of economic dependence upon the lobster fishery including, but not limited to, the percentage of income
derived from the lobster fishery;
(B) Extent of past participation in the lobster fishery; and
(C) Demonstration of intent prior to March 25, 1991, to re-enter the lobster fishery with a different vessel.
(12) Any other restrictions that the Council may designate for the purpose of reducing or controlling fishing mortality
rates, except that an Individual Transferable Quota (ITQ) system would require a full FMP amendment.
(c) After developing necessary management measures and receiving public testimony, the Council shall make a recommendation
to the Regional Director on or before July 20, 1995. The Council's recommendation must include supporting rationale
and, if management measures are recommended, an analysis of impacts, and a recommendation to the Regional Director
on whether to publish the management measures as a final rule. If the Council recommends that the management measures
should be published as a final rule, the Council must consider at least the following factors and provide support and
analysis for each factor considered:
(1) Whether the availability of data on which the recommended management measures are based allows for adequate time
to publish a proposed rule, and whether regulations have to be in place for an entire harvest/fishing season;
(2) Whether there has been adequate notice and opportunity for participation by the public and members of the affected
industry in the development of the Council's recommended management measures;
(3) Whether there is an immediate need to protect the resource; and
(4) Whether there will be a continuing evaluation of management measures adopted, following their promulgation
as a final rule.
(d) If the Council's recommendation includes adjustments or additions to management measures, after reviewing
the Council's recommendation and supporting information:
(1) If the Regional Director concurs with the Council's recommended management measures and determines that the
recommended management measures may be published as a final rule, based on the factors specified in paragraph (c)
of this section, the action will be published in the 

Federal Register

 as a final rule; or
(2) If the Regional Director concurs with the Council's recommendation and determines that the recommended management
measures should be published first as a proposed rule, the action will be published as a proposed rule in the 

Federal Register

. After additional public comment, if the Regional Director concurs with the Council recommendation, the action
will be published as a final rule in the 

Federal Register

; or
(3) If the Regional Director does not concur, the Council will be notified, in writing, of the reasons for the non-concurrence.
(e) At any time, the Council may make other adjustments to management measures implemented under this part pursuant
to the provisions in  649.44.
(f) Nothing in this section is meant to diminish the authority of the Secretary to take emergency action under section
305(c) of the Magnuson Act.


 649.44

Framework specifications after the first year of implementation.


(a) Annually, upon request from the Council, the Regional Director will provide the Council with information of the
status of the American lobster resource, based on the most recent stock assessment report.
(b) The Council and Atlantic States Fisheries Commission, through consultation with the ASMFC Lobster Scientific
Committee within the stock assessment process and with the EMTs, shall continue to monitor the effectiveness of the
Stock Rebuilding Program and to ensure, to the extent possible, that regional measures (within a Management Area)
do not shift costs from one Management Area to another.
(c) In addition, the EMTs, on at least an annual basis, shall determine the extent to which the objectives of the FMP
are being achieved and shall make recommendations to the Council for further management actions, if required.
(d) After receiving the EMT recommendations, the Council shall determine whether adjustments to, or additional
management measures are necessary to meet the goals and objectives of the FMP. After considering the EMT's recommendations,
or at any other time, if the Council determines that adjustments to, or additional management measures are necessary,
it shall develop and analyze appropriate management actions over the span of at least two Council meetings. The Council
shall provide the appropriate rationale and economic and biological analysis for its recommendation, utilizing
the most current catch, effort, and other relevant data from the fishery. The Council shall provide the public with
advance notice of the availability of both the proposals and the analyses, and opportunity to comment on them prior
to, and at, the second Council meeting. The Council's recommendation on adjustments or additions to management measures
may come from one or more of the following categories: 
(1) Minimum-size changes;
(2) A maximum-size limit;
(3) Trap limits;
(4) Seasonal closures of one or more management areas;
(5) Closed areas or zones within a management area;
(6) Restrictions on allowable fishing time;
(7) Restrictions on allowable catches;
(8) Permitting restrictions;
(9) Additional restrictions on gear;
(10) Overfishing definition; 
(11) Limitations on participation in the fishery in accordance with the control date guidelines contained in  649.44(b)(11).
These guidelines will apply until a stock rebuilding program is established.
(12) Any other restrictions which the Council may designate for the purpose of reducing or controlling fishing mortality
rates, except that an Individual Transferable Quota (ITQ) system would require a full FMP amendment.
(e) After developing management actions and receiving public testimony, the Council shall make a recommendation
to the Regional Director. The Council's recommendation must include supporting rationale and, if management measures
are recommended, an analysis of impacts, and a recommendation to the Regional Director on whether to publish the management
measures as a final rule. If the Council recommends that the management measures should be published as a final rule,
the Council must consider at least the following factors and provide support and analysis for each factor considered:
(1) Whether the availability of data on which the recommended management measures are based allows for adequate time
to publish a proposed rule, and whether regulations have to be in place for an entire harvest/fishing season;
(2) Whether there has been adequate notice and opportunity for participation by the public and members of the affected
industry in the development of the Council's recommended management measures;
(3) Whether there is an immediate need to protect the resource; and
(4) Whether there will be a continuing evaluation of management measures adopted, following their promulgation
as a final rule.
(f) If the Council's recommendation includes adjustments or additions to management measures, after reviewing
the Council's recommendation and supporting information:
(1) If the Regional Director concurs with the Council's recommended management measures and determines that the
recommended management measures may be published as a final rule, based on the factors specified in paragraph (d)
of this section, the action will be published in the 

Federal Register

 as a final rule; or
(2) If the Regional Director concurs with the Council's recommendation and determines that the recommended management
measures should be published first as a proposed rule, the action will be published as a proposed rule in the 

Federal Register

. After additional public comment, if the Regional Director concurs with the Council recommendation, the action
will be published as a final rule in the 

Federal Register

; or
(3) If the Regional Director does not concur, the Council will be notified, in writing, of the reasons for the non-concurrence.
(g) Nothing in this section shall impair the authority of the Secretary to take emergency action under section 305(c)
of the Magnuson Act.

Final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This rule requires that newly installed emergency locator transmitters (ELT's) on U.S.-registered aircraft be
of an improved design that meets the requirements of a revised Technical Standard Order (TSO) or later TSO's issued
for ELT's. This rule is prompted by unsatisfactory performance experienced with automatic ELT's manufactured under
the original TSO. Further, it addresses certain safety recommendations made by the National Transportation Safety
Board (NTSB) and the search and rescue (SAR) community. The FAA is also adopting improved standards for survival ELT's.
The rule is expected to have a dramatic effect on reducing activation failures and would increase the likelihood of
locating airplanes after accidents. In addition, publication of this document coincides with notice of the FAA's
withdrawal of manufacturing authority for ELT's produced under TSO-C91.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 



Background



In 1971, responding to a congressional mandate for rulemaking (Public Law 91-596), the FAA adopted amendments
to parts 25, 29, 91, 121, and 135 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) to require the installation and use of ELT's
that meet the requirements of TSO-C91. The amendments require that certain U.S.-registered civil airplanes
be equipped with automatic ELT's. An automatic ELT is a crash-activated electronic signaling device used to facilitate
search and rescue efforts in locating downed aircraft. The ELT's crash sensor is commonly called a G-switch (an actuation
device that operates on acceleration forces measured in G's; one G denotes the acceleration of the earth's gravity).
In most installations, the ELT is attached to the aircraft structure as far aft as practicable in the fuselage in such
a manner that damage to the device will be minimized in the event of impact.

Certain aircraft, such as turbojet-powered aircraft and aircraft engaged in scheduled air carrier operations,
are excepted from this requirement because they are more readily located after an accident because they operate within
the air traffic control system and their operators have filed instrument flight plans. For example, scheduled air
carriers and turbojet-powered aircraft use the air traffic control system (ATC) and air carriers use instrument
flight plans. This rule is applicable to those airplanes that are most difficult to locate after an accident. An ELT
is particularly helpful in locating an airplane that is operated by a pilot who does not file a flight plan or operate
within the air traffic control system.

Survival ELT's are manually operated or automatically actuated upon contact with water. Survival ELT's are required
ditching equipment for transport category airplanes and rotorcraft, as provided by the operating rules. They are
also required emergency equipment for extended overwater operations on aircraft used in air carrier, air taxi, and
commercial operations.

Since the adoption of those amendments requiring installation of ELT's, there has been unsatisfactory field experience
with the automatic ELT's. Accordingly, the FAA requested RTCA, Inc. (formerly the Radio Technical Commission for
Aeronautics) to develop a revised technical standard that would address false alarms and improve the failure-to-activate
rate for automatic ELT's. The RTCA project produced a minimum operational performance standard that is referenced
in TSO-C91a, issued in April 1985. Installation of ELT's that meet this improved standard, however, is voluntary
until compliance is required as specified in this amendment.

NTSB safety recommendations A-78-5 through A-78-12, issued in 1978, also addressed ELT problems;
they are now classified by the NTSB as ``Closed-Acceptable Action,'' primarily because TSO-91a was issued.
Following the issuance of the new TSO, in 1987 the NTSB issued safety recommendation A-87-104, that recommends
existing ELT's be replaced with ELT's that comply with TSO-C921a by 1989. That safety recommendation also urged
that ELT's be subject to specific maintenance requirements.
In October 1990, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the FAA completed a report entitled,
``Current Emergency Locator Transmitter (ELT) Deficiencies and Potential Improvements Utilizing TSO-C91a
ELT's'', hereafter referred to as the FAA/NASA report. This report consolidates and analyzes most of the known data
on ELT problems and quantifies the safety problem. General aviation accident and fatality data from the NTSB form
the cornerstone of the report. The most significant conclusions derived from the report show: 23 to 58 lives are lost
per year due to ELT failures; 15 percent of ELT failures are attributed to poor or no ELT maintenance; and after excluding
lives lost attributed to maintenance-related ELT failures, 64 percent or 13 to 31 of the lives lost each year could
be saved with a complete transition to TSO-C91a ELT's.
Based on the known unsatisfactory performance of the TSO-C91 ELT's during the 1970's and 1980's, the FAA issued
Notice No. 90-11 (55 FR 12316, April 2, 1990). This notice proposed that ELT's approved under TSO-C91a
(or later issued TSO's for ELT's) be required for all future installations. The NPRM further proposed that the manufacture
of the TSO-C91 ELT's be simultaneously terminated with issuance of a final rule. The term ``future installations''
applies to newly manufactured airplanes, and to the replacement of existing ELT's as they become unusable or unserviceable.
Additionally, the FAA solicited comments on the need for a fleet-wide ELT replacement program and specific maintenance
requirements. These issues are addressed below.

Discussion of Comments


The FAA received 51 written comments in response to Notice No. 90-11 from individuals, manufacturers, equipment
users, associations, and government agencies. Twenty-two support the proposed rule or its intent while 20 express
concern or nonsupport. Most of the nonsupport commenters, however, address the fleet-wide replacement of automatic
ELT's rather than the proposal for new installations. Nine of the comments do not take a position for or against the
proposals; however, they offer suggestions and advice.
Nineteen of the commenters supporting the rule represent major segments of the aviation search and rescue community
such as government agencies and associations. These commenters also agree on the unsatisfactory performance of
current TSO-C91 ELT's.


Failure to Activate_Automatic ELT's


Eleven of the commenters contributed information supporting the implementation of TSO-C91a, and stated that
it would have a dramatic effect on reducing activation failures and would increase the likelihood of locating airplanes
after accidents. Most commenters agreed with the conclusions identified in the FAA/NASA report explaining that
failure-to-activate was caused by:



_Insufficient impact deceleration to cause the crash sensor (G-switch) to activate the ELT;
_Improper installation;
_Battery problems;
_Fire damage;
_Impact damage;
_Antenna broken/disconnected;
_Water submersion;
_Unit not armed;
_Internal failure;
_Packing device still installed;
_Remote switch in off position; and
_ELT shielded by wreckage or terrain (although not an initial failure, this was listed as another reason for the ELT
not functioning).



An ELT manufacturer states that the term ``failure to activate'' encompasses two groups of cases that should not be
treated in the same manner. Group 1 situations are those in which the ELT does not operate after a crash because it has
a mechanical defect or failure. Group 2 situations are those in which the ELT does not operate because the crash forces
are insufficient to activate it. This commenter states that the Group 2 cases should not be classified as ELT failures
because the ELT's did what they were supposed to do when they did not activate. The commenter asserts that any ``failure''
associated with the Group 2 cases is a shortcoming of the current TSO-C91 standard that established the crash
sensor sensitivity specifications.

FAA Response:

 The FAA agrees with the manufacturer's comment about two causes of failure-to-activate and notes that the FAA/NASA
report addresses these two situations. The FAA/NASA report documents well the failures of ELT's approved under TSO-C91.
As discussed previously, the most significant conclusions from the report are that: (1) 23 to 58 lives are lost each
year due to ELT failures; (2) many of these failures are caused by poor ELT maintenance; and (3) a 64 percent failure
rate reduction can be expected with a complete transition to TSO-C91a ELT's. Attachment 1 of the FAA/NASA report
entitled, ``Validation of NASA ELT Reasons for Failure Analysis Report,'' verifies the NTSB data that provides the
cornerstone of the FAA/NASA report. In addition, the new ELT TSO-C91a contains revised G-switch specifications
designed to provide proper activation limits and to minimize mechanical defects. This new design is expected to reduce
the number of false alarms and improve the failure-to-activate rate.



False Alarms_Automatic ELT's



Twenty commenters identified ELT false alarms as contributing to poor performance. Several commenters cite the
FAA/NASA report, which documents the following causes of false alarms:




_G-switch (crash sensor);

_Corrosion;

_Incorrect installation of the ELT;

_Human failures or mishandling;

_Heat, water, or radiated interference;

_Accidental operation of the controls;

_Internal failure.




In addition to identifying the causes of false alarms, members of the Search and Rescue community (SAR) note the significant,
additional cost of responding to false alarms, the ability to respond to real emergencies, the cost to taxpayers,
and the additional, unnecessary, physical risk to SAR personnel caused by responding to false alarms. In its comments,
the NTSB stated that ``in a recent SAR mission the cost incurred, excluding a significant contribution by volunteers,
was $13 million.''



FAA Response:

 The FAA agrees with the comments regarding false alarms. The primary beneficiary of reducing the number of false alarms
would be the SAR community. A reduction in false alarms would make more SAR resources available to aid aircraft in distress.
The resources expended by SAR on false alarms would be significantly reduced. The FAA expects that the current number
of false alarms will be reduced by 75 percent with implementation of TSO-91a and a mandatory inspection and maintenance
program. However, as stated in the FAA/NASA report, the FAA cannot quantify the benefits in lives to be saved. A reduction
in the number of false alarms would result in the Air Force Rescue Coordination Center (AFRCC) spending less time analyzing
the validity of thousands of signals that occur annually on the 121.5 Mhz frequency. Thus, it is reasonable to presume
that if the pre-rescue preparation time were reduced, additional lives could be saved.



Replacement Time and Costs



Although the FAA did not propose the replacement of existing ELT's with models of newer design, in Notice No. 90-11,
the agency solicited opinion from affected users regarding a proposed time frame for a near-term retrofit program.
Twenty-one commenters address the time that should be permitted for mandatory replacement of existing ELT's with
those approved under TSO-C91a. Seven commenters call for a ``voluntary'' replacement. In general, the SAR
community proposes four years. Most commenters acknowledge that a manatory timetable for replacement is necessary
to realize the benefits of this second-generation ELT.

Twenty-six commenters express concern over the direct replacement cost of existing TSO-C91 ELT's with TSO-C91a
ELT's.



FAA Response:

 The FAA does not agree with the recommendations concerning voluntary replacement. The FAA evisions this final rule
addressing new installations to be the first step in the much-needed transition to the improved ELT's. Even though
the FAA conducted an extensive education program in the 1980's through the FAA Back-to-Basics Program, seminars,
advisory material, and pamphlets, the FAA estimates that fewer than five percent of potential users voluntarily
installed the improved ELT's. Although a voluntary replacement program may be less costly, resolution of the failure
to activate and false alarm problems would not be timely. 

The Aviation Rulemaking Advisory Committee (ARAC) has been tasked to make recommendations concerning the retrofit
of ELT's in the entire fleet. For a detailed description of this task, see the ARAC notice published at 58 FR 16574, March
29, 1993.

Integration of 406 Mhz ELT's



Nineteen commenters recommend using the 406 Mhz ELT because it has significant technical improvements over the 121.5/243
Mhz ELT equipment system. Commenters also noted that 406 Mhz ELT's are compatible with the Search and Rescue Satellite-Aided
Tracking System (COSPAS-SARSAT). Several commenters submitted data indicating that the COSPAS/SARSAT system
has proven to be an effective tool in detecting and locating both maritime and aeronautical distress incidents. The
data further show that this satellite system had been credited with saving more than 1,700 lives since it was commissioned
in 1982. In many of these distress cases, the satellite system was the only means of detecting the distress signal.
The commenters assert that improvements in ELT equipment, both on the 121.5 Mhz and 406 Mhz frequencies, will increase
the accuracy of location, reduce the time required to provide information to the Rescue Coordination Centers, reduce
the effects of interference, reduce the number of false alerts on 121.5 Mhz, and improve satellite coverage of all
areas in the United States.

Most commenters support use of an improved 121.5/2430 Mhz ELT or the improved ELT that includes 406 Mhz capability.
The NTSB further advocates a fleet-wide mandatory conversion to the 406 Mhz standard.



FAA Response: 

In October, 1992, the United States responded to an International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) letter requesting
comments on ELT carriage requirements. The United States recommended the use of 406 Mhz ELT's.

To accelerate the introduction of the 406 Mhz capability, and to provide an acceptable standard of certification
for ELT's, the FAA issued TSO-C126 on December 23, 1992. The intended configuration of the 406 Mhz ELT can be accomplished
by either of two approaches: (1) Installation of a stand-alone 406 Mhz ELT to augment an existing 121.5/243.0 Mhz ELT
installation; or (2) Installation of an integrated 121.5/406 Mhz ELT, or an integrated 121.5/243.0/406 Mhz ELT of
which the 121.5 or the 121.5/243.0 portion meets the requirements of TSO-C91a. TSO-C126 provides a standard
for significant performance and information improvements for ELT's and these improvements are expected to permit
more effective and timely SAR response after aircraft accidents.

A 406 Mhz ELT would operate at much higher power levels than a 121.5/243.0 Mhz ELT. Lithium chemistry batteries appear
to be the only likely power source. The FAA is concerned about the safety characteristics of these batteries and has
placed some initial guidance material in TSO-C126 to aid approving lithium batteries. Currently, RTCA Special
Committee 168 is developing a standard for the various kinds of lithium batteries that could be used in aircraft. The
FAA plans to use the RTCA standard as a basis for a future TSO.

The 121.5/243 Mhz ELT's approved under TSO-C91a are expected to be effective when used in conjunction with the
U.S. National Airspace and SAR systems. Therefore, the FAA recommends, but does not require, carriage of 406 Mhz ELT's.
Voluntary use of the 406 Mhz ELT's would provide a definite enhancement over the minimum requirements of the Federal
Aviation Regulations. There may be even more life-saving benefits derived from the 406 Mhz ELT for those operations
conducted over water and in remote areas; therefore, the FAA encourages installation of the 406 Mhz ELT although the
121.5/243 Mhz will continue to be used.



Costs of Automatic and Survival ELT's



Five commenters express concern over the additional cost of automatic TSO-C91a ELT's required for new installations.
The General Aviation Manufacturers Association indicates that the estimated $75 installation cost in Notice No.
90-11 is inappropriate. It claims that a realistic estimate for parts and labor is $750.

With regard to survival ELT's, Dayton-Granger, Inc. and the DME Corporation currently estimate the cost of survival
ELT's at approximately $900. Both companies plan to manufacture ELT's approved to the TSO-C91a standard. The
Air Transport Association of America (ATA) states that its member airlines estimate the cost of the TSO-C91a
survival ELT's to be $4,193 to $4,662 per aircraft. Additionally, it states that the new TSO standards are unnecessary
because there are no problems with the current survival ELT's.



FAA Response: 

The FAA based its cost estimates on estimates provided by manufacturers of authorized equipment. ARNAV Systems,
Inc., whose automatic ELT is now marketed by Artex Aircraft Supplies, Inc., obtained TSO-C91a approval for
the model ELS-10 in October 1986 and for a lower cost model, the ELT-100, in March 1988. These automatic
ELT's sell for approximately $900 and $350 respectively, and have beneficial design enhancements, such as built-in
test equipment. Narco Avionics, Inc., obtained approval for its automatic model ELT-910 in June 1989, and is
marketing it for approximately $400. Since the issuance of Notice No. 90-11, ACK Technologies, Inc., received
approval for its automatic Model E-01 ELT in May 1990; the list price for this ELT is $279. According to this manufacturer,
a selling price of less than $200 may be possible, once full production is underway. Several other ELT manufacturers
have expressed an interest in producing low-cost TSO-C91a ELT's.

This rulemaking applies only to ``new installations;'' therefore, the FAA has attempted to minimize direct costs
to operators while enhancing operators' safety. In Notice 90-11 the FAA estimated that automatic ELT's would
cost an additional $150 to $400 per unit, and that survival ELT's would cost an additional $875 to $1,225 per unit. However,
as a result of analyzing more recent data received from ELT manufacturers, the FAA has reduced its estimates of incremental
costs. Automatic ELT's are estimated to cost an additional $50 to $200 per unit, and survival ELT's are estimated to
cost an additional $250 to $750 per unit. Conversely, the FAA has increased its estimate of incremental installation
costs for automatic ELT's from $75 to $150 per unit.


G-Switch


Eight commenters express concern about the design specifications of the TSO-C91a crash sensor, known as a G-switch.
These eight commenters agree that the current TSO-C91 G-switch needs improvement because it is the primary
cause of an ELT's failure to activate. Several commenters note that the FAA/NASA report estimates a 95 percent rate
of effectiveness increase expected from using the TSO-C91a G-switch.


FAA Response:

 On the basis of the current performance of TSO-C91a ELT installations and the conclusions reported in the FAA/NASA
report, the FAA determined that TSO-C91a provides an adequate G-switch specification for sensing an airplane
crash and would minimize the number of activation failures and false activations. In the event of false activation,
the ELT monitor would alert the pilot or ground personnel. Additionally, the RTCA has determined that the TSO-C91a
standard is an appropriate specification to be included in the RTCA/DO-204 standard for 406 Mhz ELT's.


Batteries


Seven commenters specifically raise the issue of batteries as a factor in ELT's poor performance. Several commenters
indicate that an alternative to lithium chemistry batteries is needed and additional battery research should be
conducted. Suggestions for new battery types ranged from use of solar batteries to use of size ``D'' batteries.


FAA Response:

 The FAA has found that most battery problems can be eliminated if aircraft owners ensure that the ELT and its battery
receive a proper inspection as discussed in the next section, ELT Maintenance. The status of FAA requirements for
lithium batteries was discussed previously.


ELT Maintenance


Consistent with the FAA/NASA report, 19 commenters note lack of proper maintenance as a contributing cause of the
current unsatisfactory performance of TSO-C91 ELT's. Most of the commenters agree that scheduled inspection
of ELT's is necessary to reduce the number of false alarms and to ensure their proper working order. The NTSB, National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), ACK Technology, Inc., and The National Association for Search and
Rescue (NASAR) call for mandatory inspections.


FAA Response:

 The FAA agrees with these comments concerning ELT maintenance and with NTSB recommendation, A-87-104,
that recommended replacing TSO-C91 ELT's with TSO-C91a ELT's. The FAA/NASA report also concludes that
an inspection and maintenance program for ELT's is necessary. As discussed in the background section of this preamble,
an estimated 15 percent of ELT failures have been maintenance related.
The FAA already provides for mandatory ELT inspections in the regulations and in TSO's. Meeting the inspection requirements
is a responsibility shared among the manufacturer, the inspector, and the aircraft owner or operator. Maintenance
of ELT's is a major issue; accordingly, this section will digress from discussion of the comments to emphasize these
requirements. This is necessary so that users understand the FAA's requirements concerning ELT maintenance.


ELT Maintenance Requirements_An Explanation


Subpart E of Part 91 provides inspection and maintenance requirements for the continued airworthiness of the aircraft
and all of its components. Also,  91.207, of subpart C, requires that each ELT be in an operable condition and
provides specific requirements for battery replacement. Technical Standard Order C91a requires that instructions
for periodic maintenance, which are necessary for the ELT's continued airworthiness, be provided with each unit
manufactured under the TSO. These instructions must contain specific information to ensure that appropriately
rated persons will be able to inspect and maintain ELT's in an airworthy condition to meet the needs of the flying public
and the SAR community. Manufacturers of the earlier (TSO-C91) ELT's, however, were not required to submit periodic
maintenance instructions to the FAA with their TSO approval applications. Therefore, the content and usefulness
of instructions provided with TSO-C91 ELT's may vary, depending on the approach used by each manufacturer.

<TEXT>
 

Section 43.13(a) requires persons performing inspections and other maintenance to use the manufacturers' instructions
or other instructions acceptable to the FAA Administrator. The aircraft owner or operator is responsible for ensuring
that the ELT is included in these inspections and is maintained accordingly. To provide guidance on improving ELT
maintenance, Action Notice A 8310.1, recommending a specific supplemental inspection procedure for ELT's, was
issued to all FAA field personnel in September 1988. This information was also included in the February 1989 issue
of Advisory Circular 43-16, General Aviation Airworthiness Alerts, and reissued in Action Notice A 8150.3
on July 23, 1990. This Action Notice applies to ELT's authorized under both TSO-C91 and TSO-C91a.
To summarize the notice, the inspection procedure can be accomplished by making a close examination of the ELT, its
battery pack, and antenna. The signal emissions and G-switch must also be checked.
If the ELT's antenna is radiating a signal, it can be heard on any frequency through a low-cost AM radio held about six
inches from the ELT's antenna. The aircraft's VHF receiver or a check with an airport control tower may also be used
to verify the ELT signal on the 121.5 Mhz frequency. An airplane's VHF receiver is located very close to the ELT, and
it is sensitive; therefore, it does not check the integrity of the ELT together with its antenna. Consequently, using
the airplane's VHF receiver does not provide the same level of confidence in verifying the ELT signal as using the AM
radio or tower check. The ELT transmits on the emergency frequency, therefore, the signal check must be conducted
within the first five minutes after any hour and it must be limited to three sweeps of the transmitter's audio signal,
in order not to send false alarm signals.
To check the G-switch of most TSO-C91 ELT's, the unit is removed from its mounting and given a quick rap with the
hand in the direction of activation indicated on the ELT case. For TSO-C91a ELT's, however, a throwing motion
is used, coupled with a rapid reversal.
Finally, although the antenna and G-switch checks are not measured checks and do not quantify the adequacy of the G-switch
or the power output of the antenna, they do provide an acceptable level of confidence that the ELT is functioning properly.
In response to NTSB recommendation A-87-104, the findings of the FAA/NASA report, and the comments to
this rulemaking, the FAA is clarifying what must be done for an ELT to be considered in ``operable condition'' as found
in  91.207(a)(1) by adding a new paragraph (d). Although paragraph (d) is new, it is written in accordance with
current regulations and guidance, as discussed earlier under, ``ELT Maintenance Requirements_An Explanation''.
Specifically, the new regulation  91.207(a)(1)(d), describes how to inspect an ELT under Part 43, Appendix
D, paragraph (i), and requires that it be accomplished within 12 calendar months after the last inspection. The Appendix
D requirements are non-specific in nature because they apply to all components of the radio group, which includes
the ELT's. The 12-month requirement accommodates those airplanes maintained under either an annual or a progressive
inspection program and could be accomplished under the provisions of any other program approved by the Administrator
under  91.409. The FAA has determined that this clarification is not an additional requirement that would entail
additional rulemaking and an economic evaluation. The FAA has determined that this additional information should
be included in part 91 to reinforce to airplane owners and inspectors what the FAA expects when an ELT is inspected.


``Approved'' as Opposed to ``TSO-Approved''


Three commenters express concern over the meaning of the word ``approved'' in the proposed language of the ELT rules.
One commenter indicates that this rulemaking procedure may ``establish a precedent for future mass terminations
of TSO authorizations, without going through the rulemaking process.'' Another commenter requests that the FAA
refer to a particular TSO number instead of using the generic language, ``approved TSO.''

FAA Response:

 The FAA intends to clarify the certification process with regard to the regulations and TSO's. Since the effective
date of Amendment 21-50 to part 21 (September 9, 1980), The FAA's TSO revision program has been eliminating TSO's
from the rulemaking process and eliminating references to specific TSO's from the regulations. The TSO revision
makes it possible for the public to use the most up-to-date TSO or other standards that are found acceptable during
the certification of a particular piece of equipment. When specific TSO standards are designated in a regulation,
other TSO's or standards are automatically excluded. As stated in Notice No. 90-11, ``This rule replaces specific
references to TSO-C91 in the FAR with `an approved ELT that is in operable condition','' and withdraws all TSO-C91
authorizations issued to ELT manufacturers. In effect, this would allow TSO-C91a, or any subsequent TSO's
issued for ELT's, to be used as a basis for compliance with the FAR. Using the language ``approved'' is consistent with
the FAA's responsibility to eliminate dated references to regulations.

Whenever a material, part, process, or appliance is required to be ``approved,'' it must be approved under the Federal
Aviation Regulations. The approval can be obtained in one of the following ways: (1) under a Parts Manufacturer Approval;
(2) in conjunction with type certification procedures for a product, including approvals granted by a supplemental
type certificate; (3) under a Technical Standard Order authorization; or (4) in any other manner approved by the Administrator.

Of these approval methods, TSO's contain minimum performance and quality control standards for specified articles
(material, part, process, or appliance). The standards for each TSO are those the Administrator finds necessary
to ensure that the article concerned will operate satisfactorily. Compliance with a TSO is only one method of obtaining
an approval and its use is not mandatory; therefore, the standards contained in the TSO are not mandatory but are a way
of obtaining approval for a particular article.



Miscellaneous Comments



An ELT manufacturer requests that the word ``transmitter'' be added to  91.207(c)(2) for consistency with
the rest of the section.



FAA Response:

 The FAA agrees; this word has already been incorporated into  91.207(c)(2).

One commenter encourages integration with the European Organization for Civil Aviation Electronics.

In addition, the National Business Aircraft Association, Inc., expresses concern over the prematurity of the FAA's
rulemaking and states that the ramifications of other equipment such as the international Automatic Dependent Surveillance
(ADS) system used to indicate the location of other aircraft must be fully understood. The NTSB calls for integration
with ICAO efforts in establishing ELT carriage requirements.



FAA Response:

 The FAA disagrees with the National Business Aircraft Association's comment that this rule is premature. The FAA
will no longer delay this final rule because there will always be new technology on the horizon. The rule is in agreement
with the ICAO requirements, including recent changes pertaining to ELT's. The FAA is a strong supporter of the search
and rescue satellite system (COSPAS/SARSAT). In addition, the ELT program, as outlined in this rulemaking, takes
into account national and international issues and these considerations were integrated into the justification
for this rule.

Three commenters request field testing of TSO-C91a ELT's to confirm their potential costs and benefits before
their use is mandated. Four commenters call for additional research on ELT's. For example, the General Aviation Manufacturers
Association (GAMA) requests further research on TSO-C91a G-switches and battery technology.



FAA Response:

 The FAA agrees with the intent of these comments on the need for appropriate research and field testing. Transport
Canada, the Canadian counterpart of the United States Department of Transportation, is currently field testing
130 ARNAV ELT's. Usable results may not be available until late 1993. The FAA is working with Transport Canada on its
ELT improvement program and with other government as well as non-government organizations on maximizing ELT knowledge.
However, in view of the Canadian study and numerous studies documented in the FAA/NASA report, including an FAA ELT
maintenance survey on repair stations, the FAA has determined that there is no need for research on new issues before
regulatory action is taken. Additional research would only delay the installation of improved ELT's without any
clear expectation of improvement over the TSO-C91a specification.

One commenter encourages the FAA to expand its ELT educational effort to install more reliable ELT's. NASA suggests
that all pilots be required to monitor the 121.5 Mhz frequency as part of the shutdown procedure in aircraft that do
not have a cockpit monitor.

FAA Response: 

The FAA agrees with the intent of both of these comments. Working with organizations such as the Aircraft Owners and
Pilots Association, the FAA has been actively promoting the public's awareness of potential problems with ELT's.
A pamphlet entitled, ``Attention to ELT's: Insurance To Life'' has been distributed to all active U.S. pilots. This
pamphlet addresses the ELT false alarm problem and recommends that a pilot-in-command monitor the 121.5 Mhz frequency
prior to engine shutdown. This information contained in the pamphlet and ELT inspection procedures are discussed
at pilot safety seminars and have been incorporated in the FAA Back-To-Basics program.

The NASA report suggested that the pilot be required to check the 121.5 Mhz frequency before leaving the airplane.

One commenter requests that tow planes be excepted from the requirements because they often are operated under harsh
conditions that could trigger false alarms.



FAA Response: 

The FAA agrees and the final rule does not change the ELT requirements for tow planes. Those airplanes that are currently
excepted may continue operations without an ELT.

The ATA concludes, given the operating procedures of transport category aircraft, that benefits to the travelling
public from automatic ELT's would be very limited. A complete replacement of its members' fleets by 1995 would cost
$14 million.



FAA Response: 

Survival ELT's, rather than automatic ELT's, are required in transport category aircraft. Currently, automatic
ELT's are not required on transport category aircraft.

One commenter suggests that a fine be used as a penalty for an ELT false alarm resulting from the pilot's failure to maintain
the ELT.



FAA Response: 

The suggestion is beyond the scope of this rulemaking.

Another commenter suggests that insurance considerations should be the driving force to motivate aircraft owners
to install ELT's, rather than the FAA mandating ELT's.



FAA Response: 

The FAA disagrees and is not convinced that insurance considerations alone would assure a 100-percent installation
rate. Moreover, in 1971, Congress passed a law that requires the installation and use of ELT's on most aircraft.

Finally, one commenter interprets the language ``unusable or unserviceable'' in Notice No. 90-11 to mean that
replacement would be required for a TSO-C91 ELT when it needed a battery change or was removed for routine scheduled
maintenance.



FAA Response: 

The FAA intends that the term ``unusable or unserviceable'' be given its everyday meaning so as to require replacement
only when the ELT cannot be repaired. Thus, the TSO-C91 ELT would not need replacement when it can be serviced
with routine maintenance.



Impact of the Rule



Summary of the Amendments



In summary, effective six months after publication of this Final Rule, the FAA is withdrawing TSO-C91 authorizations
for automatic ELT's; therefore, the TSO-C91 model ELT's may not be manufactured after that date. Current production
of unsold TSO-C91 ELT's for general aviation airplanes is sufficiently small so that accumulation of inventories
is unlikely. This inventory is expected to be depleted by the time this rule becomes effective. The preamble to Notice
No. 90-11 specifically stated that the FAA proposed to require installation of an improved ELT that meets the
requirements of a revised TSO, and to terminate approval to use ELT's authorized under the original TSO-C91.
Although the notice stated that the new equipment would be required for future installations, language to that effect
did not appear in the proposed amendment. To carry out this intent,  91.207(a)(1) and (a)(2) are revised to state
that ELT's meeting the applicable requirements of TSO-C91 may no longer be installed.

Another change is being made to paragraph (a)(2) of  91.207 to correct an error that inadvertently occurred
when former  91.52 was revised and renumbered as  91.207 during the recodification of part 91 in 1990.
Former paragraph (b)(4) of  91.52 (the predecessor to paragraph (a)(2) of  91.207) contained a reference
to three preceding paragraphs. That is, paragraph (a)(1)(i) was included in the subject reference. The reference
also should have included paragraphs (a)(1)(ii) and (a)(1)(iii). This correction is effected by replacing the reference
to ``(a)(1)(i)'' with ``(a)(1)'', which subsumes all of the provisions of paragraph (a)(1) into the reference.

With regard to survival ELT's, the TSO authorization withdrawal will become effective two years after publication
of this final rule. The FAA is allowing additional time for the manufacturers of survival ELT's to begin producing,
and for operators to begin installing, TSO-C91a ELT's. For new installations, the new requirements include
satellite compatibility, crash survivability, and certain environmental specifications (temperature, water
resistance, etc.) that will provide definite improvement at reasonable costs.

Finally, a change is made to   121.339, 121.353, 125.209, and 135.167 to correct inadvertent errors that
were made when the applicable parts were codified in 1971 and 1980. These sections refer to survival ELT's and specifically
describe the timely replacement of transmitter batteries. Currently, these sections state that the transmitter
batteries must be replaced when the transmitter has been in use for more than one hour 

and

 when 50 percent of its useful life has expired (according to the specific expiration date). The FAA has always intended
and enforced these regulations concerning survival ELT's to prescribe a change of transmitter batteries when either
the battery has been in use for more than one hour 

or

, when 50 percent of its useful life has expired. This correction is consistent with  91.207 regarding automatic
ELT's.



Technical Standard Order



Published simultaneously with this rule, the FAA, pursuant to  21.621 of the Federal Aviation Regulations,
is withdrawing each TSO authorization to the extent that it authorizes the holder to identify or mark ELT's with TSO-C91,
effective six months after the publication of this rule for automatic ELT's, and effective two years after publication
of this rule for survival ELT's.



Regulatory Evaluation Summary



Proposed changes to Federal regulations must undergo several economic analyses. First, Executive Order 12866 directs
that each Federal agency shall propose or adopt a regulation only upon a reasoned determination that the benefits
of the intended regulation justify its costs. Second, the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 requires agencies to
analyze the economic effect of regulatory changes on small entities. Third, the Office of Management and Budget directs
agencies to assess the effects of regulatory changes on international trade. In conducting these analyses, the FAA
has determined that this rule: (1) Will generate benefits that justify its costs and is not a significant regulatory
action as defined in the Executive Order; (2) is significant as defined in DOT's Policies and Procedures; (3) will
not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities; and (4) will not constitute a barrier to international
trade. These analyses, available in the docket, are summarized below.



Costs_Automatic ELT's



Based on the comments received in response to the NPRM, the FAA has revised its estimates of the rule's costs. The FAA
now estimates that the incremental selling price of new ELT's will be $125 per unit above those of old ELT's and that
the incremental installation costs will be $150 per unit. The FAA has also re-estimated automatic ELT acquisitions
to 3,500 units annually, including units installed on new airplanes and replacements on existing airplanes. Applying
these revised estimates to the first 20 years of the rule (1995-2014), the costs of automatic ELT's will total
$19.3 million (or $10.2 million in 1993 dollars at 1994 discounted present value).



Costs_Survival ELT's



Recent efficiencies in production techniques have reduced the costs from those estimated in the NPRM. As a result,
the incremental acquisition cost of survival ELT's is estimated to total $500 per unit. The FAA estimates that, during
the 1996-2015 evaluation period, 3,081 new survival ELT's will be installed, costing $1.5 million (or $0.8
million, discounted).

Benefits_Automatic ELT's 



Based on the findings of the FAA/NASA report (cited earlier), significant improvements in ELT effectiveness will
reduce the time required to locate downed airplanes and, concomitantly, improve the chances of saving seriously
injured crash survivors. Additional benefits will be realized from reducing false alarms. 

The report's most significant conclusions are that: 23 to 58 lives are lost per year due to ELT's failure-to-operate;
12 to 18 percent of these are attributed to poor or no maintenance; and, with 100 percent TSO-C91a installations,
a 64 percent failure rate reduction can be expected. In addition, a 75 percent reduction in false alarms is likely with
all new units in place (although not directly specified in the report, this evaluation estimates that 25 percent of
false alarms, in contrast to the 12 to 18 percent of ELT failures-to-operate, are attributable to poor or no maintenance).


Consequently, using the midpoints of the range of lives lost (41) and the range attributed to maintenance failures
(15 percent), 22 or more lives could be saved annually if all TSO-C91 ELT's were replaced with TSO-C91a
ELT's (41 x (1^.15) x .64), decreasing to approximately 18 annually as general aviation activity decreases during
the 20-year evaluation period. Since ELT replacements will take place gradually over time, avoided fatalities will
not reach their full potential for several years after the period. Nevertheless, 81 fatalities are expected to be
avoided during the 20-year period following promulgation of the rule, valued at $209 million ($86.4 million discounted).


The additional benefits expected from reduced false alarms are calculated as follows. False alarms are estimated
to cost approximately $4.3 million annually (based on a $3.5 million estimate for 1987 by the Air Force Rescue Coordination
Center, adjusted to 1993 dollars). Excluding the 25 percent of false alarms attributable to maintenance-related
problems, the expected reduction in false alarm costs totals $2.4 million annually ($4.3 million x .75 x (1^.25)).
Taking into account the gradual, increasing percentage of the fleet equipped with new ELT's over the 1995-2014
evaluation period, these benefits are projected to total $8.9 million ($3.7 million discounted). 



Benefits_Survival ELT's 



There is no direct evidence of lives lost as a result of delays in reaching survivors because of defective survival
ELT's; however, such occurrences are possible. Historical data indicate that an average of 61 preventable drownings
occur per 10-year period in parts 121 and 135 operations. Over the course of the 1996-2015 evaluation period,
only one life needs to be saved in order for the benefits of new survival ELT's to exceed the $0.8 million in discounted
costs. 



Comparison of Cost and Benefits 




Costs and benefits summarized below are for the evaluation period 1995-2015 in terms of 1993 dollars at 1994
discounted present value. Automatic ELT's are estimated to have incremental costs totalling $10.2 million and benefits
of $90.1 million, yielding a benefit-to-cost ratio of 8.8 to 1. Incremental costs of survival ELT's are estimated
to total $0.8 million, requiring the avoidance of only one fatality in order to be cost-beneficial.

Regulatory Flexibility Determination



The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (RFA) was enacted by Congress to ensure that small entities are not unnecessarily
and disproportionately burdened by government regulations. The FRA requires agencies to review rules that may have
``a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.'' FAA Order 2100.14A, Regulatory Flexibility
Criteria and Guidance, establishes small entity size and cost level thresholds for complying with RFA review requirements
in FAA rulemaking actions.

The small entities potentially affected by the rule are Part 121, Part 125, and Part 135 operators that own nine or fewer
aircraft, which is the size threshold for aircraft operators considered small entities by the FAA. The annual cost
thresholds are $119,500 for operators of scheduled services with entire fleets having a seating capacity of over
60; $66,800 for other scheduled operators; and $4,700 for unscheduled operators. A substantial number of small entities
is a number which is not less than eleven and which is more than one-third of the small entities subject to the rule.

The only type of entity with the potential to sustain a significant economic impact as a result of this rule is an unscheduled
operator. Such an operator would have to purchase at least ten ELT's in a year in order to exceed the $4,700 threshold.
The rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small unscheduled operators because
most such operators own five or fewer airplanes each, and it is unlikely that at least 11 of them representing more than
one-third of the total will purchase ten new ELT's in any given year.



International Trade Impact Statement



The rule will have little or no impact on trade for either U.S. firms doing business in foreign countries or foreign
firms doing business in the United States. Foreign air carriers are prohibited from operating between points within
the United States. Therefore, they will not gain any competitive advantage over U.S. carriers. In international
operations, foreign air carriers are not expected to realize any cost advantage over U.S. carriers because the differential
in costs between the existing and new ELT rule will not be significant enough to have an adverse impact on the international
operations of U.S. carriers. Further, general aviation operations conducted in the United States are not in any direct
competition with foreign enterprises. For these reasons, the FAA does not expect that the rule will result in any international
trade impact.



Federalism Implications



The regulations herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national
government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government.
Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not have sufficient
federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.



Conclusion



The FAA has determined that the potential benefits of the regulation outweigh its potential costs and that it is not
a significant regulatory action under Executive Order 12866. In addition, this rule will not have a significant economic
impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility
Act. This rule is considered significant under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR
