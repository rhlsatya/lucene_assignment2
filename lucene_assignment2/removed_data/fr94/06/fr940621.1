Animal Export Inspection Facilities 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 We are proposing to amend the ``Inspection and Handling of Livestock 
for Exportation'' regulations by establishing additional standards for export inspection facilities. This action
would ensure that all export inspection facilities have running water and water drainage systems, storage areas,
and telephone. This action would also require facilities where horses are inspected to have walkways in front of stalls
and ceiling height adequate for horses. 


We are also proposing to require that animals intended for export be inspected within 24 hours of embarkation and to
make a minor language change to the regulations for the sake of clarity. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Background 


The regulations in 9 CFR part 91, ``Inspection and Handling of Livestock for Exportation'' (referred to below as the
regulations), prescribe conditions for exporting animals from the United States. The regulations state, among
other things, that all animals, except animals being exported to Canada or Mexico, must be exported through designated
ports of embarkation. 
To receive designation as a port of embarkation, a port must have export 
inspection facilities available for the inspection, holding, feeding, and 
watering of animals prior to exportation to ensure that the animals meet 
certain requirements specified in the regulations. To receive approval as an 
export inspection facility, the regulations provide that a facility must meet 
the specified standards in  91.14(c) concerning materials, size, inspection implements, cleaning and disinfection,
feed and water, access, testing and treatment, location, disposal of animal wastes, lighting, and office and rest
room facilities.

We are proposing to establish additional standards in  91.14(c) for export inspection facilities. We propose
to require the following: 
1. Export inspection facilities that examine horses must have ceilings at least 12 feet high in any areas where horses
will be. This is the minimum height necessary to accommodate horses, which may rear up. 
2. Every export inspection facility must have running water and a water drainage system. The drainage system must
be able to control surface drainage into or from the facility in a manner that prevents any significant risk of livestock
diseases being spread into or from the facility. While current regulations in  91.14(c)(5) require that facilities
have only ``an ample supply of potable water,'' we believe that running water and a drainage system are necessary to
adequately water the animals, to clean and disinfect the facility, and to prevent the spread of disease. 
We have determined that not all currently approved export inspection facilities have water drainage systems and
that these proposed requirements could thus compel these facilities to make structural changes. Therefore, we would
allow these facilities 2 years from the effective date of the final version of this rule to install a water drainage
system that prevents any significant risk of livestock diseases being spread into or from the facility. However,
all facilities would be required to have running water upon the effective date of the final version of this rule. 
3. Every export inspection facility must have a storage area for equipment that may accompany horses and other export
animals. The area must be able to protect equipment from weather conditions. 
4. Every export inspection facility must have a telephone. A telephone is necessary to notify an Animal and Plant Health
Inspection Service (APHIS) representative, an accredited veterinarian, or the exporter in the event of an emergency,
such as sudden onset of illness among animals to be exported. A telephone is also necessary to make reservations, cancellations,
or changes regarding the arrival time of animals. 
5. Export inspection facilities for examining horses must have walkways in front of the animal stalls. Walkways must
be wide enough that APHIS personnel can monitor and inspect animals without having to enter animal stalls. This requirement
is essential for safety reasons, as horses may kick while being inspected. 


Miscellaneous 


The regulations in  91.3(a) require that certain animals intended for export to Mexico or Canada be accompanied
from the State of origin to the United States border by an origin health certificate. In addition to other requirements,
this certificate must certify that the animals were inspected within the 30 days prior to their movement for export
and that they ``were found to be sound, healthy, and free from evidence of communicable disease and exposure thereto.''
We are proposing to remove the word ``sound'' from this section, as it is too vague to be enforceable. 
We are also proposing to amend the regulations in  91.15(a). The regulations in 91.15(a) require that animals
be inspected by an APHIS veterinarian prior to export, but do not specify a time frame prior to export during which animals
must be inspected. We are proposing to require that all animals intended for export be inspected by an APHIS veterinarian
within 24 hours of embarkation. Because animals may become ill shortly before embarkation, and because we do not want
sick or diseased animals to be exported from the United States, we believe it is imperative that animals be inspected
by an APHIS veterinarian within 24 hours of embarkation. 


Executive Order 12866 and Regulatory Flexibility Act 


This proposed rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12866. The rule has been determined to be not significant
for purposes of Executive Order 12866, and, therefore, has not been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget.

This proposed rule, if adopted, would establish additional standards for animal export inspection facilities by
requiring all facilities to have adequate running water and water drainage systems, storage areas, and a telephone.
This action would also require facilities where horses are inspected to have walkways in front of stalls and ceiling
height adequate for horses. 
Though a small number of facilities do not have water drainage systems, all of the facilities currently approved for
export inspection already meet all of the other additional standards proposed here. We are proposing, therefore,
only to codify existing industry practices. We anticipate that this proposal will have an economic impact on the few
existing export inspection facilities without drainage systems. 
Information was not available to us for determining the economic impact of requiring that water drainage systems
be installed in facilities not already so equipped. However, we have tried to minimize any economic impact by proposing
to allow these facilities 2 years from the effective date of the final version of this rule to install water drainage
systems. Allowing these facilities 2 years to install the water drainage systems would ease the economic impact of
this new standard, as affected facilities would have additional time to shop for different drainage system options
and would be able to spread out the costs of installation. 
Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that
this action would not have a 
significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. 


Executive Order 12372 


This program/activity is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic 
Assistance under No. 10.025 and is subject to Executive Order 12372, which 
requires intergovernmental consultation with State and local officials. (See

Executive Order 12778 


This proposed rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil 
Justice Reform. If this proposed rule is adopted: (1) All State and local 
laws and regulations that are inconsistent with this rule will be preempted; 
(2) no retroactive effect will be given to this rule; and (3) administrative 
proceedings will not be required before parties may file suit in court 
challenging this rule.

Certificate for Importation of Milk and Milk Products 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, USDA. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 We are proposing to amend the regulations concerning the importation of milk and milk products to require that any
milk or milk product imported into the United States from countries declared free of rinderpest and foot-and-mouth
disease be accompanied by a certificate stating that the milk was produced and processed in a country declared free
of rinderpest and foot-and-mouth disease, or that the milk product was processed in a country declared free of rinderpest
and foot-and-mouth disease from milk produced in a country declared free of rinderpest and foot-and-mouth disease.
The certificate would have to name the country in which the milk was produced and the country in which the milk or milk
product was processed. Also, the certificate would state that, except for certain movements under seal, the milk
or milk product has never been in any country in which rinderpest or foot-and-mouth disease exists. Requiring a certificate
would help ensure that milk or milk products imported into the United States do not introduce rinderpest or foot-and-mouth
disease into the United States. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Background 


The regulations in 9 CFR part 94 (referred to below as ``the regulations'') govern the importation into the United
States of specified animals and animal products in order to prevent the introduction into the United States of various
diseases, including rinderpest and foot-and-mouth disease (FMD). These are dangerous and destructive communicable
diseases of ruminants and swine. 
The regulations in  94.1(a)(2) list countries that are declared free of rinderpest and FMD. Milk and milk products
have the potential to spread rinderpest and FMD if they are produced or processed in or have transited a country where
these diseases exist. Therefore, under  94.16, milk and milk products are restricted entry into the United
States unless they are imported from countries listed in  94.1(a)(2). As trade barriers are being lifted between
many countries (such as among members of the European Union), it has become increasingly difficult to ensure that
milk or milk products imported from countries listed in  94.1(a)(2) were produced and processed in a country
free of rinderpest and FMD and were never in a country where rinderpest or FMD exists. 
For example, some milk produced in France was recently imported into the United States from Great Britain. At that
time, France was designated in the regulations as a country where rinderpest or FMD exists. If APHIS had known that
the milk imported from Great Britain had been produced in France, we would not have permitted its importation into
the United States. 
To help prevent similar incidents, we are proposing to amend  94.16 to require that milk or milk products imported
into the United States from a country listed in  94.1(a)(2) as free of rinderpest and FMD must be accompanied
by a certificate endorsed by a full-time, salaried veterinarian employed by the country of export. The certificate
would have to state that the milk was produced and processed in a country listed in  94.1(a)(2), or that the milk
product was processed in a country listed in  94.1(a)(2) from milk produced in a country listed in  94.1(a)(2).
The certificate would have to name the country in which the milk was produced and the country in which the milk or milk
product was processed. Further, the certificate would state that, except for movement under seal as described in
 94.16(c), the milk or milk product has never been in any country in which rinderpest or FMD exists. (Section
94.16(c) allows milk or milk products imported into the United States from countries listed in  94.1(a)(2)
as free of rinderpest and FMD to transit a country infected with rinderpest or FMD en route to the United States, provided
the milk or milk products are, among other things, transported under serially numbered official seals to ensure that
the milk or milk product is not removed from its container during transit.) 
This certification would help ensure that milk or milk products imported into the United States do not introduce rinderpest
or FMD into the United States. 
However, we do not propose to require that milk or milk products imported from Canada be accompanied by the proposed
certificate, even though Canada is listed in  94.1(a)(2) as free of rinderpest and FMD. Canada has a common land
border with only the United States, and Canada imports milk and milk products from other countries under conditions
as restrictive as would be acceptable for importation into the United States. Therefore, we do not believe the certificate
would be necessary. 


Executive Order 12866 and Regulatory Flexibility Act 


This proposed rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12866. The rule has been determined to be not significant
for purposes of Executive Order 12866, and, therefore, has not been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget.

This proposed rule would require that, except for milk and milk products imported from Canada, milk and milk products
imported into the United States from countries declared free of rinderpest and FMD be accompanied by a certificate
stating that the milk was produced and processed in a country declared free of rinderpest and FMD, or that the milk product
was processed in a country declared free of rinderpest and FMD from milk produced in a country declared free of rinderpest
and FMD. The certificate would have to name the country in which the milk was produced and the country in which the milk
or milk product was processed. The certificate would also have to state that the milk or milk product has never been
in any country in which rinderpest or FMD exists. 
We do not expect that requiring a certificate would have any significant economic impact for U.S. importers of milk
or milk products. The exporter of the milk or milk products would have to obtain the required certification through
the national government of the country of export prior to shipping the milk or milk products to the United States. We
do not know how many of those governments would charge a fee for providing the certificate, but it is unlikely that any
fee would be high enough to significantly raise the cost of the milk or milk product should the exporter choose to pass
the cost of the certificate on to the importer in the United States. 
Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that
this action would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.

Ballast Water Management for Vessels Entering the Hudson River



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Coast Guard, DOT.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of proposed rulemaking.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Coast Guard proposes regulations to implement an amendment to the Nonindigenous Aquatic Nuisance Prevention
and Control Act of 1990 (the Act). The proposed regulations, if adopted, would require Ballast Water Management practices
for each vessel entering the Hudson River, north of the George Washington Bridge, after operating on waters beyond
the Exclusive Economic Zone.



These rules would help to prevent the additional introduction of nonindigenous aquatic nuisance species into the
Great Lakes through the ballast water of vessels operating on the Hudson River.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Request for Comments



The Coast Guard encourages interested persons to participate in this rulemaking by submitting written data, views,
or arguments. Persons submitting comments should include their names and addresses, identify this rulemaking (CGD
94-003) and the specific section of this proposal to which each comment applies, and give the reason for each
comment. Please submit two copies of all comments and attachments in an unbound format, no larger than 81/2 by 11 inches,
suitable for copying and electronic filing. Persons wanting acknowledgment of receipt of comments should enclose
stamped, self-addressed postcards or envelopes.

The Coast Guard will consider all comments received during the comment period. It may change this proposal in view
of the comments.

The Coast Guard plans no public hearing. Persons may request a public hearing by writing to the Marine Safety Council
at the address under ``ADDRESSES.'' The request should include the reasons why a hearing would be beneficial. If it
determines that the opportunity for oral presentations will aid this rulemaking, the Coast Guard will hold a public
hearing at a time and place announced by a later notice in the 

Federal Register.



Drafting Information



The principal persons involved in drafting this document are Lieutenant Jonathan C. Burton, Project Manager, Marine
Environmental Protection Division, and Ms. Helen Boutrous, Project Counsel, Office of Chief Counsel.



Background and Purpose



Historical records suggest that over 100 non-native species have been introduced into the Great Lakes and its tributaries.
The primary medium for their introduction is believed to be ballast water from vessels. Many vessels take on water
in foreign harbors or in the near shore waters which are often rich in living organisms. When these vessels arrive to
take on cargo, they discharge ballast water and any organisms contained in the water enter the local ecosystem. While
many of these species do not survive in this new environment, those that do quickly adapt, and in some instances thrive,
particularly where there are no natural predators.

The Zebra Mussel provides a good example of the harmful effects of a newly introduced species. In 1988, this small bivalve
mollusk native to the Black, Azov, and Caspian Seas in the Ukraine and southern Russia, was discovered in the Western
Basin of Lake Erie. Scientists believe that it was introduced in 1986 by the discharge of freshwater ballast of a vessel
from Northern Europe. Hundreds of millions of Zebra Mussels can now be found on and in pipes, screens, conduits, boat
bottoms, floats, buoys, rocks, submerged objects, and native animals and plants. As a filter feeding organism, it
removes vast quantities of microscopic organisms from the water, the same organisms that fish larvae and young fish
rely upon for their food supply. It also completely covers rocks and other substances normally used by native fish
for laying eggs. Since its introduction into the Great lakes the Zebra Mussel has reproduced and spread throughout
the Great Lakes and its tributaries and has been found as far south as New Orleans.

The Coast Guard issued ballast water control regulations on April 8, 1993, for vessels entering the Great Lakes after
operating beyond the exclusive economic zone (EEZ). Such vessels are required to exchange their ballast water beyond
the EEZ. While the regulations are viewed as an excellent start toward addressing the nonindigenous aquatic nuisance
species introduction problem, Congress now realizes that it is necessary to implement ballast water controls for
vessels entering the Hudson River after operating beyond the EEZ. The Hudson River is connected to the Great Lakes
through the New York State Barge Canal System which allows for the movement of commercial and recreational vessels
throughout waterways of New York State and provides direct access to the Great Lakes. As a result of this connection,
species released from vessel's ballast water into the Hudson River can migrate, or can be transferred by vessels navigating
the canal system into the Great Lakes. 



Solutions 



Congress has noted that high seas ballast exchange is ``not a panacea'' for prevention of unintentional introductions
of nonindigenous aquatic species. Other means of infestation such as attachment to anchor chains and vessel hulls
contribute to infiltration. Moreover, the effects of ballast water exchange on high seas and coastal ecosystems
are not yet completely known. Nevertheless, ballast water exchange currently appears to be the most cost and labor
effective means of reducing the probability of new infestations. Alternative approaches may be warranted in some
situations, or may replace ballast exchange entirely, depending upon knowledge obtained through a Task Force set
up by the Act. 



International Recognition 



The need for control of the introduction of nonindigenous species has also been recognized by the international maritime
community. The ballast water control regulations for vessels entering the Great Lakes that were issued by the Coast
Guard on April 8, 1993, in large part, were based on ballast water control guidelines adopted by The Marine Environment
Protection Committee of the International Maritime Organization at its 31st session in July 1991. The resolution
(MEPC 50(31)) which accompanied the issuance of the guidelines recommends that member countries issue guidelines
for the control of nonindigenous species into their ports. 



United States Legislation 



On November 4, 1993, Congress amended (Pub. L. 102-587) the Nonindigenous Aquatic Nuisance Prevention and
Control Act of 1990 (the Act) (16 U.S.C. 4711(b)). This amendment extends the Act's applicability to vessels entering
the Hudson River, north of the George Washington Bridge, after operating beyond the EEZ. The Act, as amended, attempts
to prevent the spread of injurious nonindigenous species into the Great Lakes through the ballast water of these vessels.
The Act mandates that the Coast Guard, in consultation with the Task Force created by the Act, issue regulations to
prevent the introduction and spread of aquatic nuisance species in the Great Lakes through the ballast water of vessels
entering a U.S. port, north of the George Washington Bridge, on the Hudson River, after operating beyond the EEZ. 

The current regulations contained in 33 CFR part 151, subpart C, issued under the Act, cover vessels entering the Great
Lakes after operating beyond the EEZ and require the retention of ballast water or the exchange of ballast water beyond
the EEZ, by vessels subject to the Act. Further, as authorized under the Act, those regulations permit the use of environmentally
sound alternative ballast water management methods that the Coast Guard determines are as effective as ballast water
exchange in preventing and controlling infestations of aquatic nuisance species, thereby providing the needed
flexibility to approve additional ballast water management methods that, in the future, may prove to be even more
effective than ballast water exchange. These requirements, as well as the other requirements contained in subpart
C of part 151, would satisfy the requirements of the amendments to the Act if applied to vessels navigating on the Hudson
River, north of the George Washington Bridge, after operating beyond the EEZ. Therefore, few changes to the regulations
issued by the Coast Guard on April 8, 1993, covering vessels entering a U.S. port on the Great Lakes after operating
beyond the EEZ, are required to implement the requirements of the amendments to the Act.

The Act provides for civil and criminal penalties (16 U.S.C. 4711(c) and (d)). Any person who violates the regulations
shall be liable for a civil penalty not to exceed $25,000. Each day of a continuing violation would constitute a separate
violation. A vessel operated in violation of the regulations would be liable in rem for any civil penatly assessed
for that violation. Any person who knowingly violates the regulations would be guilty of a class C felony. A class C
felony is punishable by imprisonment of not more than 12 years (18 U.S.C. 3581(b)(3)) and a fine of not more than $250,000
for an individual or not more than $500,000 for an organization (18 U.S.C. 3571(c)(3)).
In accordance with the Act, the Coast Guard proposes the regulations discussed below.


 Discussion of Proposed Rules


This proposal, if adopted, would propose changes to subpart C of 33 CFR part 151 to extend the applicability of the ballast
water management requirements to vessels operating on the Hudson River, north of the George Washington Bridge, after
operating on the waters beyond the EEZ.
Proposed changes to  151.1504 would add ``the Captain of the Port, New York,'' to the definition of ``Captain
of the Port (COTP)'' and add the ``Hudson River, north of the George Washington Bridge,'' to the definition of ``Voyage''.
A proposed change to  151.1510(a)(1) would require that an exchange of ballast water be carried out on the waters
beyond the EEZ, in a depth exceeding 2000 meters, prior to a vessel traveling on the Hudson River, north of the George
Washington Bridge.
A proposed change to  151.1510(a)(2) would authorize the COTP to seal the tanks of vessels subject to the Act,
in which ballast water is retained, for the duration of the voyage within the Hudson River, north of the George Washington
Bridge.
By proposing to apply subpart C of part 151 to the vessels subject to the amendments to the Act, the Coast Guard is proposing
that each of the requirements of subpart C, including collection-of-information requirements which will be discussed
below, apply to vessels navigating on the Hudson River, north of the George Washington Bridge, after operating beyond
the EEZ.


Regulatory Evaluation


This proposal is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does not require
an assessment of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that order. It has not been reviewed by the Office
of Management and Budget under that order. It is not significant under the regulatory policies and procedures of the
Department of Transportation (DOT) (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979).
A draft Regulatory Evaluation under paragraph 10e of the regulatory policies and procedures of DOT has been prepared
and is available in the docket for inspection or copying where indicated under ``ADDRESSES.'' The Evaluation is summarized
as follows.
In 1992, 112 visits were made by vessels to the Hudson River, north of the George Washington Bridge, after operating
beyond the EEZ. The most recent data available from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers concerning Hudson River vessel
traffic reveals that vessels operating on the Hudson River after operating beyond the EEZ are primarily foreign importer
vessels. Vessels carrying cargo, such as vessels engaged in importing, are generally not carrying ballast water.
Accordingly, the Coast Guard has identified no vessels that have actually discharged ballast into the Hudson River.
Vessels that do not discharge ballast, do not have to exchange ballast water and would incur no costs due to the proposed
regulations. Therefore, the only aspect of the proposed regulations that these vessels would be subject to is the
recordkeeping requirements of 33 CFR 151.1516. It is estimated that it takes one half hour to complete. At the cost
of $35.00 per half hour and assuming 120 visits by vessels subject to these regulations, the annual cost will be $4,200.

Small Entities



Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq

.), the Coast Guard must consider whether this proposal, if adopted, will have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities. ``Small entities'' may include (1) small businesses and not-for-profit organizations
that are independently owned and operated and are not dominant in their fields and (2) governmental jurisdictions
with populations of less than 50,000.

Owners of vessels that would be engaging in ballast water management in the affected area are large corporations.
No small entities have been identified as being affected. The economic affect on all entities will be minimal. No U.S.
vessels have been identified as being subject to the proposed regulations. The total cost per vessel has been determined
to be $35 per visit for each vessel with a total annual cost in 1995 to $4,200 for all vessels. Therefore, the Coast Guard
certifies under 5 U.S.C. 605(b) that this proposal, if adopted, will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities. If, however, you think that your business or organization qualifies as a small entity and
that this proposal will have a significant economic impact on your business or organization, please submit a comment
(see 

ADDRESSES

) explaining why you think it qualifies and in what way and to what degree this proposal will economically affect it.



Collection of Information



Under the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq

.), the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) reviews each proposed rule that contains a collection-of-information
requirement to determine whether the practical value of the information is worth the burden imposed by its collection.
Collection-of-information requirements include reporting, recordkeeping, notification, and other, similar
requirements.

This proposal contains collection-of-information requirements in the following sections:  151.1516. The
following particulars apply:






DOT No: 

2115.


OMB Control No.: 

2115-0598.


Administration: 

U.S. Coast Guard.


Title: 

Ballast Water Management for Vessels Entering the Hudson River


Need for Information: 

No other method exists for the Coast Guard to determine compliance with the regulations. Recording of ballast water
management will allow for review of this compliance and aid in establishing the sources of species introduced through
ballast water.


Proposed Use of Information: 

This information will be used to determine compliance with the regulations and for development of a statistical base
for determining the possible sources of nonindigenous aquatic nuisance invasions.



Frequency of Response: 

Upon each entry into the Hudson River, north of the George Washington Bridge, after operating beyond the EEZ, certain
information must be available to provide to the COTP.



Burden Estimate: 60 hours annually.

Respondents: 

Approximately 120 visits by foreign vessels will be subject to this requirement.



Form(s): 

No specific form is required by the proposed regulations.



Average Burden Hours per Respondent: 

.5 hour.




The Coast Guard has submitted the requirements to OMB for review under section 3504(h) of the Paperwork Reduction
Act. Persons submitting comments on the requirements should submit their comments both to OMB and to the Coast Guard
where indicated under 

ADDRESSES.





Federalism



The Coast Guard has analyzed this proposal under the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612 and
has determined that this proposal does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of
a Federalism Assessment.

The authority to issue regulations requiring ballast water management practices for vessels navigating the Hudson
River, north of the George Washington Bridge, after operating beyond the EEZ, has been committed to the Coast Guard
by the Act. Standardizing the minimum requirements for these vessels is necessary to effectively prevent further
introductions of nonindigenous species. Therefore, if the rule becomes final, the Coast Guard intends it to preempt
state and local regulations that are inconsistent with the requirements of this proposed rule. These regulations
were developed in consultation with the Task Force which is charged with coordinating among, and providing technical
assistance to, regional, State, and local entities regarding environmentally sound approaches to prevention and
control of aquatic nuisance species. 



Environment



The Coast Guard considered the environmental impact of this proposal and concluded that preparation of an Environmental
Impact Statement is not necessary. An Environmental Assessment and a draft Finding of No Significant Impact are available
in the docket for inspection or copying where indicated under 

ADDRESSES

. The exchange of ballast water in open ocean would benefit the Hudson River environment and the Great Lakes environment
by helping to prevent potential infestations of nonindigenous species through ballast water emptied into the Hudson
River north of the George Washington Bridge and transferred through the Hudson River and into the Great Lakes. Introduction
of nonindigenous nuisance species through the ballast water of vessels has caused millions of dollars of damage to
date in the Great Lakes area.

Initial study has concluded that the amount of vessels' seawater-ballast to be discharged into the Hudson River would
constitute such a small volume that no change in the salinity or temperature levels would occur. Species contained
in water collected from the open ocean are unlikely to survive a fresh water environment. Any nuisance species contained
in the ballast water would not therefore, create a new infestation.
While these regulations will help to prevent potential infestation of species introduced through the ballast water
of vessels, data from the Army Corps of Engineers shows that no vessel traveled north of the George Washington Bridge
in a light cargo load condition after operating beyond the EEZ. This indicates that these vessels carried no ballast
water. Therefore, it is anticipated that few vessels will actually be discharging water into the Hudson River. Therefore,
the Coast Guard has concluded that the proposed regulations would have no negative impact on the environment. The
Coast Guard solicits comments on the potential environmental impact of the proposed regulations.

Approval and Promulgation of Air Quality Implementation Plans; State of Maryland-Emission Statement Program



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 EPA is proposing approval of a State 
Implementation Plan (SIP) revision submitted by the State of 
Maryland. This revision consists of an emission statement program for stationary sources which emit volatile organic
compounds (VOCs) and/or nitrogen oxides (NOx) at or above specified actual emission threshold levels. This program
applies throughout the State of Maryland. The SIP revision was submitted by the State to satisfy the Clean Air Act's
requirements for an emission statement program as part of the ozone SIP for the State of Maryland. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On November 13, 1992, the State of Maryland's Department of the Environment (MDE) submitted a revision to Maryland's
SIP which requires owners of stationary sources that emit VOCs and/or NOx, above specified actual emission applicability
thresholds, to submit annual statements certifying emissions. 



I. Background


The air quality planning and State Implementation Plan (SIP) 
requirements for ozone nonattainment and transport areas are set 
out in subparts I and II of part D of title I of the Clean Air 
Act, as amended by the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, (CAA
or ``the Act''). EPA published a ``General Preamble'' describing 
its preliminary views on how it intends to review SIP's and 
SIP revisions submitted under title I of the CAA, including those State submittals for ozone transport areas within
the States (see 57 FR 13498 (April 16, 1992) (``SIP: General Preamble for the 
Implementation of title I of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 
1990''), 57 FR 18070 (April 28, 1992) (``Appendices to the General 
Preamble''), and 57 FR 55620 (November 25, 1992) (``SIP: NOx 
Supplement to the General Preamble'')). 

EPA also issued a draft guidance document describing the 
requirements for the emission statement programs discussed in 
this document, entitled ``Guidance on the Implementation of an 
Emission Statement Program'' (July, 1992). The Agency is also 
conducting a rulemaking process to modify 40 CFR part 51 to reflect the requirements of the emission statement 
program.

Section 182 of the Act sets out a graduated control program for ozone nonattainment areas. Section 182(a) sets out
requirements applicable in marginal nonattainment areas, which are also made applicable by section 182 (b), (c),
(d), and (e) to all other ozone nonattainment areas. Among the requirements in section 182(a) is a program for stationary
sources to prepare and submit to the State each year emission statements certifying their actual emissions of VOCs
and NOx. This section of the Act provides that the States are to submit a revision to their SIPs by November 15, 1992 establishing
this emission statement program.

If a source emits either VOC or NOx at or above the designated minimum reporting level, the other pollutant should be
included in the emission statement, even if it is emitted at levels below the specified cutoffs.

The States may waive, with EPA approval, the requirement for an emission statement for classes or categories of sources
with less than 25 tons per year of actual plant-wide NOx or VOC emissions in nonattainment areas if the class or category
is included in the base year and periodic inventories and emissions are calculated using emission factors established
by EPA (such as those found in EPA publication AP-42) or other methods acceptable to EPA. 
At minimum the emission statement data should include: 
 Certification of data accuracy; 
 Source identification information; 
 Operating schedule; 
 Emissions information (to include annual and typical ozone season day emissions); 
 Control equipment information; and 
 Process data.



EPA developed emission statements data elements to be consistent with other source and State reporting requirements.
This consistency is essential to assist States with quality assurance for emission estimates and to facilitate consolidation
of all EPA reporting requirements.



II. Description of the State Submittal


A. Procedural Background


The State of Maryland held public hearings on September 21 (Frederick), September 22 (Columbia), and September 23,
1992 (Centreville) for the purpose of soliciting public comment on proposed regulatory revisions concerning emission
statements for stationary sources. Following the public hearings, the regulatory revisions were adopted by the
Secretary of the Environment on November 13, 1992, submitted to EPA on November 13, 1992 as a revision to the SIP, and
became effective in the State of Maryland on December 7, 1992. 



B. Components of Maryland's Emission Statement Program


There are several key and specific components of an acceptable emission statement program. Specifically, the State
must submit a revision to its SIP which consists of an emission statement program which meets the minimum requirements
for reporting by the sources and the State. For the emission statement program to be approvable, the state's SIP must
include, at a minimum, definitions and provisions for applicability, compliance, and specific source reporting
requirements and reporting forms. 

Maryland's revision consists of amendments to COMAR 26.11.01 General Administrative Procedures. These amendments,
revise COMAR 26.11.01.01, Definitions, and add 26.11.01.05-1, Emission Statements. 
Section .01, Definitions, has been revised by amending or adding the definitions of the following terms: Actual emissions;
Capture efficiency; Certifying individual; Control efficiency; Oxides of nitrogen; Percent seasonal throughput;
Standard Industrial Classification; and Typical ozone season day. 

Section .05-1, Emission Statements, requires that a person who owns or operates any installation, source,
or premises located in areas designated by the CAA as marginal, moderate, serious, severe or extreme ozone nonattainment
area to report the levels of emissions from the sources emitting 25 tons per year (TPY) or more of VOCs and NOx, in order
to track emission reductions and attain the ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). Because the entire
State of Maryland is in the Northeast Ozone Transport Region, emission statement reporting provisions also apply
to sources in all remaining areas of the State which emit 100 TPY of NOx or 50 TPY of VOC. Section .05-1, Emission
Statements, requires that a certifying official for each facility provide the State with a statement reporting emissions
by April 1 of each year, beginning with April 1, 1993, for the emissions discharged during the previous calendar year.
Section .05-1, Emission Statements, delineates specific requirements for the content of these annual emission
statements, including the use of the reporting form developed by the MDE. 

 


C. Enforceability 


The State of Maryland has provisions in its SIP (MD. Env. Code Ann. Section 2-609, 2-609.1, 2-610,
2-610.1) which ensure that the emission statement requirements of section 182(a)(3)(B) and sections 184(b)(2)
and 182(f) of the CAA as required by COMAR 26.11.01, sections .01 and .05-1 are adequately enforced. Once EPA
completes the rulemaking process approving the Maryland's Emission Statement program as part of the SIP, it will
be federally enforceable. 

EPA has determined that the submittal made by the State of Maryland satisfies the relevant requirements of the CAA
and EPA's guidance document, ``Guidance on the Implementation of an Emission Statement Program'' (July 1992). EPA's
detailed review of Maryland's Emission Statement Program is contained in a Technical Support Document (TSD) which
is available, upon request, from the EPA Regional Office listed in the Addresses section of this document.



III. Proposed Action


EPA is proposing to approve revisions to the Maryland SIP to include an Emission Statement Program consisting of revisions
to regulation COMAR 26.11.01., General Administrative Provisions, to amend section .01, Definitions, and add section
.05-1, Emission Statements. This revision was submitted to EPA by the State of Maryland on November 13, 1992.



1The EPA is requesting public comments on all aspects of the issues discussed in this document. These comments will
be considered before taking final action. Interested parties may participate in the Federal rulemaking procedure
by submitting written comments to the EPA Regional Office listed in the Addresses section of this document. 
Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for revision of any SIP. Each request for revision to the SIP shall be considered separately in light of specific technical,
economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements.

Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 

et seq.

, EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities.
5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government
entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000.

SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter I, part D of the Act do not create any new requirements, but simply approve
requirements that the State is already imposing. 
Therefore, because the Federal SIP-approval does not impose any new requirements, the Administrator certifies
that it does not have a significant impact on small entities. Moreover, due to the nature of the Federal-state relationship
under the CAA, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic
reasonableness of state action. The CAA forbids EPA to base its actions concerning SIPs on such grounds.

U.S. E.P.A.

 , 427 U.S. 246, 256-66 (S.Ct. 1976); 42 U.S.C. 7410 (a)(2).

This action to propose approval of Maryland's SIP Emission Statements Program has been classified as a Table 2 action
for signature by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in the 

Federal Register

 on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214-2225), as revised by an October 4, 1993 memorandum from Michael H. Shapiro, Acting
Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. A future document will inform the general public of these tables.
On January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions (54 FR 2222) from
the requirements of section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for a period of two years. The EPA has submitted a request for
a permanent waiver for Table 2 and 3 SIP revisions. The OMB has agreed to continue the waiver until such time as it rules
on EPA's request. This request continues in effect under Executive Order 12866, which superseded Executive Order
12291 on September 30, 1993. 

The Administrator's decision to approve or disapprove Maryland's SIP Emission Statements revision will be based
on whether it meets the requirements of section 110(a)(2)(A)-(K), and part D of the Clean Air Act, as amended, and EPA
regulations in 40 CFR part 52.

Proposed Technical Clarification Pertaining to Regulations for Boilers and Industrial Furnaces


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed Technical Amendment.





</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 EPA is proposing a minor amendment to the rules for Boilers and Industrial Furnaces (BIFs). EPA believes that this
amounts only to a technical amendment (because it reflects the Agency's intent as expressed either in the BIF rule
or preamble), but is soliciting comment to assure opportunity for public participation. The amendment would add
certain mercury-bearing wastes to the list of wastes that can be burned in metal-recovery furnaces pursuant to 40
CFR 266.100(c) without triggering the substantive BIF requirements. 


Because the proposed amendment is minor, the comment period is limited to three weeks. After considering any public
comments it receives and revising the amendment accordingly, the EPA may finalize it in the Land Disposal Restrictions
Phase II Rule, scheduled for promulgation in July 1994. The Phase II LDR rule was proposed September 14, 1993 (see 58
FR 48092). 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
Amendment of Boiler and Industrial Furnace Rules for Certain Mercury-Containing Wastes



The final BIF rule conditionally defers regulation of smelting, melting, and refining furnaces that burn hazardous
waste solely for legitimate metal recovery. See  266.100(c). The rule provides three tests for the determination
of burning solely for legitimate metal recovery. The heating value of the waste cannot exceed 5000 Btu/lb (if so, the
waste is considered to be burned partially for energy recovery), the concentration of appendix VIII organic constituents
in the waste cannot exceed 500 ppm (if so, the waste is considered to be burned partially for destruction), and the waste
must have recoverable levels of metal. 
 
The Chlorine Institute has informed the Agency that there are certain mercury-bearing wastes that can in fact be processed
for mercury recovery but would be inappropriately classified as being burned for the purpose of energy recovery because
their fuel value may exceed 5000 Btu/lb. These wastes, proposed to be listed in Appendix XIII to Part 266 by today's
notice, are activated carbon, decomposer graphite, wood, paper, and protective clothing from the electrolytic
mercury cell process used for the production of chlorine. These wastes can contain from hundreds of parts per million
to percent levels (in some cases, as high as 45%) of mercury. (See in the RCRA docket for this notice the letter dated
May 13, 1994 from the Chlorine Institute, Inc. to Matthew A. Straus.) The wastes also are already subject to a LDR treatment
standard that requires recovery of mercury as the method of treatment. (See Table 2 in 40 CFR 268.42, D001 High Mercury
Subcategory.) Under these circumstances, the Agency believes that it would be anomalous to consider these wastes
to be burned for a purpose other than metal recovery based on the Btu content.
 
EPA notes that these wastes can only be recovered in devices that are either: (a) subject to the mercury National Emission
Standard (NESHAP) found at 40 CFR Part 61 Subpart F; (b) subject to a Best Achievable Control Technology (BACT) or Lowest
Achievable Emission Rate (LAER) standard for mercury imposed pursuant to a Prevention of Significant Deterioration
(PSD) permit; or (c) subject to a state permit that establishes emission limitations (within the meaning of section
302 of the Clean Air Act) for mercury. (See Table 2 at 268.42, D001 High Mercury Subcategory, and 55 FR at 22570 (June
l, l990).) Thus, air emissions from these devices should already be sufficiently controlled so that further RCRA
regulation is unnecessary at this time. 55 FR at 22570. Consequently, this proposed amendment is consistent not only
with EPA's intent in promulgating the deferral for metal recovery devices in the BIF rule, but is consistent with the
Agency's determination in establishing LDR treatment standards for high mercury wastes that air emissions from
mercury recovery devices were adequately controlled provided any of the three conditions set forth above (and in
the rules) are satisfied.

Revision of the Rules Regarding Marketing and Equipment Authorizations



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Federal Communications Commission.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Proposed rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This proposal responds to a Petition for Rule Making filed by the Consumer Electronics Group of the Electronic Industries
Association (EIA/CEG) that would consolidate and harmonize the Commission's marketing rules. This proposal will
permit radio frequency devices, prior to authorization or a determination of compliance with the technical standards,
to be announced, advertised, displayed, and operated for compliance testing, demonstrations at trade shows, or
evaluation at the manufacturer's facilities. In addition, non-consumer devices that have not been tested or authorized
could be offered for conditional sale or supplied to the user for evaluation or compliance testing. On its own motion,
the Commission is also proposing to amend its equipment authorizations regulations to provide clarification, to
resolve inconsistencies, to remove unnecessary restrictions and obsolete regulations, and to incorporate several
interpretations. These proposals would stimulate economic growth by permitting products to be developed on a cooperative
basis by manufacturers and retailers, and by potential decreasing the time for a product to reach the marketplace.

Paperwork Reduction



The proposed amendments will not modify the information collection requirements contained in the current regulations.




Summary of the Notice of Proposed Rule Making



1. In the Notice of Proposed Rule Making the Commission, in response to a petition from the Consumer Electronics Group
of the Electronic Industries Association, proposes to amend Part 2 of its rules regarding the marketing and operation
of radio frequency (RF) devices. Marketing includes the sale or lease, offer for sale or lease, including advertising
for sale or lease, and importation, shipment or distribution for the purpose of sale or lease or offering for sale or
lease. Currently, the rules prohibit the marketing and operation of an RF device unless it complies with all of the
standards and the equipment authorization procedures. Certain exceptions to these rules are provided for verified
digital devices and non-consumer ISM products operated under Part 18 of the rules.

2. The proposal would harmonize the marketing rules by permitting RF devices, prior to authorization or a determination
of compliance with the technical standards, to be announced, advertised, displayed, and, if compliant with any Commission
license requirements, operated for compliance testing, demonstrated at trade shows, or evaluated at the manufacturer's
facilities. In addition, non-consumer RF devices, 

i.e.

, products employed at business, commercial, industrial, scientific or medical sites, prior to testing or authorization,
could be offered for conditional sale or supplied to the user for evaluation or compliance testing. As under the existing
rules, no products may be marketed or supplied to the general public prior to testing or authorization. Further, these
products must be designed with the intent of complying with all applicable regulations.
3. On its own motion, the Commission is also proposing several additional changes to the equipment authorization
rules to resolve inconsistencies, to provide clarification, to remove unnecessary restrictions and obsolete regulations,
and to incorporate several interpretations. Specifically, the Commission would amend the rules to indicate, explicitly,
that, as with any request for authorization, an anti-drug abuse statement is required with requests for permissive
changes. In addition, the rules would state that proper labeling of a product is a condition of the grant of equipment
authorization and is required prior to marketing. The Commission would also clarify that a product is considered
to be ``electrically identical'' if no changes are made to the product or if any changes to the product could be treated
as Class I permissive changes. Further, outdated regulations, 

e.g.

, references to type approval which is no longer employed, would be removed, duplicative rules would be removed, and
erroneous rule citations would be corrected.
4. In addition to the above changes, the Commission proposes to require that any party that modifies an authorized
RF device becomes responsible for ensuring that the modified product continues to comply with the appropriate standards
and must maintain whatever records are required to demonstrate such compliance. In order to facilitate identification,
the Commission also proposes that a product modified by someone other than the original responsible party be labeled
with the name, address and telephone number of the new responsible party along with a statement that the product has
been modified.
5. Finally, the Commission would amend the regulations regarding authorization under the verification procedure
to clarify the information required to be retained by the responsible party and to indicate the time period within
which requests by the Commission for product samples must be submitted and the party responsible for submitting those
samples.


Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis


6. As required by Section 603 of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, the Commission has prepared an Initial Regulatory
Flexibility Analysis (IRFA) of the expected impact on small entities of the proposals suggested in this document.
Written public comments are requested on the IRFA. These comments must be filed in accordance with the same filing
deadlines as comments on the rest of the Notice, but they must have a separate and distinct heading designating them
as responses to the Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis. The Secretary shall send a copy of this Notice of Proposed
Rule Making, including the Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis, to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small
Business Administration in accordance with paragraph 603(a) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. Pub. L. No. 96-354,
Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. Section 601 

et seq.

 (1981).


Reason for Action


This Notice of Proposed Rule Making responds to the petition submitted by the Electronic Industries Association,
Consumer Electronics Group, to harmonize our rules regarding the announcement, advertising, display, activation
and marketing of radio frequency (RF) devices prior to compliance with the applicable standards. On our own initiative,
we are also proposing amendments to the Part 2 rules to address the responsibility of parties that modify products
prior to sale, and to establish a time frame within which samples or records files of verified devices must be submitted
to the Commission upon request. In addition, we are proposing to amend the equipment authorization rules to clarify
existing regulations, remove outdated regulations, and correct erroneous rule citations.


Objectives


The objectives of this proposal are to facilitate the marketing and display of RF devices, to identify the party ultimately
responsible for ensuring that a marketed device complies with the standards, to facilitate the retrieval of test
records by the Commission, to clarify existing regulations, to remove outdated regulations, and to correct existing
errors in the rules.


Legal Basis


The proposed action is authorized under Sections 4(i), 302, 303(e), 303(f), and 303(r) of the Communications Act
of 1934, as amended 47 U.S.C. Sections 154(i), 302, 303(e), 303(f), and 303(r).



Reporting, Recordkeeping and Other Compliance Requirements


One change to the reporting and recordkeeping requirements would be initiated by this proposal: parties that take
authorized RF devices and remanufacture or otherwise modify these products prior to marketing would be designated
as the parties responsible for ensuring that the products comply with the applicable rules and, thus, would have the
same reporting and record keeping requirements that normally apply to an equipment manufacturer.


Federal Rules Which Overlap, Duplicate or Conflict With These Rules 


None.


Description, Potential Impact and Number of Small Entities Involved


It is unknown how many small entities that may be affected. There should be no adverse impact on any party that manufacturers
or markets equipment that currently complies with our standards.


Any Significant Alternatives Minimizing the Impact on Small Entities Consistent With Stated Objectives


None.

(3) Evaluation of product performance and determination of customer acceptability, provided such operation takes
place at the manufacturer's facilities during developmental, design or preproduction states; or, 
(4) Evaluation of product performance and determination of customer acceptability where customer acceptability
of a radio frequency device cannot be determined at the manufacturer's facilities because of size or unique capability
of the device, provided the device is operated at a business, commercial, industrial, scientific, or medical user's
site, but not at a residential site, during the development, design or preproduction stages. A product operated under
this provision shall be labelled, in a conspicuous location, with the notice in paragraph (c) of this section. 
(5) For the purpose of paragraphs (e)(3) and (e)(4) of this section, the term ``manufacturer's facilities'' includes
the facilities of the party responsible for compliance with the regulations and the manufacturer's premises, as
well as other entities working under the authorization of the responsible party in connection with the development
and manufacture, but not marketing, of the equipment. 
(6) The provisions of paragraphs (e)(1), (e)(2), (e)(3), and (e)(4) of this section do not eliminate any requirements
for station licenses that may be specified elsewhere in this chapter. 
(f) For radio frequency devices subject to verification and sold solely to business, commercial, industrial, scientific,
and medical users (excluding sales to the general public), parties responsible for verification of the devices shall
have the option of ensuring compliance with the applicable technical specifications of this chapter at each end user's
location after installation, provided that the purchase or lease agreement includes a proviso that such a determination
of compliance be made and is the responsibility of the party responsible for verification of the equipment. 
(g) The provisions in paragraphs (b) through (f) of this section apply only to devices that are designed with the intent
of compliance with all applicable requirements in this chapter. The provisions in paragraphs (b) through (f) do not
apply to radio frequency devices that could not be authorized or legally operated under the current rules. Such devices
shall not be operated, advertised, displayed, offered for sale or lease, sold or leased, or otherwise marketed.

Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants; Extension of the Final Decision To List the Mobile River System Population
of the Alabama Sturgeon as an Endangered Species With Critical Habitat


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Fish and Wildlife Service, Interior.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Proposed rule; notice of 6 month extension of deadline and reopening of the comment period.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

On June 15, 1993 the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) proposed to determine endangered status for the Alabama
sturgeon (

Scaphirhynchus suttkusi

) under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act). The Act requires the Service to make a final determination
on such proposals within 12 months, but provides for a 6 month extension if there is substantial disagreement regarding
the sufficiency or accuracy of the available data relevant to that determination. The Service finds that there is
such a substantial disagreement concerning whether the Alabama sturgeon continues to exist and therefore extends
the deadline with respect to the decision to list the Alabama sturgeon.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
Background


This sturgeon, which is endemic to the Mobile River system in Alabama and Mississippi and was once widespread in this
system, has had a significant decline in both population size and range in the Mobile River system. The fish may currently
exist in only a short, free-flowing reach of the Alabama River below Claiborne Lock and Dam in Clarke and Monroe Counties,
Alabama. Primary factors that have likely contributed to the sturgeon's decline include dams, altered river flows,
gravel-mining operations, general habitat degradation from land use practices, and, perhaps, overfishing, particularly
at the turn of the century.
The Alabama sturgeon, once called the Alabama shovelnose sturgeon, or just shovelnose sturgeon, has been recognized
since 1976 as a distinct, undescribed taxon (Ramsey 1976) that is most similar to the shovelnose sturgeon (

Scaphirhynchus platorynchus

) of the Mississippi River system and the Rio Grande. The Alabama sturgeon is a relatively small sturgeon; the maximum
standard length is about 72 centimeters (28 inches). It has an elongated, heavily armored, depressed body and an attenuated
caudal peduncle. The caudal fin has a long filament on the upper lobe that is characteristic of the genus. Sexual dimorphism
is slight. Morphological characteristics of the juvenile Alabama sturgeon are unknown. The Alabama sturgeon can
generally be distinguished from the shovelnose sturgeon of the Mississippi River system. The Alabama sturgeon almost
always has larger eyes, it has different plate numbers posterior to the anal fin, there is a difference in dorsal fin
ray numbers, and there are three diagnostic characters associated with its head armature (Mayden and Kuhajda 1994).
The Alabama sturgeon is known only from the Mobile River system of Alabama and Mississippi. Historically, this sturgeon
was found in the Mobile, Tensas, Alabama, Tombigbee, Black Warrior, Cahaba, Tallapoosa, and Coosa Rivers of the Mobile
River system (Burke and Ramsey 1985). The only recent confirmed record (since about 1985) of the Alabama sturgeon
is from the free-flowing portion of the Alabama River below Claiborne Lock and Dam.
The Alabama sturgeon was once common in Alabama. In a statistical report to Congress in 1898 (U.S. Commission of Fish
and Fisheries 1898), the total catch of shovelnose sturgeon from Alabama was 19,500 kilograms (kg) (42,900 pounds
(lb)). Of this total, 18,000 kg (39,500 lb) came from the Alabama River, 1,000 kg (2,300 lb) from the Black Warrior River,
and 500 kg (1,100 lb) from the Tennessee River. The shovelnose sturgeon reported from the Alabama and Black Warrior
Rivers was the Alabama sturgeon; the sturgeon from the Tennessee River was from the Mississippi River system shovelnose
sturgeon population. Any anonymous article in the 

Alabama Game and Fish News 

in 1930 stated that the Alabama sturgeon was ``not uncommon.''

Records of this fish supported by preserved specimens are rare. Clemmer (1983) listed 23 specimens in museum collections.
In their status survey, Burke and Ramsey (1985) captured only five Alabama sturgeons. Williams and Clemmer (1991)
located another nine specimens in addition to those examined by Clemmer (1983), making a total of 32 specimens in museum,
university, and private collections. Interestingly, since 1953 there has generally been a 7- to 8-year hiatus between
representative collections of Alabama sturgeon in museums (Mayden and Kuhajda 1994). Verified localities have
primarily been large channels of big rivers in the Mobile River system. However, a couple of Alabama sturgeon records
are from oxbow lakes (Williams and Clemmer 1991).
When the proposed rule was published (June 15, 1993; 58 FR 33148-54), the most recent documented evidence of
the Alabama sturgeon's continued existence consisted of the capture of five Alabama sturgeons in 1985 (Burke and
Ramsey 1985); two were gravid females and one was a juvenile about 2 years old. Biologists from the Alabama Department
of Conservation and Natural Resources (ADCNR), with the assistance and cooperation of the Corps, have in recent years
(1990 and 1992) conducted periodic searches for the Alabama sturgeon, utilizing a variety of sampling gear, without
verifying the presence of a single specimen (Tucker and Johnson 1991, 1992). Nevertheless, the gravid females and
juvenile Alabama sturgeons captured by Burke and Ramsey (1985) provided sufficient evidence that reproduction
was occurring during at least the mid-1980s. Coupled with a high longevity (>20 years), the likelihood of sturgeon
surviving to the present appeared quite high at the time of the proposed rule. 
Since the Burke and Ramsey (1985) status survey, there have been several anecdotal reports by commercial fishermen
that two distant sturgeons have been taken from the Mobile River system in portions of the Alabama River upstream of
Claiborne Lock and Dam. These reports presumably refer to the Alabama sturgeon and the Gulf sturgeon (

Acipenser oxyrinchus desotoi

). The Gulf sturgeon can achieve lengths up to 2 meters (m) (6.6 feet), is generally more robust, and has shorter and
deeper caudal peduncles than does the Alabama sturgeon. In addition, Gulf sturgeon are anadromous, migrating as
adults up rivers from the Gulf of Mexico to spawn. (The Gulf sturgeon was listed as threatened on September 30, 1991
(56 FR 49658.)
The service and the ADCNR conducted an extensive sampling program in 1993 in an effort to locate the Alabama sturgeon
in the Mobile River system. On December 2, 1993, a mature male Alabama sturgeon was caught live in a gill net by staff
of the Service's Panama City, Florida, Field Office. The capture site was in the free-flowing portion of the Alabama
River downstream of Claiborne Lock and Dam, Clarke and Monroe Counties, Alabama. This specimen represents the only
verified record of the Alabama sturgeon in nearly a decade. 
From this chronology of Alabama sturgeon collections, this fish has experienced a tremendous decline in both population
size and range in just 100 years. 
The specific habitat needs of the Alabama sturgeon are largely unknown. Members of the genus 

Scaphirhynchus 

are freshwater fish (Bailey and Cross 1954) that do not make seasonal migrations to and from the sea. Shovelnose sturgeons
in the Mississippi River system are most common in river channels having strong currents over sand, gravel, and rock
substrates (Trautman 1981, Hurley 

et al. 

1987, Curtis 1990) but may occasionally occur over softer sediments (Bailey and Cross 1954). Habitat selection also
appears to be dictated by current velocities (Hurley 

et al. 

1987). The shovelnose sturgeon often uses habitats associated with channel-training devices (Hurley and Nickum
1984, Hurley 

et al. 

1987, Curtis 1990), which are water-diversion structures (e.g., training dikes, wing walls, and closing dams) used
for directing currents to maintain channels. The association of the shovelnose sturgeon with these habitats may
be correlated with higher prey item densities and suitable current velocities (Hurley 

et al. 

1987); high silt loads directly impact many invertebrates that require a relatively stable substrate. The Corps
provided funds for the Service to investigate the possibility that the Alabama sturgeon also uses habitats associated
with channel-training devices in the Alabama River. However, no conclusions were derived from this study as no Alabama
sturgeons were captured (Corps, 

in litt., 

1993). 
Based upon the limited information available, the Alabama sturgeon appears to prefer relatively stable substrates
of gravel and sand in deeper portions of river channels with swift currents (Burke and Ramsey 1985). Limited data collected
from a radio-collared Alabama sturgeon suggested that if frequented swift currents in water 7.5 to 12.0 m (25 to 40
feet) deep (Burke and Ramsey 1985).

Sturgeons are thought to swim upstream to spawn (Becker 1983). Shovelnose sturgeons, based on telemetry studies
conducted during the spawning season, were found to migrate limited distances (Hurley 

et al.

 1987). Spawning habitats for the Alabama sturgeon are generally unknown. Spawning shovelnose sturgeon in the Mississippi
River system generally use hard substrates that may occur in main-channel areas or deep-water habitats associated
with channel-training devices in major rivers or possibly in tributaries (Hurley and Nickum 1984). Observations
by Burke and Ramsey (1985) suggest that the Alabama sturgeon prefers spawning habitat similar to the shovelnose sturgeon
in the Mississippi River system.

Currents are required for the development of sturgeons' adhesive eggs, which require 5 to 8 days to hatch (Burke and
Ramsey 1985). Spawning of the shovelnose sturgeon in the Mississippi River system apparently occurs from April to
July (Moos 1978). The spawning period for the sturgeon probably depends upon water temperature and flows (Moos 1978),
as it does for numerous other fish species. Henry and Ruelle (1992) conducted a study of shovelnose sturgeon reproduction
in the Mississippi River system, concluding that they do not spawn every year and that poor body condition may result
in the production of fewer eggs or infrequent spawning attempts. The reproductive biology of the Alabama sturgeon
is poorly known. However, given what is known concerning the chronology of Alabama sturgeon collections and the reproductive
biology of other sturgeon species, populations of Alabama sturgeon may be cyclical, with peak numbers possibly occurring
every 7 to 8 years (Mayden and Kuhajda 1994).

Several studies have aged sturgeon of the genus 

Scaphirhynchus

 by cross-sectioning pectoral fin spines. Helms (1973) aged shovelnose sturgeon in the Mississippi River at up to
12 years. Durkee 

et al.

 (1979) aged shovelnose sturgeon at up to 14 years in the upper Mississippi River system. Ages ranged from 8 to 27 years
for 288 shovelnose sturgeon sampled from the Missouri River (Zweiacker 1967). However, Zweiacker (1967) could not
validate the marks interpreted as annuli (Moos 1978). Ruelle and Keenlyne (1993) aged three pallid sturgeons at 10,
37, and 41 years. Considering the longevity of this genus, the rarity of the Alabama sturgeon, and the several-year
hiatus that occurs between major year classes, frequent Alabama sturgeon encounters should not be expected.

Burke and Ramsey (1985) conducted stomach analyses of a few Alabama sturgeon. They found that aquatic insect larvae
were a major dietary component, but fish eggs, snails, mussels, and fish were also taken. Shovelnose sturgeon, based
on a study conducted in the Missouri River, are opportunistic feeders (Modde and Schmulbach 1977). Various groups
of aquatic insect larvae generally comprise their diet (Modde and Schmulbach 1977, Durkee 

et al. 

1979).

The recent capture of a single specimen of the Alabama sturgeon afforded scientists the opportunity to obtain fresh
tissue samples and compare its genetic distinctiveness with other sturgeons. The only completed, but unpublished,
study comparing the genetics of these two sturgeons (Schill and Walker 1994) concluded that the Alabama sturgeon
and the shovelnose and pallid sturgeons of the Mississippi River system were indistinguishable based on estimates
of sequence divergence at the mitochondrial cytochrome 

b

 locus. This result is similar to other studies where no cytochrome 

b

 differentiation was found among other fish species within a genus where the species were based on well accepted morphological,
behavioral, and other characteristics (Avise 1994). If the Alabama sturgeon's taxonomy is subsequently revised
to subspecies or population status and is generally accepted by the scientific community, the Alabama sturgeon would
still qualify for protection under the Act provided that it is not extinct.

Section 3(15) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (16 U.S.C. 1531-1544), specifically provides
for listing species, subspecies, and distinct population segments of vertebrate species as endangered or threatened
species. Although the Service finds that there is some disagreement among ichthyologists concerning the Alabama
sturgeons' taxonomic status, the Service has determined that the Alabama sturgeon warrants recognition as a species
as defined by the Act.

The Alabama sturgeon was included in 

Federal Register

 notices of review for candidate animals in 1982, 1985, 1989, and 1991. In the 1982 notice (47 FR 58454) and in the 1985
notice (50 FR 37958), this fish was listed as a category 2 (sufficient information indicates proposing to list may
be appropriate, but conclusive data are not currently available to support a proposed rule). In the 1989 and 1991 notices
(54 FR 554 and 56 FR 58816), the Alabama sturgeon was listed as category 1 (substantial information supports listing).

In the June 15, 1993, proposed rule (58 FR 33148) and through associated notifications, interested parties were requested
to submit factual reports and information that might contribute to the development of a final rule to list the Alabama
sturgeon as endangered with critical habitat. The comment period was open until October 13, 1993. Appropriate Federal
and State agencies, county governments, scientific organizations, and interested parties were contacted by letter
dated June 21, 1993; a copy of the proposed rule was enclosed, and their comments on the rule were solicited. A total
of 34 letters were sent. Legal notices were published in the 

Birmingham News,

 Birmingham, Alabama, on July 25, 1993; the 

Mobile Press-Register,

 Mobile, Alabama, on July 25, 1993; the 

Montgomery Advertiser,

 Montgomery, Alabama, on July 24, 1993; and the 

Clarion Ledger,

 Hinds County, Mississippi, on July 23, 1993. The proposed rule also stated that a public hearing would be conducted
to answer questions and gather additional information on the biology of the Alabama sturgeon and discuss issues relating
to the proposed listing and critical habitat designation.

The public hearing on the Service's proposal to list the Alabama sturgeon as an endangered species with critical habitat
was scheduled for August 31, 1993, in Mobile, Alabama. The comment period remained open until October 13, 1993. A notice
of the hearing was published in the 

Federal Register

 on July 27, 1993 (58 FR 40109), and a legal notice was published in the 

Birmingham News 

on August 1, 1993. This public hearing was subsequently canceled at the request of some members of the Alabama Congressional
delegation. A cancellation notice was published in the 

Federal Register

 on August 24, 1993 (58 FR 44643), and legal notices were published in the 

Birmingham News 

on August 29, 1993; the 

Montgomery Advertiser

 on August 29, 1993; and the 

Clarion Ledger

 on August 27, 1993. 

The public hearing on this proposal was rescheduled for October 4, 1993, at the William K. Weaver Hall Auditorium on
the campus of Mobile College, Mobile, Alabama. The comment period remained open until October 13, 1993. A notice of
the hearing and extension of the comment period was published in the 

Federal Register

 on September 13, 1993 (58 FR 47851). 

Due to the tremendous interest in this issue, a large number of people who came to the October 4, 1993, hearing had to
be turned away due to space constraints. Although neither the Act nor the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 551
et seq.) required that a second hearing be held, the Service decided that it was in the best interest of all concerned
parties that they have an opportunity to comment on issues raised by the Alabama sturgeon proposed rule. Therefore,
an additional public hearing was scheduled in Montgomery, Alabama, on November 15, 1993, to allow for additional
comments from the interested public. A notice of the second hearing, reopening of the comment period (from October
25, 1993, to December 8, 1993), and notice of availability of a scientific panel report was published in the 

Federal Register

 on October 25, 1993 (58 FR 55036). Legal notices
