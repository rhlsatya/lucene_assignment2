<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Revised Notice_Revises the publication date for the draft and final environmental impact statements; establishes
the date, time and location of four public meetings; changes the telephone number and address of the USDA Forest Service,
Jefferson National Forest; defines the study area the agencies are using in developing alternatives to the proposed
action; and changes the responsible official for the National Park Service.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Forest Service will prepare a draft and final environmental impact statement on a proposed action to authorize
the Appalachian Power Company to construct a 765,000-volt transmission line across approximately twelve miles
of the Jefferson National Forest, as well as portions of the Appalachian National Scenic Trail, the New River (at Bluestone
Lake) and R.D. Bailey Lake Flowage Easement Land (at Guyandotte River).



The federal agencies have identified a study area in which alternatives to the proposed action will be developed.
The study area includes land located in the Virginia counties of Botetourt, Roanoke, Craig, Montgomery, Pulaski,
Bland and Giles and the West Virginia counties of Monroe, Summers, Mercer and Wyoming.

The Appalachian Power Company proposal involves federal land under the administrative jurisdiction of the USDA
Forest Service (Jefferson National Forest), the USDI National Park Service (Appalachian National Scenic Trail)
and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (New River and R.D. Bailey Lake Flowage Easement Land).

The Forest Service will be the lead agency and is responsible for the preparation of the environmental impact statement.
The National Park Service and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers will be cooperating agencies in accordance with 40 CFR
 1501.6.

In initiating and conducting the analysis the federal agencies are responding to the requirements of their respective
permitting processes and the need for the Appalachian Power Company to cross federal lands with the proposed transmission
line.

The Forest Service additionally will assess how the proposed transmission line conforms to the direction contained
in their Land and Resource Management Plan (LRMP). Changes in the LRMP could be required if the transmission line is
authorized across the Jefferson National Forest.

The total length of the electric transmission line proposed by the Appalachian Power Company is approximately 115
miles.

The original notice indicated that the dates, times, and locations for public meetings would be made known to the public
through the 

Federal Register

. The following public meetings have been scheduled to provide the public with an update on the federal analysis and
to review alternative transmission line corridors. The public meetings will begin at 7:00 pm and end at 9:00 p.m. at
the following locations:




July 12, 1994, New Castle High School, Route 615, New Castle, Virginia

July 13, 1994, Narrows High School, 115 Woodland Avenue, Narrows, Virginia

July 14, 1994, Union High School, School Street, Union, West Virginia

July 15, 1994, Waiteville Community Center, Ray Siding Road, Waiteville, West Virginia




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The Appalachian Power Company has submitted an application to the Jefferson National Forest for authorization to
construct a 765,000-volt electric transmission line across approximately twelve miles of the National Forest.
Portions of the Appalachian National Scenic Trail, the New River (at Bluestone Lake), and R.D. Bailey Lake Flowage
Easement Land (at Guyandotte River) would also be crossed by the proposed transmission line.





Studies conducted by the Appalachian Power Company and submitted to the Virginia State Corporation Commission,
as part of its application and approval process, indicate a need to reinforce its extra high voltage transmission
system by the mid-to-late 1990s in order to maintain a reliable power supply for projected demands within its service
territory in central and western Virginia and southern West Virginia.

A study to evaluate potential route locations of the proposed transmission line has been prepared for Appalachian
Power Company through a contract with Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University (VPI) and West Virginia
University (WVU). The information gathered by VPI and WVU, along with other information collected during the analysis
process, will be utilized in the preparation of the environmental impact statement. General information about the
transmission line route proposal is available from the Jefferson National Forest.

The decisions to be made following the environmental analysis are whether the Forest Service, the National Park Service,
and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers will authorize Appalachian Power Company to cross the Jefferson National Forest,
the Appalachian National Scenic Trail, and the New River and R.D. Bailey Lake Flowage Easement Land, respectively,
with the proposed 765,000-volt transmission line and, if so, under what conditions a crossing would be authorized.

In preparing the environmental impact statement a range of routing alternatives will be considered to meet the purpose
and need for the proposed action. A no action alternative will also be analyzed. Under the no action alternative APCO
would not be authorized to cross the Jefferson National Forest, the Appalachian National Scenic Trail, the New River
or R.D. Bailey Lake Flowage Easement Land. The alternatives developed by VPI and WVU will also be considered.

The federal analysis will include an analysis of the effects of the proposed transmission line along the entire proposed
route as well as all alternative routes which are considered in detail.

The significant issues identified for the federal analysis are listed below:

_The construction and maintenance of the 765kV transmission line and the associated access roads and right-of-way
may (1) affect soil productivity by increasing soil compaction and erosion; (2) affect geologic resources (karst
areas, Peters, Lewis, Potts Mountains, Arnolds Knob) and unique geologic features like caves through blasting,
earthmoving or construction machinery operations; and (3) result in unstable structural conditions due to the placement
of the towers. 

_The construction and maintenance of the 765kV transmission line and the associated access roads and right-of-way
may (1) degrade surface and ground water quality due to the application of herbicides; (2) degrade surface and ground
water quality because of sedimentation resulting from soil disturbance and vegetation removal; (3) reduce the quantity
of ground and spring water due to the disturbance of aquifers resulting from blasting, earthmoving or construction
machinery operation; and (4) adversely affect the commercial use of ground and surface waters due to herbicide contamination
and sedimentation. 

_The construction and maintenance of the 765kV transmission line and the associated access roads and right-of-way
may affect existing cultural resources, and historic structures and districts through the direct effects of the
construction and maintenance activities and by changing the existing resource setting. 

_The operation and maintenance of the 765kV transmission line and the associated access roads and right-of-way may
adversely affect human health through (1) direct and indirect exposure to herbicides and (2) exposure to electromagnetic
fields in induced voltage. 

_The construction of the 765kV transmission line may adversely affect the safety of those operating aircraft at low
altitudes or from airports located near the transmission line. 

_The operation of the 765kV transmission line may (1) adversely affect communication by introducing a source of interference;
(2) increase noise levels for those in close proximity to the line. 

_The construction, operation and maintenance of the 765kV transmission line and the associated access roads and
right-of-way may (1) adversely affect trails (including the Appalachian Trail) and trail facilities by facilitating
vehicle access through new road construction and the upgrading of existing roads; and (2) reduce hiker safety by facilitating
vehicle access to remote trail locations. 

_The construction, operation and maintenance of the 765kV transmission line and the associated access roads and
right-of-way may affect hunting, fishing, hiking, camping, boating and birding opportunities and experiences
because (1) the setting in which these pursuits take place may be altered; and (2) the noise associated with the operation
of the line may detract from the backcountry or recreation experience. 

_The construction and operation of the 765kV transmission line and the associated access roads and right-of-way
may affect local communities by (1) reducing the value of private lands adjacent to the line; (2) decreasing tax revenues
due to the reductions in land value; and (3) influencing economic growth, industry siting, and employment. 

_The construction, operation and maintenance of the 765kV transmission line and the associated access roads and
right-of-way may (1) conflict with management direction contained in resource management plans and designations;
(2) affect the uses that presently occur on and adjacent to the proposed right-of-way; (3) affect the wild, scenic
and/or recreational qualities of the New River; (4) affect sensitive land uses like schools, churches, and community
facilities; (5) affect the cultural attachment residents feel toward Peters Mountain; and (6) affect the scenic
and/or recreational qualities of the Appalachian National Scenic Trail (Appalachian Trail). 

_The construction, operation and maintenance of the 765kV transmission line and the associated access roads and
right-of-way may adversely affect the visual attributes of the area because the line, the associated right-of-way,
and access roads may (1) alter the existing landscape; and (2) conflict with the standards established for scenic
designations. 

_The construction, operation and maintenance of the 765kV transmission line and the associated access roads and
right-of-way may affect wildlife, plant and aquatic populations, habitat and livestock because (1) habitat are
created, changed or eliminated; (2) herbicides are used and herbicides may be toxic; (3) the transmission line presents
a flight hazard to birds; (4) electromagnetic fields and induced voltage may be injurious.

 


The following permits and/or licenses would be required to implement the proposed action:

Other authorizations may be required from a variety of Federal and State agencies.
Public participation will occur at several points during the federal analysis process. The first point in the analysis
was the scoping process (40 CFR  1501.7). The Forest Service has collected information, comments, and assistance
from Federal, State and local agencies, the proponent of the aciton, and other individuals or organizations who are
interested in or affected by the electric transmission line proposal. This input will be utilized in the preparation
of the draft environmental impact statement. The scoping process included, (1) identifying potential issues, (2)
identifying issues to be analyzed in depth, (3) eliminating insignificant issues or those which have been covered
by a relevant previous environmental analysis.
Public participation was solicited through contacts with known interested and/or affected groups, and individuals;
news releases; direct mailings; and/or newspaper advertisements. Public meetings were also held to hear comments
concerning the Appalachian Power Company proposal and to develop the significant issues to be considered in the analysis.
Similar public participation opportunities will be provided throughout the federal analysis process.
The draft environmental impact statement is expected to be filed with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
and available for public review by February 28, 1995. This revises the September 1, 1994 date previously announced.
At that time, EPA will publish a notice of availability of the draft environmental impact statement in the 

Federal Register

. The comment period on the draft environmental impact statement will be 45 days from the date the EPA publishes the
notice of availability in the 

Federal Register

.
Reviewers need to be aware of several court rulings related to public participation in the environmental impact statement
review process. First, reviewers of draft environmental impact statements must structure their participation
in the environmental review of the proposal so that it is meaningful and alerts an agency to the reviewer's position
and contentions. 

Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corp.

 v. 

NRDC,

 435 U.S.C. 519, 553 (1978). Also, environmental objections that could be raised at the draft environmental impact
statement stage but that are not raised until after completion of the final environmental impact statement may be
waived or dismissed by the courts. 

City of Angoon 

v. 

Hodel,

 803 F.2d 1016, 1022 (9th Cir. 1986) and 

Wisconsin Heritages, Inc. 

v. 

Harris,

 490 F. Supp. 1334, (E.D. Wis. 1980). Because of these court rulings, it is very important that those interested in this
proposed action participate by the close of the 45-day comment period so that substantive comments and objections
are made available to the Forest Service at a time when it can meaningfully consider them and respond to them in the final
environmental impact statement.
To assist the Forest Service in identifying and considering issues and concerns on the proposed action, comments
on the draft environmental impact statement should be as specific as possible. It is also helpful if comments refer
to specific pages or chapters of the draft statement. Comments may also address the adequacy of the draft environmental
impact statement or the merits of the alternatives formulated and discussed in the statement. (Reviewers may wish
to refer to the Council on Environmental Quality Regulations for implementing the procedural provisions of the National
Environmental Policy Act at 40 CFR  1503.3 in addressing these points.)
After the comment period ends on the draft environmental impact statement, the comments will be analyzed, considered,
and responded to by the three federal agencies in preparing the final environmental impact statement. The final environmental
impact statement is expected to be filed with the EPA and available for public review by August 1, 1995. This revises
the February 1, 1995 date previously announced.
The responsible officials will consider the comments, responses, environmental consequences discussed in the
final environmental impact statement, and applicable laws, regulations, and policies in making a decision regarding
this document. The responsible officials will document their decisions and reasons for their decisions in a Record
of Decision.
The responsible official for the Forest Service is Joy E. Berg, Forest Supervisor, Jefferson National Forest. The
address is changed from 210 Franklin Road SW, Caller Service 2900, Roanoke, Virginia 24001 to 5162 Valleypointe Parkway,
Roanoke, Virginia 24019. The responsible official for the National Park Service is changed from John Byrne to Don
King, Acting Project Manager_Appalachian National Scenic Trail, National Park Service, Harpers Ferry Center,
Harpers Ferry, West Virginia 25425. The responsible official for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is Colonel Earle
C. Richardson, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Huntington District, 508 8th Street, Huntington, West Virginia 25701-2070.

<DOCTITLE>Central Iowa Power Cooperative; Finding of No Significant Impact </DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Rural Electrification Administration, USDA.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of finding of no significant impact.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 Notice is hereby given that the Rural Electrification Administration (REA), pursuant to the National Environmental
Policy Act of 1969, as amended, the Council on Environmental Quality Regulations (40 CFR Parts 1500-1508),
and REA Environmental Policies and Procedures 
(7 CFR Part 1794), has made a Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI) with respect to a project proposed by Central
Iowa Power Cooperative (CIPCO), of Cedar Rapids, Iowa. The proposed project consists of the construction of a 345
kV and a 161 kV transmission line and associated facilities. The facilities would be located in Scott and Muscatine
Counties, Iowa. 



REA has concluded that the impacts from the proposed project would not be significant and that the proposed action
is not a major Federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment. Therefore, the preparation
of an environmental impact statement is not necessary.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 REA, in accordance with its environmental policies and procedures, required that CIPCO prepare a Borrower's Environmental
Report (BER) reflecting the potential impacts of the proposed facilities. The BER, which includes input from the
Federal, State, and local agencies, has been adopted as REA's Environmental Assessment for the project in accordance
with 7 CFR 1794.61. REA has concluded that the BER represents an accurate assessment of the environmental impacts
of the project. The proposed project will not affect any known properties listed or eligible for listing in the National
Register of Historic Places. Archaeological resource surveys for the sites of the 345 kV Walcott Switching Station
and the 345/161 kV substation at the IPSCO plant and the right-of-way of the 345 kV transmission line will be conducted.
In compliance with Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act, the survey reports will be reviewed by the
Iowa State Historic Preservation Officer and REA. Clearance must be obtained from both agencies before CIPCO can
commence any ground disturbing activities associated with project construction. In addition, if previously unknown
resources are discovered during project construction, CIPCO will halt construction while the significance of the
find and proper mitigation is determined. Given these procedures, the project will not have any significant effect
on cultural resources. The project should have no impact on floodplains, water quality, federally listed or proposed
for listing threatened or endangered species or their critical habitat, and no significant impact on important farmland
or wetlands. 



The purpose of this project is to provide electrical service to IPSCO's steel mill. This would be accomplished by the
construction of a 345 kV switching station, approximately 8 miles of 345 kV transmission line, 13 miles of 161 kV transmission
line, and a 345/161 kV substation at the IPSCO plant and modification of an existing 345/161 kV substation. 

The 345 kV switching station, to be known as the Walcott Switching Station, would be constructed and operated by the
Iowa Illinois Gas and Electric Company of Davenport, Iowa, on property to be owned by CIPCO. The 345 kV transmission
line would extend from the Walcott Switching Station to the IPSCO plant site, a distance of about 8 miles and terminate
at a 345 kV/161 kV substation on the IPSCO plant site. Approximately 2.4 miles of the proposed 345 kV line would be double-circuited
and share ROW with an existing 69 kV line. Generally a 120-foot wide ROW would be needed to accommodate the 345 kV transmission
line. The 345 kV/161 kV substation on the mill site would require a total area of about 3 acres. The CIPCO portion of the
substation would require about 1.6 acres and it would include two transmission line terminations; one for the 345
kV line and one for the 161 kV line. Modifications to the existing substation would not require any additional land.
The 161 kV transmission line would be constructed from an existing substation to the IPSCO plant site on an existing
69 kV transmission line ROW. The line would be rebuilt to a 161 kV specifications. However, no additional ROW would
be needed for the proposed changes. The preferred structures are designed for a future second 161 kV circuit. However,
building the second circuit is not a part of the proposed project. 

Alternatives considered to the project as proposed were no action, onsite generation, upgrading existing facilities,
various transmission system additions, alternative transmission line routes, and alternative switching station
sites. REA has considered these alternatives and concluded that the project as proposed will allow CIPCO to provide
adequate and reliable electric service to the IPSCO steel mill with a minimum of adverse impact. 

Copies of the BER and FONSI are available for review at REA at the aforementioned address, or may be reviewed at or obtained
from the offices of CIPCO, P.O. Box 2517, Cedar Rapids, Iowa 52406, telephone (319) 366-8011.

ACTION:

 Notice of hearing and request for public comments. 

 
</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The International Telecommunications Working Group of the Information Infrastructure Task Force's (IITF) Telecommunications
Policy Committee is developing recommendations for consideration by the IITF on international telecommunications
policy issues related to the development of a National Information Infrastructure (NII) within the context of an
emerging Global Information Infrastructure (GII). To ensure that the International Telecommunications Working
Group's recommendations regarding these issues take into consideration all views, we invite testimony and written
comments from interested parties on any of the topics outlined in the supplementary information section of this notice.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 I. Background and Topics for Discussion 

The White House formed the IITF to articulate and implement its vision for the NII. The Task Force is chaired by Ronald
H. Brown, the Secretary of Commerce, and consists of three committees_the Telecommunications Policy Committee,
the Information Policy Committee, and the Committee on Applications and Technology. Working with the private sector,
the IITF committees are seeking to develop telecommunications, information and technology policies to promote
applications that best suit the needs of the United States. Within the Telecommunications Policy Committee, chaired
by Larry Irving, Assistant Secretary of Commerce for the National Telecommunications and Information Administration,
is the International Telecommunications Working Group, chaired by Carol C. Darr, Deputy General Counsel of the U.S.
Department of Commerce. In recognizing that the NII will be a part of a much larger Global Information Infrastructure,
the Administration believes that the principles that inform our view of the NII also must guide the development of
a GII. To that end, the Administration has identified five principles essential for the creation of a global information
infrastructure:  Encourage private investment;  Promote competition;  Create a flexible regulatory
framework;  Provide open access; and  Ensure universal service. The International Telecommunications
Working Group recognizes that any re-examination of U.S. international telecommunications policy must take into
account the international dimension of technological convergence. Measures adopted by other governments in response
to this convergence are likely to affect a broad range of issues related to the interconnection of the U.S. NII with
foreign networks, such as access to, and interoperability of networks, investment, foreign aid and assistance,
technology transfer, and evolving international regulations. In response to these issues, the International Working
Group, through six informal subgroups, has identified six areas that should be addressed:  U.S. participation
in international and regional organizations and standard-setting bodies; 
 Foreign trade barriers affecting the U.S. industry and the development of the NII and, as a related question,
the role of foreign entities in the implementation of infrastructure;  International aspects of pending telecommunications
reform legislation;  Impact of U.S. export controls;  Electronic information exchanges between U.S.
and foreign research organizations; and

 U.S. aid and assistance for funding telecommunications projects and delivering technical assistance to
developing countries and countries with emerging economies. 
These informal subgroups have addressed each of these issues, looking first to the need to document existing circumstances
(e.g., to clarify the respective roles of international, regional and national organizations and standard-setting
bodies) and thereafter to address whether the Administration's NII objectives would be served better by changing
U.S. policy and/or efforts relating to each area. 
In the course of its deliberations, the Working Group has concluded that traditional U.S. policy approaches toward
international telecommunications have been both appropriate and constructive in achieving their objectives of
obtaining greater access by U.S. firms to foreign markets, eliminating barriers caused by incompatible standards,
and promoting the competitiveness of U.S. firms in providing international services. These policies should be continued.
However, it also seems clear that the stimulus for changes in U.S. domestic policy_the convergence of technologies
and blurring of boundaries between industries and markets_has significant bearing on the international environment,
with corresponding implications for U.S. international telecommunications policy. 
In March, 1994, Vice President Gore discussed the creation of a GII and emphasized that it will require the participation
of all countries. Many countries have already embarked on national initiatives similar to the NII, reflecting the
increasingly common objective of governments to facilitate broader access by consumers to an expanded array of information
technologies and services. The European Union, Japan, Canada, and several countries in developing regions of the
world, such as Latin America, Asia, and Eastern Europe, have identified telecommunications and information technologies
as essential to further economic growth and development. 
We recognize that the creation of a GII will have policy and operational issues that affect the United States and other
countries. The Working Group is seeking a broader understanding of the emerging policy issues associated with the
international dimension of technological convergence, and requests comments on the following issues/questions
that have arisen as a result of the work of the subgroups, and certain general questions with regard to the GII: 


Subgroup Questions 


1. Are there issues raised by technological convergence on a global scale that have not been addressed in U.S. policy?
What mechanisms (governmental or private sector, bilateral or multilateral) are best suited to addressing these
issues? 
2. Given the manner in which the telecommunications market is emerging, are the issues in the 1993 NTIA Notice of Inquiry
(58 Fed. Reg. 4846 (January 15, 1993)), which addressed the regulation of international telecommunications services
provided between the United states and other countries, still primary areas of concern? 
3. Given the convergence of technologies and the increase in the number of organizations developing standards, are
the U.S. government/private sector preparatory processes adequate to promote U.S. interests in international
standards activities? How should the U.S. government and the private sector facilitate the coordination of standards-setting
bodies? 
4. How should the U.S. government address compulsory licensing of intellectual property rights by international
standards-setting bodies? 
5. How can the process of developing international standards be enhanced to ensure the interconnectivity and interoperability
of an NII, and ultimately a GII? 
6. In light of the recent and significant liberalization of U.S. export controls, are further export control reforms
appropriate to ensure that the United States is able to participate fully in the international marketplace? 


General Questions About the GII


7. What is your vision of the GII? 
8. What should be the U.S. role in developing the GII? 
9. What should be the private sector's role in developing the GII? 
10. Given the significant amount of financial resources that will be necessary to create a GII and the fact that the
United States has limited financial ability to provide aid and assistance, what should the United States do to stimulate
private investment? 
11. With regard to the NII, the Administration clearly has indicated that government policies should remain technologically
neutral. Should this approach also be adopted for the GII? 
12. Pursuant to the NII, the Administration is pursuing a domestic review of current telecommunications laws and
regulations. Should this same type of exercise be pursued with regard to U.S. laws and regulations addressing international
telecommunications? 
13. What technical, financial and other issues need to be addressed in achieving the goal of a global digital library
defined by Vice President Gore in his speech before the International Telecommunication Union's World Telecommunication
Development Conference? 


II. Guidelines for Written Comments and Oral Testimony

<DOCTITLE>Groundfish of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands </DOCTITLE>


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Issuance of an experimental fishing permit.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 NMFS announces the issuance of an experimental fishing permit #94-1 (EFP) to Coastal Villages Fishing Cooperative
(CVFC) and Golden Age Fisheries (GAF). The EFP authorizes CVFC, GAF, and the factory trawler (F/T) REBECCA IRENE to
conduct a trawl survey limited to 500 metric tons (mt) of groundfish in Kuskokwim Bay, Etolin Strait, and the area north
of Nunivak Island. Results of the survey will be used to assess whether sufficient amounts of marketable groundfish
are located in near-shore waters to support the development of a small-boat fishery in this area. This EFP will provide
information not otherwise available through research or commercial fishing operations. The intended effect of
this action is to promote the purposes and policies of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Issuance of an EFP is authorized by the Fishery Management Plan for the Groundfish Fishery of the Bering Sea and Aleutian
Islands area and its implementing regulations at 50 CFR part 675. Regulations at  675.6 set out the procedures
for issuing EFPs to authorize fishing that would otherwise be prohibited.


NMFS announced the receipt of an application for an EFP from CVFC and GAF in the 

Federal

 

Register

 on May 4, 1994
(59 FR 23054). The application requested authorization for CVFC to conduct a 1994 summer trawl survey limited to 500
mt of groundfish in Kuskokwim Bay, Etolin Strait, and an area north of Nunivak Island. The vessel that will participate
in the trawl survey is the F/T REBECCA IRENE. Results of the survey will be used to ascertain the abundance of marketable
fish species in near-shore waters that could be harvested from small fishing vessels in this area. CVFC consists of
the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta communities of Chefornak, Chevak, Eek, Goodnews Bay, Hooper Bay, Kipnuk, Kwigillingok,
Mekoryuk, Newtok, Nightmute, Platinum, Quinhagak, Scammon Bay, Toksook Bay, Tuntutuliak, and Tununak. One of the
goals of CVFC is to train individuals from these villages to work at all levels of the groundfish industry, including
harvesting, processing, marketing, and corporate management. The North Pacific Fishery Management Council reviewed
the EFP application at its April 18-24, 1994, meeting and recommended to the Director of the Alaska Region, NMFS
(Regional Director), that the EFP be approved. 
The Regional Director has approved the EFP application and has issued an EFP to CVFC, GAF, and the F/T REBECCA IRENE.
The EFP authorizes the F/T REBECCA IRENE to harvest 500 mt of groundfish in the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta area during the
time period extending from June 15 through September 30, 1994. The objective of this allocation is to support a survey
of fishery resources in this area so that CVFC, in cooperation with GAF, may assess the feasibility of a future near-shore
fishery for fishing vessels in this area. This EFP will provide information not otherwise available through research
or commercial fishing operations because this area is not fished during NMFS assessment surveys and it is not economically
feasible for a commercial vessel to survey this area during the open access fishery. Groundfish and prohibited species
amounts associated with this permit will not be deducted from total allowable catch and prohibited species catch
(PSC) amounts specified for 1994. Under this EFP, all vessels must comply with existing Federal regulations at 50
CFR parts 620 and 675, except  675.21 and 675.20(a). PSC limits established for fishing activities authorized
under this EFP are as follows: 1,250 red king crab; 2.5 mt Pacific halibut; and 0.5 mt Pacific herring. 


Classification


Based on the EA prepared for this EFP, the Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, NOAA, determined that no significant
impact on the quality of the human environment will result from this EFP. The Regional Director determined that this
experiment will not affect species listed as threatened or endangered, or areas that are critical habitat for these
species under the Endangered Species Act in a way that was not already considered in previous formal and informal section
7 consultations. Additional information, including gear restrictions, scientific sampling procedures, project
design, and disposition of harvested fish, is contained in the EFP.
This notice is exempt from OMB review under E.O. 12866.

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of availability of the terms and conditions of proposed commodity futures and option contracts.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Chicago Board of Trade (CBT or Exchange) has applied for designation as a contract market in rough rice futures
and futures option contracts. The Director of the Division of Economic Analysis (Division) of the Commission, acting
pursuant to the authority delegated by Commission Regulation 140.96, has determined that publication of the proposals
for comment is in the public interest, will assist the Commission in considering the views of interested persons,
and is consistent with the purposes of the Commodity Exchange Act. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The terms and conditions of the proposed CBT contracts are identical to those of the MCE rough rice contracts, since
the CBT contracts are intended to replace the existing MCE rough rice contracts. Under the proposal, concurrent with
the listing of the CBT's proposed rough rice futures and option contracts, the MCE rough rice futures and option contracts
would be delisted and all existing open interest will be transferred to the CBT from the MCE. The MCE contract designations
for rough rice would remain in force. 


The Commission is requesting comment on the proposed CBT contracts and on the proposal to transfer open interest to
the CBT from the MCE. 
Copies of the terms and conditions will be available for inspection at the Office of the Secretariat, Commodity Futures
Trading Commission, 2033 K Street, NW., Washington, DC 20581. Copies of the terms and conditions can be obtained through
the Office of the Secretariat by mail at the above address or by phone at (202) 254-6314. 
Other materials submitted by the CBT in support of the applications for contract market designation may be available
upon request pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) and the Commission's regulations thereunder
(17 CFR Part 145 (1987)), except to the extent they are entitled to confidential treatment as set forth in 17 CFR 145.5
and 145.9. Requests for copies of such materials should be made to the FOI, Privacy and Sunshine Act Compliance Staff
of the Office of the Secretariat at the Commission's headquarters in accordance with 17 CFR 145.7 and 145.8. 
Any person interested in submitting written data, views, or arguments on the proposed terms and conditions, or with
respect to other materials submitted by the CBT, should send such comments to Jean A. Webb, Secretary, Commodity Futures
Trading Commission, 2033 K Street NW., Washington, DC 20581 by the specified date.

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Detroit District, Corps of Engineers, proposes to construct and operate a dredged material placement facility
at Holland, Michigan. The Federal navigation project at Holland, Michigan extends approximately six miles from
Lake Michigan to Holland, Michigan. The navigation channel has an authorized depth of 21 feet in the main channel and
23 feet in the entrance channel. Channel depth has been significantly reduced by shoal buildup in certain areas of
the project, resulting in impacts to shipping. The proposed dredged material placement facility is necessary to
allow for continued maintenance dredging and would allow restoration of authorized project depths.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTRY INFORMATION: 

Holland Harbor, Michigan, is on the eastern shore of Lake Michigan, about 95 miles northeast from Chicago, Illinois.
The Federal navigation project extends approximately six miles eastward from Lake Michigan, through Lake Macatawa
to the mouth of the Macatawa River at Holland, Michigan. Authorized project depths are 21 feet in the main navigation
channel and 23 feet in the entrance channel. And 18-foot deep turning basin is located near the upstream limit of the
project. 



Sites previously used for dredged material placement are at capacity. In addition, the navigation project has an
estimated backlog of 130,000 cubic yards of sediments, which have impacted shipping by significantly reducing channel
depths in certain areas of the project. Therefore, to allow for restoration of authorized project depths and continued
operation and maintenance (O&M) of the Federal project, the Corps of Engineers, Detroit District, proposes
to construct a new dredged placement facility at Holland, Michigan. 

The proposed facility would be designed to contain approximately 400,000 cubic yards of shoal material, which would
accommodate 10 to 20 years of O&M dredging, depending on site and material management practices. This facility
would be incorporated into the Long-Term Dredged Material Management Plan for Holland Harbor, which is currently
being developed to accommodate at least 20 years of O&M dredging. 

Alternative sites for dredged material placement include upland sites, open-water placement, and beach nourishment.
The no Federal action alternative will also be considered and will serve as a baseline from which to measure the impacts
of the action alternatives. 

A proposed upland sit is a farm about two miles east of Lake Macatawa in Holland Township. This site, which is in an industrial
zone along the north side of Macatawa River, extends south from Lakewood Boulevard between 112th and 120th Avenues
(approximately the N1/4 of the SW1/4 of Section 22, T5N, R15W). 

A preliminary design for the farm site is a facility construed with earthen dikes, up to approximately 11 feet in height,
occupying approximately 30 acres. Dredged material would be transported to the facility by truck or hydraulic pipeline.
The pipeline would be routed up the Macatawa River. 

An alternative upland disposal site is located about two miles north of Lake Macatawa in Section 15 of Park Township
(T5N, R16W), which is bounded by 160th and 168th Avenues and Riley and James Streets. This section includes scattered
residential development, wooded areas, blown-out dunes, and two Superfund cleanup areas (Comprehensive Environmental
Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, 1980). An earthen design would be considered. 

Open-water placement could be at or near previously used open-water sites, approximately 1.5 miles west-southwest
from the harbor entrance along the 60-foot depth contour of Lake Michigan. Open-water placement of material dredged
from some areas of the navigation channel would require covering or capping with cleaner material. 

Only harbor entry channel material is suitable for beach nourishment. Dredged material from the remainder of the
project is unsuitable for beach nourishment because it is fine-grained. Beach nourishment is in use as dredged material
management tool at Holland Harbor and would be considered for future disposal or suitable materials. 

Significant issued to be analyzed include potential impacts on wetlands, water quality, fish and wildlife habitat,
cultural resources, and farmlands. Social impacts including impacts upon recreation and aesthetics, will also
be considered. 

The proposed actions will be revised for compliance with the Fish and Wildlife Act of 1956; the Fish and Wildlife Coordination
Act of 1958; the National Historic Preservation Act of 1989; the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969;
the Clean Air Act of 1970; the Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972; the Endangered Species Act of 1973; the Water Resources
Development Act of 1976; the Clean Water Act of 1977; the Farmland Protection Policy Act (Subtitle I of Title XV of the
Agriculture and Food Act of 1981); Executive Order 11593, Protection and Enhancement of the Cultural Environment,
May 1971; Executive Order 11988, Flood Plain Management, May 1977; Executive Order 11990, Wetland Protection, May
1977; and Corps of Engineers, Department of the Army, 33 CFR part 230, Environmental Quality: Policy and Procedure
for Implementing NEPA. 

The proposed project will be coordinated in detail with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service (FWS), the Michigan Department of Natural Resources, and the Michigan State Historic Preservation
Office. Funds have been provided to the FWS (pursuant to the Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act of 1958) for the preparation
of detailed report on potential project impacts on fish and wildlife resources. 

All affected Federal, State and local agencies, Indian tribes, and other private organizations and parties are invited
to participate in the proposed project review. Questions, concerns, and comments may be directed to the address given
in this notice. The Macatawa Area Coordinating Council, a local planning group, has scheduled a public meeting for
August 2, 1994, at Holland, Michigan. It is anticipated that the DEIS would be available for public review in February
1995.

<DOCTITLE>Notice of Intent To Prepare a Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement </DOCTITLE>
for Storage and Disposition of Weapons-Usable Fissile Materials 



<AGENCY>

 Department of Energy. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of Intent (NOI) to Prepare a Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement (PEIS) for Long-Term Storage and
Disposition of Weapons-Usable Fissile Materials.

 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The changes in the aftermath of the Cold War have significant implications for the management of weapons-usable fissile
materials (primarily plutonium and highly-enriched uranium). The large reductions in nuclear weapons agreed to
by the United States and Russia reduces our national security requirements for fissile materials and, as a result,
storage and disposition decisions for these materials will be required. 


The national policy outlined by the President in September 1993 is to seek to eliminate where possible the accumulation
of stockpiles of highly-enriched uranium (HEU) or plutonium, and to ensure that where these materials already exist
they are subject to the highest standards of safety, security and international accountability. In addition, the
President has initiated a comprehensive review of long-term options for plutonium disposition, taking into account
technical, nonproliferation, environmental, budgetary and economic considerations. 
The Department of Energy (DOE), which is the agency responsible for management, storage and disposition of weapons-usable
fissile materials from United States nuclear weapons dismantlement and weapons production processes, proposes
to prepare a Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement (PEIS) pursuant to the National Environmental Policy
Act (NEPA) to evaluate alternatives for long-term storage of all weapons-usable fissile materials, and disposition
of weapons-usable fissile materials declared surplus to national defense needs by the President. 
The results of the environmental analysis in the PEIS, information from technical and economic studies, and national
policy objectives will form the basis for decisions regarding long-term storage of all weapons-usable fissile materials
and the disposition of surplus weapons-usable fissile materials. The PEIS may be followed by project-specific NEPA
documents to the extent necessary to implement any decisions. 
The purpose of this NOI, which is the initial step in the NEPA process, is to inform the public of the PEIS proposal, to
solicit public input, and to announce that a scoping process will be conducted so that the public may express its opinions
and views regarding the alternatives to be considered and the scope of the issues to be addressed in the PEIS. 
Written comments on the scope of the 

PEIS for Storage and Disposition of Weapons-Usable Fissile Materials

 are invited from the public. To ensure consideration in preparation of the PEIS, written comments must be postmarked
by October 17, 1994. Late comments will be considered to the extent practicable. Public scoping workshops to provide
and discuss information, and receive oral comments on the scope of the PEIS will be held during August and September
1994, both regionally and in the vicinity of the sites which may be affected by potential decisions and their implementation.
DOE will announce the location, date and time for these public scoping workshops in a subsequent Notice in the 

Federal Register

, and by other appropriate means as early as practicable. The Department will endeavor to provide 30 days notice prior
to any applicable workshops. Following this scoping period, the Department will issue an Implementation Plan which
will describe, among other things, the scope of the PEIS, the alternatives that will be analyzed, and the schedule
for completing the PEIS. 





Note:

 A definition of terms is included at the end of this NOI.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
National Policy Objectives 


On September 27, 1993, the President outlined a major principle of U.S. nonproliferation policy: 



Our national security requires us to accord higher priority to nonproliferation, and to make it an integral element
of our relations with other countries. 




The policy further states that the U.S. will: 



Seek to eliminate where possible the accumulation of stockpiles of highly-enriched uranium or plutonium, and to
ensure that where these materials already exist they are subject to the highest standards of safety, security and
international accountability.

 

In addition, the President called upon the Government to: 



Initiate a comprehensive review of long-term options for plutonium disposition, taking into account technical,
nonproliferation, environmental, budgetary and economic considerations.

 

The Department's objectives in furtherance of this policy include: 
 To strengthen national and international arms control efforts by providing an exemplary model for storage
of all weapons-usable fissile materials and disposition of surplus weapons-usable fissile materials; 
 To ensure that storage and disposition of weapons-usable fissile materials is carried out in compliance with
environmental, safety and health standards; 
 To minimize the prospect that surplus United States weapons-usable fissile materials could be reintroduced
into the arsenals from which they came and therefore increasing the prospect of reciprocal measures by Russia and
other nuclear powers; 
 To minimize the risk that surplus United States weapons-usable fissile materials could be obtained by unauthorized
parties; and 
 To accomplish these objectives in a timely and cost-effective manner. 



Purpose of, and Need for, the PEIS 


The Department of Energy (DOE), the agency responsible for management, storage and disposition of weapons-usable
fissile materials from United States nuclear weapons dismantlement and weapons production processes, proposes
to prepare a Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement (PEIS) to evaluate alternatives for long-term storage
of all weapons-usable fissile materials, and disposition of weapons-usable fissile materials declared surplus
to national defense needs by the President. 
The results of the environmental analysis in the PEIS, information from technical and economic studies, and national
policy objectives will form the basis for decisions regarding long-term storage of all weapons-usable fissile materials
and the disposition of surplus weapons-usable fissile materials. The PEIS may be followed by project-specific NEPA
documents to the extent necessary to implement any decisions. 
The purpose of this NOI, which is the initial step in the NEPA process, is to inform the public of the PEIS proposal, to
solicit public input, and to announce that a scoping process will be conducted so that the public may express its opinions
and views regarding the alternatives to be considered and the scope of the issues to be addressed. 


Background 


In early 1994, the National Academy of Sciences published a report, 

Management and Disposition of Excess Weapons Plutonium

. This study, commissioned by the President's National Security Council, provides information regarding management
and disposition of surplus nuclear materials, in particular plutonium. Copies of this National Academy of Sciences
report are available upon request to the address stated above. 
In the United States, weapons-usable fissile nuclear materials are currently stored at several DOE sites, including
Pantex (Amarillo, Texas), Hanford Site (Richland, Washington), Idaho National Engineering Laboratory (Idaho
Falls, Idaho), Rocky Flats Plant (Denver, Colorado), Savannah River Site (Aiken, South Carolina), Lawrence Livermore
National Laboratory (Livermore, California), Los Alamos National Laboratory (Los Alamos, New Mexico), and Oak
Ridge Reservation (Oak Ridge, Tennessee). 
The Department is currently performing vulnerability studies to determine the environmental, safety, and health
(ES&H) risks associated with the current storage of plutonium, highly enriched uranium (HEU), and other weapons-usable
fissile materials. These studies will form the basis for Departmental actions to ensure safe, secure interim storage
of weapons-usable fissile materials until the long-term storage or disposition actions are implemented. In addition,
plans for bilateral or International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspection and verification of the surplus material
in storage are being developed and may require action. If any actions required to establish these interim conditions
are considered major federal actions that might have a significant impact on the environment, appropriate NEPA analysis
will be prepared and documented prior to proceeding. The results of these efforts will establish the interim condition
of safe, controlled, inspectable storage.

Recent nuclear arms reduction agreements and pledges, along with Presidential decisions concerning what stocks
of plutonium, HEU, and other nuclear materials are to be reserved for national defense will largely determine how
much and when material will be declared ``surplus'' and will become available for disposition. Discussions are ongoing
with the Nuclear Weapons Council to determine what materials are surplus and what must be maintained as a reserve.
DOE anticipates that these amounts will be identified so that the analysis planned for the PEIS can address the storage
and disposition alternatives.

Several kilograms of plutonium, or several times that amount of HEU, are sufficient to make a nuclear weapon. Although
both plutonium and HEU can be used to make nuclear weapons, they pose different risks and require different controls.
HEU is produced by ``enriching'' natural uranium using one of several technologies, all of which are complex isotopic
separation technologies that require commitment of significant funds and industrial resources. As stated by the
National Academy of Sciences in its study, HEU can be blended down with naturally occurring, depleted or low-enriched
uranium to make a low-enriched uranium (LEU) reactor fuel that poses lower proliferation risk and can return a substantial
economic benefit. In fact, LEU is the fuel for most of the world's nuclear power reactors.

In contrast, blending cannot reduce the proliferation risks of plutonium because all plutonium isotopes can be used
to make a nuclear weapon. Separating plutonium from other elements with which it might be mixed or from unirradiated
reactor fuel containing plutonium requires only well-understood chemical processing techniques. Thus, the management
of plutonium in any form is a greater challenge than the management of HEU.



HEU Long-Term Storage and Disposition Alternatives



DOE has proposed to consolidate HEU into secure interim storage at Oak Ridge in the Y-12 facility (see 59 FR 11783),
and may reduce its surplus by blending down some of the HEU. The resulting LEU could then be made available for commercial
sale.

The PEIS will consider the following alternatives for HEU disposition: Blending down surplus HEU with other, more
abundant, naturally occurring uranium, depleted uranium or other LEU, to make LEU for reactor fuel; and any other
reasonable alternatives identified in the scoping process. Additionally, the no-action alternative of maintaining
surplus HEU in a storage facility indefinitely will be evaluated.

HEU can be made highly proliferation resistant by blending it down into a LEU (less than 20 percent U-235), and
there may be significant economic benefits that would offset the costs associated with this alternative. Consequently,
alternatives which do not exploit the economic value of the surplus HEU, such as blending it down into LEU, are likely
to be considered reasonable for disposition of most of the surplus HEU. However, some HEU may have impurities that
make this material unacceptable as a reactor fuel when blended down and would have to be disposed of as waste. For these
materials, blending down to less than 20 percent U-235 to prevent use in nuclear weapons, followed by disposal
as waste, may be the only reasonable alternative.



Plutonium Long-Term Storage and Disposition Alternatives



The Department proposes to use the report prepared by the National Academy of Sciences, 

Management and Disposition of Excess Weapons Plutonium,

 as the starting point for evaluating alternatives regarding the long-term storage and disposition of plutonium.
The Academy concluded that the existence of surplus fissile materials worldwide constitutes a ``clear and present
danger to national and international security.'' The Academy further noted that:




None of the options yet identified for managing this material can eliminate this danger; all they can do is to reduce
the risk. Moreover, none of the options for long-term disposition of excess weapons plutonium can be expected to substantially
reduce the inventories of excess plutonium from nuclear weapons for at least a decade.




As a result, the Academy recommended that:




It is important to begin now to build consensus on a road map for decisions concerning long-term disposition of excess
weapons plutonium. Because disposition options will take decades to carry out, it is critical to develop options
that can muster a sustainable consensus.



Standards for Action



In its report, the Academy identified standards for managing the risks associated with surplus weapons plutonium.
These standards include:



The Stored Weapons Standard



The high standards of security and accounting applied to storage of nuclear weapons should be maintained for weapons-usable
fissile materials throughout the process of dismantlement, storage and disposition. The Academy concluded that
storage should not be extended indefinitely because of nonproliferation risks and arms reduction objectives.



The Spent Fuel Standard



The National Academy of Sciences recommended that options for long-term disposition of plutonium should seek to
meet a ``spent-fuel standard'' in which the plutonium is as inaccessible for weapons use as the plutonium in spent
nuclear fuel from commercial power reactors.

<DOCNO> FR940621-2-00024 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940621-2-00016 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The Department is seeking public comment on the appropriateness of these standards as well as others. 


Long-term Storage Alternatives 


The Department proposes to evaluate alternatives for long-term storage of plutonium, HEU and other weapons-usable
fissile materials: (1) In the current interim storage facilities (the no-action alternative); (2) in facilities
upgraded as necessary to comply with current ES&H and design requirements; or (3) in a new consolidated storage
facility. Five candidate sites for a new consolidated long-term storage were selected from those evaluated during
the Reconfiguration Program in preparation for development of the Reconfiguration PEIS, addressing the nuclear
weapons complex for the post-Cold War era. They are the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory, the Savannah River
Site, the Oak Ridge Reservation, the Pantex Plant, and the Nevada Test Site. In addition, ongoing evaluation of interim
storage sites may result in other sites being considered reasonable alternatives for consolidated long-term storage.



Surplus Plutonium Disposition Alternatives (Including Other Surplus Nuclear Materials Except HEU)



Controlled, interim storage will be required until the materials are either placed into long-term storage or dispositioned
into a more proliferation resistant form. As mentioned previously, the alternatives for disposition of plutonium
and certain other surplus nuclear materials were evaluated by the Academy. In general, the Academy identified several
broad alternatives for meeting the ``spent fuel standard.''

 

Mixed Oxide fuel alternative,

 in which the surplus plutonium would be used as fuel in existing, modified, or new nuclear reactors, that would consume
a fraction of the plutonium and embed the rest in highly radioactive spent fuel similar to that now produced by commercial
power reactors, and which would be stored and ultimately disposed of in a geologic repository;

 

Immobilization alternative,

 in which the surplus plutonium would be vitrified or embedded in a ceramic or other material, either alone or mixed
with radioactive high-level wastes, to form glass or ceramic logs for ultimate disposal in a geologic repository;
and

 

Geologic disposition alternative,

 in which plutonium in some other acceptable form would be placed directly in suitable canisters and buried in deep
boreholes drilled into the earth, or in a mined geologic repository.



Beyond the Spent Fuel Standard



Because plutonium disposition alternatives meeting the ``spent fuel standard'' result in a form that still entails
a risk of use in weapons, and because the barriers to use diminish with time as the radioactivity decays, it will be prudent
to consider further steps to reduce long-term proliferation risks. Thus, the alternatives that result in the plutonium
becoming essentially inaccessible or destroyed include:

 

Accelerator based conversion

, in which a large fraction of plutonium would be fissioned in a sub-critical reactor aided by neutrons produced by
an accelerator; and

 

``Deep Burn'' Reactors

, in which the plutonium is fissioned so completely in reactors, without spent fuel reprocessing and recycling, that
only a small amount of plutonium would remain in the spent nuclear fuel.

There may be other alternatives that are reasonable for disposition of surplus plutonium (and other surplus weapons-usable
fissile materials) into a form which is substantially and inherently proliferation resistant. The PEIS will include
consideration of any other reasonable alternatives identified in the scoping process.

The purpose of the PEIS is to develop information to support decision making concerning long-term storage of all plutonium,
HEU, and other weapons-usable material and disposition of the surplus plutonium and other weapons-usable fissile
materials so that the risk of proliferation is minimized. Some of the alternatives to accomplish disposition may
require substantial research and development, and could entail subsequent NEPA analysis prior to any decision concerning
implementation.

The Academy study also considered plutonium disposition alternatives that the Academy judged to be unreasonable.
These alternatives were: sub-seabed disposal; ocean dilution; underground detonation; and disposal in space.
Comments regarding these, and any other alternatives, are encouraged to aid DOE in establishing the reasonable PEIS
alternatives for disposition of surplus plutonium (and other weapons-usable fissile materials).



The NEPA Process



This PEIS is being prepared pursuant to section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969,
as amended (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.) and the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) regulations (40 CFR parts 1500-1508).
The reason for this PEIS is that there might be significant environmental impacts from implementing decisions on
the long-term storage and disposition of weapons-usable fissile materials. Such decisions would be a major Federal
action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment within the meaning of NEPA and, therefore, requiring
the preparation of an environmental impact statement (EIS).

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940621-2-00025 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940621-2-00016 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

NEPA requires review of any major Federal action which may significantly affect the quality of the human environment.
The review is documented through an EIS. The NEPA process is described in the CEQ regulations implementing NEPA [40
CFR, Parts 1500-1508] and DOE NEPA regulations at 10 CFR Part 1021. The draft and final PEIS will be prepared in
accordance with these requirements. 

A PEIS is a broad-scope environmental analysis of a program or policy [40 CFR 1500.4(i)]. A PEIS provides an opportunity
for NEPA review to coincide with meaningful points in agency planning and decisionmaking [40 CFR 1502.4(b)]. A PEIS
may be used to support later NEPA documents of narrower scope (called ``tiering''), such as site-specific or project-specific
NEPA reviews. NEPA documents tiered from the PEIS would focus on specific actions when they are ripe for review [40
CFR 1502.20]. Following preparation of an EIS, an agency issues a Record of Decision (ROD) to document its decision
[40 CFR 1505.2]. The ROD explains how the EIS analysis was balanced against other factors leading to the agency's decision.
DOE has determined that potential decisions and their implementation regarding the long-term storage and disposition
of weapons-usable fissile materials would be a major Federal action within the meaning of NEPA; and that the several
actions which might be anticipated under this effort are connected [40 CFR 1508.25] and would constitute a broad agency
program [40 CFR 1502.4]. Accordingly, DOE has decided that a PEIS is appropriate to analyze the environmental consequences
associated with long-term storage and disposition of weapons-usable fissile materials and to factor environmental
considerations into DOE decisions. 

At this point in the NEPA process, all alternatives, especially those identified for plutonium disposition, are
broadly stated. This has been done intentionally so that public input during scoping can be optimally utilized to
identify which alternatives should be specifically addressed and which significant issues should be included within
the scope of the PEIS. Based on comments received during the scoping process, the reasonable alternatives to be included
in the PEIS, a discussion of the methodology and the issues to be addressed will be identified in a PEIS Implementation
Plan. 



Environmental Issues 



The PEIS will identify and analyze direct, indirect, and cumulative impacts resulting from the alternatives for
potential decisions and their implementation. The impact analyses will address the following resources: air, water,
land, biota, human health and safety, social and economic, cultural, energy and minerals, transportation, and any
other issues identified as appropriate during the scoping process. The impact analyses will be at the programmatic
level for the proposed action and each alternative and will not deal with specific site environmental resource issues
unless an alternative proposes a site-specific activity. Subsequent to the decisions made upon the completion of
this PEIS, DOE may undertake site-specific actions based upon such decisions and may also perform separate NEPA analyses
on those actions prior to any site implementation. Such analyses would include a detailed examination of the site-specific
environmental impacts of those activities. DOE invites public comments specifically on the scope of the PEIS analysis.




Classified Material 



DOE plans to prepare the PEIS in unclassified form; however, DOE will review classified material while preparing
the PEIS. In the event any classified material is included in the completed PEIS or its associated Record of Decision
(ROD), such material would be in a classified appendix which would not be available for general public review. This
material would, however, be considered by DOE in reaching a decision on long-term storage and disposition of fissile
nuclear materials. DOE will provide as much information as possible in unclassified form to assist public understanding
and input. 



Other DOE NEPA Documents 



There are several other NEPA documents in preparation by DOE that have a direct bearing on this PEIS. These are: 

 

The Reconfiguration PEIS

 which will no longer address long-term storage of plutonium and HEU since the PEIS which is the subject of this NOI will
address alternatives for long-term storage of all weapons-usable fissile material. The Reconfiguration PEIS will
continue to describe the remaining missions in the nuclear weapons complex and will evaluate alternatives for tritium
supply and recycle. 

 

The Pantex Site-Wide Environmental Impact Statement (EIS)

 will address alternatives for interim storage of plutonium pits. This interim storage of plutonium pits is part of
the no-action alternative for long-term storage of all plutonium which includes other forms of plutonium, along
with pits, and which will be addressed in this PEIS. 

 

The Oak Ridge Interim Storage of Enriched Uranium Environmental Assessment (EA)

 will address interim storage alternatives for enriched uranium. This interim storage also forms part of the no-action
alternative for long-term storage of HEU which will be addressed in this PEIS. 

 

The Environmental Restoration and Waste Management PEIS

 will address the programmatic level decisions for treatment, storage and disposal of waste within the DOE complex.
If any actions to dispose of weapons-usable fissile materials result in a waste form, these waste forms would be treated,
stored and disposed of in accordance with the decisions resulting from the Environmental Restoration and Waste Management
PEIS.

Other EIS's and EA's

 involving weapons-usable fissile materials are or will be in progress for the purpose of establishing the interim
conditions for some of these materials. 



Definitions 



As used in this Notice of Intent, the following definitions apply: 

 Disposition is a process of use or disposal of materials that results in the remaining material being converted
to a form that is substantially and inherently more proliferation-resistant than the original form. 

 Highly Enriched Uranium (HEU) is uranium which has an isotopic content of uranium-235 of 20 percent or more.


 Interim Storage refers to the safe, controlled, inspectable storage facilities and conditions that will
be established in the near term and will remain in effect until the long-term storage or disposition actions are implemented.


 Low Enriched Uranium (LEU) is uranium which has an isotopic content of uranium-235 of less than 20 percent.
Most commercial reactor fuel is enriched to about 4 to 5 percent uranium-235. 

 Weapons-Usable Fissile Materials is used to refer to a specific set of nuclear materials that may be utilized
in making a nuclear explosive for a weapon. Weapons-usable fissile materials include uranium with uranium-235 isotopic
content of 20 percent or more, plutonium of any isotopic composition, and other isotopes such as uranium-233, americium-241,
and neptunium-237 which have been separated from spent nuclear fuel or irradiated targets. The term weapons-usable
fissile materials does not include the fissile materials present in spent nuclear fuel or irradiated targets from
reactors. 



Invitation to Comment 



DOE invites comments on the scope of this PEIS from all interested parties, including affected Federal, State and
local agencies and Indian tribes. DOE solicits comments regarding the scope of the PEIS analysis, suggestions on
significant environmental issues, alternatives to be included in the PEIS, and other matters of content. 

To ensure consideration of comments in preparing the draft PEIS, written comments must be postmarked by October 17,
1994. Late comments will be considered to the extent practicable. Agencies, organizations, and the general public
are invited to present oral comments pertinent to preparation of the PEIS at public scoping workshops. DOE will also
accept written material at the workshops. Written and oral comments will be given equal weight in the scoping process.


Public scoping workshops to provide information and discuss and receive comments on the scope of the PEIS will be held
during August and September 1994, both regionally and in the vicinity of the sites which may be affected by the proposed
action. A national public scoping workshop will also be held in Washington, DC. DOE will announce the location, date
and time for these public workshops in a subsequent Notice in the 

Federal Register

, and by other appropriate means as early as practicable. The Department will endeavor to provide 30 days notice prior
to any applicable workshops. Advance registration to provide oral comments at these workshops will be facilitated

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of Non-Competitive Financial Assistance Award. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Department of Energy announces that, pursuant to 10 CFR 
600.6(a)(5), it is making a discretionary financial assistance award based on the 
criteria set forth at 10 CFR 600.7(b)(2)(i)(A) to Florida State University under

will initiate a comprehensive program which will involve the identification and 
independent evaluation of (1) innovative technologies that are either currently being 
utilized in environmental remediation efforts conducted by, or in development by, 
Federal and State agencies, and private United States organizations; and (2) innovative 
technologies for environmental restoration which are under development abroad.




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Department of Energy has determined, in 
accordance with 10 CFR 600.7(b)(2)(i)(A), that a noncompetitive award to Florida State 
University is necessary for the satisfactory completion of, or continuation or renewal of, 
an activity presently being funded by the Department of Energy or another Federal 
agency, and for which competition for support would have a significant adverse effect on 
continuity or completion of the activity. Florida State University has been involved in a 
cooperative research and development program with the United States Environmental 
Protection Agency that focused on hazardous waste characterization and monitoring of 
RCRA hazardous waste sites. In addition, Florida State University has been under an 
agreement with Sandia National Laboratories to develop a prototype model for

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), pursuant to the DOE Financial Assistance Rules, 10 CFR 600.7, is announcing its
intention to enter into a cooperative agreement with the Georgia Institute of Technology for the design and construction
of a photovoltaic power system on the Georgia Tech Aquatic Center, site of the 1996 Olympic Games.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

DOE has evaluated, in accordance with the DOE Federal Assistance Regulations, 10 CFR section 600.14, the unsolicited
proposal entitled ``The Design, Construction and Monitoring of a Photovoltaic Power System on the Georgia Tech Aquatic
Center, Site of the 1996 Olympic Natation Venue'' and recommends that the unsolicited proposal be accepted for support
without further competition in accordance with section 600.14 of the Federal Assistance Regulations.





In preparation for the Olympic Games and other major international sporting events in Atlanta, the new construction
of an open air Aquatic Center on the Georgia Institute of Technology campus presents the opportunity to construct
a photovoltaic system of approximately 75,000 gross square feet over the swimming and diving facility. The design
is conceived as 230 ft. long  x  20 ft. wide roof sections in a barrel vault configuration on which photovoltaic
cells would reside. The roof structure would be composed of steel columns and trusses with a metal deck and single ply
membrane. The PV panels would be integrated to the outer roof layer in segmented panels. The PV panels would be 65 W PEAK
to be installed for a total of 250 to 300 KW PEAK which would provide 20-25% of the peak power requirements of the
Aquatic Center.

The proposed photovoltaic roof installation project objectives include: (1) Design and research of a PV system to
support the increased energy consumption on campus and have a peak capacity of 3400 KW, (2) monitoring and evaluating
performance of the system, (3) support Georgia Power's demand-side strategy, (4) support the Climate Change Action
Plan, (5) support the Utility Photovoltaic Group (UPVG), (6) support the Georgia Tech Center of Excellence in Photovoltaics
Research and Education, and (7) provide the largest, unparalleled facility integrated PV power system in the United
States.

The project team is a group of individuals with experience in PV research, design, manufacturing and application.
Inclusion of the Aquatic Center Design Team (ACDT), comprised of architects, structural engineers, estimators
and planners responsible for the design and construction of the Aquatic Center and the Atlanta Committee for the Olympic
Games (ACOG), in the project team enhances the integration of the PV system into the Aquatic Center construction project
and into the integrated schedule.

This project represents a unique opportunity to showcase a renewable energy commercialization project with utility-side
impact and support the Climate Change Plan. This proposal has been found to be meritorious. The team has the capabilities
and commitment to this project which should provide a basis for the successful implementation of the proposed project.

The program cost is estimated to be $5,439,000 total, with the DOE share being $1,993,000, Georgia Power Company share
being $1,848,000, and Georgia Institute of Technology's share the remaining $1,598,000.

 </AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of acceptance of an unsolicited financial assistance 

 application for Grant award.

 
 
 
 
</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

Based upon a determination made pursuant to 10 CFR 600.7(b)(2)(i)(B) the DOE, Morgantown Energy Technology Center
gives notice of its plans to award a 24 month Grant to Maurer Engineering, Inc. with an associated budget of approximately
$180K of which the Sandia National Laboratory will cost share approximately 45 percent. 



 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The pending award is based on an unsolicited application for the project entitled ``Evaluate Russian Advanced Drilling
Technology''. The overall objective of this project is to evaluate Russian drilling motor and drill bit technology
to eliminate unnecessary research in advanced drilling in the United States. This effort will compare Russian and
United States technologies utilizing from 4-6 Russian experts. Based on their personal experiences, literature
reviews, and personal interviews, the grantee will complete a document identifying areas where each country leads
technically, where each technology compliments each other, and where cooperative Research and Development (R&D)
would be beneficial. One of the DOE's missions is to accelerate the development of new drilling technology products
that will reduce cost or improve efficiency for drilling new oil and gas wells in the U.S. This proposed effort will
enable the Government to evaluate a wide variety of advance drilling technology research areas that are poorly understood
in the U.S. Performance of this study has the potential to save millions of dollars in duplication of effort in performing
advanced drilling technology research potentially already completed by the Russians. The development of U.S. based
advanced drilling systems will permit the gas industry to have the appropriate drilling technology to develop competitive
sources of natural gas in the future. The assurance of a reliable supply of natural gas over the next 2 to 3 decades will
do much to ease the U.S. dependence on imported oil until substitute sources of energy can be developed. The proposed
effort will provide clear benefits to the general public as regards the future of U.S. energy.

<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of Noncompetitive Financial Assistance Award.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), pursuant to the DOE Financial Assistance Rules, 10 CFR 600.7, is announcing its
intention to award a grant to Tufts University for continuing research efforts in support of the DOE Office for Building
Technologies programs. Tufts' lab-scale research on electrochromic devices will help advance the goal of developing
viable electrochromic windows for building applications.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The proposed basic research will contribute to the DOE mission by identifying and solving the materials and optics
problems associated with developing practical electrochromic windows for electrical control of radiant energy
transfer in building and vehicle windows. Successful completion of this research would advance the goal of commercialization
of electrochromic window technology. Deploying this window technology will reduce energy use in buildings which,
in the U.S., accounts for about 40% of annual national energy consumption. Approximately one-sixth of that energy
is wasted by unwanted radiation transfer through windows.


DOE has performed a review in accordance with 10 CFR 600.7 and has determined that the activity to be funded is necessary
to satisfactorily complete the current research. DOE funding for the Grant is estimated at $238,947 and the anticipated

<DOCTITLE>El Paso Natural Gas Company; Request Under Blanket Authorization</DOCTITLE>



June 15, 1994.



Take notice that on June 13, 1994, El Paso Natural Gas Company (El Paso), P.O. Box 1492, El Paso, Texas 79978, filed in
Docket No. CP94-601-000 a request pursuant to   157.205 and 157.212 of the Commission's Regulations
under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.205, 157.212) for authorization to construct and operate a delivery point under
El Paso's blanket certificate issued in Docket No. CP82-435-000 pursuant to Section 7 of the Natural Gas
Act, all as more fully set forth in the request that is on file with the Commission and open to public inspection.

El Paso proposes to construct and operate the Afton Meter Station and approximately 168.2 feet of 12-inch pipeline
in Dona Ana County, New Mexico, to permit the firm transportation and delivery of natural gas to the City of Las Cruces,
New Mexico, in accordance with a transportation service agreement dated August 15, 1991. El Paso states that Las Cruces
seeks to receive gas delivered for its customers from a point on El Paso's existing 26-inch California Line and El Paso's
30-inch California First Loop Line, which would involve constructing dual 6-inch senior orifice-type meter runs,
two 6-inch tap and valve assemblies, and appurtenances. It is stated that the service agreement provides for the firm
transportation of Las Cruces' full requirements of natural gas to consumers situated within the City of Las Cruces.
New Mexico, and its surrounding areas. El Paso states that the total estimated cost of the facilities is $151,600 which
would be reimbursed by Las Cruces.

El Paso explains that this proposal would supersede that proposal authorized in Docket No. CP94-67-000
since the parties have determined that the new location for the Afton Meter Station would provide Las Cruces with more
flexibility and less capacity constraints in the delivery of its gas. El Paso estimates that, during the third year
of operation, the maximum peak day and annual requirements of the Afton Meter Station would be 97,400 Mcf and 14,600,000
Mcf, respectively.

Any person or the Commission's staff may, within 45 days after issuance of the instant notice by the Commission, file
pursuant to Rule 214 of the Commission's Procedural Rules (18 CFR 385.214) a motion to intervene or notice of intervention
and pursuant to  157.205 of the Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.205) a protest to the request.
If no protest is filed within the time allowed therefor, the proposed activity shall be deemed to be authorized effective
the day after the time allowed for filing a protest. If a protest is filed and not withdrawn within 30 days after the time
allowed for filing a protest, the instant request shall be treated as an application for authorization pursuant to
Section 7 of the Natural Gas Act.

measurement and control equipment, capable of delivering an additional 35,000 Mcf of gas per day to NOARK, with a total
delivery capability of 70,000 Mcf of gas per day. Ozark estimates that it will cost $34,000 to construct the proposed
facilities, to be financed with equity funds and aid-in-construction funding from NOARK.
Ozark explains that becasue the location of the proposed delivery point expansion is in Township 9N, Range 26W in western
Arkansas, it is required to obtain a Section 7(c) certificate in accordance with a Stipulation and Consent Agreement
approved by the Commission in 1983, 22 FERC   61,324 at p. 61,578, instead of qualifying under Ozark's blanket
construction certificate.
Any person desiring to be heard or to make any protest with reference to said application should on or before July 6,
1994, file with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Washington, D.C. 20426, a motion to intervene or a protest
in accordance with the requirements of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.214 and 385.211)
and the Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.10). All protests filed with the Commission will be considered
by it in determining the appropriate action to be taken but will not serve to make the protestants parties to the proceeding.

<DOCTITLE>Richmond Power Enterprise, L.P.; Petition</DOCTITLE>










June 15, 1994.





Take notice that on June 10, 1994, Richmond Power Enterprise, L.P. (RPE) filed a petition for an order declaring that
RPE has the right under the ``regulatory out'' provision of its off-peak transportation (OPI) service agreement
with Columbia Gas Transmission Corporation (Columbia) to terminate its service agreement for OPI service.



RPE contends that this termination right was triggered by Commission orders regarding Columbia's Order No. 636 compliance
filing. Specifically RPE asks the Commission to institute proceedings (but not evidentiary hearings), in accordance
with an order of the bankruptcy judge in Columbia's bankruptcy proceeding, and to grant its motion for summary judgment
regarding its termination rights under the OPI service agreement.




Any person desiring to be heard or to protest said filing should file a motion to intervene or protest with the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with 18 CFR   385.214
and 385.211 of the Commission's Rules and Regulations. All such motions or protests should be filed on or before July
6, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will

its FERC Gas Tariff, Third Revised Volume No. 1, First Revised Sheet No. 167A. Such tariff sheet is proposed to be effective

Order No. 509 Final Rule issued October 4, 1993 in Docket No. RM93-8-000 (Final Rule). In that regard, the
Final Rule, among other things, removes the regulations governing the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (OCSLA)

Section 9 of TGPL's existing FT Rate Schedule is no longer required.

TGPL states that copies of the instant filing are being mailed to customers, State Commissions and other interested
parties.

Any person desiring to be heard or to protest said filing should file a motion to intervene or protest with the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with 18 CFR   385.214
and 385.211 of the Commission's Rules and Regulations. All such motions or protests should be filed on or before June
22, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will
not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party must file a motion to intervene.
Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection in the public reference
room.

<DOCTITLE>National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program; List of Petitions Received</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Public Health Service, HHS.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Public Health Service (PHS) is publishing this notice of petitions received under the National Vaccine Injury
Compensation Program (``the Program''), as required by section 2112(b)(2) of the PHS Act, as amended. While the Secretary
of Health and Human Services is named as the respondent in all proceedings brought by the filing of petitions for compensation
under the Program, the United States Court of Federal Claims is charged by statute with responsibility for considering
and acting upon the petitions.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Program provides a system of no-fault compensation for certain individuals who have been injured by specified
childhood vaccines. Subtitle 2 of title XXI of the PHS Act, 42 U.S.C. 300aa-10 

et seq.

, provides that those seeking compensation are to file a petition with the U.S. Court of Federal Claims and to serve
a copy of the petition on the Secretary of Health and Human Services, who is named as the respondent in each proceeding.
The Secretary has delegated his responsibility under the Program to PHS. The Court is directed by statute to appoint
special masters who take evidence, conduct hearings as appropriate, and make initial decisions as to eligibility
for, and amount of, compensation.



A petition may be filed with respect to injuries, disabilities, illnesses, conditions, and deaths resulting from
vaccines described in the Vaccine Injury Table set forth at section 2114 of the PHS Act. This Table lists for each covered
childhold vaccine the conditions which will lead to compensation and, for each condition, the time period for occurrence
of the first symptom or manifestation of onset or of significant aggravation after vaccine administration. Compensation
may also be awarded for conditions not listed in the Table and for conditions that are manifested after the time periods
specified in the Table, but only if the petitioner shows that the condition was caused by one of the listed vaccines.

Section 2112(b)(2) of the PHS Act, 42 U.S.C. 300aa-12(b)(2), requires that the Secretary publish in the 

Federal Register

 a notice of each petition filed. Set forth below is a partial list of petitions received by PHS on October 1, 1990 through
January 29, 1991.

Section 2112(b)(2) also provides that the special master ``shall afford all interested persons an opportunity to
submit relevant, written information'' relating to the following:

1. The existence of evidence ``that there is not a preponderance of the evidence that the illness, disability, injury,
condition, or death described in the petition is due to factors unrelated to the administration of the vaccine described
in the petition,'' and

2. Any allegation in a petition that the petitioner either:

(a) ``Sustained, or had significantly aggravated, any illness, disability, injury, or condition not set forth in
the Vaccine Injury Table (see section 2114 of the PHS Act) but which was caused by'' one of the vaccines referred to in
the Table, or

(b) ``Sustained, or had significantly aggravated, any illness, disability, injury, or condition set forth in the
Vaccine Injury Table the first symptom or manifestation of the onset or significant aggravation of which did not occur
within the time period set forth in the Table but which was caused by a vaccine'' referred to in the Table.

This notice will also serve as the special master's invitation to all interested persons to submit written information
relevant to the issues described above in the case of the petitions listed below. Any person choosing to do so should
file an original and three (3) copies of the information with the Clerk of the U.S. Court of Federal Claims at the address
listed above (under the heading For Further Information Contact), with a copy to PHS addressed to Director, Bureau
of Health Professions, 5600 Fishers Lane, room 8-05, Rockville, MD 20857. The Court's caption (Petitioner's
Name v. Secretary of Health and Human Services) and the docket number assigned to the petition should be used as the
caption for the written subission.

Chapter 35 of title 44, United States Code, related to paperwork reduction, does not apply to information required
for purposes of carrying out the Program.

<DOCTITLE>Uniform Biological Material Transfer Agreement: Request for Comments </DOCTITLE>


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 National Institutes of Health (NIH), Public Health Service, DHHS.

 

BACKGROUND: 

Open access to the results of federally-funded research is a cornerstone of NIH's research policy. In the case of many
research projects, this includes not only access to information as can be provided in publications, but also access
to biological research materials necessary to replicate or build on the initial results. Frequently, the exchange
of research materials between scientists and separate institutions involves case-by-case negotiation of material
transfer agreements (MTAs). In order to guide and facilitate the increasing number of such transfers, the Public
Health Service (PHS) issued in 1988, a ``Policy Relating to Distribution of Unique Research Resources Produced with
PHS Funding'' (NIH GUIDE FOR GRANTS AND CONTRACTS, Vol. 17, No. 29, September 16, 1988: pg. 1), that was followed in
1989 by adoption of a standard Material Transfer Agreement form for use by NIH scientists. Such agreements are important
because they require the recipient to use care in the handling of the materials, to maintain control over the distribution
of the materials, to acknowledge the provider in publications, and to follow relevant Public Health Service (PHS)
guidelines relating to recombinant DNA, human subjects research, use of animals, etc. However, while most institutions
have adopted some standard material transfer agreement form, they are not all consistent. 



ISSUE: 

Several concerns have affected the sharing of research materials. These include delays in sharing of materials while
conducting negotiations on individual MTAs, required grants of invention rights to improvements to the materials
or to inventions made using the materials, and required approval prior to publication. Such problems have resulted
in significant delays in sharing materials, undue administrative barriers to sharing, and in some cases, lack of
availability of materials for further research by federal grantees. (For reports and discussion of these issues,
please refer to The New Biologist, Vol. 2, No. 6, June 1990: pp. 495-497; and Science, Vol. 248, 25 May, 1990: pp.
952-957). 


In addition, there is a desire to have a uniform agreement for the sharing of non-proprietary materials.

 

PROPOSAL: 

The NIH, in participation with representatives of academia and industry, has coordinated the development of a proposed
uniform biological material transfer agreement (UBMTA) to address concerns about contractual obligations imposed
by some MTAs and to simplify the process of sharing proprietary materials between non-profit institutions. The Association
of University Technology Managers, particularly Ms. Joyce Brinton, Harvard University; Ms. Lita Nelsen, Massachusetts
Institute of Technology; and Dr. Sandra Shotwell, Oregon Health Sciences University, have played leadership roles
in furthering the development of common materials sharing practices. The consistent use of this agreement by grantee
institutions could reduce the administrative burden of sharing materials as investigators come to rely on common
acceptance of the terms of the UBMTA by cooperating institutions. 


The NIH proposes that the UBMTA be considered for general use in the exchange of materials for research purposes between
non-profit institutions. While use of the UBMTA may not be appropriate for every material transfer, if used for the
majority of transfers, it could set standards for materials sharing that would be of long term benefit to the research
enterprise and to the public health. 
As a further suggestion to simplify the process of materials sharing, it is proposed that the UBMTA be approved at the
institutional level, and handled in a treaty format, so that individual transfers could be made with reference to
the UBMTA, without the need for separate negotiation of an individual document to cover each transfer. As a result,
transfers of biological materials would be accomplished by an implementing letter (see sample) containing a description
of the material, a statement indicating that the material was being transferred in accordance with the terms of the
UBMTA and signed by the Provider Scientist and the Recipient Scientist. Thus, sharing of materials between institutions,
each of which had signed the UBMTA, would be significantly simplified. At the same time, any institution would retain
the option to handle a specific material on a customized basis, i.e., the use of the UBMTA would not be mandatory, even
for signatory institutions. 
For non-proprietary materials, a Simple Letter Agreement has also been developed, which incorporates many of the
same principles as the UBMTA. This Letter Agreement could be used where the institutions have not agreed to the UBMTA.

The full text of the treaty version of the UBMTA, the implementing letter, and a simple one-page letter agreement for
non-proprietary material follows. The NIH welcomes public comment on the documents themselves, as well as their
proposed use. Comments should be addressed to: UBMTA Project, c/o Office of Technology Transfer, Box 13, 6011 Executive
Boulevard, Rockville, MD 20852-3804. Comments may also be sent by facsimile transmission to: UBMTA Project
at (301) 402-0220.

 Notice.





</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Worland District, Cody Resource Area, of the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) will host an open house to provide
a forum to answer questions and allow public comment concerning the proposed withdrawal of public land from settlement,
location, or entry under the general land laws, including the mining laws, to protect scenic, recreational, and cultural
resource values in the Devil Canyon area near Lovell, Wyoming. The public is invited to participate. All comments
will be considered when a final determination is made on whether this land should be withdrawn. In addition, the open
house will provide the public an opportunity to identify concerns to be addressed in a planning review of existing
management prescriptions associated with management of the resource values in Devil Canyon. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Notice of Proposed Withdrawal for the Devil Canyon area was published in the 

Federal Register

 on February 1, 1994 (Vol. 59, No. 21, page 4721), and involves 7,202 acres of public land and Federal minerals, and 320
acres of Federal minerals underlying private lands in Big Horn County, Wyoming. This area includes portions of Porcupine
Creek, Oasis Spring, Trout Creek, and Deer Creek drainages, near Lovell, Wyoming. The open house will also provide
the public an opportunity to evaluate the implications, needs, and issues associated with management of the unique
scenic, recreational, and cultural values located in the Devil Canyon area. 


The resource values involved were instrumental in identifying much of the BLM administered public lands in the area
under review for special management emphasis and designation as an area of critical environmental concern (ACEC),
and in the BLM lands along the mentioned waterways being found to meet the Wild and Scenic Rivers suitability factors.

The planning review will identify any need for additional management prescriptions or actions, as appropriate.
Management actions to consider include closure of the area to settlement, location, or entry under the general land
laws, including the mining laws. If the final determinations of the planning review result in withdrawing the lands
as proposed or in changing any other existing management direction or adding new management direction for the BLM
administered public lands involved, the Cody Resource Management Plan (RMP) would be amended, accordingly, in the
process. 
The open house will be held jointly with the Forest Service, since the upper portion of Porcupine Creek has also been
proposed for withdrawal by the Forest Service. Interested parties may provide written statements within 30 days
after the open house to the State Director, Bureau of Land Management, Wyoming State Office, P.O. Box 1828, Cheyenne,
Wyoming 82003.

<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This notice advises the public that the City of Bakersfield (Applicant) has applied to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service
(Service) for an incidental take permit pursuant to section 10(a)(1)(B) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as
amended (Act). The application has been assigned permit number PRT-786634. The requested permit would authorize
the incidental take of the endangered blunt-nosed leopard lizard (

Gambelia silus

) and the threatened San Joaquin kit fox (

Vulpes macrotis mutica

) in the city of Bakersfield, Kern County, California. The proposed incidental take would occur as a result of construction
activities for a sewer trunkline in blunt-nose leopard lizard and San Joaquin kit fox habitat.




The Service also announces the availability of an Environmental Assessment (EA) for the proposed issuance of the
incidental take permit. This notice is provided pursuant to section 10(c) of the Act and National Environmental Policy
Act regulations (40 CFR  1506.6).




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 




Background



Under section 9 of the Act, ``taking'' of endangered blunt-nosed leopard lizards and threatened San Joaquin kit fox
is prohibited. However, the Service, under limited circumstances, may issue permits to take endangered or threatened
wildlife species if such taking is incidental to, and not the purpose of, otherwise lawful activities. Regulations
governing permits for endangered and threatened species are in 50 CFR   17.22 and 17.32, respectively.

The applicant proposes to implement a Habitat Conservation Plan (HCP) for the blunt-nose leopard lizard and San Joaquin
kit fox that will allow construction of a sewer trunkline in the city of Bakersfield, Kern County, California. The
permit would authorize the disturbance of up to 88.2 acres. The permit would be in effect for 2 years. The application
includes an HCP and Implementation Agreement.

The applicant proposes to construct a 12 to 30-inch diameter underground line within a construction corridor ranging
between 35 and 75 feet in width. Construction is proposed to begin after permit issuance and to take about 8 to 9 months.
A total of 88.2 acres will be subject to temporary disturbance as a result of sewer trunkline construction activities.
Approximately 73 acres of the total disturbed area is considered suitable habitat for the two listed species. The
area that will be subject to temporary disturbance includes urban, actively cultivated, and nonnative grasslands.

The applicant proposes to undertake a series of on-site and off-site mitigation measures to offset the incidental
take of a small number of San Joaquin kit foxes and blunt-nosed leopard lizards, and the temporary impacts to their
habitats associated with this project. These measures would include: (1) Offsite acquisition of 80.2 acres of native
habitat; (2) transfer to the California Department of Fish and Game, or the designated trustee, funds to manage and
improve these offsite lands; and (3) measures to reduce the potential of take of both species to the maximum extent
possible during construction of the sewer trunkline.

The EA considers the environmental consequences of four alternatives. The alternatives include the proposed action
(permit issuance), no-action (permit denial), incorporation into the Regional Section 10(a) permit for the Metropolitan
Bakersfield Area, and modifying current sewer trunkline alignments.

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 Pursuant to section 102(2)(c) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, the National Park Service (NPS) announces
the availability of a Final Environmental Impact Statement/General Management Plan/Development Concept Plan
(FEIS/GMP/DCP) for Bent's Old Fort National Historic Site, Colorado.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 In December 1993, the National Park Service released, for a 60-day public review, a Draft Environmental Impact Statement/General
Management Plan/Development Concept Plan (DEIS/GMP/DCP) that evaluated three alternatives. The alternatives
provided for the preservation of historic and natural resources while providing for visitor use. Under the no-action
alternative, existing management activities would continue. Alternative One would expand the scope of the interpretive
program, creating a self-service, self-interpretation oriented visitor experience. It would maintain the historic
character of the site and improve overall operational and administrative working environments, while limiting
physical development of small additions of space and renovation of existing spaces. The proposal would expand the
scope of the interpretive program, create an interactive interpretive atmosphere through implementation of a visitor
center, maintain the historic character of the site, and improve overall operational and administrative working
environments by adding appropriate facilities. 



The DEIS/GMP/DCP in particular evaluated the environmental consequences of the proposed action and the other alternatives
on geology/soils, vegetation, prime and unique farmlands, wildlife, threatened and endangered species, water
resources/quality, floodplains and wetlands, air quality, noise quality, cultural resources, visitor use, and
socioeconomic resources/surrounding land uses. The environmental consequences of the proposed action and alternatives
considered are fully disclosed in the DEIS/GMP/DCP. The Final Environmental Impact Statement/General Management
Plan/Development Concept Plan states that the proposal, as described in the DEIS/GMP/DCP is the final plan. Also
included are the results of the public involvement and consultation and coordination for this project.

<DOCTITLE>Record of Decision Black-footed Ferret Reintroduction Conata Basin/Badlands, SD </DOCTITLE>



Introduction 



Pursuant to regulations of the Council on Environmental Quality (40 CFR  1505.2) and the implementing procedures
of the National Park Service for the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (40 U.S.C.  1501 

et seq.

), the Department of the Interior has prepared this draft record of decision on the 

Final Environmental Impact Statement, Black-footed Ferret Reintroduction, Conata Basin/Badlands, South Dakota,
March, 1994. 

This record of decision is a concise statement of decisions that were made, alternatives that were considered, and
mitigating measures that were developed to avoid or minimize environmental impacts. 



Decision 



The National Park Service will accept as approved for implementation, Alternative C, Reintroduce Black-footed
Ferrets into the Badlands National Park and the Buffalo Gap National Grassland with Initial Releases in the Badlands
National Park, as described in the above-referenced Final Environmental Impact Statement. Working with its cooperators
to achieve this alternative, the National Park Service will implement a cooperative management plan and reintroduction
protocol for restoration of black-footed ferrets into the Conata Basin/Badlands Area of South Dakota. The National
Park Service considered and evaluated the alternatives for the reintroduction of a non-essential experimental
population of black-footed ferrets into the Conata Basin/Badlands area of South Dakota as presented in the FEIS,
including a no action alternative, and thoroughly reviewed and considered public and agency comments in formulating
this determination. 



The Selected Plan 



The selected plan reintroduces black-footed ferrets into a black-tailed prairie dog colony complex on the Badlands
National Park (BNP) and the Buffalo Gap National Grassland (BGNG). A non-essential experimental population area
of approximately 1,182,200 acres is delineated within which the legal status of the black-footed ferret is changed
from endangered to non-essential experimental to allow for greater management flexibility. A reintroduction area
of approximately 42,000 acres which currently contains about 8,000 acres of prairie dog colonies on federally managed
land becomes the focus of releases and black-footed ferret management activities. Initial releases occur in the
BNP, and habitat for black-footed ferret movement and dispersal is identified. Short-term constraints on a few activities
may be implemented at specific release sites and in the reintroduction area to increase the chances for survival of
released animals. 

The immediate purpose of the proposed action is to use experimental techniques to reintroduce and establish a free
ranging, cooperatively managed wild population of black-footed ferrets (Mustela nigripes

) in the Conata Basin/Badlands experimental population area near Wall, South Dakota, as part of the national recovery
effort. The reintroduced black-footed ferrets and their progeny will be classified a nonessential experimental
population under federal rulemaking procedures. 



Alternatives Considered 



Five alternatives, including the selected plan, were analyzed in the final environmental impact statement: 

Alternative A_No Action: Black-footed ferrets would not be reintroduced into the BNP or the BGNG. 

Alternative B_Reintroduce black-footed ferrets only in the BNP on approximately 3,200 acres of prairie dog colonies
within a reintroduction area of approximately 25,000 acres, with approximately 3,175 acres of prairie dog colonies.


Alternative C (Selected Plan)_Reintroduce black-footed ferrets in the BNP and the BGNG on approximately 8,000 acres
of prairie dog colonies within a reintroduction area of approximately 42,000 acres, with initial releases in the
BNP. 

Alternative D_Reintroduce black-footed ferrets in the BNP and the BGNG on approximately 8,000 acres of prairie dog
colonies within a reintroduction area of approximately 42,000 acres, with initial releases on the BGNG. 

Alternative E_Reintroduce black-footed ferrets in the BNP and the BGNG on approximately 8,000 acres of prairie dog
colonies within a reintroduction area of approximately 172,000 acres, with initial releases occurring in the most
biologically suitable habitat within the reintroduction area. Although prairie dog management remains unchanged
under all alternatives, management options to further protect black-footed ferrets could occur within a larger
reintroduction area in situations where conflict with other land uses arise. 



Environmentally Preferable Alternative 



The environmentally preferred alternative is Alternative E. Although prairie dog management and levels of prairie
dog habitat would not increase under this alternative, some additional protection of black-footed ferrets could
occur if management options favoring black-footed ferrets were exercised across a larger reintroduction area,
reducing the risks to black-footed ferrets from competing activities and/or uses. Within a socioeconomic context,
however, the public perception that protecting each individual black-footed ferret with overly restrictive measures
in an expanded reintroduction area outweighed any environmental benefit to black-footed ferret population recovery
efforts. Alternative C was chosen to reintroduce and establish a population of black-footed ferrets in the Conata
Basin/Badlands area of South Dakota within the context of existing recreational and agricultural land uses. 



Mitigation 



Potential project impacts, public concerns, and methods to be used to mitigate those impacts and concerns are addressed
in the FEIS. The National Park Service considers that Alternative C, reintroduction of black-footed ferrets in BNP
and BGNG with initial releases in BNP, provides the best means to establish and perpetuate a free-ranging population
of black-footed ferrets into the Conata Basin/Badlands area of South Dakota with the fewest environmental effects.
All practical solutions to avoid or minimize environmental harm from selecting this action alternative have been
identified and considered acceptable. 



Conclusion 



After careful evaluation of each alternative and considering black-footed ferret biology, management objectives,
environmental effects, costs, socioeconomics, legislative intent, National Park Service policies, and public
response, the National Park Service believes that Alternative C provides the best balanced course of action to establish
and manage a population of black-footed ferrets into a portion of its historical range within southwestern 
South Dakota.

 Notice.

 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Department of Labor (DOL) is publishing, for public 
information, a list of the following health care facilities that have submitted attestations (Form ETA 9029 and explanatory
statements) to one of four Regional Offices of DOL (Boston, Chicago, Dallas and Seattle) for the purpose of employing
nonimmigrant alien nurses. A decision has been made on the these organizations' attestations and they are on file
with DOL.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
The Immigration and Nationality Act requires that a health care facility seeking to use nonimmigrant aliens as registered
nurses first attest to the Department of Labor (DOL) that it is taking significant steps to develop, recruit and retain
United States (U.S.) workers in the nursing profession. The law also requires that these foreign nurses will not adversely
affect U.S. nurses and that the foreign nurses will be treated fairly. The facility's attestation must be on file with
DOL before the Immigration and Naturalization Service will consider the facility's H-1A visa petitions for
bringing nonimmigrant registered nurses to the United States. 26 U.S.C. 1101(a)(15)(H)(i)(a) and 1181(m). The
regulations implementing the nursing attestation program are at 20 CFR Parts 655, Subpart D, and 29 CFR Part 504, (January
6, 1994). The Employment and Training Administration, pursuant to 20 CFR 655.310(c), is publishing the following
list of facilities which have submitted attestations which have been accepted for filing and those which have been
rejected. 


The list of facilities is published so that U.S. registered nurses, and other persons and organizations can be aware
of health care facilities that have requested foreign nurses for their staff. If U.S. registered nurses or other persons
wish to examine the attestation (on Form ETA 9029) and the supporting documentation, the facility is required to make
the attestation and documentation available. Telephone numbers of the facilities chief executive officer also
are listed to aid public inquiries. In addition, attestations and explanatory statements (but not the full supporting
documentation) are available for inspection at the address for the Employment and Training Administration set forth
in the 

ADDRESSES

 section of this notice. 
If a person wishes to file a complaint regarding a particular attestation or a facility's activities under the attestation,
such complaint must be filed at the address for the Wage and Hour Division of the Employment Standards Administration
set forth in the 

ADDRESSES

 section of this notice.

Abbott Pension Plan (the Plan), located in Lynn, MA. 


[Application No. D-9613].


Proposed Exemption 


The Department is considering granting an exemption under the authority of section 408(a) of the Act and section 4975(c)(2)
of the Code and in accordance with the procedures set forth in 
29 CFR part 2570, subpart B (55 FR 32836, 32847, August 10, 1990). If the exemption is granted, the restrictions of 
sections 406(a), 406 (b)(1) and (b)(2) of the Act and the sanctions resulting from the application of section 4975
of 
the Code, by reason of section 4975(c)(1) (A) through (E) of the Code, shall not apply to the proposed transfer by the
Plan, of certain limited partnership interests (the Interests) to Abbott House Nursing Home, Inc. (Abbott); Winthrop
Nursing Home, Inc. (which does business as the Bay View Nursing Home and is referred to herein as Winthrop/Bay View);
Devereux House Nursing Home, Inc. (Devereux); and the Greenview House Nursing Home, Inc. (Greenview), in satisfaction
of certain cash advances made to the Plan by these entities. (Abbott, Winthrop/Bay View, Devereux and Greenview,
which are parties in interest with respect to the Plan, are collectively referred to herein as the Nursing Facilities.)

This proposed exemption is conditioned upon the following requirements: (1) The transfer represents a one-time
transaction and satisfies certain cash advances made by the Nursing Facilities to the Plan; (2) the Interests are
transferred for the greater of their historical cost to the Plan, their fair market value or the total amount of cash
advanced to the Plan; 
(3) for purposes of the transfer, the fair market value of the Interests has been established by a qualified, independent
appraiser; and (4) the Plan does not pay any fees or commissions in connection with the transfer. 


Summary of Facts and Representations 


1. The Plan is a defined benefit plan that has been adopted by four Massachusetts-based nursing facilities which are
members of a controlled group of corporations. The Nursing Facilities that sponsor the Plan for the benefit of their
employees are Abbott, Winthrop/Bay View, Devereux and Greenview. As of December 31, 1992, the Plan had total net assets
of $2,060,920. This amount was allocated among the Nursing Facility sub-Plan accounts as follows: 





2. As of December 23, 1993, the Plan had two remaining participants, Richard C. Bane and his brother, Robert Bane, both
of whom participate in the Abbott sub-Plan account. Richard Bane is the Plan trustee and the decisionmaker with respect
to the Plan's investments. Both Richard and Robert Bane are 50 percent shareholders of Abbott and Devereux. Their
father, George H. Bane, and Gerald Gouchberg, an outside investor who is not related to members of the Bane Family,
each own 50 percent of the outstanding stock of Winthrop/Bay View and Greenview. 
3. The Plan is in the process of terminating and upon termination, will be replaced with a deferred compensation plan.
On April 12, 1993, the Plan received approval from the Internal Revenue Service to terminate as of December 31, 1992
and it made cash distributions to 126 employees of the Nursing Facilities with the exception of the Banes. To provide
partial funding for the participant distributions and to provide liquidity while assets were being sold, the Nursing
Facilities made cash advances
 to the Plan during the second and third quarters of 1993 in the following amounts:

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940621-2-00076 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940621-2-00051 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

In addition to the cash advances, each Nursing Facility made cash contributions during 1992 and 1993 to their respective
sub-Plan account in order to satisfy the Plan's liabilities. Such contributions were in excess of $273,000. 
4. At present, the Plan holds certain assets that are not readily marketable and have limited liquidity. These assets
consist of interests in New England Pension Properties V (NEPP V) and New England Pension Properties VI (NEPP VI).
NEPP V and NEPP VI are real estate investment trusts/limited partnerships. The Plan has paid no servicing fees in connection
with the holding of the Interests in NEPP V and NEPP VI nor have any restrictions been placed upon their sale or transfer.

The Plan acquired the Interests in NEPP V and NEPP VI on June 22, 1987 and July 13, 1988, respectively, from Copley Partnerships,
an unrelated party. The Plan made a cash investment of $50,000 in NEPP V and $40,000 in NEPP VI. At the time of acquisition,
the per unit value of the Interests in 
NEPP V and NEPP VI was $1,000. Thus, the Plan received 
50 limited partnership units in NEPP V and 40 limited partnership units in NEPP VI. Both NEPP V and NEPP VI have a maturity
date of December 31, 2036. 


On July 31, 1990, the Plan received $1,926 from Copley Partnerships with respect to the Interest in NEPP VI. This amount
represented a return of capital. In addition, the Plan received income payments of $14,082 for NEPP V and $11,165 for
NEPP VI or a total income payment of $25,247. 


The Interests have been appraised by Fredric Daub, President of Capital Insurance Agency, Inc., an independent investment
broker from Maynard, MA. In an appraisal report dated February 25, 1994, Mr. Daub has verified that during the fourth
quarter of 1993, he obtained firm bids for NEPP V of $232 per unit and $324 per unit for NEPP VI in the secondary market.
Thus, the fair market values of the Plan's Interests in NEPP V and NEPP VI would be $11,600 and $12,960, respectively,
or a total fair market value of $24,560. Mr. Daub represents that these values reflect gross proceeds before the application
of a one-time fee of $250 and a re-registration fee of an unspecified amount. Mr. Daub also notes that these values reflect
a commitment as of the day of the offering and that the secondary market for investments such as NEPP V and NEPP VI is extremely
limited. 


5. To facilitate the liquidation and termination of the Plan and reimburse the Nursing Facilities for the cash advances
they have made to the Plan, the Nursing Facilities propose to have the Interests transferred to them. Accordingly,
an administrative exemption is requested from the Department. 


The Interests will be transferred to the Nursing Facilities for the greater of their historical cost to the Plan, their
fair market value, or $100,754 representing the total outstanding loans advanced previously by the Nursing Facilities
to the Plan. According to the applicant, these loans would have been repaid in cash had the Plan not been in the process
of terminating. As a result of the transfer, the Nursing Facilities will cancel the outstanding indebtedness. The
Plan will not be required to pay any fees or commissions in connection therewith. 


6. In summary, it is represented that the proposed transaction will satisfy the statutory criteria for an exemption
under section 408(a) of the Act because: (a) the transfer will be a one-time transaction to satisfy certain cash advances
made by the Nursing Facilities to the Plan; (b) the Interests will be transferred to the Nursing Facilities for the
greater of their historical cost to the Plan, their fair market value or the total amount of cash advanced to the Plan;
(c) for purposes of the transfer, the fair market value of the Interests has been established by a qualified, independent
appraiser; and (d) the Plan will not pay any fees or commissions in connection with the transfer.

AT&T Management Pension Plan and AT&T Pension Plan (the AT&T Plans), and

Proposed Exemption 


The Department is considering granting an exemption under the authority of section 408(a) of the Act and section 4975(c)(2)
of the Code and in accordance with the procedures set forth in 
29 CFR Part 2570, Subpart B (55 FR 32836, 32847, August 10, 1990). If the exemption is granted the restrictions of sections
406(a), 406 (b)(1) and (b)(2) of the Act and the sanctions resulting from the application of section 4975 of the Code,
by reason of section 4975(c)(1) (A) through (E) of the Code, shall not apply, effective June 3, 1993, to the past and
proposed lease (the Lease) by the Plans, through the Telephone Real Estate Equity Trust (TREET), of office space in
Southpark C, a commercial office building in Austin, Texas, to American Telephone and Telegraph Co. (AT&T),
one of the sponsors of the Plans; provided that the following conditions are satisfied: 
(A) The interests of TREET for all purposes under the Lease are represented by Hill Partners, which is independent
of and unrelated to AT&T, serving as a fiduciary under the Act; 
(B) At all times under the Lease, AT&T pays TREET rent of no less than the fair market rental value of the Property;
and 
(C) All terms and conditions of the Lease are at least as favorable to TREET as those which TREET could obtain in arm's-length
transactions with unrelated parties;

Prior to 1986, TREET acquired the Note and the Deed of Trust from the Mercantile Fund. Commencing in 1986, that portion
of TREET's assets which included the Note and Deed of Trust was managed by Goldman Sachs & Company (Goldman) pursuant
to an agreement with AT&T under which Goldman managed debt investments of TREET. 
Effective December 1, 1990, AT&T commenced leasing from Crowe approximately 13,997 square feet in Southpark
C pursuant to a written lease (the AT&T Lease) providing for monthly rental of $6858.75 for a term of 36 months,
through November 30, 1993. AT&T represents that at the time the AT&T Lease commenced, neither Karsten nor
any other representative of TREET had any authority or control over the leasing of space in Southpark, and TREET's
sole interest in Southpark at that time was as the holder of a security interest arising from TREET's ownership of the
Note and the Deed of Trust. 
5. AT&T represents that during the mid-1980's Crowe began to experience increasing difficulty in meeting its
Loan payment obligations, due to depressed real estate conditions in the Austin market, and Crowe and TREET negotiated
modified Loan payment terms in 1989, 1990 and 1991. These modifications related Crowe's Loan payment obligation
to the level of cash flow generated by the Southpark buildings, and the parties agreed that unpaid accrued interest
would be added to the Loan principal. As a result, however, the principal amount of the Loan became so large in relation
to the value of the Southpark buildings that it appeared unlikely that Crowe would be able to receive any return on its
equity after paying off the Loan. After it was evident that Crowe would eventually default on the Loan and that TREET
would acquire Southpark by foreclosure, Goldman took steps to enable TREET to acquire title to Southpark prior to
foreclosure, in order to exercise control over the buildings and to directly collect the rents. Crowe transferred
title to Southpark to TREET through a deed in lieu of foreclosure (the Transfer Deed) executed on June 3, 1993. At that
time, AT&T remained a tenant in Southpark under the AT&T Lease, occupying approximately 18 percent of the
rentable space in Southpark. The term of the AT&T Lease expired on November 30, 1993, but the lease continues on
a month-to-month holdover basis (the Holdover Lease). AT&T hopes to negotiate a new lease of office space in Southpark
(the New Lease), under which it would occupy substantially less space in Southpark, constituting less than ten percent
of the Southpark's leasable square footage. 
6. At all times before TREET acquired Southpark, its interests in the Loan had been managed and advised by Goldman,
whose responsibilities with respect to Trust assets were limited to the management of debt investments. Upon acquisition
of title to Southpark through the Transfer Deed, TREET thereby acquired equity interests, which were not within the
scope of Goldman's authority to manage under the terms of its appointment. Accordingly, Karsten, which was already
providing investment management services with respect to other assets of TREET, was appointed by AT&T to assume
investment management responsibility on TREET's behalf for the Southpark buildings. With the addition of Southpark
to TREET assets under its management, Karsten commenced to hold management responsibility with respect to more than
twenty percent of the assets of TREET. 
7. In order to secure representation of TREET's interests under the AT&T Lease by a fiduciary which is sufficiently
independent of AT&T, Hill Partners, Inc. (Hill Partners) has been appointed to act as an independent fiduciary
on behalf of TREET, effective December 1, 1993, with respect to AT&T's lease of space in Southpark. Hill Partners
is a Texas corporation engaged in commercial real estate development and management services, with its corporate
headquarters in Austin, Texas. Hill Partners represents that it is unrelated to AT&T and TREET, except for the
provision of services as leasing agent for Southpark C, which it represents constitutes less than five percent of
Hill Partners' total revenues for the past fiscal year. Hill Partners serves as a fiduciary under the Act, to represent
TREET's interests for all purposes with respect to AT&T's lease of Southpark space pursuant to the Holdover Lease
and any New Lease or extension, renewal or renegotiation of the AT&T Lease. Hill Partners is required to monitor
AT&T's performance of all obligations under any such lease, and to pursue appropriate remedies in the event of
any default in performance of such obligations. Hill Partners' obligations include representing the interests
of TREET in the negotiations with AT&T over the New Lease, and in the oversight and enforcement of AT&T's obligations
under any New Lease which is consummated, including any renewal or extension thereof.
 
Hill Partners' role also includes certain determinations with respect to the period commencing June 3, 1993, to December
1, 1993 (the Interim Period), the date of Hill Partners' assumption of duties as independent fiduciary on behalf of
TREET. Specifically, Hill Partners is obligated to assess and evaluate AT&T's performance of its obligations
under the AT&T Lease during the Interim Period, and Karsten's representation of TREET's interests during the
Interim Period with respect to the AT&T Lease. Hill Partners represents that it has determined that during the
Interim Period, AT&T was in complete compliance with all terms and conditions of the AT&T Lease. Hill Partners
also represents that, based upon its review, it has determined that Karsten's representation of TREET's interests
under the AT&T Lease during the Interim Period was appropriate and adequately protective of the interests of
TREET. 
8. With respect to the proposed New Lease, the negotiation of which has been conducted between AT&T and Hill Partners,
AT&T proposes to lease 7,600 square feet in Southpark C for a term of three years, effective April 1, 1994. The proposed
annual base rent per square foot is $6.00 for the first year, $6.60 for the second year, and $6.96 for the third year,
and AT&T is responsible for its pro rata share of expenses. The New Lease's three-year term may be extended for
no more than one three-year renewal term at rent of no less than the prevailing market rental rate, by written notice
to Hill Partners 180 days prior to expiration of the initial term, subject to Hill Partners' determination that such
extension is in the best interests of the plans participating in TREET. Hill Partners confirms that it has represented
TREET's interests in negotiating the proposed New Lease, that it approves of all the terms and conditions of the proposed
New Lease, and that it would be in the best interests of TREET to execute the New Lease with AT&T. Hill Partners states
that it has determined that the rent required under the New Lease is not less than the fair market rent. Hill Partners
states that in executing the New Lease, TREET will be retaining a substantial corporate tenant which has an excellent
performance record and which constitutes a very high quality tenant. Hill Partners represents that all the terms
of the proposed New Lease are at least as favorable to TREET as TREET could obtain in an arm's-length transaction with
an unrelated party. 
9. In summary, the applicant represents that the proposed transactions satisfy the criteria of section 408(a) of
the Act for the following reasons: (1) The interests of TREET with respect to TREET's lease of space in Southpark to
AT&T under the Holdover Lease and the proposed New Lease have been and will be represented by Hill Partners, serving
as an independent fiduciary on behalf of TREET; (2) Hill Partners has determined that during the Interim Period, after
TREET acquired Southpark and before Hill Partners' appointment as independent fiduciary, the interests of TREET
were adequately protected and appropriately represented by Karsten; (3) Hill Partners approves of all terms of the
proposed New Lease and AT&T's continued tenancy in Southpark, and has determined that the rent required under
the New Lease is not less than the fair market rent; (4) Under the proposed New Lease, AT&T will reduce the amount
of space it leases in Southpark to less than ten percent of Southpark's total leasable space; and (5) Any renewal of
the New Lease will require the approval of Hill Partners and will require rent of no less than the fair market rent.

General Information 


The attention of interested persons is directed to the following: 
(1) The fact that a transaction is the subject of an exemption under section 408(a) of the Act and/or section 4975(c)(2)
of the Code does not relieve a fiduciary or other party in interest of disqualified person from certain other provisions
of the Act and/or the Code, including any prohibited transaction provisions to which the exemption does not apply
and the general fiduciary responsibility provisions of section 404 of the Act, which among other things require a
fiduciary to discharge his duties respecting the plan solely in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries
of the plan and in a prudent fashion in accordance with section 404(a)(1)(b) of the act; nor does it affect the requirement
of section 401(a) of the Code that the plan must operate for the exclusive benefit of the employees of the employer maintaining
the plan and their beneficiaries; 
(2) Before an exemption may be granted under section 408(a) of the Act and/or section 4975(c)(2) of the Code, the Department
must find that the exemption is administratively feasible, in the interests of the plan and of its participants and
beneficiaries and protective of the rights of participants and beneficiaries of the plan; 
(3) The proposed exemptions, if granted, will be supplemental to, and not in derogation of, any other provisions of
the Act and/or the Code, including statutory or administrative exemptions and transitional rules. Furthermore,
the fact that a transaction is subject to an administrative or statutory exemption is not dispositive of whether the
transaction is in fact a prohibited transaction; and 
(4) The proposed exemptions, if granted, will be subject to the express condition that the material facts and representations
contained in each application are true and complete and accurately describe all material terms of the transaction
which is the subject of the exemption. In the case of continuing exemption transactions, if any of the material facts
or representations described in the application change after the exemption is granted, the exemption will cease
to apply as of the date of such change. In the event of any such change, application for a new exemption may be made to the
Department.

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Grant of Individual Exemptions. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document contains exemptions issued by the Department of Labor (the Department) from certain of the prohibited
transaction restrictions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (the Act) and/or the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986 (the Code). 


Notices were published in the 

Federal Register

 of the pendency before the Department of proposals to grant such exemptions. The notices set forth a summary of facts
and representations contained in each application for exemption and referred interested persons to the respective
applications for a complete statement of the facts and representations. The applications have been available for
public inspection at the Department in Washington, DC. The notices also invited interested persons to submit comments
on the requested exemptions to the Department. In addition the notices stated that any interested person might submit
a written request that a public 
hearing be held (where appropriate). The applicants have represented that they have complied with the requirements
of the notification to interested persons. No public comments and no requests for a hearing, unless otherwise stated,
were received by the Department. 
The notices of proposed exemption were issued and the exemptions are being granted solely by the Department because,
effective December 31, 1978, section 102 of Reorganization Plan No. 4 of 1978 (43 FR 47713, October 17, 1978) transferred
the authority of the Secretary of the Treasury to issue exemptions of the type proposed to the Secretary of Labor. 


Statutory Findings 


In accordance with section 408(a) of the Act and/or section 4975(c)(2) of the Code and the procedures set forth in 29
CFR Part 2570, Subpart B (55 FR 32836, 32847, August 10, 1990) and based upon the entire record, the Department makes
the following findings: 
(a) The exemptions are administratively feasible; 
(b) They are in the interests of the plans and 
their participants and beneficiaries; and 
(c) They are protective of the rights of the 
participants and beneficiaries of the plans.

[Prohibited Transaction Exemption 94-47; Exemption Application No. D-9516]. 



Exemption 


Part I_Exemption for Cross-Trading Between Certain Funds 


The restrictions of sections 406(a)(1)(A) and 406(b)(2) of the Act, and the sanctions resulting from the application
of section 4975 of the Code, by reason of section 4975(c)(1)(A) of the Code, shall not apply to (1) the purchase and sale
of stock (including the stock of BankAmerica Corporation (BAC)) between Index Funds and/or Model Driven funds (collectively,
the Funds); and (2) the purchase and sale of stocks (including the common stock of BAC) between Index or Model-Driven
Funds and various large pension plans (the Large Plans) pursuant to portfolio restructuring programs of the Large
Plans; provided that the following conditions and the General Conditions of Part III are met: 
(a) The Index or Model-Driven Fund is based on an index which represents the investment performance of a specific segment
of the public market for equity securities in the United States and/or foreign countries. The organization creating
and maintaining the index must be (1) engaged in the business of providing financial information, evaluation, advice
or securities brokerage services to institutional clients, (2) a publisher of financial news or information, or
(3) a public stock exchange or association of securities dealers. The index must be created and maintained by an organization
independent of Bank of America and its affiliates. The index must be a generally accepted standardized index of securities
which is not specifically tailored for the use of Bank of America or its affiliates. 
(b) The price for the stock is set at the closing price for that stock on the day of trading; unless the stock was added
to or deleted from an index underlying a Fund (or Funds) after the close of trading, in which case the price will be the
opening price for that stock on the next business day after the announcement of the addition or deletion. 
(c) The transaction takes place within three business days of the ``triggering event'' giving rise to the cross-trade
opportunity. A triggering event is defined as: 
(1) A change in the composition or weighting of the index and/or model underlying a Fund; 
(2) A change in the overall level of investment in a Fund as a result of investments and withdrawals made on the Fund's
regularly-scheduled opening date; or 
(3) A declaration by Bank of America (recorded on Bank of America's records) that a ``triggering event'' has occurred,
which will be made upon an accumulation of cash in a Fund attributable to dividends and/or tender offers for portfolio
securities equal to not less than .05 percent and not more than .5 percent of the Fund's total value; 
(d) In the event that a number of shares of a particular stock which all of the Funds or Large Plans propose to sell on a
given day is less than the number of shares of such stock which all of the Funds or the Large Plans propose to buy, or vice
versa, the direct cross-trade opportunity must be allocated among potential buyers or sellers on a pro rata basis.

(e) With respect to transactions involving a Large Plan: 
(1) It has assets in excess of $50 million; 
(2) Fiduciaries of the Large Plan who are independent of Bank of America are, prior to any cross-trade transactions,
fully informed of the cross-trade technique and provide advance written approval of such transactions. Within 45
days of the completion of the Large Plan's portfolio restructuring program, such fiduciaries shall be fully appraised
in writing of the transaction results. However, if such program takes longer than three months to complete, interim
reports of the transaction results will be made within 30 days of the end of each three month period. 
(3) Such Large Plan transactions occur only in situations where Bank of America has been authorized to restructure
all or a portion of the Large Plan's portfolio into an Index or Model-Driven Fund (including a separate account based
on an index or computer model) or to act as a ``trading adviser'' in carrying out a Large Plan-initiated liquidation
or restructuring of its equity portfolio; and 
(f) Bank of America receives no additional direct or indirect compensation as a result of the cross-trade transaction.

(g) Prior to any proposed cross-trading by a Fund, Bank of America provides to each employee benefit plan which invests
in a Fund information which describes the existence of the cross-trading program, the ``triggering events'' which
will create cross-trade opportunities, the pricing mechanism that will be utilized for stocks purchased or sold
by the Funds, and the allocation methods and other procedures which will be implemented by Bank of America for its cross-trading
practices. Any such employee benefit plan which subsequently invests in a Fund shall be provided the same information
prior to or immediately after the plan's initial investment in a Fund. 


Part II_Exemption for the Acquisition, Holding and Disposition of BAC Stock 


The restrictions of sections 406(a)(1)(D), 406(b)(1) and (b)(2) of the Act, and the sanctions resulting from the
application of section 4975 of the Code by reason of section 4975(c)(1)(D) and (E) of the Code, shall not apply to the
acquisition, holding or disposition of the common stock of BAC by Index or Model-Driven Funds, if the following conditions
and the General Conditions of Part III are met:

<PARENT> FR940621-2-00052 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(a) The acquisition or disposition of the BAC stock is for the sole purpose of maintaining strict quantitative conformity
with the relevant index upon which the Index or Model-Driven Fund is based; 

(b) All acquisitions and dispositions, other than through cross-trade transactions meeting the conditions of Part
I, will comply with Rule 10b-18 of the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the limitations regarding
the price paid or received for such stock;

constitute no more than the greater of: (1) 10 percent of the stock's average daily trading volume for the previous
five days; or (2) 10 percent of the stock's trading volume on the date of the transaction; 

(d) If the necessary number of shares of BAC stock cannot be acquired within 10 business days from the date of the event
which causes the particular Index or Model-Driven Fund(s) to require BAC stock, Bank of America will appoint a fiduciary
which is independent of Bank of America and its affiliates to design acquisition procedures and monitor Bank of America's
compliance with such procedures; 

(e) All purchases and sales of BAC stock, other than cross-trades meeting the conditions of Part I, will be executed
on the national exchange on which BAC stock is primarily traded; 

(f) No transactions will involve purchases from, or sales to, Bank of America or any affiliate, officer, director
or employee of Bank of America or any party in interest with respect to a plan which has invested in an Index or Model-Driven
Fund. This requirement does not preclude purchases and sales of BAC stock in cross-trade transactions meeting the
conditions of Part I; 

(g) No more than five (5) percent of the total amount of BAC stock issued and outstanding at any time shall be held in the
aggregate by the Index and Model-Driven Funds; 

(h) BAC stock shall constitute no more than two percent of the value of any independent third-party index on which the
investments of an Index or Model-Driven Fund are based; 

(i) A plan fiduciary independent of Bank of America authorizes the investment of such plan's assets in an Index or Model-Driven
Fund which purchases and/or holds BAC stock; and 

(j) A fiduciary independent of Bank of America and its affiliates will direct the voting of the BAC stock held by an Index
or Model-Driven Fund on any matter in which shareholders of BAC stock are required or permitted to vote. 



Part III_General Conditions

(b)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection (b) and notwithstanding any provisions of subsections
(a)(2) and (b) of section 504 of the Act, the records referred to in subsection (a) of this Part are available at their
customary location for examination during normal business hours by_ 

(A) Any duly authorized employee or representative of the Department of Labor or the Internal Revenue Service,

(D) Any participant or beneficiary of any plan participating in an Index or Model-Driven Fund, or any duly authorized

(2) None of the persons described in subparagraphs (B) through (D) of this subsection (b) shall be authorized to examine

exemption, refer to the notice of proposed exemption published on April 22, 1994 at 59 FR 19255.





WRITTEN COMMENTS: 

The Department received one written comment and no requests for a hearing. The written comment was submitted on behalf
of the Bank of America National Trust and Savings Association (the Applicant), and it addresses two points which are
summarized as follows: 



1. Section 6 in the summary of facts and representations in the notice of proposed exemption (the Summary) commences
with the following statement: ``The Bank proposes to take advantage of opportunities to direct the cross-trading
of securities directly between the Funds, or directly with other client accounts for which the Bank is the investment
manager, or with mutual funds or institutional accounts for which the Bank is the investment advisor.'' However,
the Applicant points out that the proposed exemption does not provide exemptive relief as broad as that reflected
in the statement. 

The Department notes that the appearance of the aforementioned statement in the Summary is an error. The Applicant
did not request, and the Department did not propose, exemptive relief for the Funds' cross-trade transactions with
``other client accounts for which the Bank is the investment manager, or with mutual funds or institutional accounts
for which the Bank is the investment advisor.'' Despite the erroneous appearance of the aforementioned statement
in the Summary, the Department notes that the operative language of the proposed exemption included only transactions
between Index Funds and/or Model Driven Funds (the Funds), and between the Funds and Large Plans (as defined in Part
I, Section (e) of the proposed exemption), including the purchase and sale of common stock of BAC. Like the proposed
exemption, the final exemption is restricted to those transactions defined and identified in Parts I through IV of
the exemption, which do not include transactions with ``other client accounts for which the Bank is the investment
manager, or with mutual funds or institutional accounts for which the Bank is the investment advisor.'' 

2. The Applicant notes a typographical error in Section 9 of the Summary: The reference to rule 10b-189, in the
second paragraph, line 10, should read as a reference to SEC Rule 10b-18.




ADDITIONS: 

In this final exemption the Department has included a new condition (g) in Part I_Exemption for Cross-Trading Between
Certain Funds, which was inadvertently omitted from the notice of proposed exemption. Condition (g) requires the
Bank of America to provide certain information regarding its cross-trading program to employee benefit plans which
invest in the Funds. 



After consideration of the entire record, including the Applicant's comment, the Department has determined to grant
the exemption.

General Information 


The attention of interested persons is directed to the following: 
(1) The fact that a transaction is the subject of an exemption under section 408(a) of the Act and/or section 4975(c)(2)
of the Code does not relieve a fiduciary or other party in interest or disqualified person from certain other provisions
to which the exemptions does not apply and the general fiduciary responsibility provisions of section 404 of the Act,
which among other things require a fiduciary to discharge his duties respecting the plan solely in the interest of
the participants and beneficiaries of the plan and in a prudent fashion in accordance with section 404(a)(1)(B) of
the Act; nor does it affect the requirement of section 401(a) of the Code that the plan must operate for the exclusive
benefit of the employees of the employer maintaining the plan and their beneficiaries; 
(2) These exemptions are supplemental to and not in derogation of, any other provisions of the Act and/or the Code,
including statutory or administrative exemptions and transactional rules. Furthermore, the fact that a transaction
is subject to an administrative or statutory exemption is not dispositive of whether the transaction is in fact a prohibited
transaction; and 
(3) The availability of these exemptions is subject to the express condition that the material facts and representations
contained in each application are true and complete and accurately describe all material terms of the transaction
which is the subject of the exemption. In the case of continuing exemption transactions, if any of the material facts
or representations described in the application change after the exemption is granted, the exemption will cease
to apply as of the date of such change. In the event of any such change, application for a new exemption may be made to the
Department.

Located in New York, NY 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Pension and Welfare Benefits Administration. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Grant of individual exemption to modify and replace prohibited transaction exemption (PTE) 92-77 involving
Shearson Lehman Brothers, Inc. (Shearson Lehman). 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document contains an individual exemption which supersedes PTE 92-77 (57 FR 45833, October 5, 1992).

1

 This exemption permits the replacement of Shearson Lehman with an entity known as ``Smith Barney Inc.''

2

 It also allows SBI to adopt a daily-traded collective investment fund (the GIC Fund) for Plans investing in the Consulting
Group Capital Markets Funds (the Trust). The exemption provides conditional relief that is identical to that provided
by PTE 92-77 and it will affect participants and beneficiaries of, and fiduciaries with respect to, Plans participating
in the Trust. 





</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On March 29, 1994, the Department of Labor (the Department) published a notice of proposed exemption (the Notice)
in the 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 14680) that would replace PTE 92-77. PTE 92-77 provides an exemption from certain prohibited transaction
restrictions of section 406 of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (the Act) and from the sanctions
resulting from the application of section 4975 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the Code), as amended, by reason
of section 4975(c)(1) of the Code. The proposed exemption was requested in an application filed by SBI pursuant to
section 408(a) of the Act and section 4975(c)(2) of the Code, and in accordance with the procedures (the Procedures)
set forth in 29 CFR Part 2570, Subpart B (55 FR 32836, August 10, 1990). Effective December 31, 1978, section 102 of Reorganization
Plan No. 4 of 1978 (43 FR 47713, October 17, 1978) transferred the authority of the Secretary of the Treasury to issue
exemptions of the type requested to the Secretary of Labor. Accordingly, this replacement exemption is being issued
solely by the Department. 


The Notice gave interested persons an opportunity to comment on the proposed exemption and to request a public hearing.
The only written comments submitted to the Department during the comment period were made by SBI. These comments expressed
SBI's substantive concerns about the Notice and offered suggestions for clarifying certain language of the Notice.
Discussed below are SBI's comments and the Department's responses thereto. Also discussed is a comment made by the
Department. 


SBI's Comments 


SBI notes that there is an ambiguity regarding the effective date of the GIC Fund. SBI represents that the Notice provides
in the last paragraph under the heading ``Supplementary Information,'' that with respect to transactions involving
the GIC Fund, the exemption ``would become effective as of the date of the grant of the notice of pendency.'' However,
under the captions 

Effective Dates

 and 

Dates

, SBI explains that the Notice states that the exemption will be effective ``upon its grant,'' or ``as of the date the
grant notice is published.'' Because it was the intention of the parties that the effective date for transactions
involving the GIC Fund would be March 29, 1994, the date of publication of the Notice in the 

Federal Register

, SBI requests that the Department make the exemption retroactive to this date for the GIC Fund. 
The Department has considered SBI's comment and has made the requested modification. 
SBI wishes to modify the exemption in order that it may offer the GIC Fund to both fiduciary-directed Plans as well as
Plans providing for participant-directed investments (the Section 404(c) Plans). The Department believes this
comment has merit and that it would be potentially beneficial to participants and beneficiaries since it provides
different types of Plans participating in the TRAK Program with the opportunity to invest in the GIC Fund. 
SBI explains that in the preamble to the Notice there is a statement to the effect that it will ``describe the GIC Fund
in a prospectus (the Prospectus) and promotional materials that will be furnished to Section 404(c) Plan participants.''
SBI represents that interests in the GIC Fund are not subject to the registration and Prospectus delivery requirements
of the Securities Act of 1933. Also, SBI points out that the conditions of PTE 92-77 require it to deliver copies
of the Trust Prospectus only to the Plan administrator and not to the individual participants. Because it has no practical
means of delivering Prospectuses or other disclosures to participants, SBI indicates that the responsibility for
providing these materials to participants rests with the Plan administrator. In this regard, SBI represents that
the disclosure information it will make available to all Plans proposing to invest in the GIC Fund will include copies
of the Trust Prospectus and a separate description of the GIC Fund's investment objectives, policies and processes.
SBI explains that its description of the GIC Fund will be designed to provide a participant with sufficient information
in order that the participant can make an informed investment decision. 
The Department concurs with these comments. 
In addition to principal comments discussed above, SBI has made certain technical clarifications and updates to
the Notice in the following areas: 
(1) 

General.
a. Redesignations. 

SBI explains that effective December 31, 1993, Primerica Corporation changed its name to ``The Travelers Inc.''
and that effective May 9, 1994, the ``Trust for TRAK Investments'' was renamed ``Consulting Group Capital Markets
Funds.'' Also effective June 1, 1994, ``Smith Barney Shearson Inc.'' was renamed ``Smith Barney Inc.''

(2) 

Supplementary Information. 
a. Asset Sale Transaction. 

SBI explains that the transaction by which Smith Barney Harris Upham & Company, Inc. (Smith Barney) acquired
Shearson Lehman and its Asset Management Divisions was an asset sale and not a merger. Accordingly, SBI suggests that
the fourth sentence of the third paragraph under the heading ``Supplementary Information,'' read as follows: ``As
a result of the transaction, most of the assets and business of the Shearson divisions were transferred to Smith Barney,
which was renamed `Smith Barney Shearson Inc.''' 

b. 

Fees Paid to Transfer Agent. 

SBI represents that in the seventh paragraph under the heading ``Supplementary Information,'' the Notice states
that The Shareholder Services Group (TSSG), 
as transfer agent, will charge a fee of $8.50 to $9.50 per plan for its transfer agency services. While these are the
current expected fee levels, SBI notes that such fees may increase or decrease in the future. Because TSSG is no longer
an affiliate, SBI requests that the paragraph be amended to provide that TSSG as transfer agent will receive a reasonable
fee for its services rather than specifying a precise dollar amount.

General Conditions. 


a. Written Disclosures. 

Section II(k)(1)(F) of the General Conditions of the Notice states that SBI will provide copies of PTE 92-77
and documents pertaining to the proposed replacement exemption to each Plan participating in the TRAK Program. SBI
wishes to clarify that the ``documents pertaining to the proposed replacement exemption'' refer to copies of the
Notice and, when issued, the final exemption. 


The Department concurs with the above supplemental clarifications to the Notice that have been made by SBI and hereby
incorporates these changes, as well as the substantive changes also described above, by reference into the Notice
and, where applicable, into this final exemption. 




Department's Comment 




Section III of the Notice, which is captioned ``Definitions,'' provides several meanings of the term ``Independent
Plan Fiduciary'' in subparagraph (b). For purposes of the exemption, the term ``Independent Plan Fiduciary'' may
include a Plan administrator, a participant in a Keogh Plan, an individual covered under a self-directed IRA or a trustee
of a Title I Plan that does not permit participant-directed investments as contemplated under section 404(c) of the
Act. However, due to an oversight, the definition does not extend to a participant in a Section 404(c) Plan. Because
the TRAK Program is being marketed as an investment alternative to Section 404(c) Plans and the individual participant
of such Plan makes the decision on whether to invest therein, the Department has amended the definition of the term
``Independent Plan Fiduciary'' by providing a new subparagraph (b)(5) which includes a Section 404(c) Plan participant.

Accordingly, after consideration of the entire exemption record, including the written comments, the Department
has determined to grant the replacement exemption as modified herein. 


General Information 



The attention of interested persons is directed to the following: 
(1) The fact that a transaction is the subject of an exemption under section 408(a) of the Act and section 4975(c)(2)
of the Code does not relieve a fiduciary or other party in interest or disqualified person from certain other provisions
of the Act and the Code, including any prohibited transaction provisions to which the exemption does not apply and
the general fiduciary responsibility provisions of section 404 of the Act, which require, among other things, a fiduciary
to discharge his or her duties respecting the plan solely in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries of
the plan and in a prudent fashion in accordance with section 404(a)(1)(B) of the Act; nor does it affect the requirements
of section 401(a) of the Code that the plan operate for the exclusive benefit of the employees of the employer maintaining
the plan and their beneficiaries; 

(2) In accordance with section 408(a) of the Act and 
section 4975(c)(2) of the Code, the Department has found that the exemption is administratively feasible, in the
interest of the Plans and their participants and beneficiaries and protective of the rights of participants and beneficiaries
of the Plans; and 

(3) The exemption is supplemental to, and not in derogation of, any other provisions of the Act and the Code, including
statutory or administrative exemptions. Furthermore, the fact that a transaction is subject to an administrative
or statutory exemption is not dispositive of whether the transaction is in fact a prohibited transaction. 


(4) In addition to transactions involving the GIC Fund, the exemption is applicable to the transactions previously
described in PTE 92-77 only if the conditions specified therein are met. 


Exemption 



Under the authority of section 408(a) of the Act and 
section 4975(c)(2) of the Code and in accordance with the Procedures cited above, the Department hereby replaces

PTE 92-77 as follows: 



Section I. Covered Transactions 



(a) The restrictions of section 406(a) of the Act and the sanctions resulting from the application of section 4975
of the Code, by reason of section 4975(c)(1) (A) through (D) of the Code, shall not apply to the purchase or redemption
of shares by Plans in the SBI-established Trust in connection with such Plans' participation in the TRAK Personalized
Investment Advisory Service. 

(b) The restrictions of section 406(b) of the Act and the sanctions resulting from the application of section 4975
of the Code by reason of section 4975(c)(1) (E) and (F) of the Code, shall not apply to the provision, by the Consulting
Group, of investment advisory services to an Independent Plan Fiduciary of a participating Plan which may result
in such fiduciary's selection of a Portfolio in the TRAK Program for the investment of Plan assets. 


The exemption is subject to the following conditions that are set forth in Section II. 



Section II. General Conditions 



(a) The participation of Plans in the TRAK Program will be approved by an Independent Plan Fiduciary. For purposes
of this requirement, an employee, officer or director of SBI and/or its affiliates covered by an IRA not subject to
Title I of the Act will be considered an Independent Plan Fiduciary with respect to such IRA. 

(b) The total fees paid to the Consulting Group and its affiliates will constitute no more than reasonable compensation.


(c) No Plan will pay a fee or commission by reason of the acquisition or redemption of shares in the Trust. 

(d) The terms of each purchase or redemption of Trust shares shall remain at least as favorable to an investing Plan
as those obtainable in an arm's length transaction with an unrelated party. 

(e) The Consulting Group will provide written documentation to an Independent Plan Fiduciary of its recommendations
or evaluations based upon objective criteria.

<USDEPT>NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION</USDEPT>





Boston Edison Co.; Pilgrim Nuclear Power Station; Issuance of Environmental Assessment and Finding of No Significant
Impact


The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an amendment to Facility Operating
License No. DPR-35, issued to the Boston Edison Company (BECo, or the licensee), for operation of the Pilgrim
Nuclear Power Station, located in Plymouth, Massachusetts.


Identification of Proposed Action


The amendment would consist of changes to the Technical Specifications (TSs) and would authorize an increase of the
storage capacity of the spent fuel pool (SFP) from 2320 fuel assemblies to 3859 fuel assemblies.
The NRC staff has prepared an Environmental Assessment of the Proposed Action.


Summary of Environmental Assessment


The ``Final Generic Environmental Impact Statement (FGEIS) on Handling and Storage of Spent Light Water Power Reactor
Fuel'' (NUREG-0575), Volumes 1-3, concluded that the environmental impact of interim storage of spent
fuel was negligible and the cost of the various alternatives reflects the advantage of continued generation of nuclear
power with the accompanying spent fuel storage. Because of the differences in design, the FGEIS recommended evaluating
SFP expansions on a case-by-case basis.
For Pilgrim, the expansion of the storage capacity of the SFP will not create any significant additional radiological
effects or nonradiological environmental impacts.
The additional whole body dose that might be received by an individual at the site boundary and the estimated dose to
the population within an 80 kilometer radius is believed to be too small to have any significance when compared to the
fluctuations in the annual dose this population receives from exposure to background radiation. The occupational
radiation dose for the proposed operation of the expanded SFP is estimated to be extremely small compared to the total
annual occupational radiation exposure for this facility.
The only nonradiological impact affected by the SFP expansion is the waste heat rejected. The total increase in heat
load rejected to the environment will be small in comparison to the amount of total heat currently being released.
There is no significant environmental impact attributed to the waste heat from the plant due to this very small increase.


Finding of no Significant Impact


The staff has reviewed the proposed SFP expansion to the facility relative to the requirements set forth in 10 CFR Part
51. Based on this assessment, the NRC staff concludes that there are no significant radiological or nonradiological
impacts associated with the proposed action and that the issuance of the proposed amendment to the license will have
no significant impact on the quality of the human environment. Therefore, pursuant to 10 CFR 51.31, no environmental
impact statement needs to be prepared for this action.
For further details with respect to this action, see (1) the application for amendment to the TSs dated February 11,
1993, (2) the FGEIS on Handling and Storage of Spent Light Water Power Reactor Fuel (NUREG-0575), (3) the Final
Environmental Statement for the Pilgrim Nuclear Power Station, dated May 1972, and (4) the Environmental Assessment
dated June 15, 1994.
These documents are available for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, 2120 L Street, NW.,
Washington, DC 20555, and at the local public document room located at Plymouth Public Library, 11 North Street, Plymouth,
Massachusetts 02360.

<DOCTITLE>Duke Power Co.; Consideration of Issuance of Amendments to Facility Operating Licenses, Proposed No Significant
Hazards Consideration Determination, and Opportunity for a Hearing</DOCTITLE>







The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of amendments to Facility Operating
License No. NPF-9 and Facility Operating License No. NPF-17 issued to Duke Power Company (the licensee)
for operation of the McGuire Nuclear Station, Units 1 and 2, located in Mecklenberg County, North Carolina.

The proposed amendments would change the Technical Specifications to increase Main Steam and Pressurizer Code Safety
Valve Setpoint Tolerances.

Before issuance of the proposed license amendment, the Commission will have made findings required by the Atomic
Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act) and the Commission's regulations.

The Commission has made a proposed determination that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.
Under the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facility in accordance with the
proposed amendment would not (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee
has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below:




The proposed amendment will not result in a significant increase in the probability or consequences of any previously
analyzed accident. The valve lift setting is challenged only after a transient has been initiated and is not a contributor
to the probability of any transient or accident. The transients which involve pressure increases which would potentially
challenge the safety valves have been analyzed to determine the consequences of delayed or premature valve actuation
at the extremes of the new setpoint tolerances. These analyses show that all applicable acceptance criteria are met
using the wider tolerances.

The proposed amendment will not result in the creation of any new accident not previously evaluated. As noted above,
the setpoint tolerance only affects the time at which the safety valve opens following or during a transient, and is
not a contributor to the probability of an accident.

The proposed amendment will not result in a significant decrease in a margin of safety. The limiting transient in each
accident category has been analyzed to determine the affect of the change in lift setpoint tolerance on the transient.
In each case, the results of the analyses met all applicable criteria.

Bases on the above, it is conclude that no significant hazard considerations exist.




The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

The Commission is seeking public comments on this proposed determination. Any comments received within 30 days after
the date of publication of this notice will be considered in making any final determination.

Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendment until the expiration of the 30-day notice period. However,
should circumstances change during the notice period such that failure to act in a timely way would result, for example,
in derating or shutdown of the facility, the Commission may issue the license amendment before the expiration of the
30-day notice period, provided that its final determination is that the amendment involves no significant hazards
consideration. The final determination will consider all public and State comments received. Should the Commission
take this action, it will publish in the 

Federal Register

 a notice of issuance and provide for opportunity for a hearing after issuance. The Commission expects that the need
to take this action will occur very infrequently.

Written comments may be submitted by mail to the Rules Review and Directives Branch, Division of Freedom of Information
and Publications Services, Office of Administration, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555,
and should cite the publication date and page number of this 

Federal Register

 notice. Written comments may also be delivered to Room 6D22, Two White Flint North, 11555 Rockville Pike, Rockville,
Maryland, from 7:30 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. Federal workdays. Copies of written comments received may be examined at the
NRC Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555.

The filing of requests for hearing and petitions for leave to intervene is discussed below.

By July 21, 1994, the licensee may file a request for a hearing with respect to issuance of the amendment to the subject
facility operating license and any person whose interest may be affected by this proceeding and who wishes to participate
as a party in the proceeding must file a written request for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene. Requests
for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's ``Rules of Practice
for Domestic Licensing Proceedings'' in 10 CFR Part 2. Interested persons should consult a current copy of 10 CFR 2.714
which is available at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington,
DC 20555 and at a local public document room located at Atkins Library, University of North Carolina, Charlotte (UNCC
Station), North Carolina 28223. If a request for a hearing or petition for leave to intervene is filed by the above date,
the Commission or an Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, designated by the Commission or by the Chairman of the Atomic
Safety and Licensing Board Panel, will rule on the request and/or petition; and the Secretary or the designated Atomic
Safety and Licensing Board will issue a notice of hearing or an appropriate order. As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition
for leave to intervene shall set forth with particularity the interest of the petitioner in the proceeding, and how
that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding. The petition should specifically explain the reasons
why intervention should be permitted with particular reference to the following factors: (1) The nature of the petitioner's
right under the Act to be made party to the proceeding; (2) the nature and extent of the petitioner's property, financial,
or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect of any order which may be entered in the proceeding
on the petitioner's interest. The petition should also identify the specific aspect(s) of the subject matter of the
proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Any person who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or
who has been admitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting leave of the Board up to 15 days prior to the
first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended petition must satisfy the specificity
requirements described above.

Not later than 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file
a supplement to the petition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions which are sought to be litigated
in the matter. Each contention must consist of a specific statement of the issue of law or fact to be raised or controverted.
In addition, the petitioner shall provide a brief explanation of the bases of the contention and a concise statement
of the alleged facts or expert opinion which support the contention and on which the petitioner intends to rely in proving
the contention at the hearing. The petitioner must also provide references to those specific sources and documents
of which the petitioner is aware and on which the petitioner intends to rely to establish those facts or expert opinion.
Petitioner must provide sufficient information to show that a genuine dispute exists with the applicant on a material
issue of law or fact. Contentions shall be limited to matters within the scope of the amendment under consideration.
The contention must be one which, if proven, would entitle the petitioner to relief. A petitioner who fails to file
such a supplement which satisfies these requirements with respect to at least one contention will not be permitted
to participate as a party.

Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subject to any limitations in the order granting leave
to intervene, and have the opportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, including the opportunity
to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses.

If a hearing is requested, the Commission will make a final determination on the issue of no significant hazards consideration.
The final determination will serve to decide when the hearing is held.

If the final determination is that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration, the Commission
may issue the amendment and make it immediately effective, notwithstanding the request for a hearing. Any hearing
held would take place after issuance of the amendment.

If the final determination is that the amendment request involves a significant hazards consideration, any hearing
held would take place before the issuance of any amendment. A request for a hearing or a petition for leave to intervene
must be filed with the Secretary of the Commission, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, Attention:
Docketing and Services Branch, or may be delivered to the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building,
2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555, by the above date. Where petitions are filed during the last 10 days of the
notice period, it is requested that the petitioner promptly so inform the Commission by a toll-free telephone call
to Western Union at 1-(800) 248-5100 (in Missouri 1-(800) 342-6700). The Western Union operator
should be given Datagram Identification Number N1023 and the following message addressed to David B. Matthews petitioner's
name and telephone number, date petition was mailed, plant name, and publication date and page number of this 

Federal Register

 notice. A copy of the petition should also be sent to the Office of the General Counsel, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,
Washington, DC 20555, and to Mr. Albert Carr, Duke Power Company, 422 South Church Street, Charlotte, North Carolina
28242, attorney for the licensee.
Nontimely filings of petitions for leave to intervene, amended petitions, supplemental petitions and/or requests
for hearing will not be entertained absent a determination by the Commission, the presiding officer or the presiding
Atomic Safety and Licensing Board that the petition and/or request should be granted based upon a balancing of the
factors specified in 10 CFR 2.714(a)(1)(i)-(v) and 2.714(d).

<DOCTITLE>Policy Statement on Alternative Dispute Resolution Within OPM</DOCTITLE>



The Administrative Dispute Resolution Act, Public Law 101-552, encourages Federal agencies to use alternative
dispute resolution (ADR) methods whenever possible. ADR proceedings offer constructive approaches for resolving
disputes, while avoiding the expense and delay of formal adversarial and judicial proceedings. ADR methods encompass
a range of approaches, including mediation, minitrials, fact finding, and arbitration, among others. OPM is committed
to the concepts of cooperative, interest-based problem solving, which are basic to ADR approaches.

OPM officials should examine those areas in which disputes routinely arise as a result of ongoing OPM program and administrative
activities. OPM organizations should then select and tailor ADR approaches to these specific functional and program
areas. The type, nature, and number of disputes will influence the selection and implementation of an ADR process
suitable for that particular organizational setting. The Associate Director for Administration has been designated
as the Agency Dispute Resolution (ADR) Specialist. The Agency Dispute Resolution Specialist can provide information
on resources and training to assist offices to design and implement an ADR process for their particular category of
disputes.

ADR approaches are not meant to supersede collective bargaining agreements or other statutory, regulatory, or contractual
dispute resolution procedures. ADR processes are intended to supplement rather than replace existing formal procedures.
Participation in an ADR process is voluntary for all parties to a dispute including OPM and a decision to use ADR calls
for informed judgement. ADR methods are not suitable for all types of disputes and may not be appropriate in those cases
where:

 A precedent-setting decision is needed,

 An important policy question is involved,

 The decision would have a significant effect on non-parties to the dispute, or

 A full public record of the proceeding is important.

Absent these conditions, it should be presumed to be in OPM's best interest to participate in an ADR process if other
parties to the dispute also agree. Senior officials should review non-participation decisions to assure that appropriate
reasons exist to offset the expected benefits and cost savings which accrue to the Agency through participation.

Consensual methods of dispute resolution represent a new and effective approach to conflict management. ADR approaches
also promote communication and understanding between the disputants by emphasizing the common interest all parties
have in a fair, speedy and cost effective solution. By avoiding the time and cost associated with formal adversarial
proceedings, ADR allows OPM to redirect and focus more resources on productive activities.

Self-Regulatory Organizations; Cincinnati Stock Exchange, Inc.; Notice of Filing of Proposed Rule Change Concerning
Chinese Wall Procedures for Designated Dealers


June 15, 1994.


Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby given that
on March 17, 1994, the Cincinnati Stock Exchange, Incorporated (``CSE or Exchange'') filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II and III below, which Items
have been prepared by the CSE. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change
from interested persons.


I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change


The Cincinnati Stock Exchange, Inc. proposes to adopt Chinese Wall procedures relating to the activity of the Exchange's
Designated Dealers (``specialists''). The text of the proposal follows; the proposed additions are italicized.


The Cincinnati Stock Exchange, Incorporated


Chapter V
Supervision


Rule 5.5. Chinese Wall Procedures




(a) An Exchange Designated Dealer (``specialist'') must establish a functional separation (``Chinese Wall'')
between the specialist operation and any associated or affiliated persons as appropriate to its operation and further
establish, maintain and enforce written procedures reasonably designed to prevent the misuse of material, non-public
information, which includes review of employee and proprietary trading, memorialization and documentation of
procedures, substantive supervision of inter-departmental communications by the Exchange specialist firm's
Compliance Department and procedures concerning proprietary trading when the firm is in possession of material,
non-public information. The Exchange specialist firm must obtain the prior written approval of the Exchange that
it has complied with the requirements above in establishing functional separation as appropriate to the operation
and that it has established proper compliance and audit procedures to ensure the maintenance of the functional separation.
A copy of these Chinese Wall procedures, and any amendments thereto, must be filed with the Exchange's Surveillance
Department.




(b) The following are the minimum procedural and maintenance requirements:




(1) The associate or affiliated person can have no influence on specific specialist trading decisions.




(2) Material, non-public corporate or market information obtained by the associated or affiliated person from the
issuer may not be made available to the specialist.




(3) Clearing and margin financing information regarding the specialist may be routed only to employees engaged in
such work and managerial employees engaged in overseeing operations of the affiliated or associated persons and
specialist entities.




(c) Information that may be made available to others:




(1) A broker affiliated with an associated or affiliated person may make available to the specialist only the market
information that he would make available to an unaffiliated specialist in the normal course of his trading and ``market
probing'' activity.




(2) A specialist may make known to a broker affiliated with an affiliated or associated person only the information
about market conditions in specialty stocks that he would make available in the normal course of specializing to any
other broker and in the same manner as it would make such information available to any other broker.




(3) An affiliated or associated person can popularize a specialty stock provided it makes adequate disclosure about
the existence of possible conflicts of interest.




(d) A specialist who becomes privy to material, non-public information must communicate that fact promptly to his
firm's compliance officer or other designated official. The specialist shall seek guidance from the compliance
officer or other designated official as to what procedures the specialist should follow after receipt of such information
or such other action that should be taken. Appropriate records shall be maintained by the compliance officer or other
designated official. The record should include a summary of the information received by the specialist and a description
of the action taken by the compliance officer or other designated official.




(e) The Exchange has established the following procedures to monitor compliance with this rule:




(1) Examination of the Chinese Wall procedures established by Exchange specialist firms.




(2) Surveillance of proprietary trades effected by an affiliated or associate person and its affiliated or associated
specialist (``designated dealer'') firm.




Accordingly, the Exchange will conduct periodic examinations of the specialist firm's Chinese Wall procedures
to ensure that a functional separation between the associated or affiliated person and the specialist has been created
and thereafter maintained. The Exchange will also monitor the trading activities of affiliated or associated persons
and affiliated or associated specialists in the specialist firms' specialty stocks in order to monitor the possible
trading while in possession of material, non-public information through the periodic review of trade and comparison
reports generated by the Exchange.




II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change


In its filing with the Commission, the CSE included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed
rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be
examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The CSE has prepared summaries, set forth in sections (A), (B), and
(C) below, of the most significant parts of such statements.


A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change


(1) Purpose


The purpose of the proposed new rule is to require specialists to establish the appropriate functional separation
to their operations while maintaining and enforcing written procedures reasonably designed to prevent the misuse
of material, non-public information by employee, affiliated individual and proprietary accounts. The proposed
rule further requires that a copy of such procedures be provided to the Exchange for review and approval, and sets forth
specific guidelines for designated dealers to follow in adopting, maintaining and enforcing Chinese Wall procedures.


(2) Basis


The proposed rule change is consistent with section 6(b) of the Act in general and furthers the objectives of section
6(b)(5) in particular in that it promotes just and equitable principals of trade and protects investors and the public
interest.


B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition


The CSE does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any inappropriate burden on competition.


C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants
or Others


No written comments were solicited or received with respect to the proposed rule change.


III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action


Within 35 days of the date of publication of this notice in the 

Federal Register

 or within such longer period (i) as the Commission may designate up to 90 days of such date if it finds such longer period
to be appropriate and publishes its reasons for so finding or (ii) as to which the self-regulatory organization consents,
the Commission will:
(A) by order approve such proposed rule change, or
(B) institute proceedings to determine whether the proposed rule change should be disapproved.


IV. Solicitation of Comments


Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying in the Commission's

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Notice of Filing of Proposed Rule Change by The National Association of Securities
Dealers, Inc. to Eliminate Access Market Maker Procedures From Schedule D to the NASD By-Laws</DOCTITLE>


June 15, 1994.



Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1) (``Act''), notice is hereby
given that on May 25, 1994, the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (``NASD'' or ``Association'') filed
with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'' or ``SEC'') the proposed rule change as described in
Items I, II, and III below, which Items have been prepared by the NASD. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit
comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons.



I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change



Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Act, the NASD hereby files a proposed rule change to delete Part IX of Schedule D
to the NASD By-Laws which contains procedures for market maker access to The Nasdaq Stock market (``Nasdaq'') by certain
broker-dealers that do not receive Level 3 Nasdaq Workstation service (``Level 3 service''). Below is the text of
the proposed rule change; deleted language is bracketed.



[Part IX]


[Procedures for Access to the NASDAQ System by Non-NASDAQ Market Makers]



[These procedures permit a registered NASDAQ market maker, upon approval by the Corporation, to enter quotations
into the NASDAQ System on behalf of another market maker who does not subscribe to Level 3 NASDAQ Service.]



[A. Definitions]



[1. An ``access market maker'' is a member of the Association who does not subscribe to Level 3 NASDAQ service, but is
or intends to be a market maker in a security for which quotations are displayed on the NASDAQ System.]

[2. An ``entering subscriber'' is a registered NASDAQ market maker who has entered into an arrangement with an access
market maker to enter quotations in the NASDAQ System on behalf of such access market maker.]

[B. The entering subscriber may enter quotations in the NASDAQ System on behalf of an access market maker only upon
submission and approval by the Association of the following:]

[1. A fully executed copy of the access arrangement agreement which shall contain all agreements and conditions concerning
the access arrangement.]

[2. An application for registration as an access market maker for each security.]

[C. Access market makers and entering subscribers shall be limited to one access arrangement in each security.]

[D. Quotations displayed by the entering subscriber on behalf of the access market maker shall be accompanied by the
entering subscriber's market maker identifier and a special symbol designating that an access arrangement exists.
The identity of the access market maker must be made available by the entering subscriber upon request.]

[E. All transactions resulting from the display of quotations in the NASDAQ System by the entering subscriber shall
be executed by the entering subscriber and he shall be responsible for the transaction. Both the entering subscriber
and the access market maker shall be subject to and be responsible for compliance with the provisions of Schedule D.]

[F. Access market makers shall pay to the Corporation an access fee of $70 per month for the first security and $52.50
per month for each additional security which is subject to an approved access arrangement.]



II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



In its filing with the Commission, the NASD included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed
rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be
examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The NASD has prepared summaries, set forth in sections (A), (B),
and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.



A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



The purpose of the proposed rule change is to eliminate an outmoded procedure by which certain NASD member firms could
participate as market makers in Nasdaq without procuring the necessary computer equipment and subscribing to Level
3 service. Currently, Part IX of Schedule D permits a member firm that does not receive Level 3 service to qualify as
an ``access market maker'' by entering into a suitable agreement with another firm that is a Level 3 subscriber (``entering
subscriber''). After the NASD's approval of such an arrangement, the entering subscriber can input two-sided quotations
reflecting the dealer interest of the access market maker. These quotations would be displayed with the entering
subscriber's market maker identifier; a special indicator would also be displayed to inform other dealers that an
access arrangement existed with respect to the quotations displayed in the subject security. In this circumstance,
the entering subscriber assumed responsibility for executing trades at the displayed bid and offer. The entering
subscriber and access market maker were jointly responsible for compliance with the various market maker obligations
set forth in Part V of Schedule D to the NASD By-Laws.

In conjunction with defining the system requirements for Nasdaq's technology migration, the Nasdaq Stock Market,
Inc. (``NSMI'') staff analyzed the cost and feasibility of providing functionality for access market makers in the
new environment. The staff found that changes in market making practices in recent years had dramatically reduced
the use of the access market maker arrangement. The staff also found that no NASD member was currently utilizing this
access feature. Given the absence of interested firms and the lack of any regulatory purpose in preserving the access
market maker feature, it was determined that this feature did not warrant the expenditure of resources necessary
to provide this functionality in the new environment. The NASD also believes that it is preferable to limit market
maker participation to Level 3 service subscribers to ensure integrity of its audit trail file, including the ability
to fix responsibility at the source for every quotation entry and reported transaction.

The NASD believes that this proposed rule is consistent with Sections 15A(b)(6) and 15A(b)(11) of the Act. Section
15A(b)(6) requires that the Association's rules be designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices,
to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to foster cooperation and coordination with persons engaged in
regulating, clearing, and processing information with respect to, and facilitating transactions in securities.
Section 15A(b)(11) authorizes the Association to adopt rules governing the form and content of quotations disseminated
by member firms for the purposes of providing fair and informative quotations, preventing fictitious or misleading
quotations, and promoting orderly procedures for collecting and distributing quotation information.

The NASD submits that elimination of the access market maker feature is fully consistent with the foregoing statutory
provisions. Market makers in Nasdaq securities now will be required to subscribe to Level III service in order to enter
quotations into the Nasdaq system. This requirements will eliminate an extra step in the quotation process by which
an ``entering subscriber'' may act as an intermediary.



B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition



The NASD believes that the proposed rule change will not result in any burden on competition that is not necessary or
appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act, as amended.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Notice of Filing of Proposed Rule Change by Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc. to
Adopt Equity Floor Procedure Advice A-2, Stopping Orders</DOCTITLE>



June 15, 1994.




Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C.  78s(b)(1), notice
is hereby given that on November 2, 1993, the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Phlx'' or ``Exchange'') filed
with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'' or ``SEC``) the proposed rule change as described in
Items I, II and III below, which Items have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization. On June 1, 1994, the
Exchange submitted to the Commission Amendment No. 1 to the proposed rule change in order to narrow the scope of its
original filing, to revise certain language used therein and to request approval to amend its Minor Rule Violation
Enforcement and Reporting Plan (``Plan'').
 The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons.





I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change



The Phlx proposes to adopt Equity Floor Procedure Advice (``Advice'') A-2, Stopping Orders, which would require
that any order on the book that is stopped by the specialist be displayed at its price or better if not executed immediately
after being stopped. Moreover, the proposed advice would prohibit the specialist from trading for the specialist's
own account with any order that specialist stopped, while the specialist is in possession of an order at that price
or better. In this regard, the specialist must exercise due diligence to match the stopped order with the other order
pursuant to Phlx Rules 119 and 120.

Proposed Advice A-2(E) is followed by the designator ``(E)'' to identify it as an equity floor advice, applicable
only to the Exchange's equity floor. In this regard, the Exchange's Plan would be amended to include this Advice. Accordingly,
violations of proposed Advice A-2(E) would be subject to a fine schedule, which results in a $250 fine for the
first occurrence, a $500 fine for the second occurrence and a sanction discretionary with the Exchange's Business
Conduct Committee for any violations thereafter.



II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose
of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text
of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The self-regulatory organization has
prepared summaries, set forth in Sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.



A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



1. Purpose 



The Phlx proposed to adopt Advice A-2(E) to govern stopping orders on the equity trading floor. The purpose of
the proposal is to codify stopping policies into an advice as a ready reminder to the equity floor and also to establish
that minor violations may result in the issuance of pre-established fines. The advice is also intended to contribute
to the standardization of trading floor rules among the Intermarket Trading System (``ITS'') participant exchanges.

With respect to stopped orders on the book, the proposed text is consistent with the specialist's requirements to
engage in a course of dealings to assist in the maintenance of a fair and orderly market, pursuant to Phlx Rule 203. Specifically,
the first requirement is that a stopped order on the book must be displayed at its price or better if not executed immediately
after being stopped. The second requirement of this Advice prohibits a specialist from trading with a stopped order
for his own account, while in possession of another order at an equal or better price. Instead, the specialist would
be required to exercise due diligence to ``match'' the stopped order with the other order, consistent with Phlx Rule
218.



2. Statutory Basis



The proposed rule is consistent with Section 6 of the Act, in general, and, in particular, with Section 6(b)(5), in
that it is designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade and prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts
and practices, by furthering the purposes of Rule 203, which in turn, should foster a fair and orderly market in Exchange
traded securities.



B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition



The Phlx does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any inappropriate burden on competition.



C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants
or Others



No written comments were either solicited or received.



III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action



Within 35 days of the publication of this notice in the 

Federal Register

 or within such other period (i) as the Commission may designate up to 90 days of such date if it finds such longer period
to be appropriate and publishes its reasons for so finding or (ii) as to which the self-regulatory organization consents,
the Commission will:

(A) by order approve the proposed rule change, or

(B) institute proceedings to determine whether the proposed rule change should be disapproved.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Stock Clearing Corporation of Philadelphia; Notice of Filing and Immediate Effectiveness
of a Proposed Rule Change Adding a Residual Credit Transfer Feature to the Automated Customer Account Transfer Service</DOCTITLE>


June 14, 1994.



Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''),
 notice is hereby given that on May 5, 1994, the Stock Clearing Corporation of Philadelphia (``SCCP'') filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change (File No. SR-SCCP-94-01)
as described in Items I, II, and III below, which Items have been prepared primarily by SCCP. The Commission is publishing
this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons.





I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change



The proposed rule change will offer SCCP clearing members the ability to transfer through the Automated Customer
Account Transfer Service (``ACATS'') credit positions which accrue to an account after the account has been transferred
to another broker-dealer.


II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



In its filing with the Commission, SCCP included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule
change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined
at the places specified in Item IV below. SCCP has prepared summaries, set forth in sections (A), (B), and (C) below,
of the most significant aspects of such statements.


A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change




Residual credit processing is an enhancement to SCCP's ACATS program which allows an ACATS delivering member to initiate
through ACATS the transfer of residual credit positions for both cash and securities which have accrued to an account
after the account has been transferred to another broker-dealer. The current method for identifying and transferring
residual credits differs from firm to firm. Some firms have systems which automatically review transferred accounts
for the presence of residual positions. Other firms either review transferred accounts on a periodic basis or rely
on customer inquiries or claim letters from ACATS receiving firms. Currently, no matter what method a firm uses to
monitor transferred accounts, to transfer residual positions the delivering firm will issue a check or will transfer
securities outside of ACATS.


Transferring residual positions outside of ACATS may result in lost or improperly routed checks and securities and
increases the processing costs of transferring positions due to postage costs and other processing inefficiencies.
The ACATS residual credit processing will help to eliminate lost or improperly routed checks and securities by providing
an efficient and standardized automated method for the transfer of residual credits.


The procedures for transferring residual credits are the same as the procedures for transferring customer accounts
through ACATS with the following exceptions: (1) Only the delivering member may transfer residual credits through
ACATS, (2) the transfer request must be initiated in an automated form, and (3) the delivering member's input constitutes
both the request and the details of the residual credits.


Money settlement for residual credits will be processed along with the clearing member's other ACATS money settlement
obligations. In addition, to the extent that the residual securities are eligible for continuous net settlement,
ACATS residual credits will be netted along with a member's other CNS obligations. However, the ACATS receiving member
retains the ability to reject the residual credits or request adjustments.


The proposed rule change is consistent with Section 17A(b)(3)(F)
 of the Act in that it promotes the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of securities transactions and fosters
cooperation and coordination with persons engaged in the clearance and settlement of securities transactions by
providing an efficient and standardized automated method for the transfer of residual credits.




B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition




SCCP does not believe that the proposed change will impose any inappropriate burden on competition.


C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants
or Others




No written comments have been solicited or received.


III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action



The foregoing rule change has become effective on filing pursuant to Section 19(b)(3)(A)(iii)
 of the Act and pursuant to Rule 19b-4(e)(4)
 promulgated thereunder because the proposed rule change effects a change in an existing service that does not adversely
affect the safeguarding of securities or funds in the custody or control of SCCP or for which SCCP is responsible and
does not significantly affect the respective rights or obligations of SCCP or the clearing members using the service.
At any time within sixty days of the filing of this proposed rule change, the Commission may summarily abrogate such
rule change if it appears to the Commission that such action is necessary or appropriate in the public interest, for
the protection of investors, or otherwise in furtherance of the purposes of the Act.





IV. Solicitation of Comments




Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views, and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying in the Commission's
Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of such filing will also be available
for inspection and copying at the principal office of SCCP. All submissions should refer to File No. SR-SCCP-94-01
and should be submitted by July 12, 1994.

<DOCTITLE>Issuer Delisting; Notice of Application To Withdraw From Listing and Registration; (Advanced NMR Systems, Inc.,
Common Stock, $0.01 Par Value) File No. 1-7694</DOCTITLE>



June 14, 1994.



Advanced NMR Systems, Inc. (``Company'') has filed an application with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission''),
pursuant to Section 12(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'') and Rule 12d2-2(d) promulgated thereunder,
to withdraw the above specified security from listing and registration on the Pacific Stock Exchange, Inc. (``PSE'').

The reasons alleged in the application for withdrawing this security from listing and registration include the following:

According to the Exchange, the Board of Directors of the Company (the ``Board''), pursuant to lawfully delegated
authority, unanimously approved resolutions on January 14, 1994 to withdraw the Company's Common Stock from listing
on the PSE and the Boston Stock Exchange, Inc. (``BSE'') (a separate application for delisting was filed with the Commission
by the BSE on February 7, 1994). The decision of the Board was based upon the belief that the listing of the Common Stock
on the PSE was no longer beneficial to the Company, as the Company and its stockholders can achieve increased market
visibility through registration on the NASDAQ National Market System (``NMS''). At the end of 1993, the Company met
the NMS eligibility standards, and a listing thereon was approved by NASDAQ by letter dated February 2, 1993, a copy
of which is attached to the application as Exhibit 1. The Board believes that the Company will achieve greater investor
access through national trading of its shares, and will maintain access through the NMS to many of the same West Coast-based
investor markets that it currently has as a result of its association with the PSE. It is primarily due to this potential
redundancy that the Company seeks to delist its shares on the PSE.

Any interested person may, on or before July 6, 1994 submit by letter to the Secretary of the Securities and Exchange
Commission, 450 Fifth Street NW., Washington, DC 20549, facts bearing upon whether the application has been made
in accordance with the rules of the exchanges and what terms, if any, should be imposed by the Commission for the protection
of investors. The Commission, based on the information submitted to it, will issue an order granting the application
after the date mentioned above, unless the Commission determines to order a hearing on the matter.




For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

legal and accounting fees, and the cost of printing and mailing the proxy statements.

7. As of the date of the application, applicant had no shareholders, assets, or liabilities. Applicant is not a party
to any litigation or administrative proceeding. Applicant is not presently engaged in, nor does it propose to engage
in, any business activities other than those necessary for the winding up of its affairs.

<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Following is a summary of the application. The complete application is available for a fee from the Commission's Public
Reference Branch.



Applicants' Representations



1. National Home, a stock life insurance company organized under the laws of Missouri, is wholly-owned by Providian
Corporation, a publicly held insurance holding company. National Home is principally engaged in offering life insurance,
annuity contracts; and accident and health insurance and is admitted to do business in 40 states, the District of Columbia
and Puerto Rico.

2. The Separate Account was established by National Home as a separate account under Missouri law to fund the Contracts.
The Separate Account is registered as a unit investment trust under the 1940 Act. The Separate Account has eighteen
subaccounts, each of which invests solely in a corresponding portfolio (``Portfolio'') of one of seven open-end
management investment companies (``Funds''). The Funds are registered under the 1940 Act.

3. Shares of each Portfolio are purchased by National Home for the corresponding subaccount of the Separate Account
at net asset value. Shares of each Portfolio are also offered to other affiliated or unaffiliated separate accounts
of insurance companies offering variable annuity contracts or variable life insurance policies.

4. The Contract is a flexible premium payment contract that is intended to be used either in connection with a retirement
plan qualified under Section 401(a), 403(b), 408, and 457 of the Internal Revenue Code (``Qualified Contract'')
or by other purchasers (``Non-Qualified contract''). A Contract owner may allocate purchase payments and/or the
accumulation value to the general account of National Home and/or the subaccounts of the Separate Account. The Contract
owner may select among annuity payment options that include variable or fixed annuity options. Capital Values Securities
Corporation, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Providian Corporation, is the principal underwriter of the Contracts.

5. The minimum initial purchase payment for a Non-Qualified Contract is $5,000. A Qualified Contract may be purchased
with a minimum initial purchase payment of $2,000 or with $50 monthly investments pursuant to a systematic payment
plan.
6. The Contract is available in two forms, A Unit Contracts and B Units Contracts.
A Unit Contracts have a maximum front-end sales load of 5.75% deducted from each purchase payment. There are no withdrawal
or surrender charges for A Unit Contracts. For contracts offered in the future that are substantially similar in all
material respects to A Unit Contracts, the front-end sales load will not exceed 5.75% and there will be no surrender
charges.





B Unit Contracts have no front-end sales load deducted from purchase payments. Up to 10% of the Contract's accumulated
value as of the Contract date or, if more recent, the last Contract anniversary, can be withdrawn once per year without
a surrender charge. Additional withdrawals are subject to a contingent deferred sales load of 6%. The applicable
contingent deferred sales load decreases by 1% per year until after the sixth Contract year there is no contingent
deferred sales load. For contracts offered in the future that are substantially similar in all material respects
to B Unit Contracts, there will be no front-end sales load and the maximum surrender charge will be 6% of the amount surrendered.





7. The total contingent deferred sales loads assessed for current and future Contracts will not exceed 8.5% of the
purchase payments under the Contract. Applicants are relying on Rule 6c-8 under the 1940 Act to deduct the contingent
deferred sales load.





8. Contract owners may make unlimited exchanges among the Portfolios, provided a minimum balance of $1,000 is maintained
in each subaccount or general account option to which a Contract owner has allocated a portion of accumulated value.
No fee is imposed for such exchanges; however, National Home has reserved the right to charge $15 for each exchange
in excess of twelve per Contract year.
9. The Contracts are subject to an annual policy fee of $30 which will be deducted on each Contract anniversary and upon
surrender, on a pro rata basis, from each subaccount.
10. An administrative charge which is guaranteed for the life of the Contracts to be an amount equal to .15% annually
of the net asset value of the Separate Account is assessed daily.
 The administrative fee is intended to cover National Home's ongoing administrative expenses, and will not exceed
the cost of services to be provided over the life of the Contract in accordance with the applicable standards in Rule
26a-1 under the 1940 Act.




11. National Home makes a deduction fro the accumulated value or purchase payments from premium taxes, imposed by
state law, as the taxes are incurred. Currently these taxes range up to 3.5%
12. National Home imposes a charge as compensation for bearing certain mortality and expense risks under the Contract.
The annual charge is assessed daily based on the net asset value of the Separate Account. The annual mortality and expense
risk charge is .65% of the net asset value of the Separate Account attributable to A Unit Contracts, and 1.25% of the
net asset value of the Separate Account attributable to B Unit Contracts. For contracts offered in the future similar
to either the A Unit Contracts or the B Unit Contracts, the annual mortality and expense risk charge will not exceed
1.25% of the net asset value of the Separate Account attributable to such contracts.
For A Unit Contracts, .45% is allocated to the mortality risk and .20% is allocated to the expense risk. For B Unit Contracts
and future contracts, .80% is allocated to the mortality risk and .45% is allocated to the expense risk.

13. Where a life annuity payment option is selected, the mortality risk borne by National Home under the two forms of
the Contract arises from the obligation of National Home to make annuity payments regardless of how long an annuitant
may live. The mortality risk is the risk that annuitants will live longer than National Home's actuarial projections
indicate, resulting in higher than expected annuity payments. National Home also assumes mortality risk as a result
of an adjusted death benefit which is to be paid to an annuitant's beneficiary if the adjusted death benefit is greater
than the Contract's accumulated value.

14. The expense risk borne by National Home is the risk that the charges for administrative expenses which are guaranteed
for the life of the Contract may be insufficient to cover the actual costs of issuing and administering the Contract.

15. The mortality and expense risk is higher under the B Unit Contracts than under the A Unit Contracts because B Unit
Contracts are expected to be more attractive to Contract owners purchasing a Qualified Contract. While both A Unit
Contracts and B Unit Contracts are offered as Qualified Contracts, historically, the Contracts offering a contingent
deferred sales load (like the B Unit Contracts) have been more appealing to those seeking to purchase Qualified Contracts
than contracts with a front-end sales load (like the A Unit Contracts). The more complicated regulatory structure
surrounding the offering and maintenance of Qualified Contracts makes these Contracts more expensive to administer.
In addition, it is anticipated that the utilization of B Unit Contracts for Qualified Contracts will increase the
instances where life annuity payment options are selected by B Unit Contract owners, in comparison to A Unit Contract
owners, thereby increasing the mortality risk National Home is bearing under B Unit Contracts.

16. If the charges deducted are insufficient to cover the actual cost of the mortality and expense risk, the loss will
fall on National Home. If the charges prove more than sufficient, the excess will be added to National Home's surplus
and will be used for any lawful purpose including any shortfalls in the costs of distributing the Contracts.



Applicants' Legal Analysis and Conditions



1. Applicants request an exemption from sections 26(a)(2)(C) and 27(c)(2) of the 1940 Act to the extent any relief
is necessary to permit the deduction from the Separate Account of the mortality and expense risk charges under the
Contracts. Applicants request that the order also permit the deduction of the mortality and expense risk charges
described herein from the assets of the Separate Account pursuant to other contracts offered in the future through
the Separate Account, to the extent that such contracts are substantially similar to the Contracts.

2. Applicants submit that their request for an order that applies to materially similar contracts offered in the future
by the Separate Account is appropriate in the public interest. Such an order would promote competitiveness in the
variable annuity contract market by eliminating the need for National Home to file redundant exemptive applications,
thereby reducing its administrative expenses and maximizing the efficient use of its resources. Investors would
not receive any benefit or additional protection by requiring National Home to repeatedly seek exemptive relief
with respect to the same issues addressed in this Application.

3. Applicants represent that they have reviewed publicly available information regarding the aggregate level of
the mortality and expense risk charges under variable annuity contracts comparable to the A Unit Contracts and the
B Unit Contracts currently being offered in the insurance industry taking into consideration such factors as current
charge level, the manner in which charges are imposed, the presence of charge level or annuity rate guarantees and
the markets in which the Contracts will be offered. Based upon this review, Applicants represent that the mortality
and expense risk charges under the Contracts are within the range of industry practice for comparable contracts.
Applicants will maintain and make available to the Commission, upon request, a memorandum outlining the methodology
underlying this representation. Similarly, prior to making available any substantially similar contracts through
the Separate Account, Applicants will represent that the mortality and expense risk charges under any such contracts
will be within the range of industry practice for comparable contracts. Applicants will maintain and make available
to the Commission, upon request, a memorandum outlining the methodology underlying such representation.

4. Applicants represent that the Separate Account will invest only in underlying funds that have undertaken to have
a board of directors/trustees, a majority of whom are not interested persons of any such fund, formulate and approve
any plan under Rule 12b-1 under the 1940 Act to finance distribution expenses.

5. Applicants do not believe that the front-end sales load or contingent deferred sales load imposed under the Contracts
will necessarily cover the expected costs of distributing the Contract. Any shortfall will be made up from National
Home's general account assets which will include amounts derived from the mortality and expense risk charges. National
Home has concluded that there is a reasonable likelihood that the distribution financing arrangement being used
in connection with the Contracts will benefit the Separate Account and the Contract owners. National Home will keep
and make available to the Commission, upon request, a memorandum setting forth the basis for this representation.



Conclusion



Applicants assert that for the reasons and upon the facts set forth above, the requested exemption from sections 26(a)(2)(C)
and 27(c)(2) of the 1940 Act to deduct the mortality and expense risk charge under the Contract, or under substantially
similar contracts offered in the future by the Separate Account, meets the standards in section 6(c) of the 1940 Act.
Applicants assert that the exemptions requested are necessary and appropriate in the public interest and consistent
with the protection of investors and the policies and provisions of the 1940 Act.

Purpose


To support four Regional Children's Advocacy Centers that will encourage and facilitate the creation of local children's
advocacy centers, and strengthen those now in existence through the delivery of training and technical assistance.



Background


Section 6 of Public Law 102-586, codified at 42 U.S.C. 13001 et. 

seq.

, addressing the 1992 Amendments to the Victims of 
Child Abuse Act (the Act), provides for the establishment of four Regional Children's Advocacy Centers for purposes
of providing information, technical assistance and training to assist communities in establishing multi-disciplinary
programs which respond to child abuse. National Child Abuse and Neglect Data System Working Paper 2 reports that based
on 1990 revised data, States received and referred for investigation approximately 1.7 million reports on an estimated
2.6 million children who are the alleged subjects of child abuse and neglect. In 1991, States received nearly 1.8 million
reports on approximately 2.7 million children. The number reported in 1991 represents an increase of approximately
2.4 percent from 1990 data.

1

 Draft Working Paper 3 of the National Child Abuse and Neglect Data System reported approximately 918,263 substantiated
and indicated victims of child maltreatment from 49 states in 1992. Of these, approximately 14% (129,982) were sexually
abused.

2

 The Carnegie Corporation of New York reported, in its publication Starting Points, that one in three victims of physical
abuse is a baby less than a year old and that in 1990, more one year-olds were maltreated than in any previous year for
which data are available. Additionally, Starting Points reported that ``almost 90 percent of children who died of
abuse and neglect in 1990 were under the age of five; and 53 percent were less than a year old.''

3

 Based upon its annual telephone survey of states, the National Committee for Prevention of Child Abuse reported that
at least three children a day die from physical abuse inflicted by a parent or caretaker.

4

 








To address this problem, in 1985, then Madison County Alabama District Attorney Robert E. (Bud) Cramer mobilized
professionals in Madison County to establish a Children's Advocacy Center for victims of child abuse. The Center
is a facility-based, child-focused program which coordinates the response to victims of child abuse through multi-disciplinary
teams of representatives from statutorily mandated and other involved agencies. Team members include representatives
from child protective services, law enforcement, the district attorney's office, and the mental health and medical
fields. The elements of the Madison County model are incorporated in the 1992 Amendments to the Victims of Child Abuse
Act.

A major goal of children's advocacy centers is to prevent the inadvertent revictimization of an abused child by the
judicial and social service systems in their efforts to protect the child. The multi-disciplinary team provides
joint interviews of child victims and makes joint decisions about appropriate actions ranging from prosecution
to referral for mental health services. Child victims and non-offending family members are assigned an advocate
to help them cope with the criminal justice system's processing of their case. As a consequence of a coordinated response,
child victims are spared the pain and confusion of multiple interviews by prosecutors, protective service workers
and social workers. 


In 1990, the National Network of Children's Advocacy Centers (National Network) was incorporated in Madison County,
Alabama, as 
a national membership organization of local children's advocacy centers. Its purposes are to support the development,
growth and continuation of non-profit, facility-based programs utilizing a multi-disciplinary team approach
for handling child abuse cases, and for setting standards and regulating practices of children's advocacy centers.
The growth in the number of children's advocacy centers and the success of the National Network in establishing performance
standards led Congress to amend the Victims of Child Abuse Act in 1992 to authorize this program. 


Five hundred thousand dollars ($500,000) has been appropriated for Fiscal Year 1994 to establish four Regional Children's
Advocacy Centers to provide training and technical assistance in communities throughout the United States, toward
which this announcement is directed. An additional one million dollars ($1,000,000) has been appropriated to provide
direct funding assistance to community organizations and agencies for development and expansion of local children's
advocacy centers. The one million dollar appropriation will be awarded to the National Network of Children's Advocacy
Centers by OJJDP under a cooperative agreement to be awarded in July 1994 for purposes of providing funds to assist
local communities interested in developing or expanding local children's advocacy centers. It is expected that
these funds will be available in the fall of 1994 through a national competitive solicitation issued by the National
Network. 


The Act requires coordination in the delivery of technical assistance by the Regional Children's Advocacy Centers
with the activities of local children's advocacy centers that are funded under the provisions of the Act, codified
at 42 U.S.C. 13002. This will be achieved by representation of the grantees selected to implement the Regional Children's
Advocacy Centers on the Board of Directors of the National Network as ex officio members who will also serve on a Committee
of the Board on Training and Technical Assistance. 




Goal



To increase the number of facility-based multi-disciplinary children's advocacy centers for purposes of providing
coordinated, non-traumatizing services to children and families who are victims of abuse and neglect. 



Objectives




 To assist communities to develop a comprehensive, multi-disciplinary response to child abuse that is designed
to meet the needs of child victims and their families. 
 To enhance the skills of volunteers and professionals staffing multi-disciplinary, facility-based Children's
Advocacy Centers. 
 To provide support for non-offending family members of child victims of abuse and neglect. 
 To enhance coordination among community agencies and professions involved in the intervention, prevention,
prosecution, and investigation systems that respond to child abuse cases. 
 To support national coordination among children's advocacy centers for purposes of maximizing efficient
and effective use of technical assistance and training resources. 
 To facilitate the development and utilization of training and technical assistance materials. 
 To promote the implementation of national standards of practice. 




Program Strategy 



OJJDP will competitively select one applicant from each of the four census regions (Northeast, Midwest, South and
West), and award cooperative agreements of up to $125,000 to each. 
The states identified in these regions are: 


Northeast: 

Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, New York, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey;

California. 


While each grantee will participate in national coordination of the Children's Advocacy Program through representation
on the Board of Directors of the National Network of Children's Advocacy Centers, the primary focus of each will be
on delivery of technical assistance and training to children's advocacy centers, and on communities interested
in establishing multi-disciplinary, facility-based local advocacy centers in the census regions where they are
located or are otherwise designated to serve. 
Pursuant to the Act, codified at 42 U.S.C. 13001b(b)(2)(A), the Regional Children's Advocacy Centers will assist
communities in: 


 Developing a comprehensive, multi-disciplinary response to child abuse; 

 Establishing free-standing facilities for providing multi-disciplinary services to child victims and
their families; 
 Preventing or reducing trauma to children caused by multiple contacts with community professionals; 

 Providing families with needed services; 
 Maintaining open communication and case coordination among community professionals and agencies involved
in child protection efforts; 
 Coordinating and tracking investigative, preventive, prosecutorial, and treatment efforts; 

 Supporting effective investigative, preventive, prosecutorial, and treatment efforts; 

 Enhancing professional skills of professionals and volunteers who support local children's advocacy centers;
and 
 Enhancing community understanding of child abuse.

<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of technical standard order authorization withdrawal.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This notice withdraws each Technical Standard Order (TSO) C91 authorization to the extent that it allows the authorization
holder to identify or mark emergency locator transmitters (ELT's) with ``TSO-C91),'' and sets a date for the
termination of ELT's manufactured under TSO-C91. This withdrawal will ensure that future ELT's are produced
under TSO-C91a, issued previously which requires a higher minimum operational performance standard for ELT's.




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 




Background



In April 1990, the FAA proposed that all future installations of Emergency Locator Transmitters (ELT's) use equipment
approved under Technical Standard Order (TSO) C91a (55 FR 12316, April 2, 1990). The FAA also proposed the termination
of the manufacture of TSO-C91 ELT's by withdrawing the TSO-C91 manufacturing authorizations. These
actions were based on the known unsatisfactory performance of ELT's approved under TSO-C91.

In April 1985, the FAA issued TSO-C91a, which provides an improved minimum operational performance standard
(MOPS) for 121.5/243.0 MHz ELT's. In December 1992, the FAA issued TSO-C126, which provides a MOPS for 406 MHz
ELT's. ELT's approved under either of these TSO's may be used to comply with the Federal Aviation Regulations for ELT's.

Accordingly, this notice withdraws TSO-C91 to the extent that it authorizes the holder to mark ELT's with the
designation ``TSO-C91.'' For automatic ELT's manufactured under TSO-C91, this cancellation is effective
December 19, 1994. For survival ELT's manufactured under TSO-C91, this withdrawal is effective June 21, 1996.





Issued in Washington, DC on June 10, 1994.

Environmental Leadership Program: Request for Pilot Project Proposals; Notice

<USDEPT>ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY</USDEPT>






Environmental Leadership Program: Request for Pilot Project Proposals


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Request for Environmental Leadership Program pilot project proposals.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This notice requests proposals for Environmental Leadership Program pilot projects, and outlines the criteria
facilities must meet to be considered for participation. These pilot projects will explore ways that EPA and States
might encourage facilities to develop innovative auditing and compliance programs and to reduce the risk of non-compliance
through pollution prevention practices. In addition, the pilots will help EPA design a full-scale leadership program,
and determine if implementing such a program can help improve environmental compliance. Any future full-scale leadership
program based in the Office of Compliance will be consistent with the goals of the Administrator's Common Sense Initiative,
which focuses on comprehensive environmental protection strategies for entire industry sectors.


These voluntary pilot projects will benefit the public by encouraging industry to take greater responsibility for
self-monitoring, which will lead to improved compliance, pollution prevention, and environmental protection.
The projects will benefit industry by providing an opportunity to receive recognition for outstanding environmental
management practices and to address barriers to self-monitoring and compliance efforts. Finally, the projects
will benefit government by strengthening Federal-State partnerships and allowing EPA to gather empirical data
on environmental compliance methodology and measures.
EPA plans to select three to five (3-5) pilot projects. The pilots will be selected from the pool of proposals
received based on how completely they address the seven criteria outlined in this notice, and their potential to demonstrate
possible components of a full-scale leadership program. Depending on the level of interest in the projects, the quality
of the proposals received, and available resources, the Agency may be willing to expand the pilot project phase to
include additional projects.

B. Model Facility Pilot Projects


In the January 28, 1994 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 4066), the Administrator announced EPA's intent to further develop the ELP concept, initially through a small
number (3-5) of voluntary, facility-based pilot projects. The new Office of Compliance (OC), within the reorganized
Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance (OECA), will coordinate the ``model facility'' pilot project effort
with significant Regional and State partner involvement. At the same time, EPA opted not to further develop its own
``Corporate Statement of Environmental Principles,'' but rather to work cooperatively with organizations that
have developed their own corporate or industry-specific codes. (The Office of Pollution Prevention and Toxics will
continue to lead any future Agency involvement in this area.)
This 

pilot project 

effort is distinguished from a possible future, 

full-scale 

Environmental Leadership Program. A major goal of the pilot projects is to further explore possible components of
a full-scale program. Options were raised during public comment last year on various program elements, including
the review and selection process, recognition mechanisms, and other possible incentives for facilities. The pilot
projects will explore these options, and will have a definite life span of about 12-18 months. At the end of this
time, EPA will determine if a full-scale program is feasible, and if implementing such a program can help improve environmental
compliance.
The pilot projects, therefore, represent the experimental first step in the evolution of the ELP. The pilot phase
is also an excellent opportunity to strengthen partnerships between government, industry groups, and regulated
entities as a prelude to more extensive emphasis by the Agency on voluntary compliance initiatives. The pilot projects,
and any future leadership program, will be a vehicle for facilities to continue building positive, proactive relationships
with EPA and State and local agencies.


C. Benefits to Pilot Project Participants


EPA foresees a number of potential benefits to facilities that are selected for pilot projects. The Agency will publicly
recognize these facilities that demonstrate outstanding environmental management practices, and also provide
them with an opportunity to help shape the possible future, full-scale leadership program. EPA will use the pilot
projects to evaluate recognition mechanisms and other incentives that could be offered in a full-scale program.
While mechanisms for recognition will be determined in discussions with each facility, they may include press releases,
letters to community groups, local and State agencies, and/or site visits by EPA officials. It is important to note
that any future program would offer recognition and other incentives on a continuing basis (similar to the OSHA Voluntary
Protection Program), not as a one-time award.
The pilots represent an opportunity for facilities to inform and directly participate in EPA's effort to reassess
its environmental auditing policy. In addition, it is anticipated that the projects selected will generate empirical
data useful for evaluating EPA's compliance policies and spur the development of methodologies for evaluating compliance
behavior. Finally, EPA is interested in discussing possible policy modifications and other incentives that could
help facilities overcome barriers to self-monitoring and compliance efforts. Facilities should address this issue
in their proposals for pilot projects. Proposals should focus on incentives that can be offered by EPA's Office of
Enforcement and Compliance Assurance under existing law using administrative authority or policies that lie clearly
within OECA's jurisdiction. Proposals to change statutory deadlines, amend environmental standards, or that require
actions by other agencies are not appropriate for this program.
The remainder of this notice will outline the criteria facilities must address in their proposal to be considered
for a pilot project, briefly outline the role of States and EPA Regions, and discuss the proposal review and selection
process.


II. Criteria for Facility Pilot Projects


The following criteria for pilot projects were developed in response to extensive public comment on the original
ELP proposal. In this phase of the ELP, facilities of all types, including small businesses, municipalities, and
Federal facilities,
 are encouraged to submit proposals for pilot projects that address these criteria. Each criterion must be addressed
in some way in the proposal; however, facilities may choose to emphasize individual criteria that are appropriate
to their unique situation in setting specific goals for a pilot project.




A. Compliance History


EPA believes that the greatest potential for the pilot projects is to demonstrate ``state-of-the-art'' environmental
management systems that establish and maintain compliance with environmental statutes and regulations. These
systems, when combined with an emphasis on pollution prevention, can lead to improved efficiencies that help facilities
exceed minimum compliance standards. To be selected to participate in a pilot project, facilities must demonstrate
a commitment to compliance. Therefore, facility proposals must describe their local, State, and Federal compliance
history, explain how they have resolved compliance issues in the past, what they are doing to address any outstanding
compliance issues, and how they are trying to position themselves to go beyond compliance.


B. Environmental Management and Auditing Programs


Industry leaders have long recognized the value of self-auditing for environmental compliance and the need to have
processes and personnel in place to achieve compliance goals. Facilities applying to the ELP must describe their
existing or proposed environmental management and auditing programs, their systems to resolve issues raised by
these programs in a timely manner, and their systems to evaluate and adjust these programs on a regular basis. One of
the major goals of implementing these management systems and auditing programs should be to move the facility into
compliance and position it to go beyond compliance.

<DOCNO> FR940621-2-00120 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940621-2-00075 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Guidance on environmental auditing and state-of-the-art environmental management practices is available from
many sources. As a starting point, EPA refers potential pilot participants to the following sources: 

 The EPA Environmental Auditing Policy Statement (

Federal Register

, 
July 9, 1986) which includes a discussion of elements of an effective auditing program; 

 The ``Draft Corporate Sentencing Guidelines for Environmental Violations,'' (

BNA Environment Reporter,

 11/26/93), which includes a discussion of ``Minimum Factors for Demonstrating a Commitment to Environmental Compliance''
in Part D. 

Voluntary standards on environmental management systems and environmental 
auditing may also provide guidance to facilities interested in preparing pilot project proposals. EPA is participating
in work groups organized by the International Organization for Standards (ISO) and the National Sanitation Foundation
(NSF International). The American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) is coordinating U.S. participation
in ISO Technical Committee 207 (TC-207) on environmental management systems (EMS). 
Contacts for these organizations are listed at the end of this notice. 

Similarly, EPA is aware that initiatives such as the Global Environmental 
Management Initiative (GEMI), the Responsible Care Program, and the CERES Principles have been developed in the
private sector and by non-governmental groups. These and other private sector efforts may be useful for facilities
interested in submitting pilot proposals, and facilities are encouraged to develop proposals with industry and
trade association involvement and support.



C. Disclosure of Audit Results 



EPA is currently reevaluating its environmental auditing policy, and will take an empirical approach so that any
decision to either reinforce or change existing policy is informed by fact. The ELP pilot projects may generate useful
data on auditing methodology and measures, and may serve as a vehicle for experimenting with policy-driven incentives.


EPA is particularly interested in examining how disclosure of audit results could improve the public's confidence
in and acceptance of industry's self-monitoring efforts, and how disclosure could help facilitate the flow of information
to the personnel responsible for implementing audit recommendations. Facilities applying to the ELP must demonstrate
a willingness to disclose in some manner the results of their audits. EPA recognizes the controversial nature of this
issue, and for that reason wants to explore the potential benefits and perceived risks of disclosure in the context
of the pilot projects. 

As part of their proposals, therefore, facilities should suggest the type and extent of information they would be
willing to disclose, the mechanisms they would use to disclose the information, the parties to whom they would disclose
the information, and finally, any conditions they would seek from regulators in order to make the disclosure. Proposed
incentives should be limited to items that can be offered by EPA's Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance
under existing law using administrative authority or policies that lie clearly within OECA's jurisdiction. Proposals
to change statutory deadlines, amend environmental standards, or that require actions by other agencies are not
appropriate for this program.



D. Pollution Prevention Activities 



EPA's new Office of Compliance is organized principally around economic sectors, in order to support integrated
approaches to compliance that promote pollution prevention as a means of meeting environmental requirements and
realizing environmental improvements. Facilities must describe their existing or proposed comprehensive, multimedia
pollution prevention program that is integrated into their overall operations. In describing this program, facilities
should include descriptions of their pollution prevention planning process, their State pollution prevention
plan (if required, see ``Other Required Documentation'' below), their systems for implementing pollution prevention
projects, how resources are allocated to pollution prevention, and how they measure pollution prevention progress.
At a minimum, facilities should include the two-year projection of waste generation required by the Pollution Prevention
Act and their RCRA waste minimization certification (see ``Other Required Documentation'' below). 



E. Setting an Example 



Facilities must show that they are currently using, or would be willing to use, their auditing, pollution prevention,
and/or other environmental management programs as models or benchmarks for other facilities within their company
or industry, or for their customers, suppliers, and contractors. EPA recognizes that there may be many mechanisms
for doing this, and that confidentiality issues may limit the amount of information and technology facilities are
able to share. Given these conditions, facilities must propose how they would help others learn from their experiences
and the type and extent of information they would be willing to share.



F. Performance Measures 



Good environmental management systems set performance objectives, and measure and report on progress toward those
goals. While EPA recognizes that there are many possible measures of environmental performance, at the pilot project
stage the Office of Compliance is primarily interested in developing methodology that can demonstrate and measure
compliance success and pollution prevention results, as complements to the traditional enforcement measures of
actions and penalties. Therefore, facilities must propose quantitative and/or qualitative measures that will
track the compliance improvements and pollution prevention results that would accrue from their participation
in a pilot project. Facilities must also include brief descriptions of additional performance objectives that they
are striving to meet, and of the systems they use to track and monitor progress toward these goals. Any future, full-scale
leadership program will attempt to incorporate overall measures of environmental management performance, in addition
to measures of compliance and pollution prevention. 


G. Employee and Community Involvement 


Sensitivity and responsiveness to employee and community concerns is a key 
component of environmental leadership. In proposals for the ELP, facilities must demonstrate that their employees
and their communities are involved in developing and implementing their environmental management programs, and
should suggest mechanisms (for example, employee interviews, interviews with local Emergency Planning Commission
(LEPCs), etc.) which can be used to verify this involvement.

III. Other Required Documentation 


Facilities should include in their proposal the information they deem necessary to address the criteria outlined
above,
