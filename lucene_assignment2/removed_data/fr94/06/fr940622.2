<DOCTITLE>Foreign-Trade Zone 137_Washington Dulles </DOCTITLE>
International Airport, Virginia; 
Request for Boundary Modification 



The Washington Dulles Foreign-Trade Zone, Inc., grantee of FTZ 137, has made a request to the Foreign-Trade Zones
(FTZ) Board for a minor modification of the boundary of FTZ 137 pursuant to  400.27(f) of the FTZ Board regulations
(15 CFR Part 400). The grantee is requesting authority to include within the zone project a privately owned public
warehouse facility on a 3-acre parcel located at 110 Terminal Drive, Sterling, Virginia, within the Dulles Airport
Corridor area, some 2 miles from the airport. In exchange, zone status would be relinquished on a parcel (3 acres) located
within the boundary of the existing zone on the airport complex. The warehouse is operated by Victory Van Corporation,
which would offer zone services as part of its public warehousing operation. No authority is requested for manufacturing
or processing activity. The purpose of the change is to provide improved zone public warehousing services in the airport
area while the grantee considers revisions to its longer-term zone plan.

Public comment on the request is invited from interested parties. Submissions shall be addressed to the Board's Executive
Secretary at the address below. The closing period for their receipt is July 8, 1994. 

A copy of the request will be available for public inspection at the following location: Office of the Executive Secretary,

ACTION: 

Notice of Preliminary Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

In response to a request by the respondents, Akzo Faser A.G. and Akzo Fibers, Inc. (Akzo), producers/importers of
high-tenacity rayon filament yarn from Germany, the Department of Commerce (the Department) has conducted an administrative
review of the antidumping duty order on high-tenacity rayon filament yarn from Germany. The review period is February
20, 1992 through May 31, 1993. This review involves one manufacturer/exporter of this merchandise to the United States,
Akzo, and its United States subsidiary/importer.


The review indicates the existence of dumping margins for the period, and we preliminary determine to assess antidumping
duties equal to the difference between the United States price (USP) and the foreign market value (FMV).
Interested parties are invited to comment on these preliminary results of review.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
Background


On June 30, 1992, the Department published in the 

Federal Register

 the antidumping duty order on high-tenacity rayon filament yarn from Germany (57 FR 29062). On June 7, 1993, the Department
published a notice in the 

Federal Register

 notifying interested parties of the opportunity to request an administrative review of high-tenacity rayon filament
yarn from Germany (58 FR 31941). On June 29, 1993, Akzo requested, in accordance with section 353.22(a) of the Commerce
regulations, that we conduct an administrative review for the period February 20, 1992 through May 31, 1993. We published
a notice of initiation of the antidumping duty administrative review on July 21, 1993 (58 FR 39007).

The Department has now conducted a review for this period in accordance with section 751 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as
amended (the Act).


Scope of the Review


The product covered by this administrative review is high-tenacity rayon filament yarn from Germany. During the
review period, such merchandise was classifiable under the 

Harmonized Tariff Schedule

 (HTS) item number 5403.10.30.40. High-tenacity rayon filament yarn is a multifilament single yarn of viscose rayon
with a twist of five turns or more per meter, having a denier of 1100 or greater, and a tenacity greater than 35 centinewtons
per tex. The HTS item number is provided for convenience and U.S. Customs purposes. The written description remains
dispositive as to the scope of the product coverage. The review covers Akzo and the period February 20, 1992 through
May 31, 1993 (POR).


United States Price


In calculating USP, the Department treated Akzo's sales as purchase price (PP), as defined in section 772 of the Act,
because the merchandise was sold to unrelated U.S. purchasers prior to importation. PP was based on the free-on-board
(FOB) price to unrelated purchasers in the United States. We made adjustments, where applicable, for foreign brokerage
and handling, foreign inland freight, ocean freight, U.S. duty, U.S. inland freight, foreign inland insurance,
and U.S. brokerage.
We made an addition to USP for taxes which were rebated upon exportation. On October 7, 1993, the United States Court
of International Trade (CIT), in 

Federal-Mogul Corporation and The Torrington Company

 v. 

United States,

 Slip Op. 93-194 (CIT, October 7, 1993), rejected the Department's methodology for calculating an addition
to USP under section 772(d)(1)(C) of the Act to account for taxes that the exporting country would have assessed on
the merchandise had it been sold in the home market. The CIT held that the addition to USP under section 772(d)(1)(C)
of the Act should be the result of applying the foreign market tax rate to the price of the U.S. merchandise at the same
point in the chain of commerce that the foreign market tax was applied to the foreign market sales (

see Federal-Mogul,

) Slip Op. 93-194 at 12).
In accordance with the 

Federal-Mogul

 decision, the Department added to USP the result of multiplying the foreign market tax rate by the U.S. price at the
same point in the chain of commerce that the foreign market tax was applied to foreign market sales. The Department
has also adjusted the USP tax adjustments and the amount of tax included in FMV to account for expenses that are later
deducted from USP and FMV. These adjustments to the amount of the foreign market tax and the USP tax adjustment are necessary
to prevent our new methodology for calculating the USP tax adjustment from creating antidumping duty margins where
no margins would exist if not taxes were levied upon foreign market sales.
Without the adjustments, margins would be artificially increased because both the amount of tax included in the price
of the foreign market merchandise and the amount of the USP tax adjustment include many expenses that are later deducted
when calculating USP and FMV. After deductions are made for these expenses, the amount of tax included in FMV and the
USP tax adjustment still reflects the amounts of these expenses. Thus, a margin may be created that is not dependent
upon a difference between USP and FMV, but rather is the result of the price of the U.S. merchandise containing more
expenses than the price of the foreign market merchandise.
The Department's policy of avoiding the creation of artificial margins is in accordance with court decisions. The
United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has held that the application of the USP tax adjustment under
section 772(d)(1)(C) of the Act should not create an antidumping duty margin if pre-tax FMV does not exceed USP (

see Zenith Electronics Corp.

 v.

 United States,

 988 F.2d 1573, 1581 (Fed. Cir. 1993)). In addition, the CIT has specifically held that an adjustment should be made
to mitigate the impact of expenses that are deducted from FMV and USP upon the USP tax adjustment and the amount of tax
included in FMV (

see Daewoo Electronics Co., Ltd.

 v. 

United States,

 760 F. Supp. 200, 208 (CIT, 1991)). However, the mechanics of the Department's adjustments to the USP tax adjustment
and the foreign market tax amount as described above are not identical to those suggested in 

Daewoo.


In addition, the Department requested that Akzo submit information relating to all exporter's sales price (ESP)
sales made during the POR. The Department analyzed data submitted by Akzo and determined that the ESP sales reported
were entered and liquidated prior to the date of the Department's preliminary determination of sales at less-than-fair-value
(LTFV). Because this merchandise was entered prior to the date of the preliminary determination, it was not covered
by this order (

see

 Notice of Antidumping Duty Order: High-Tenacity Rayon Filament Yarn from Germany, 57 FR 29062 (June 30, 1992)). Therefore,
we have excluded these sales from this review.
No other adjustments to USP were claimed or allowed.


Foreign Market Value


Akzo had sufficient home market sales of the subject merchandise during the POR. Therefore, the sales of high-tenacity
rayon filament yarn in the home market served as a viable basis for calculating FMV.

<DOCNO> FR940622-2-00008 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940622-2-00004 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Based on findings in the LTFV investigation that home market sales of the subject merchandise were made by Akzo at prices
below the cost of production (COP), the Department conducted a cost investigation for this administrative review.
We examined whether home market sales were made below cost in substantial quantities over an extended period of time,
and whether such sales were made at prices which permitted recovery of all costs within a reasonable period of time
in the normal course of trade. We calculated Akzo's COP on a model-specific basis as the sum of all reported materials
costs, labor expenses, factory overhead, selling expenses, net interest expense, and revised general and administrative
expenses. We reallocated general and administrative costs as a percentage of cost of goods sold. We compared COP to
home market prices, net of movement charges, third-party payments, packing, rebates, and discounts. Based upon
this comparison, we found that there were sales below cost.
Where we determined that less than 10 percent of the home market sales of rayon yarn of a particular model were sold at
prices below the COP, we did not disregard any sales of that model in our calculation of FMV. If 10 percent or more, but
not more than 90 percent, of the home market sales of a particular model of rayon yarn were below cost, we excluded the
below-cost home market sales prices from our calculation of FMV, provided that these below-cost home market sales
were made over an extended period of time. For those models where more than 90 percent of the home market sales were made
below cost over an extended period of time, we disregarded all home market sales of those models from our calculation
of FMV and used the constructed value of those models as described below.
To determine whether sales below cost were made over an extended period of time, we compared the number of months in
which sales below cost occurred for a particular model to the number of months in which that model was sold. If the model
was sold in fewer than three months, we did not disregard below-cost sales unless there were below-cost sales of that
model in each month sold. If a model was sold in three or more months, we did not disregard below-cost sales unless there
were sales below cost in at least three of the months in which the model was sold.
Akzo has not submitted information indicating that any of its sales below cost were made at prices which would have
permitted ``recovery of all costs within a reasonable period of time in the normal course of trade,'' as required by
section 773(b)(2) of the Act. Therefore, we have no basis for concluding that the costs of production of such sales
have been recovered within a reasonable period of time. As a result of our investigation, we disregarded Akzo's below-cost
sales made over an extended period of time.

We used constructed value (CV) as FMV for those U.S. sales for which there were insufficient sales of the comparison
home-market model at or above the COP. We calculated CV in accordance with section 773(e) of the Act. We made an adjustment
to general and administrative expenses based on our finding that Akzo had allocated general and administrative costs
to different product groups based on specific allocation methodologies. The costs reported were general in nature
and related to all operations, and we allocated them to all of Akzo's product lines. In addition, we summed the cost
of materials, indirect selling expenses, direct selling expenses, revised general and administrative expenses,
net interest expenses, and imputed credit. In our calculation of the selling, general, and administrative expenses
(SG&A), where the sum of the actual selling expenses and the revised general and administrative expenses was
less than the statutory minimum of 10 percent of the cost of manufacturing (COM), we calculated SG&A as 10 percent
of the COM. Where the actual profits were less than the statutory minimum of 8 percent of COM plus SG&A, we calculated
profit as 8 percent of the sum of COM plus SG&A. We adjusted CV for selling, credit, and packing expenses.

For those models that had sufficient above-cost sales, the Department calculated FMV using home market prices based
on the FOB price to unrelated purchasers. Where applicable, we made adjustments for inland freight (post-sale),
inland insurance, packing, discounts, other discounts, interest revenue, rebates, and third party payments. We
made adjustments for differences in technical services expenses and credit. We also made adjustments for differences
in the physical characteristics of merchandise. The Department also made an adjustment to the amount of consumption
taxes included in FMV in accordance with the Department's aforementioned tax adjustment methodology.



Preliminary Results



As a result of our review, we preliminarily determine the dumping margin to be:





Parties to this proceeding may request disclosure within 5 days of publication of this notice and any interested party
may request a hearing within 10 days of publication. Any hearing, if requested, will be held 44 days after the date of
publication, or the first workday thereafter. Interested parties may submit case briefs and/or written comments
not later than 30 days after the date of publication. Rebuttal briefs and rebuttals to written comments, limited to
issues raised in such briefs or comments, may be filed not later than 37 days after the date of publication. The Department
will publish a notice of the final results of this administrative review, which will include the results of its analysis
of issues raised in any such briefs or comments.

The Department shall determine, and the U.S. Customs Service shall assess, antidumping duties on all appropriate
entries. Individual differences between USP and FMV may vary from the percentage stated above. The Department will
issue appraisement instructions directly to the U.S. Customs Service.

Furthermore, the following deposit requirements will be effective upon completion of the final results of this administrative
review for all shipments of high-tenacity rayon filament yarn from Germany entered, or withdrawn from warehouse,
for consumption on or after the publication date of the final results of this administrative review, as provided by
section 751(a) of the Act: (1) The cash deposit rate for Akzo will be that established in the final results of this review;
(2) for merchandise exported by manufacturers or exporters not covered in this review but covered in the original
LTFV investigation, the cash deposit will continue to be the rate published in the final determination for which the
manufacturer or exporter received a company-specific rate; (3) if the exporter is not a firm covered in this review,
or the original investigation, but the manufacturer is, the cash deposit rate will be that established for the manufacturer
of the merchandise in the final results of this review, or the original investigation; (4) if neither the exporter
nor the manufacturer is a firm covered in this or any previous review, the cash deposit rate will be the ``all others
rate'' from the LTFV investigation.

On May 25, 1993, the CIT in 

Floral Trade Council

 v. 

United States,

 822 F. Supp. 766 (1993), and 

Federal-Mogul Corporation and the Torrington Company

 v. 

United States,

 822 F. Supp. 782 (1993), decided that once an ``all others'' rate is established for a company, it can only be changed
through an administrative review. The Department has determined that in order to implement these decisions, it is
appropriate to reinstate the original ``all others'' rate from the LTFV investigation (or that rate as amended for
correction for clerical errors or as a result of litigation) in proceedings governed by antidumping duty orders for
the purposes of establishing cash deposits in all current and future administrative reviews. Thus, the ``all others''
rate for the purposes of this review will be 24.58 percent, the ``all others'' rate established in the final notice
of LTFV investigation by the Department (57 FR 21770).

This notice also serves as a preliminary reminder to importers of their responsibility under 19 CFR 353.26 to file
a certificate regarding the reimbursement of antidumping duties prior to liquidation of the relevant entries during
this review period. Failure to comply with this requirement could result in the Secretary's presumption that reimbursement
of antidumping duties occurred and the subsequent assessment of double antidumping duties.

This administrative review and notice are in accordance with section 751(a)(1) of the Act (19 U.S.C. 1675(a)(1))
and 19 CFR 353.22.

 Notice of Final Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Reviews.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 On March 8, 1994, the Department of Commerce published the preliminary results of its administrative reviews of the
antidumping duty order on industrial phosphoric acid from Israel (59 FR 10787). The review periods are August 1, 1991
through July 31, 1992 and August 1, 1992 through July 31, 1993. These reviews involve Haifa Chemicals, Ltd., a manufacturer/exporter
of this merchandise to the United States. We have now completed these reviews and determine the margin to be 6.82 percent


ad valorem

 for Haifa Chemicals.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
Background 


On March 8, 1994, the Department of Commerce (the Department) published in the 

Federal Register

 the preliminary results of its administrative reviews of the antidumping duty order on industrial phosphoric acid
from Israel (59 FR 10787) covering the periods August 1, 1991 through July 31, 1992 and August 1, 1992 through July 31,
1993, the fifth and sixth review periods respectively. The review of Rotem Fertilizers (Rotem) was terminated in
the preliminary results of these reviews (59 FR 10787) because Rotem was determined to be the successor to Negev Phosphates,
Ltd. (Negev), a company that was revoked from the antidumping order in the final results of the changed circumstances
review. The Department has now completed these administrative reviews in accordance with section 751 of the Tariff
Act of 1930, as amended (the Act). 


Scope of the Review 


Imports covered by these reviews are shipments of industrial phosphoric acid (IPA). This product is classifiable
under item number 2809.20.00 of the 

Harmonized Tariff Schedule 

(HTS). The HTS item number is provided for convenience and customs purposes. The written description remains dispositive.

The review periods are August 1, 1991 through July 31, 1992 and August 1, 1992 through July 31, 1993. These reviews involve
Haifa Chemicals Ltd. (Haifa), an Israeli manufacturer/exporter to the United States of the subject merchandise.

Haifa reported that it did not have any shipments of the subject merchandise to the United States during these review
periods. We subsequently confirmed with the United States Customs Service that there were no entries of this merchandise
to the United States by Haifa during these review periods. Therefore, we are using the rate found in the previous review
for this company for cash deposit purposes. 

See Industrial Phosphoric Acid from Israel; Final Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review 

(57 FR 38471; August 25, 1992). Because Haifa did not respond to the Department's questionnaire in that review, it
was assigned a rate of 6.82 percent, the highest margin assigned to any company in a previous review or in the investigation.

Analysis of Comments Received



We gave interested parties an opportunity to comment on the preliminary results. We received no comments.



Final Results of the Review



We determine the following dumping margin for the periods 
August 1, 1991 through July 31, 1992 and August 1, 1992 through July 31, 1993:






The Department will instruct the Customs Service to assess antidumping duties on all appropriate entries. Individual
differences between United States price and foreign market value may vary from the percentages stated above. The
Department will issue appraisement instructions directly to the Customs Service. 
Furthermore, the following deposit requirements will be effective upon publication of these final results of administrative
reviews for all shipments of the subject merchandise, entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption as provided
by section 751(a)(1) of the Tariff Act: (1) The cash deposit rate for the reviewed company will be the rate as listed;
(2) for previously reviewed or investigated companies not listed above, the cash deposit rate will continue to be
the company-specific rate published for the most recent period; (3) if the exporter is not a firm covered in these reviews,
a prior review, or the original less-than-fair-value investigation, but the manufacturer is, the cash deposit rate
will be the rate established for the most recent period for the manufacturer of the merchandise; and (4) cash deposits
for all other manufacturers or exporters will be the ``all other'' rate of 1.77 percent. This is the rate established
during the LTFV investigation.

These deposit requirements shall remain in effect until publication of the final results of the next administrative
review.

This notice also serves as a final reminder to importers of their responsibility under 19 CFR 353.26 to file a certificate
regarding the reimbursement of antidumping duties prior to liquidation of the relevant entries during these review
periods. Failure to comply with this requirement could result in the Secretary's presumption that reimbursement
of antidumping duties occurred and subsequent assessment of double antidumping duties.

This notice also serves as the only reminder to parties subject to administrative protective order (APO) of their
responsibilities concerning the return or destruction of proprietary information disclosed under APO in accordance
with 19 CFR 353.34(d). Failure to comply is a violation of the APO.

These administrative reviews and notice are in accordance with section 751(a)(1) of the Act (19 U.S.C. 1675(a)(1))
and 19 CFR 353.22.

<DOCTITLE>Notice of Court Decision: Certain Hot Rolled Lead and Bismuth Carbon Steel Products from Germany </DOCTITLE>


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Import Administration, International Trade Administration, Department of Commerce.

 
</AGENCY>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 On June 7, 1994, the United States Court of International Trade (``CIT'') overturned the determination by the Department
of Commerce (``the Department'') that the benefit of Saarstahl AG's subsidization, by reason of forgiveness of debts,
was passed through to Dillinger Hutte Saarstahl AG (``DHS'') after Saarstahl was privatized.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 In its 

Final Affirmative Countervailing Duty Determination: Certain Hot Rolled Lead and Bismuth Carbon Steel Products
From Germany,

 58 FR 6233 (January 27, 1993), the Department determined that subsidies previously bestowed on Saarstahl in the form
of debt forgiveness passed through to DHS, a newly formed holding company of which Saarstahl became a subsidiary.
The Department's determination was challenged. The Department subsequently requested, and was granted, a remand
in order to reconsider its final determinations. On remand, the Department adopted its reasoning from 

Final Affirmative Countervailing Duty Determination: Certain Steel Products From Germany, 

58 FR 37315 (July 9, 1993), in which it determined that a portion of the price DHS paid for Saarstahl represented repayment
of prior subsidies. On June 7, 1994, in 

Saarstahl AG 

v. 

United States, 

Slip Op. 94-92, the CIT overturned the Department's determination that previously bestowed subsidies continued
to benefit a company privatized in an arm's-length transaction. 
In its decision in 

Timken Co. 

v. 

United States, 

893 F.2d 337 (Fed. Cir. 1990), the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit held that, pursuant to 19 U.S.C.
1516a(e), the Department must publish a notice of a court decision which is not ``in harmony'' with a Department determination,
and must suspend liquidation of entries pending a ``conclusive'' court decision. The CIT's decision in 

Saarstahl 

on June 7, 1994, constitutes a decision not in harmony with the Department's final affirmative determination. Publication
of this notice fulfills the 

Timken 

requirement. 


Accordingly, the Department will continue to suspend liquidation pending the expiration of the period of appeal
or, if appealed, upon a ``conclusive'' court decision. Absent an appeal or, if appealed, upon a ``conclusive'' court
decision affirming the CIT's opinion, the countervailing duty order will be revoked effective June 17, 1994.

<DOCTITLE>Notice of Court Decision: Certain Hot Rolled Lead and Bismuth Carbon Steel Products From the United Kingdom</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Import Administration, International Trade Administration, Department of Commerce.



</AGENCY>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 On June 7, 1994, the United States Court of International Trade (``CIT'') overturned the determination by the Department
of Commerce (``the Department'') that United Engineering Steels, Ltd. (``UES'') was being subsidized by reason
of subsidies previously bestowed on a government-owned company which sold one of its productive units to UES in an
arm's-length transaction.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 In its 

Final Affirmative Countervailing Duty Determination: Certain Hot Rolled Lead and Bismuth Carbon Steel Products
From the United Kingdom,

 58 FR 6237 (January 27, 1993), the Department determined that subsidies previously bestowed on the British Steel
Corporation (``BSC'') passed through, in part, to UES, a joint-venture company, when UES purchased one of BSC's productive
units in an arm's-length transaction. The Department's determination was challenged. The Department subsequently
requested, and was granted, a remand in order to reconsider its final determination. On remand, the Department adopted
its reasoning in 

Final Affirmative Countervailing Duty Determination: Certain Steel Products From the United Kingdom,

 58 FR 37393 (July 9, 1993), in which it determined that part of the price UES paid for the productive unit purchased from
BSC constituted payment for prior subsidies. On June 7, 1994, in 

Inland Steel Bar Co. v. United States,

 (``

Inland Steel

''), Slip Op. 94-93, the CIT overturned the Department's determination that previously bestowed subsidies
are passed through to a successor company sold in an arm's-length transaction.



In its decision in 

Timken Co. v. United States,

 893 F.2d 337 (Fed. Cir. 1990), the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit held that, pursuant to 19 U.S.C.
section 1516a(e), the Department must publish a notice of a court decision which is not ``in harmony'' with a Department
determination, and must suspend liquidation of entries pending a ``conclusive'' court decision. The CIT's decision
in Inland Steel on June 7, 1994, constitutes a decision not in harmony with the Department's final affirmative determination.
Publication of this notice fulfills the 

Timken

 requirement.

Accordingly, the Department will continue to suspend liquidation pending the expiration of the period of appeal,
or, if appealed, upon a ``conclusive'' court decision. Absent an appeal, or, if appealed, upon a ``conclusive'' court
decision affirming the CIT's opinion, the countervailing duty order will be revoked effective June 17, 1994.

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The purpose of this notice is to announce that the Secretary of Commerce has approved the withdrawal of Federal Information
Processing Standard (FIPS) 71, Advanced Data Communication Control Procedures (ADCCP) and FIPS 78, Guideline for
Implementing Advanced Data Communication Control Procedures (ADCCP).



On November 16, 1993, notice was published in the 

Federal Register

 (58 FR 60425) proposing withdrawal of Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 71, because the technical
specifications that they adopt are obsolete and are no longer supported by industry. NIST also stated that if FIPS
71 were withdrawn, FIPS 78 would be withdrawn as well.

The written comments submitted by interested parties and other material available to the Department relevant to
this standard was reviewed by NIST. On the basis of this review, NIST recommended that the Secretary approved the withdrawal
of FIPS 71 and 78, and prepared a detailed justification document for the Secretary's review in support of that recommendation.

The detailed justification document which was presented to the Secretary is part of the public record and is available
for inspection and copying in the Department's Central Reference and Records Inspection Facility, Room 6020, Herbert
C. Hoover Building, 14th Street between Pennsylvania and Constitution Avenues, NW., Washington, DC 20230.

National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Commerce.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice; Request for comments.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This proposed FIPS defines general purpose profiles that can be used by both vendors and users to specify exact requirements
for how various products will fit into an SQL environment. An SQL environment is an integrated data processing environment
in which heterogeneous products, all supporting some aspect of FIPS 127, SQL, are able to communicate with one another
and provide shared access to data and data operations and methods under appropriate security, integrity, and access
control mechanisms.


The profiles in this proposed FIPS will enable Federal agencies to specify a subset of FIPS 127 to provide limited SQL
access to legacy databases, or to support SQL gateways to specialized data managers such as Geographic Information
Systems, full-text document management systems, or object database management systems.
Prior to the submission of this proposed FIPS to the Secretary of Commerce for review and approval, it is essential
to assure that consideration is given to the needs and views of manufacturers, the public, and State and local governments.
The purpose of this notice is to solicit such views.
This proposed FIPS contains two sections: (1) An announcement section, which provides information concerning the
applicability, implementation, and maintenance of the standard; and (2) a specifications section. Only the announcement
section of the standard is provided in this notice. Interested parties may obtain copies of the specifications section
from the Standards Processing Coordinator (ADP), National Institute of Standards and Technology, Technology Building,
room B64, Gaithersburg, MD 20899, telephone (301) 975-2816. An electronic version of this specification is

Federal Information Processing Standards Publication XXX



(Draft_April 1994)



Announcing the Standard for SQL Environments



Federal Information Processing Standards Publications (FIPS PUBS) are issued by the National Institute of Standards
and Technology after approval by the Secretary of Commerce pursuant to Section 111(d) of the Federal Property and
Administrative Services Act of 1949 as amended by the Computer Security Act of 1987, Public Law 100-235.

1. Name of Standard. SQL Environments (FIPS PUB XXX).

2. Category of Standard. Software Standard, Database.

3. Explanation. An SQL environment is an integrated data processing environment in which heterogeneous products,
all supporting some aspect of the FIPS SQL standard (FIPS PUB 127), are able to communicate with one another and provide
shared access to data and data operations and methods under appropriate security, integrity, and access control
mechanisms. Some components in an SQL environment will be full-function SQL implementations that conform to an entire
level of FIPS SQL and support all of its required clauses for schema definition, data manipulation, transaction management,
integrity constraints, access control, and schema information. Other components in an SQL environment may be specialized
data repositories, or graphical user interfaces and report writers, that support selected portions of the SQL standard
and thereby provide a degree of integration between themselves and other products in the same SQL environment.
This FIPS PUB is the beginning of a continuing effort to define appropriate conformance profiles that can be used by
both vendors and users to specify exact requirements for how various products fit into an SQL environment. The emphasis
in this first FIPS for SQL Environments is to specify general purpose, SQL external repository interface (SQL/ERI)
profiles for non-SQL data repositories. These profiles specify how a subset of the SQL standard can be used to provide
limited SQL access to legacy databases, or to support SQL gateways to specialized data managers such as Geographic
Information Systems (GIS), full-text document management systems, or object database management systems. All
of the profiles specified herein are for server-side products, that is, products that control persistent data and
provide an interface for users access to that data. Subsequent versions of this FIPS PUB may specify SQL environment
profiles for client-side products, that is, products that access data and then present that data in graphical or report-writer
style to an end user, or process the data in some other way on behalf of the end user.
4. Approving Authority. Secretary of Commerce
5. Maintenance Agency. Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology, (Computer Systems
Laboratory)

For information on the current status of the above Working Drafts, contact NIST personnel working on SQL Standardization
at 301-975-3251. For document references to the above and for additional related documents, see the References
section of the SQL/ERI Server Profiles specification.
8. Objective. The primary objective of this FIPS PUB for SQL Environments is to specify SQL profiles that can be used
by Federal departments and agencies to support integration of legacy databases and other non-SQL data repositories
into an SQL environment. The intent is to provide a high level of control over a diverse collection of legacy or specialized
data resources. An SQL environment allows an organization to obtain many of the advantages of SQL without requiring
a large, complex, and error-prone conversion effort; instead, the organization can evolve, in a controlled manner,
to a new environment.
9. Applicability. This standard is applicable in any situation where it is desirable to integrate a client-side productivity
tool or a server-side data repository into an SQL environment. It is a non-mandatory standard that may be invoked on
a case-by-case basis subject to the integration objectives of the procuring department or agency. It is particularly
suitable for specifying limited SQL interfaces to legacy databases or to specialized data repositories not under
the control of a full-function SQL database management system. It can be used along with other procurement information
to specify SQL interface requirements for a wide range of data management procurements.
One special area of application envisioned for this standard is Electronic Commerce, a National Challenge Application
area of the National Information Infrastructure. The primary objective of Electronic Commerce is to integrate communications,
data management, and security services in a distributed processing environment, thereby allowing business applications
within different organizations to interoperate and exchange information automatically. At the data management
level, electronic commerce requires a logically integrated database of diverse data stored in geographically separated
data banks under the management and control of heterogeneous database management systems. An over-riding requirement
is that these diverse data managers be able to communicate with one another and provide shared access to data and data
operations and methods under appropriate security, integrity, and access control mechanisms. FIPS SQL provides
a powerful database language for data definition, data manipulation, and integrity management to satisfy many of
these requirements. It is unrealistic to expect that every data manager involved in electronic commerce will conform
to even the Entry SQL level of the FIPS SQL standard; however, it is not unrealistic to require that they support a limited
SQL interface, even a read-only interface, provided by one of the SQL/ERI Server profiles. New procurements to add
components to the National Information Infrastructure, or to upgrade existing components, can define the necessary
SQL schemas and point to appropriate SQL/ERI Server profiles as procurement requirements.
This standard may also be applicable, on a case-by-case basis, in many of the following areas:



Legacy databases
Full-Text document databases
Geographic Information Systems
Bibliographic information retrieval

Object database interfaces
Federal data distribution
Operating system file interface
Open system directory interface
Electronic mail repositories
CASE tool repositories
XBase repositories
C++ sequence class repositories
Object Request Broker interface repository
Real-time database interface
Internet file repositories



Further detail on each of these potential application areas can be found in Section 8, ``Applicability'', of the FIPS
specification of SQL Environments.
10. Specifications. See the Specifications for SQL Environments_SQL External Repository Interface (SQL/ERI)_Server
Profiles (Affixed).
11. Implementation. Implementation of this standard involves four areas of consideration: the effective date,
acquisition of conforming implementations, interpretation, and validation.
11.1 Effective date. This publication is effective immediately upon publication. Since it is a nonmandatory
specification, based on the established FIPS SQL standard, and used at the discretion of individual Federal procurements,
no transitional period or delayed effective date is necessary.
11.2 Acquisition. All conforming implementations of a specific SQL/ERI profile will support some aspects
of the FIPS SQL standard. However, such implementations will not normally be full function database management systems
and conformance will often be dependent upon SQL schema definitions and other requirements provided as part of each
individual procurement. In most cases, a procurement will not be able to simply point to an SQL/ERI profile and demand
conformance to it. Instead, successful procurements will normally use an appropriate SQL/ERI profile, together
with an application-specific schema definition, as one aspect of overall procurement requirements. In many cases,
vendors of products that provide a limited SQL interface will define their interfaces in terms of a fixed SQL schema
definition. In those cases, procurements can point to the vendor-provided schema definition and to an appropriate
SQL/ERI profile as a procurement requirement. In some cases, especially in those situations where schema definitions
and requirements are not known in advance, a request for a proposal (RFP) many require that an SQL schema, and adherence
to one of the SQL/ERI Server profiles, be presented as part of the response proposal.
11.3 Interpretation. NIST provides for the resolution of questions regarding specifications and requirements
of the FIPS for SQL Environments, and issues official interpretations as needed. Procedures for interpretations
are specified in FIPS PUB 29-3. All questions about the interpretation of FIPS SQL Environments should be addressed
to:



Director, Computer Systems Laboratory, Attn: SQL Environments, National Institute of Standards and Technology,
Gaithersburg, MD 20899, Telephone: (301) 975-2833



11.4 Validation. Implementations of the FIPS for SQL Environments may be validated in accordance with NIST
Computer Systems Laboratory (CSL) validation procedures for FIPS SQL (FIPS PUB 127). Recommended procurement terminology
for validation of FIPS SQL is contained in the U.S. General Services Administration publication 

Federal ADP & Telecommunications Standards Index, 

Chapter 4 Part 2. This GSA publication provides terminology for three validation options: Delayed Validation, Prior
Validation Testing, and Prior Validation. The agency may select the appropriate validation option and may specify
appropriate time frames for validation and correction of nonconformities.
Implementations may be evaluated using the NIST SQL Test Suite, a suite of automated validation tests for SQL implementations.
Although this test suite was designed to test conformance of full-function SQL database management systems, it can
be modified to accommodate testing of SQL/ERI Server implementations. The results of validation testing by the SQL
Testing Service are published on a quarterly basis in the 

Validated Products List, 

available from the National Technical Information Service (NTIS).
Current information about the NIST SQL Validation Service and the status of validation testing for SQL Environments
is available from:



National Institute of Standards and Technology, Computer Systems Laboratory, Software Standards Validation Group,
Building 225, Room A266, Gaithersburg, Maryland 20899, (301) 975-2490.

 Policy statement.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Farm Credit Administration (FCA) Board adopted a ``Policy Statement on Regulatory Philosophy'' [BM-17-FEB-94-02;
FCA-PS-59] on February 17, 1994. This policy statement is in final form; however, pursuant to the ``Policy
Statement on Rules for Transaction of Business and Operational Responsibilities of the Farm Credit Administration
Board'' [NV-94-05 (07-FEB-94); FCA-PS-58], Article VII, Section 2(b), this
Policy Statement should be reviewed by the FCA Board no later than February 17, 1999.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The text of the Board's policy statement concerning regulatory philosophy is set forth below in its entirety:


Policy Statement on Regulatory Philosophy; BM-17-FEB-94-02; FCA-PS-59




Effective Date:

 Upon adoption.


Effect on Previous Action:

 None.


Source of Authority:

 Farm Credit Act of 1971, as amended; 12 U.S.C. 2001 

et seq.
THE FCA BOARD HEREBY ADOPTS THE FOLLOWING POLICY STATEMENT:
The FCA shall develop regulations consistent with its authorities under the Farm Credit Act of 1971 (Act), as amended,
and other relevant statutes. It is the FCA Board's philosophy to promulgate regulations that are necessary to implement
the law and to promote the safety and soundness of the Farm Credit System (System). In general, the Board's regulatory
objective will be to:



Protect the public, the investors, and the customer/shareholders of the System in an effort to create an environment
whereby customer/shareholders and investors can take advantage of the System's strength and rely on its future viability
with confidence.



The FCA Board believes that safe and sound operations of System institutions will promote: (a) Investor confidence
in System debt securities, which works to ensure adequate funds at reasonable rates for lending to customer/shareholders;
and, (b) customer/shareholder confidence in each cooperatively owned System institution, which works to ensure
customers and capital.
To effectively achieve its objective, the FCA will do the following:
1. The FCA will promulgate regulations only as required by law, as necessary to interpret the law, or as necessary to
promote the safe and sound operation of System institutions.
2. The FCA will work to eliminate outdated regulations and ensure that its regulations implement the purposes of the
law without unnecessary burden or cost. The FCA Board recognizes that some costs and benefits are difficult to quantify
and that some are qualitative, but essential to consider. When there is a significant cost impact, the FCA will consider
the risk or problem, as well as the costs associated with a regulatory solution, from the perspective of the customer/shareholder,
the System institution, the investor, and the regulator, including when appropriate a numerically-based cost analysis.
In choosing among alternatives, the FCA will adopt its regulatory approach based upon a reasoned determination that
the benefits of the intended regulations justify their cost.
3. The FCA will strive to ensure that each regulation has a well-defined objective. Regulations will address specific
identified risks or problems. The Board will consider these risks from the perspective of the customer/shareholder,
the System institution, the investor, and the regulator. Preambles to regulations will explain the FCA Board's rationale
for the regulatory solution adopted. Consistent with its statutory authority, the FCA will establish a regulatory
environment that grants System institutions the business flexibility to offer a full range of high quality, low cost
credit and other services to customer/shareholders.
4. The FCA's regulations shall, to the extent feasible, specify performance criteria and objectives rather than
operational methods for achieving its purposes. The FCA recognizes that it does not manage the day-to-day activities
of System institutions. Operational constraints that are imposed by regulations should be based on specific statutory
requirements or the achievement of regulatory objectives.
5. In setting regulatory priorities, the FCA, to the extent it has discretion, will give high priority to issues that
pose the greatest risk within the Farm Credit System.
6. The FCA will carefully consider policy positions of the other financial regulators to determine whether or not
consistency facilitates the objectives of the Act. The FCA Board recognizes that differences between the System
and non-agricultural lenders will at times warrant different approaches.
7. The FCA will draft its regulations and policy statements to be clear and easy to understand, with the goal of minimizing
the potential for ambiguity, uncertainty, and resultant litigation.
8. The FCA will utilize appropriate innovative approaches to seeking the public's perspective regarding regulatory
proposals.
The FCA Board will take these principles into consideration as its considers the need for and the content of new regulatory
initiatives and as it reviews existing regulations to determine their continuing need and effectiveness. The FCA
Board is mindful that most regulatory activities will involve competing considerations and is committed to considering
and weighing those competing considerations and arriving at thoughtful regulatory judgments.



Adopted this 17th day of February, 1994, by order of the Board.

Take notice that on June 13, 1994, Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America (Natural), 701 East 22nd Street, Lombard

construction cost of $14,650,000 for the jurisdictional facilities and approximately $6,137,000 for the non-jurisdictional
facilities.

Natural is amending its application, by deleting its proposal to construct and operate all jurisdictional facilities
proposed in Docket No. CP93-745-000. Natural further proposes to amend its original filing to this proceeding
by increasing its maximum daily deliverability at three of Natural's existing storage fields by 175 MMcf per day original
proposed in Docket No. CP93-745-000.

Any person desiring to be heard or to make any protest with reference to said amendment should on or before July 1, 1994,

with the requirements of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR   385.214 or 385.211)
and the Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR  157.10). All protests filed with the Commission will be
considered by it in determining the appropriate action to be taken but will not serve to make the protestants parties
to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party to a proceeding or to participate as a party in any hearing therein
must file a motion to intervene in accordance with the Commission's Rules. All persons who have heretofore filed need
not file again.

Take notice that on May 31, 1994, Southern California Gas Company (SoCalGas) filed pursuant to  284.123(b)(2)
of the Commission's regulations, a petition for rate approval requesting that the Commission approve as fair and
equitable a rate of $.7414 per Dth for wheeling services and $1.4149 per Dth for parking and loaning services performed
under  311(a)(2) of the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 (NGPA).

SoCalGas states that it is an intrastate pipeline within the meaning of section 2(16) of the NGPA and it owns and operates
an intrastate pipeline system in the State of California. SoCalGas proposes an effective date of July 1, 1994.

Pursuant to  284.123(b)(2)(ii), if the Commission does not act within 150 days of the filing date, the rate will
be deemed to be fair and equitable and not in excess of an amount which interstate pipelines would be permitted to charge
for similar transportation service. The Commission may, prior to the expiration of the 150-day period, extend the
time for action or institute a proceeding to afford parties an opportunity for written comments and for the oral presentation
of views, data, and arguments.

Any person desiring to participate in this rate proceeding must file a motion to intervene in accordance with   385.211

</ACTION>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On May 6, 1993, the Office of Hearings and Appeals of the Department of Energy issued a Decision and Order setting forth
final refund procedures to distribute the monies in the escrow account established in accordance with the terms of
an Agreed Judgment entered into between the Department of Energy and Whitaker Oil Company. 

See Whitaker Oil Co.,

 23 DOE  85,054 (1993), 58 FR 28009 (May 12, 1993). That Decision established a filing deadline 90 days from the
date the Whitaker Decision and Order appeared in the 

Federal Register

. Thus, August 10, 1993 was the deadline for the submission of refund applications for direct restitution by purchasers
of Whitaker's kerosene, toluene, xylene, and diesel fuel. 23 DOE at 88,138.


The Office of Hearings and Appeals began accepting refund applications in the Whitaker proceeding on June 8, 1993.
All of the Applications for Refund filed in the Whitaker proceeding have been considered and resolved. Furthermore,
in view of the extended period of time that has transpired since the commencement of the proceeding, we have concluded
that all eligible applicants have been provided with more than ample time to file. Accordingly, as of the date of issuance
of this Notice, the proceeding established to distribute funds from the escrow account maintained pursuant to the
Agreed Judgment entered into between the DOE and Whitaker Oil Company is closed. Any unclaimed funds remaining after
all meritorious claims have been paid will be made available for indirect restitution pursuant to the Petroleum Overcharge
Distribution and Restitution Act of 1986, 15 U.S.C.  4501.

<DOCTITLE>Receipt of Application for Emergency Exemption to use Pirate Insecticide; </DOCTITLE>
Solicitation of Public Comment 





<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 




</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice. 






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 EPA has received a specific exemption request from the Louisiana Department of Agriculture and Forestry (hereafter
referred to as the ``Applicant'') for use of the pesticide, 4-bromo-2-(4-chlorophenyl)-1-(ethoxymethyl)-5-(trifluoromethyl)-1

H

pyrrole-3-carbonitrile, to control beet armyworms (BAW) on up to 200,000 acres of cotton in Louisiana. In accordance
with 40 CFR 166.24, EPA is soliciting public comment before making the decision whether or not to grant the exemption.





</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Pursuant to section 18 of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) (7 U.S.C. 136p), the Administrator
may, at her discretion, exempt a State agency from any registration provision of FIFRA if she determines that emergency
conditions exist which require such exemption. The Applicant has requested the Administrator to issue a specific
exemption for use of the insecticide, 4-bromo-2-(4-chlorophenyl)-1-(ethoxymethyl)-5-(trifluoromethyl)-1

H

-pyrrole-3-carbonitrile, available as Pirate 3SC from American Cyanamid Company, to control beet armyworms (BAW)
on up to 200,000 acres of cotton in Louisiana. Information in accordance with 40 CFR part 166 was submitted as part of
this request.



According to the Applicant, BAW is an occasional pest of cotton in Louisiana which seldom causes economic damage.
However, under favorable environmental conditions, BAW populations can increase to extremely high levels and cause
severe economic losses. In 1993, a severe outbreak cost affected Louisiana cotton producers $15 to $85 per acre. According
to the Applicant, the registered pesticides provide only partial control of BAW. If Pirate Insecticide is not available
for use and another outbreak occurs, the Applicant claims that yield losses of 10 to 20 percent may occur, resulting
in significant economic losses for affected growers.

Under the proposed exemption, a maximum of two ground applications of Pirate 3SC would be made at 8.53 fluid ounces
of product (0.2 pounds active ingredient) per acre. No applications would be made within 21 days of harvest. A maximum
of 40,000 pounds of active ingredient would be needed to treat up to 200,000 acres of cotton.

This notice does not constitute a decision by EPA on the application itself. The regulations governing section 18
require that the Agency publish notice of receipt in the 

Federal Register

 and solicit public comment on an application for a specific exemption proposing use of a new chemical (i.e., an active
ingredient not contained in any currently registered pesticide) [40 CFR 166.24 (a)(1)]. 4-bromo-2-(4-chlorophenyl)-1-(ethoxymethyl)-5-(trifluoromethyl)-1

H

-pyrrole-3-carbonitrile is a new chemical. Accordingly, interested persons may submit written views on this subject
to the Field Operations Division at the address above. The Agency will review and consider all comments received during
the comment period in determining whether to issue the emergency exemption requested by the Louisiana Department
of Agriculture and Forestry.

<DOCTITLE>Receipt of Application for Emergency Exemption To Use Imidacloprid; </DOCTITLE>

Solicitation of Public Comment 





<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 





</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice. 






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 EPA has received specific exemption requests from the California Environmental Protection Agency, Department
of Pesticide Regulation (hereafter referred to as the ``Applicant'') to use the pesticide imidacloprid (CAS 105827-78-9)
to treat up to 22,000 acres of broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower, and rapini, and up to 40,000 acres of head and leaf lettuce,
to control the silverleaf, or sweet potato whitefly (

Bemesia tabaci

). 
The Applicant proposes the first food use of an active ingredient; therefore, in accordance with 40 CFR 166.24, EPA
is soliciting public comment before making the decision whether or not to grant the exemption. 




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Pursuant to Section 18 of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) (7 U.S.C. 136p), the Administrator
may, at her discretion, exempt a state agency from any registration provision of FIFRA if she determines that emergency
conditions exist which require such exemption. The Applicant has requested the Administrator to issue specific
exemptions for the use of imidacloprid on broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower, and head and leaf lettuce to control the
silverleaf whitefly (SLW). Information in accordance with 40 CFR part 166 was submitted as part of these requests.




Whiteflies have been a problem in the ``desert-cropping systems'' in California and Arizona for some time, but in
1990, a new strain (possibly a new species) was discovered, which appears to be much more prolific than the standard
strain, and resistant to many insecticides. Whiteflies are common on many wild and cultivated crops such as tomatoes,
cotton, cucurbits and solanaceae. The Applicant states that this new strain caused devastation to many crops in 1991
in California's Imperial Valley, with crop losses over $120 million. Whiteflies cause direct damage through feeding
activities and indirectly through the production of honeydew which enhances sooty mold development. The Applicant
claims that adequate control of this pest is not being achieved with the currently registered compounds. The Applicant
claims that without control of this pest, growers could expect up to 50 percent yield losses, causing significant
economic losses. 

The Applicant proposes to apply imidacloprid at a maximum rate of 0.3016 lb. active ingredient (20 fluid oz. of product)
per acre with a maximum of one application, at or near planting, per crop season on a total of 62,000 acres of the above-listed
crops. For each of the crops named, it is possible to produce two crops per calendar year on a given acre, and therefore,
the acreage could potentially receive two applications of imidacloprid per calendar year. However, the Applicant
proposed to limit the maximum amount which could be applied per calendar year to 0.5 lb. a.i. (32 fl. oz. product) per
acre. Therefore, use under this exemption could potentially amount to a maximum total of 31,000 lbs. of active ingredient,
or 15,500 gal. of product. This is the second time that the Applicant has applied for the use of imidacloprid on the named
crops, and exemptions were issued for this use in California last year. 

This notice does not constitute a decision by EPA on the application itself. The regulations governing section 18
require publication of a notice of receipt in the 

Federal Register

 and solicit public comment on an application for a specific exemption proposing the first food use of an active ingredient.
Accordingly, interested persons may submit written views on this subject to the Field Operations Division at the
address above. 

The Agency, accordingly, will review and consider all comments received during the comment period in determining
whether to issue the emergency exemption requested by the California Department of Pesticide Regulation.

<DOCTITLE>Receipt of Application for Emergency Exemption To Use Pirate Insecticide; </DOCTITLE>

Solicitation of Public Comment 





<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).




</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 EPA has received a specific exemption request from the Georgia Department of Agriculture (hereafter referred to
as the ``Applicant'') for use of the pesticide, 4-bromo-2-(4-chlorophenyl)-1-(ethoxymethyl)-5-(trifluoromethyl)-1

H

-pyrrole-3-carbonitrile, to control beet armyworms (BAW) on up to 25,000 acres of cotton in Georgia. In accordance
with 40 CFR 166.24, EPA is soliciting public comment before making the decision whether or not to grant the exemption.





</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Pursuant to section 18 of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) (7 U.S.C. 136p), the Administrator
may, at her discretion, exempt a State agency from any registration provision of FIFRA if she determines that emergency
conditions exist which require such exemption. The Applicant has requested the Administrator to issue a specific
exemption for use of the insecticide, 4-bromo-2-(4-chlorophenyl)-1-(ethoxymethyl)-5-(trifluoromethyl)-1H-pyrrole-3-carbonitrile,
available as Pirate 3SC from American Cyanamid Company, to control beet armyworms (BAW) on up to 25,000 acres of cotton
in Georgia. Information in accordance with 40 CFR part 166 was submitted as part of this request. 



According to the Applicant, BAW has historically been a late-season pest of cotton, particularly in drought years.
However, the use of organophosphate insecticides in the Boll Weevil Eradication Program has disrupted the natural
biological control of BAW, causing it to become a serious, season-long problem in certain years. According to the
Applicant, the registered pesticides provide only partial control of BAW. If Pirate Insecticide is not available
for use and a severe outbreak occurs, the Applicant claims that yield losses of up to 100 percent are possible in some
fields. 

Under the proposed exemption, a maximum of two ground applications of Pirate 3SC would be made at 8.53 fluid ounces
of product (0.2 pounds active ingredient) per acre. No applications would be made within 21 days of harvest. A maximum
of 10,000 pounds of active ingredient would be needed to treat up to 25,000 acres of cotton. 

This notice does not constitute a decision by EPA on the application itself. The regulations governing section 18
require that the Agency publish notice of receipt in the 

Federal Register

 and solicit public comment on an application for a specific exemption proposing use of a new chemical (i.e., an active
ingredient not contained in any currently registered pesticide) [40 CFR 166.24 (a)(1)]. 4-bromo-2-(4-chlorophenyl)-1-(ethoxymethyl)-5-(trifluoromethyl)-1

H

-pyrrole-3-carbonitrile is a new chemical. Accordingly, interested persons may submit written views on this subject
to the Field Operations Division at the address above. The Agency will review and consider all comments received during
the comment period in determining whether to issue the emergency exemption requested by the Georgia Department of
Agriculture.

Solicitation of Nominations for Membership 




<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.


 

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Board is inviting the public to nominate qualified individuals for appointment to its Consumer Advisory Council,
which is comprised of representatives both of consumer and community interests and of the financial services industry.
Thirteen new members will be selected for three-year terms that will begin in January 1995. The Board expects to announce
the selection of new members by year-end 1994.

 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Consumer Advisory Council was established in 1976 at the direction of Congress to advise the Federal Reserve Board
on the exercise of its duties under the Consumer Credit Protection Act and on other consumer-related matters. The
Council by law represents the interests both of consumers and of the financial community. Members serve three-year
terms that are staggered to provide the Council with 
continuity. 




New members will be selected for terms beginning January 1, 1995, to replace members whose terms expire this year.


Nominations should include the address and telephone number of the nominee, information about past and present positions
held, and a description of special knowledge, interests or experience related to consumer credit or other consumer
financial services.

 Persons may nominate themselves as well as other candidates. 


The Board is interested in candidates who have some familiarity with consumer financial services and candidates
who are willing to express their viewpoints. Candidates do not have to be experts on all levels of consumer financial
services, but they should possess some basic knowledge of the area. In addition, they should be able to make the necessary
time commitment to prepare for and attend meetings (usually two days long including committee meetings) three times
a year. 


In making the appointments, the Board will seek to complement the qualifications of continuing Council members in
terms of affiliation and geographic representation, and to ensure the representation of women and minority groups.
The Board expects to announce its selection of new members by year-end.

<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The proposed information collection requirement described below has been submitted to the Office of Management
and Budget (OMB) for expedited review, as required by the Paperwork Reduction Act. The Department is soliciting public
comments on the subject proposal.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

This Notice informs the public that the Department of Housing and Urban Development has submitted to OMB, for expedited
processing, an information collection package with respect to owner application for funds for a special adjustment
for drug-related security retrofitting for Section 8 Moderate Rehabilitation projects.





Funds were appropriated for drug-related security retrofitting for Section 8 Moderate Rehabilitation projects
by Departments of Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban Development, and Independent Agencies Appropriations
Act of 1994 (Pub. L. 103-124, approved October 28, 1993).

HUD intends to provide six million dollars to Section 8 Moderate Rehabilitation owners who apply and are approved
for a special adjustment for drug-related security retrofitting.

The form provides for owners of Section 8 Moderate Rehabilitation projects to apply for Fiscal Year 1994 funds for
special rent adjustments for security retrofitting. It also provides for Housing Agencies (HAs) to review and comment
on the owner's application, for the HUD Field Office to approve or disapprove the owner's application. All funding
decisions regarding approved application will be made on a first come first served basis until the available funding
has been depleted.
The Department has submitted the proposal for the collection of information as described below, to OMB for review,
as required by the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. Chapter 25); 
(1) 

The title of the information collection proposal: 

Form HUD-52662, Owner Application, Funds for Special Adjustment for Drug-Related Security Retrofitting,
Section 8 Moderate Rehabilitation Program.
(2) 

Office of the agency to collect the information: 

Office of the Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing.
(3) 

The description of the need for the information and its proposed use: 

The data that will be collected on the form is necessary for HUD to determine whether a Moderate Rehabilitation project
meets the statutory and administrative requirements necessary for HUD approval of funds for a special adjustment
for drug-related security retrofitting.
(4) 

Agency form number: 

Form HUD-52662.
(5) 

Members of the public who will be affected by the proposal: 

Owners of Section 8 Moderate Rehabilitation projects; HAs with Section 8 Moderate Rehabilitation Programs.
(6) 

How frequently information submissions will be required: 

Once a year in years when Congress appropriates funds for this purpose.
(7) 

An estimate of the total number of hours needed to prepare the information submissions including number of respondents,
frequency of response, and hours of response: 

Two hundred Moderate Rehabilitation owners are expected to apply voluntarily for the special adjustment for security
retrofitting in Fiscal Year 1994. Owners will spend approximately three (3) hours competing the form. HA review of
the form will take approximately one (1) hour. HUD Field Office review of the form will take approximately one (1) hour.
This process will take place no more than once a year for funding purposes; Fiscal Year 1994 is the first year such funding
has occurred, and it is not know whether future fiscal years will provide another opportunity for owners to apply for
these funds. Total Fiscal Year 1994 hours of response is 1,000.
(8) 

Type of request: 

New request.

SF 83 Supporting Statement for Requests for OMB Approval Under the Paperwork Reduction Act and 5 CFR 1320



A. Justification



1. 

Explain the circumstances that make the collection of information necessary. Include the identification of any
legal or administrative requirements that necessitate the collection.

Congress has appropriated six million dollars for Fiscal Year 1994 for special adjustments to cover the costs of drug-related
security measures at selected Section 8 Moderate Rehabilitation projects. The statutory authority for special
adjustments to Section 8 Moderate Rehabilitation Contract Rents is in Section 8(c)(2)(B) of the U.S. Housing Act
of 1937 as amended by the Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act of 1990 at Section 542. Section 8(c)(2)(B)
states the following: ``Where the Secretary determines that a project assisted under this section is located in a
community where drug-related criminal activity is generally prevalent and the project's operating, maintenance,
and capital repair expenses have been substantially increased primarily as a result of the prevalence of such drug-related
activity, the Secretary may (at the discretion of the Secretary and subject to the availability of appropriations
for contract amendments for this purpose), on a project-by-project basis, provide adjustments to the maximum monthly
rents, to a level no greater than 120 percent of the project rents, to cover the costs of maintenance, security, capital
repairs, and reserves required for the owner to carry out a strategy acceptable to the Secretary for addressing the
problem of drug-related criminal activity.'' Form HUD-52662, Owner Application, Funds for Special Adjustment
for Drug-Related Security Retrofitting, Section 8 Moderate Rehabilitation Program, provides for owners of Section
8 Moderate Rehabilitation projects to apply for Fiscal Year 1994 funds for special rent adjustments for security.
Owner application is voluntary.

2. Indicate how, by whom, and for what purpose the information is to be used and the consequence to Federal program or
policy activities if the collection of information was not conducted.

The information collected on Form HUD-52662 is to be used by Housing Agencies administering Moderate Rehabilitation
Programs and HUD Field Office staff to evaluate the eligibility and need of project owners applying for the funds for
special adjustments for security, and as a basis for assigning funds. If this collection of information was not conducted,
the Department would be unable to assign Fiscal Year 1994 funds for special adjustments for security for Moderate
Rehabilitation projects.

3. Describe any consideration of the use of improved information technology to reduce burden and any technical or
legal obstacles to reducing burden.

Form HUD-52662 will collect information by Housing Assistance Payments (HAP) Contract Number. Field Office
staff will be able to check information on the incoming HUD-52662 by using the newly available Control Files
System (CFS) containing Moderate Rehabilitation HAP Contract information. CFS will reduce the burden to Field Office
staff in evaluating the information in the HUD-52662.

4. Describe efforts to identify duplication.

The Department is not collecting this data through any other information collection mechanism. Owners are not asked
to provide data of Form HUD-52662. Owners are not asked to provide data of Form HUD-52662 that can be obtained
from other HUD computerized files.

5. Show specifically why any similar information already available cannot be used or modified for use for the purpose(2)
described in 

#

2.

Similar information (description of criminal activity in the neighborhood of the Moderate Rehabilitation project;
impact of the drug-related criminal activity on the project's operating, maintenance and capital repair expenses;
owner's strategy to address the problem of drug-related criminal activity; and security items needed) is not already
available from other sources.

6. 

If the collection of information involves small businesses or other small entities, describe the methods used to
minimize burden.

The collection of information may involve small businesses of other small entities that own Moderate Rehabilitation
projects. These entities are under no obligation to complete the application, and will do so on a voluntary basis if
they believe they can benefit from the funds. Form HUD-52662 takes no more than three hours for an owner to complete.

7. Describe the consequence to Federal program or policy activities if the collection were conducted less frequently.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940622-2-00054 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940622-2-00039 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 


The collection will occur only in years in which Congress has appropriated funds for special adjustments for security
for Moderate Rehabilitation projects. 

8. Explain any special circumstances that require the collection to be conducted in a manner inconsistent with the
guidelines in 5 CFR 1320.6. 

This information collection does not violate 5 CFR 1320.6. 
9. Describe efforts to consult with persons outside the agency to obtain their views on the availability of data, frequency
of collection, the clarity of instructions and record-keeping, disclosure, or reporting format (if any), and on
the data elements to be recorded, disclosed, or reported. (Consultation should occur at least once every 3 years.)


In the supporting statement, provide: 
a. The names and telephone numbers of those consulted and the year in which the consultation took place. Indicate the
agencies, companies, State or local governments, or other organizations represented by those consulted. 

b. A summary of any major problems that could not be resolved during consultation. 

c. A description of other public contacts and opportunities for public comment, and a summary of the comments received.


The parties outside the agency who would have an interest in commenting on Form HUD-52662 are Housing Agencies
(HAs) administering Moderate Rehabilitation Programs and Moderate Rehabilitation project owners. Since the form
must be approved for use in assigning funds appropriated for the current fiscal year, time does not permit the opportunity
for HAs and owners to comment. HAs and owners have expressed interest to the Department in having a mechanism for funding
special adjustments for security. 

10. Describe any assurance of confidentiality provided to respondents and the basis for the assurance in statute,
regulation, or agency policy. 

Section 8 owners who choose to use Form HUD-52662 to apply for special adjustments for security are accustomed
to providing information on the nature of project operations through their ongoing participation in the Section
8 Program. HAs and HUD staff are aware of many of the particulars of the ownership, financial and physical conditions
of projects under HAP Contract. The additional information requested on Form HUD-52662 regarding drug-related
criminal activity and its impact on the project is considered non-confidential and customary under the program.


11. Provide additional justification for any questions of a sensitive nature, such as sexual behavior and attitudes,
religious beliefs, and other matters that are commonly considered private. This justification should include the
reasons why the agency considers the questions necessary, the specific uses to be made of the information, the explanation
to be given to persons from whom the information is requested, and any steps to be taken to obtain their consent. 

There are no questions of this nature in the collection. 
12. Provide estimates of annualized cost to the Federal Government and to the respondents. Also provide a description
of the method use to estimate cost, which should include quantification of hours, operational expenses (such as equipment,
overhead, printing, and support staff), and any other expense that would not have been incurred without the paperwork
burden. 

An owner who chooses to use the form will spend approximately three (3) hours completing the form. Housing Agency review
of the form will take approximately one (1) hour. HUD Field Office review of the form will take approximately one (1)
hour. This process will take place no more than once a year for funding purposes; Fiscal Year 1994 is the first year such
funding has occurred, and it is not know whether future fiscal years will provide another opportunity for owners to
apply for these funds. 
13. Provide estimates of the burden of the collection of information. The statement should:
 
Provide number of respondents, frequency of response, annual burden, and an explanation of how the burden was estimated.
Unless directed to do so, agencies should not make special survey to obtain information on which to base burden estimates.
Consultation with a few potential respondents is desirable. If the burden on respondents is expected to vary widely
because of differences in activity, size, or complexity, show the range of estimated burden, and explain the reasons
for the variance. 
 
If the request for approval is for more than one form, provide burden estimates for each form for which approval is sought
and summarize the burdens on the SF 83. 
 
If the proposed collection of information was not included in the agency's Information Collection Budget (ICB) or
if the burden show on the SF 83 is different from that in the ICB, explain the difference. 

Two hundred Moderate Rehabilitation owners are expected to apply for the special adjustment for security in Fiscal
Year 1994. The annual ``burden'' will be once per year, if Congress provides appropriations after the current fiscal
year. 
14. Explain reasons for changes in burden, including the need for any increase. 

This is a new information collection requirement, since this is the first time Congress has appropriated funds for
this purpose. 
15. For collections of information whose results are planned to be published for statistical use, outline plans for
tabulation, statistical analysis, and publication. Provide the time schedule for the entire project, including
beginning and ending dates of the collection of information, completion of report, publication dates, and other
actions.

Intent To Amend Two Land Use Plans for a Proposed Withdrawal


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Bureau of Land Management, Interior.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of Intent and Scoping Period.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Bureau of land Management (BLM) is proposing to amend the Caliente Management Framework Plan (MFP) and the Nellis
Air Force Range Resources Plan (RP) to analyze a proposed withdrawal by the Nellis Air Force Base. The withdrawal would
involve 3,972 acres of public land in the White Sides Area of the BLM's Caliente Resource Area, Lincoln County, Nevada.
This amendment is proposed to be an environmental assessment (EA) level amendment. 


A 30 day scoping period is being conducted to give the public an opportunity to comment on this proposed amendment and
the following tentative issues: (1) Oil and gas leasing; (2) Off-road vehicle use; (3) Locatable minerals; and (4)
Access. In addition to the proposed withdrawal and the no action alternative, the public is also invited to suggest
alternatives to be analyzed in this amendment.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The purpose of the proposed withdrawal of the White Sides area, located adjacent to the Nellis Air Force Range, is to
provide a security buffer to the Nellis Air Force Range.


The White Sides area is currently managed by the Caliente MFP. The adjacent Nellis Air Force Range is withdrawn for
military purposes (see Public Laws 99-606 and 100-338) and its natural and cultural resources are managed
by the BLM through the Nellis Air Force Range Resource Plan (RP). If this area is to be withdrawn, its management would
be similar to that of this RP. Therefore, it is proposed that the Caliente MFP be amended to not include the management
of the subject 3,972 acres and the Nellis Air Force Range RP be amended to include the management of the subject 3,972
acres. 
Management of resources that may be changed by this amendment include: (1) Oil and gas leasing; (2) Off-road vehicle
use; (3) Locatable minerals; and (4) Access. Thus, they become tentative issues that will be addressed in one or more
of the alternatives of the amendment. Issue 1. Oil and gas leasing: The area is currently open to leasing under the Caliente
MFP Minerals decision 2.0. The proposed withdrawal could impact oil and gas exploration and development. Issue 2.
Locatable minerals: The subject area is open to locatable mining under the Caliente Minerals decision 1.1. The proposed
withdrawal would close the land under the mining laws. Issue 3. Recreation/Off-Road Vehicle Use: The subject area
is currently open to sight-seeing, recreational, and off-road vehicle use under Caliente MFP Recreation Decision
R-2. The proposed withdrawal would close the area to public access. 
This amendment will analyze the impacts of several alternatives to the proposed withdrawal, including the no action
alternative. 
Federal, state and local agencies, and other individuals or organizations who are interested in/or affected by aspects
of the proposed amendment and environmental assessment, are invited to participate in this planning process. Comments
and recommendations will be accepted only on those subjects being addressed by this amendment.

Determination 


On the basis of the record

 developed in the subject investigation, the Commission determines,

2

 pursuant to section 735(b) of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C.  1673d(b)) (the Act), that an industry in the United
States is materially injured by reason of imports from the Netherlands of aramid fiber formed of poly para-phenylene

<DOCTITLE>Revised Aggregate Production Quotas for Controlled Substances in Schedules I and II</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), Justice.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of final revised aggregate production quotas for 1994.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This notice establishes revised 1994 aggregate production quotas for controlled substances in Schedules I and II
of the Controlled Substances Act (CSA).



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Section 306 of the CSA (21 U.S.C. 826) requires the Attorney General to establish aggregate production quotas for
controlled substances in Schedules I and II each year. This responsibility has been delegated to the Administrator
of the DEA pursuant to  0.100 of title 28 of the Code of Federal Regulations. The Administrator, in turn, has redelegated
this function to the Deputy Administrator pursuant to 59 FR 23637 (May 6, 1994).



On April 13, 1994, a notice of the proposed revised 1994 aggregate production quotas for certain controlled substances
in Schedules I and II was published in the 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 17568). All interested parties were invited to comment on or object to these proposed aggregate production
quotas on or before May 13, 1994.

Several companies commented that the revised 1994 aggregate production quotas for amphetamine, codeine (for sale),
d-desoxyephedrine, opium, oxycodone (for sale), pentobarbital and secobarbital were insufficient to provide
for the estimated medical, scientific, research and industry needs of the United States, for export requirements
and for the establishment and maintenance of reserve stocks.

The DEA has reviewed the involved companies' 1993 year-end inventories, their initial 1994 manufacturing quotas,
1994 export requirements and their actual and projected 1994 sales. Based on this data, the DEA has adjusted the revised
1994 aggregate production quotas for amphetamine, codeine (for sale), d-desoxyephedrine, opium, oxycodone (for
sale), pentobarbital and secobarbital to meet the estimated medical, scientific, research and industrial needs
of the United States.

Regarding levorphanol, methylphenidate, phencyclidine and sufentanil, DEA has received updated information
from several manufacturers which shows the necessity for adjustments of the revised 1994 aggregate production quotas
for these controlled substances. The adjustments will provide for the estimated medical, scientific, research
and industrial needs of the United States and for the establishment and maintenance of reserve stocks. The DEA has
adjusted the 1994 revised aggregate production quotas for levorphanol, methylphenidate, phencyclidine and sufentanil
accordingly.

The Office of Management and Budget has determined that notices of aggregate production quotas are not subject to
centralized review under Executive Order 12866. This action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles
and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612, and it has been determined that this matter does not have sufficient
Federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.

The Deputy Administrator hereby certifies that this action will have no significant impact upon small entities whose
interests must be considered under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601 

et. seq. 

The establishment of aggregate production quotas for Schedules I and II controlled substances is mandated by law
and by international treaty obligations. While aggregate production quotas are of primary importance to large manufacturers,
their impact upon small entities is neither negative nor beneficial. Accordingly, the Deputy Administrator has
determined that this action does not require a regulatory flexibility analysis.

Therefore, under the authority vested in the Attorney General by section 306 of the Controlled Substances Act of 1970
(21 U.S.C. 826), delegated to the Administrator of the DEA by  0.100 of title 28 of the Code of Federal Regulations,
and redelegated to the Deputy Administrator pursuant to 59 FR 23637 (May 6, 1994), the Deputy Administrator hereby
orders that the 1994 revised aggregate production quotas, expressed in grams of anhydrous acid or base, be established
as follows:

<DOCTITLE>Linwood T. Townsend, D.D.S.; Denial of Application</DOCTITLE>


On March 12, 1993, the Deputy Assistant Administrator, Office of Diversion Control, Drug Enforcement Administration
(DEA), issued an Order to Show Cause to Linwood Thomas Townsend, D.D.S., Respondent, at 1285 N.E. 148th Street, North
Miami, Florida. The Order to Show Cause proposed to deny his application for registration executed on November 8,
1991, and filed with the DEA pursuant to 21 U.S.C. 823(f). The Order alleged that Respondent's registration with DEA
would be inconsistent with the public interest, as that term is used in 21 U.S.C. 823 and 824.
Respondent requested a hearing and the matter was docketed before Administrative Law Judge Paul A. Tenney. Following
prehearing procedures, a hearing was held in Miami, Florida on October 13, 1993. On January 18, 1994, Judge Tenney
issued his Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Recommended Ruling. Neither party filed exceptions to the administrative
law judge's opinion and recommended decision and, on February 18, 1994, the administrative law judge transmitted
the record to the Acting Administrator. The Deputy Administrator has considered the record in its entirety and, pursuant
to 21 CFR  1316.67, hereby enters his final order in this matter.
The administrative law judge found that in 1977 Respondent obtained a license to practice dentistry in Florida. On
May 30, 1980, Respondent was issued DEA Registration, AT9228708. On November 17, 1980, Respondent was issued a second
Certificate of Registration. On November 30, 1981, Respondent's DEA registration expired, and was never renewed.
From November 1981 through November 1991, Respondent issued prescriptions for controlled substances with the expired
registration number. A DEA Investigator conducted a survey of 11 pharmacies in the Miami area for prescriptions for
controlled substances issued by the Respondent. The survey included prescriptions issued between January 1989
and November 1991. The Investigator recovered approximately 575 prescriptions for controlled substances issued
by the Respondent during that period. Respondent did not possess a valid DEA registration during that time.
At the DEA administrative hearing, Respondent testified that he thought his registration was transferable and that
at that time he did not know that he was doing anything wrong. Respondent further testified that once he became aware
of the need for a new DEA registration, he immediately submitted an application to DEA. Additionally, the Respondent
said that he had not prescribed controlled substances since that time.
Respondent also represented that during the period in question, he was employed by institutions which were part of
the public health service, and was therefore exempt from DEA registration under 21 CFR  1301.25. The administrative
law judge found that Respondent's claim was without any factual foundation. The Deputy Administrator agrees. The
term ``public health service'' as set forth in  1301.25, refers to the United States Public Health Service.
None of the institutions at which Respondent was employed was part of the Public Health Service as contemplated by
 1301.25.
The administrative law judge additionally found that on February 4, 1988, in the Circuit Court of the Eleventh Judicial
Circuit in Dade County, Florida, Respondent was convicted upon his plea of 

nolo contendere 

to filing false Medicaid claims. He was placed on eighteen months probation and ordered to pay restitution.
Additionally, as a result of the conviction, on May 13, 1988, the Florida Department of Health and Rehabilitative
Services terminated Respondent from further participation in the Florida Medicaid program. By letter dated June
24, 1988, the United States Department of Health and Human Services excluded Respondent from participation in the
Medicare program pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 1320a-7(a), for a period of five years.
The administrative law judge further found that on November 3, 1988, the Department of Professional Regulation,
Board of Dentistry (Board), filed an 18 count administrative complaint against Respondent. The complaint alleged
that from March 1985 to May 1987, Respondent billed the Florida Medicaid Department for services that he did not render
and filed false documents pertaining to the billing of these services to patients. With the exception of two counts,
Respondent did not dispute the allegations in the complaint. Consequently, on February 27, 1989, the Board entered
its final order in which it adopted the allegations in the administrative complaint as findings of fact. The order
placed Respondent's state dental license on suspension for three months, two months stayed. Following the suspension,
Respondent's license was placed on five years probation and Respondent was ordered to take 24 hours of instruction
in ethics and perform 500 hours of community service.
The Board filed an administrative complaint and an amended administrative complaint against the Respondent on March
14, 1990 and December 19, 1990, respectively. The amended complaint alleged that the Respondent failed to meet the
minimum standard of care in diagnosis and treatment of his patients and failed to keep records which justified his
course of treatment. A stipulation entered into by the parties was approved and adopted by Final Order dated August
13, 1991. As part of the order, Respondent was required to pay $1,000 and his license to practice dentistry was placed
on probation for two years.
The administrative law judge further found that Respondent filed a DEA application for registration, dated November
8, 1991, and indicated that he never had a state professional license or controlled substance registration revoked,
suspended, denied, restricted, or placed on probation. In fact, Respondent knew that his dental license had twice
been disciplined and placed on suspension and probation by the Board. Since DEA must rely on the truthfulness of information
supplied by applicants in registering them to handle controlled substances, falsification cannot be tolerated.
Any material falsification of any application for registration is an independent statutory basis for the denial
of an application. Herbert J. Robinson, M.D., 59 FR 6304 (1994); John W. Wang, M.D., 57 FR 47869 (1992); Ronald H. Futch,
M.D., 53 FR 38990 (1988).
The administrative law judge recommended that the Administrator deny Respondent's application for registration
at this time. The administrative law judge further found that the circumstances are sufficient to support a recommendation
to the Administrator that an application be looked on favorably after the passage of one year. The Deputy Administrator
adopts the findings of fact, conclusions of law and recommended ruling of the administrative law judge in its entirety.
Pursuant to 21 U.S.C. 823(f), the Deputy Administrator may deny an application for DEA registration if he determines
that the registration would be inconsistent with the public interest. Section 823(f) requires that the following
factors be considered:
(1) The recommendation of the appropriate State licensing board or professional disciplinary authority.
(2) The applicant's experience in dispensing, or conducting research with respect to controlled substances.

(3) The applicant's conviction record under Federal or State laws relating to the manufacture, distribution, or
dispensing of controlled substances.
(4) Compliance with applicable State, Federal, or local laws relating to controlled substances.
(5) Such other conduct which may threaten the public health and safety.
These factors are to be considered in the disjunctive. That is, the Deputy Administrator may properly rely on any one
or a combination of those factors, giving each the weight he deems appropriate in determining whether a registration
should be revoked, or an application denied. See David W. Warren, M.D., 55 FR 40017 (1990); Henry J. Schwarz, Jr., M.D.,
54 FR 16422 (1989); England Pharmacy, 52 FR 1674 (1987); and Felix Seisin, M.D., 51 FR 3863 (1986).
The Deputy Administrator finds that the fourth and fifth factors are relevant to the adjudication of this matter.
The record clearly establishes that the Respondent issued approximately 575 prescriptions for controlled substances
without a valid DEA registration. Further, Respondent had been excluded from the Medicare program and had disciplinary
action taken against him by the Florida Dental Board based upon Medicaid fraud and unprofessional conduct. Additionally,
Respondent falsified his DEA application. The administrative law judge concluded that the record warrants denial
of Respondent's application for registration at this time. The Deputy Administrator concurs in this evaluation.
Accordingly, the Deputy Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration, pursuant to the authority vested
in him by 21 U.S.C. 823 and 824 and 28 CFR   0.100(b) and 0.104 [59 FR 23637 (1994)], hereby orders that the
application for a DEA Certificate of Registration submitted by Linwood Thomas Townsend, D.D.S., dated November
8, 1991, be, and it hereby is, denied. This order is effective July 22, 1994.



Dated June 15, 1994.

<USDEPT>UNITED STATES NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION</USDEPT>



<DOCTITLE>Biweekly Notice</DOCTITLE>



Applications and Amendments to Facility Operating Licenses Involving No Significant Hazards Considerations

I. Background


Pursuant to Public Law 97-415, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission or NRC staff) is publishing
this regular biweekly notice. Public Law 97-415 revised section 189 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the
Act), to require the Commission to publish notice of any amendments issued, or proposed to be issued, under a new provision
of section 189 of the Act. This provision grants the Commission the authority to issue and make immediately effective
any amendment to an operating license upon a determination by the Commission that such amendment involves no significant
hazards consideration, notwithstanding the pendency before the Commission of a request for a hearing from any person.

This biweekly notice includes all notices of amendments issued, or proposed to be issued from May 27, 1994, through
June 10, 1994. The last biweekly notice was published on June 8, 1994 (59 FR 29623).



Notice Of Consideration Of Issuance Of Amendments To Facility Operating Licenses, Proposed No Significant Hazards
Consideration Determination, And Opportunity For A Hearing



The Commission has made a proposed determination that the following amendment requests involve no significant hazards
consideration. Under the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facility in accordance
with the proposed amendment would not (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an
accident previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident
previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The basis for this proposed determination
for each amendment request is shown below. 
The Commission is seeking public comments on this proposed determination. Any comments received within 30 days after
the date of publication of this notice will be considered in making any final determination. 
Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendment until the expiration of the 30-day notice period. However,
should circumstances change during the notice period such that failure to act in a timely way would result, for example,
in derating or shutdown of the facility, the Commission may issue the license amendment before the expiration of the
30-day notice period, provided that its final determination is that the amendment involves no significant hazards
consideration. The final determination will consider all public and State comments received before action is taken.
Should the Commission take this action, it will publish in the 

Federal Register 

a notice of issuance and provide for opportunity for a hearing after issuance. The Commission expects that the need
to take this action will occur very infrequently. 
Written comments may be submitted by mail to the Rules Review and Directives Branch, Division of Freedom of Information
and Publications Services, Office of Administration, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555,
and should cite the publication date and page number of this 

Federal Register 

notice. Written comments may also be delivered to Room 6D22, Two White Flint North, 11555 Rockville Pike, Rockville,
Maryland from 7:30 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. Federal workdays. Copies of written comments received may be examined at the NRC
Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555. The filing of requests for a hearing
and petitions for leave to intervene is discussed below.
By July 22, 1994, the licensee may file a request for a hearing with respect to issuance of the amendment to the subject
facility operating license and any person whose interest may be affected by this proceeding and who wishes to participate
as a party in the proceeding must file a written request for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene. Requests
for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's ``Rules of Practice
for Domestic Licensing Proceedings'' in 10 CFR Part 2. Interested persons should consult a current copy of 10 CFR 2.714
which is available at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington,
DC 20555 and at the local public document room for the particular facility involved. If a request for a hearing or petition
for leave to intervene is filed by the above date, the Commission or an Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, designated
by the Commission or by the Chairman of the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board Panel, will rule on the request and/or
petition; and the Secretary or the designated Atomic Safety and Licensing Board will issue a notice of a hearing or
an appropriate order. 
As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall set forth with particularity the interest of the
petitioner in the proceeding, and how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding. The petition
should specifically explain the reasons why intervention should be permitted with particular reference to the following
factors: (1) the nature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made a party to the proceeding; (2) the nature and
extent of the petitioner's property, financial, or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect
of any order which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest. The petition should also identify
the specific aspect(s) of the subject matter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Any person
who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has been admitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting
leave of the Board up to 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended
petition must satisfy the specificity requirements described above.
Not later than 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file
a supplement to the petition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions which are sought to be litigated
in the matter. Each contention must consist of a specific statement of the issue of law or fact to be raised or controverted.
In addition, the petitioner shall provide a brief explanation of the bases of the contention and a concise statement
of the alleged facts or expert opinion which support the contention and on which the petitioner intends to rely in proving
the contention at the hearing. The petitioner must also provide references to those specific sources and documents
of which the petitioner is aware and on which the petitioner intends to rely to establish those facts or expert opinion.
Petitioner must provide sufficient information to show that a genuine dispute exists with the applicant on a material
issue of law or fact. Contentions shall be limited to matters within the scope of the amendment under consideration.
The contention must be one which, if proven, would entitle the petitioner to relief. A petitioner who fails to file
such a supplement which satisfies these requirements with respect to at least one contention will not be permitted
to participate as a party. 
Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subject to any limitations in the order granting leave
to intervene, and have the opportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, including the opportunity
to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses. 
If a hearing is requested, the Commission will make a final determination on the issue of no significant hazards consideration.
The final determination will serve to decide when the hearing is held. 
If the final determination is that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration, the Commission
may issue the amendment and make it immediately effective, notwithstanding the request for a hearing. Any hearing
held would take place after issuance of the amendment. 
If the final determination is that the amendment request involves a significant hazards consideration, any hearing
held would take place before the issuance of any amendment. 
A request for a hearing or a petition for leave to intervene must be filed with the Secretary of the Commission, U.S.
Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Docketing and Services Branch, or may be delivered
to the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington DC 20555, by the above
date. Where petitions are filed during the last 10 days of the notice period, it is requested that the petitioner promptly
so inform the Commission by a toll-free telephone call to Western Union at 1-(800) 248-5100 (in Missouri 1-(800) 342-6700).
The Western Union operator should be given Datagram Identification Number N1023 and the following message addressed
to 

(Project Director)

: petitioner's name and telephone number, date petition was mailed, plant name, and publication date and page number
of this 

Federal Register 

notice. A copy of the petition should also be sent to the Office of the General Counsel, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,
Washington, DC 20555, and to the attorney for the licensee. 
Nontimely filings of petitions for leave to intervene, amended petitions, supplemental petitions and/or requests
for a hearing will not be entertained absent a determination by the Commission, the presiding officer or the Atomic
Safety and Licensing Board that the petition and/or request should be granted based upon a balancing of factors specified
in 10 CFR 2.714(a)(1)(i)-(v) and 2.714(d). 
For further details with respect to this action, see the application for amendment which is available for public inspection
at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555, and at the
local public document room for the particular facility involved.



Consolidated Edison Company of New York, Docket No. 50-247, Indian Point Nuclear Generating Unit No. 2, Westchester
County, New York




Date of amendment request: 

April 26, 1994


Description of amendment request: 

The proposed amendment would revise the Technical Specifications to change the Table 3.5-1 High Containment Pressure
( Hi Level), Safety Injection Setting Limit from less than or equal to 2.0 psig to less than or equal to 5.0 psig.


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:



The proposed change does not involve a significant hazards consideration since:

1. There is no significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident.

It is proposed that the High Containment Pressure (Hi Level) actuation setting of [less than or equal to] 2.0 psig be
revised to [less than or equal to] 5.0 psig. This additional operating flexibility will decrease the frequency of
Containment venting necessary to relieve containment of 
non-condensible gases which build up during normal operation.

Based upon a statistical analysis of the containment pressure channel uncertainty for a 30 month operating cycle,
a margin must be allowed between the Technical Specification limit (plant setting) and the Safety Analysis limit
so that the Safety Analysis limit(s) will not be exceeded under the worst circumstances. For a Technical Specification
value of [less than or equal to] 5.0 psig, the corresponding Safety Analysis limit must be increased to 10 psig to provide
margin for the channel statistical allowance. A safety evaluation performed pursuant to 10 CFR 50.59 is on file which
supports a change in the Safety Analysis limit from 7.3 psig (current value) to 10.0 psig. Key conclusions of the Safety
Evaluation are that neither the probability nor the consequences of an accident or malfunction of equipment important
to safety previously evaluated in the Safety Analysis report would be increased.

Thus, assurance is provided that appropriate protective actions in accordance with the Technical Specifications
will be taken so that Safety Analysis limits are not exceeded.

2. The possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously analyzed has not been created.

The proposed change in the Technical Specification limit together with the change in the Safety Analysis limit provides
adequate margin to accommodate instrument channel uncertainty over a 30 month operating cycle. Plant equipment,
which would be set at the Technical Specification limit, will therefore provide protective functions to assure that
safety analysis limits are not exceeded. This would prevent the possibility of a new or different kind of accident
from that previously evaluated from occurring.

3. There has been no reduction in the margin of safety.

The proposed change to the Technical Specification limit would decrease the frequency of containment purges necessary
to vent the build up of non-condensible gases during normal operation. This would result in a decrease in the amount
of radioactivity discharged to the environment (due to decay), decrease the potential for high Containment pressure
alarms and increase the margin for an ESF trip. The change to the Safety Analysis limits, justified by a safety Evaluation
performed in accordance with 10 CFR 50.59, assures sufficient margin exists to accommodate channel instrument uncertainty
over the maximum operating cycle length. This margin is necessary so that safety functions will occur and Safety Analysis
limits will be preserved.



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant
hazards consideration.

Date of amendment request: 

May 24, 1994


Description of amendment request: 

The proposed amendments would transfer the boron concentration in Technical Specification (TS) 3.9.1 for the reactor
coolant system and the refueling canal during MODE 6, and the boron concentration in TS 3.9.12 for the spent fuel pool
from the TS to the Core Operating Limits Report (COLR). The application is submitted in response to the guidance in
Generic Letter 88-16 which addresses the transfer of fuel cycle-specific parameter limits from the TS to the COLR.



Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:



The following analysis, performed pursuant to 10 CFR 50.91, shows that the proposed amendment will not create a significant
hazards consideration as defined by the criteria of 10 CFR 50.92.
 
1. This amendment will not significantly increase the probability or consequence of any accident previously evaluated.

No component modification, system realignment, or change in operating procedure will occur which could affect the
probability of any accident or transient. The relocation of boron concentration values to the COLR is an adminsitrative
change which will have no effect on the probability or consequences of any previously-analyzed accident. The required
values of boron concentration will continue to be determined through use of approved methodologies.

2. This amendment will not create the possibility of any new or different accidents not previously evaluated.

No component modification or system realignment will occur which could create the possibility of a new event not previously
considered. The administrative change of relocating parameters to the COLR, in this case boron concentration, cannot
create the probability of an accident.

3.This amendment will not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.

Required boron concentrations will remain appropriate for each cycle, and will continue to be calculated using approved
methodologies. There is no significant reduction in a margin of safety.



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

GPU Nuclear Corporation, et al., Docket No. 50-219, Oyster Creek Nuclear Generating Station, Ocean County, New Jersey




Date of amendment request: 

May 12, 1994


Description of amendment request: 

The proposed amendment would revise Technical Specification Sections 3.1 and 4.1 for Protective Instrumentation,
the associated bases, and tables to increase the surveillance test intervals (STIs) and add allowable out-of-service
times (AOTs). All proposed STI and AOT changes are in accordance with General Electric Company Licensing Topical
Reports (LTRs) which have been previously reviewed and approved by the NRC staff. Also, AOTs are clarified in accordance
with the most recently approved BWR Owners' Group letters which were used in the development of NUREG-1433 ``Standard
Technical Specifications, General Electric Plants, BWR/4.'' The Technical Specification changes will permit
specified Channel Tests to be conducted quarterly rather than weekly or monthly. The amendment will enhance operational
safety by reducing 1) the potential for inadvertent plant scrams, 2) excessive test cycles on equipment, and 3) the
diversion of plant personnel and resources on unnecessary testing. 
Two additional technical changes are proposed. The first change involves extending the Channel Calibration interval
for average power range monitor (APRM) scram instrumentation from weekly to quarterly. GPUN has evaluated the effect
of drift on the setpoint over the longer interval for this instrumentation and found it to be acceptable. The second
change would add a quarterly Channel Calibration requirement for High Drywell Pressure (for Core Cooling) and Turbine
Trip Scram instrumentation. This would be a new requirement not currently incorporated in the Technical Specifications.
Nineteen editorial changes have been incorporated in Instrumentation Sections 3.1 and 4.1 to provide clarity and
consistency. These items are editorial only and do not alter the meaning or intent of any requirements. Examples of
editorial changes are: 1) capitalize definitions where used, 2) punctuation and grammatical corrections, 3) ensuring
consistency in STI nomenclature, and 4) reformat of tables. A table note and its associated footnote were deleted
which involved a 1985 licensing condition which is no longer applicable. 


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analyses of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:



NO SIGNIFICANT HAZARDS CONSIDERATION EVALUATION OF TECHNICAL CHANGES 
 
1. The operation of the Oyster Creek Nuclear Generating Station, in accordance with the proposed amendment, will
not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. 

The generic analysis contained in LTR NEDC-30851P-A assessed the impact of changing RPS [reactor protection system]
STIs and adding AOTs on RPS failure frequency, scram frequency and equipment cycling. Specifically, Section 5.7.4,
``Significant Hazards Assessment,'' of NEDC-30851P-A states that:

Fewer challenges to the safeguards system, due to less frequent testing of the RPS, conservatively results in a decrease
of approximately one percent in core damage frequency. This decrease is based upon the following:

Based on the plant-specific experience presented in Appendix J, the estimated reduction in scram frequency (0.3
scrams/yr) represents a 1 to 2 percent decrease in core damage frequency based on the BWR plant-specific Probabilistic
Risk Assessments (PRAs) listed in Table 5-8.

The increase in core damage frequency due to less frequent testing is less than one percent. This increase is even lower
(less than 0.01 percent) when the changes resulting from the implementation of the Anticipated Transients Without
Scram (ATWS) rule are considered. Therefore, this increase is more than offset by the decrease in CDF [core damage
frequency] due to fewer scrams.

The effect of reducing unnecessary cycles on RPS equipment, although not easily quantifiable also results in a decrease
in core damage frequency.

The overall impact on core damage frequency of the changes in allowable out-of-service times is negligible.

The BWR Owners' Group concluded that the proposed changes do not significantly increase the probability or consequences
of an accident previously evaluated since the increase in probability of a scram failure due to RPS unavailability
is insignificant. The overall probability of an accident is decreased as the time RPS logic operates as designed is
increased resulting in less inadvertent scrams during testing and repair. The plant-specific evaluation performed
by GPUN and GE demonstrates that while the Oyster Creek RPS differs from the generic model analyzed in the RPS LTR (NEDC-30851P-A),
the net effect of the differences do not alter the generic conclusions. The AOTs proposed for RPS instrumentation
are based on improved wording developed for use in NUREG 1433, ``Standard Technical Specifications, General Electric
Plants, BWR/4,'' which ensures a loss of function does not occur. In addition, the change to the APRM Scram Channel
Calibration surveillance interval from weekly to quarterly has been evaluated by GPUN to determine the effect on
setpoint drift. The results of the evaluation show acceptable performance of this scram parameter ensuring that
the safety analysis remains valid. The clarification that a Channel Calibration is not applicable to Turbine Trip
Scram instrumentation is appropriate since this trip parameter senses turbine stop valve position via limit switches
which are fixed in position and adjusted, as necessary, during valve maintenance. This trip parameter and its switch
adjustment methods are similar to the Main Steamline Isolation Valve [MSIV] Scram for which the Technical Specifications
require only a Channel Test.

LTR NEDC-30936P-A (Parts 1 and 2) contains an assessment of the impact of changing STIs and AOTs for BWR ECCS Actuation
Instrumentation. Section 4.0, ``Technical Assessment of Changes,'' of NEDC-30963P-A (Part 2) states that:

The results indicate an insignificant (less than 5E-7 per year) increase in water injection function failure frequency
when STIs are increased from 31 days to 92 days, AOTs for repair of the ECCS actuation instrumentation are increased
from one hour to 24 hours, and AOTs for surveillance testing are increased from two to six hours. For all four BWR models
the increase represents less than 4% increase in failure frequency. However, when other factors which influence
the overall plant safety are considered, the net result is judged to be an improvement in plant safety.

From this generic analysis, the BWR Owners' Group concluded that the proposed changes do not significantly increase
the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated since the increase in probability of a water
injection failure due to ECCS instrumentation unavailability is insignificant and the net result is judged to be
an improvement in plant safety. The plant-specific evaluation performed by GPUN and GE demonstrates that while the
Oyster Creek ECCS differs from the generic model analyzed in LTR NEDC-30936P-A, the net effect of the plant-specific
differences do not alter the generic conclusions. The addition of a quarterly Channel Calibration STI for the High
Drywell Pressure ECCS initiation parameter is consistent with the calibration interval requirement for other similar
instrumentation at Oyster Creek and ensures the regular performance of calibrations. This is a new requirement not
currently contained in the Technical Specifications and experience performing the High Drywell Pressure (Core
Cooling) instrument calibration at a quarterly interval has proven adequate for instrument performance monitoring.

LTRs NEDC-30851P-A, Supplement 2 and NEDC-31677P-A contain generic analyses assessing the impact of changing STIs
and AOTs for BWR Isolation Actuation Instrumentation which are common or not common to RPS and ECCS instrumentation.
Section 4.0, ``Summary of Results,'' of NEDC-30851P-A, Supplement 2 states that:

The results indicated that the effects on probability of failure to initiate isolation are very small and the effects
on probability or frequency of failure to isolate are negligible in nearly every case. In addition, the results indicated
that increasing the AOT to 24 hours for tests and repairs has a negligible effect on the probability of failure of the
isolation function. These combined with changes to the testing intervals and allowed out-of-service times for RPS
and ECCS instrumentation provide a net improvement to plant safety and operations.

and Section 5.6, ``Assessment of Net Effect of Changes,'' of NEDC-31677P-A states that:

A reduction in core damage frequency (CDF) of at least as much as estimated in the ECCS instrumentation analysis can
be expected when the isolation actuation instrumentation STIs are changed from one month to three months. The chief
contributor to this reduction is the channel functional tests for the MSIVs. Inadvertent closure of the MSIVs will
cause an unnecessary plant scram. This reduction in CDF more than compensates for any small incremental increase
(10% or 1.0E-07/year) in calculated isolation function failure frequency when the STI is extended to three months.

Based on this generic analysis, the BWR Owners' Group concluded that the proposed changes do not significantly increase
the consequences of an accident previously evaluated since the increase in probability of an isolation failure due
to isolation instrumentation unavailability is insignificant. The proposed wording of the AOTs is based on the clarifications
used in the development of NUREG 1433, ``Standard Technical Specifications, General Electric Plants, BWR/4,''
which ensures a loss of function does not occur where applied to isolation actuation instrumentation.

LTR NEDC-30851P-A, Supplement 1 contains a generic analysis assessing the impact of changing control rod block STIs
on Rod Block failure frequency. Section 5 (Brookhaven National Laboratory Technical Evaluation Report - Attachment
2 to the NRC SER) of NEDC-30851P-A, Supplement 1 states that:
 
The BWROG proposed changes to the Technical Specifications concerning the test requirements for BWR control rod
block instrumentation. The changes consist of increasing the surveillance test intervals form one to three months.
These test interval extensions are consistent with the already approved changes to STIs for the reactor protection
system. The technical analysis reviewed and verified as documented herein indicates that there will be no significant
changes in the availability of the control rod block function if these changes are implemented. In addition, there
will be a negligible impact on the plant core melt frequency due to the decreased testing.

Bases contained in GE Topical Report GENE-770-1-A assessed the impact of changing STIs and AOTs on failure frequency
for selected systems. Section 2.0, ``Summary,'' of GENE-770-06-1-A states that: 

Technical bases are provided for selected proposed changes to the instrumentation STIs and AOTs that were identified
in the BWROG Improved BWR Technical Specification activity. These STI and AOT changes are consistent with approved
changes to the RPS, ECCS, and isolation actuation instrumentation. These proposed changes do not result in a degradation
to overall plant safety.

The BWR Owners' Group concluded from the generic analysis in NEDC-30851P-A, Supplement 1 and the bases in GENE-770-06-1-A
that the proposed changes do not significantly increase the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated. GPUN's utilization of GENE-770-06-1-A is limited to the identified AOTs for Control Rod Block instrumentation
analyzed in NEDC-30851P-A since the Control Rod Block LTR did not explicitly address AOTs.

2. The operation of Oyster Creek Nuclear Generating Station, in accordance with the proposed amendment, will not
create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.

The addition of allowable out-of-service times (AOTs) consistent with wording developed for use in Improved Standard
Technical Specifications to ensure no loss of function and the revision of surveillance test intervals (STIs) does
not alter the function of RPS, ECCS, Isolation or Rod Block instrumentation nor involve any type of plant modification.
No new modes of plant operation are involved with the changes.

Adding a quarterly Channel Calibration STI for High Drywell Pressure instrumentation (for Core Cooling) establishes
a requirement in the Technical Specifications which is not currently incorporated. This is an additional requirement
beyond that already in place for this instrumentation and will not alter its operation since by their nature STIs ensure
proper instrument performance. The clarification that a Channel Calibration is not applicable to Turbine Trip Scram
instrumentation is appropriate since this trip parameter senses turbine stop valve position via limit switches
which are fixed in position and adjusted during valve maintenance. This trip parameter and its switch adjustment
methods are similar to the Main Steamline Isolation Valve Scram for which the Technical Specifications require only
a Channel Test. Revising the Channel Calibration STI for APRM Scram instruments from weekly to quarterly allows these
instruments to benefit from the Channel Test STI change provided by the generic analysis in the RPS LTR. The benefits
include a significant reduction in the number of half-scram states the plant will undergo reducing the potential
for inadvertent plant trips. The effect of setpoint drift over the longer interval has been evaluated and found acceptable.

The proposed changes will not alter the physical characteristics of any plant systems or components and all safety-related
systems and components remain within their applicable design limits. Thus, system and component performance is
not adversely affected by these changes, thereby assuring that the design capabilities of those systems and components
are not challenged in a manner not previously assessed so as to create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident.


3. The operation of the Oyster Creek Nuclear Generating Station, in accordance with the proposed amendment, will
not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.

The NRC staff has reviewed and approved the generic studies contained in the GE Licensing Topical Reports and has concurred
with the BWR Owners' Group that the proposed changes do not significantly affect the availability of RPS, ECCS Actuation,
Isolation Actuation and Control Rod Block instrumentation. The proposed addition of allowable out-of-service
times for instruments addressed by the LTRs provides reasonable times for making repairs and performing tests. The
lack of sufficient out-of-service time provided in current Technical Specifications, increases the potential
for an inadvertent scram or equipment actuation. The proposed AOTs provide realistic times to complete required
actions without increasing overall instrument failure frequency and ensure that no loss of function occurs, therefore,
there is no significant reduction in the margin of safety.

The LTRs demonstrate that extending surveillance test intervals does not result in significant changes in the probability
of instrument failure. Where Channel Calibration frequency has not changed, assurance exists that setpoints will
not be affected by drift. In the case of the APRM Scram Channel Calibration, the proposed change to quarterly from weekly
has been evaluated and found acceptable. Expected instrument performance over the extended interval will assure
that applicable safety analyses will continue to be met. In addition, other instrumentation was evaluated for drift
effects of setpoints and was found acceptable. The addition of a quarterly Channel Calibration interval for High
Drywell Pressure (for Core Cooling) is consistent with Channel Calibration STIs for most other instrumentation
at Oyster Creek and has been the interval used to achieve an adequate level of instrument performance monitoring.
The clarification that a Channel Calibration is not applicable to Turbine Trip Scram instrumentation ensures consistency
in the establishment of surveillance requirements. This trip parameter senses turbine stop valve position via limit
switches which are fixed in position and adjusted during valve maintenance. This trip parameter and its switch adjustment
methods are similar to the Main Steamline Isolation Valve Scram for which the Technical Specifications require only
a Channel Test. These proposed changes, when coupled with the reduced probability of test-induced plant transients
and equipment failures, do not result in a reduction in the margin of safety.

No Significant Hazards Consideration Evaluation For Editorial Changes

The above nineteen proposed changes are editorial in nature and are typical example I.c.2.e.i in 51FR7744. Therefore,
they do not:

1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.

The editorial changes described above do not change the design or operation of any structure, system or component
relied upon to prevent or mitigate the consequences of any accident evaluated. These editorial changes also do not
add new structures, systems or components which may have an effect on existing elements of the facility. The changes
proposed correct, clarify and/or retain existing requirements. 

2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident form any accident previously evaluated.

Since neither physical changes to the facility nor changes in its operation are involved in the proposed editorial
changes to the Technical Specifications, there is no possibility for creation of a new or different kind of accident.

3. Involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety.

Facility configuration and operation are unaffected by the proposed editorial changes. As a result no changes in
margin of safety occur.

The editorial changes described and evaluated above are purely administrative to achieve consistency or correct
an error in the Technical Specifications. 



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analyses and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied for both the technical issues and editorial changes. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes
to determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.

Pennsylvania 




Date of amendment request: 

February 10, 1994


Description of amendment request: 

The revision proposed by Technical Specification Change Request (TSCR) No. 230 to the Technical Specifications
would revise specification 3.7.2.c, ``Unit Electric Power System,'' to eliminate testing of an emergency diesel
generator (EDG) when the redundant EDG is inoperable. 

Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:



1. The proposed amendment serves to assure that an EDG is always available to perform on demand and the lower number
of demands for performance reduce the probability of equipment failure. The required action no longer requires a
``test'' be performed. Therefore, the word ``test'' has been deleted from TS 3.7.2.c. The change is administrative.
Since the proposed amendment does not affect the design or performance of the diesel generators or their ability to
perform their design function, the change will not result in an increase in the consequences or probability of an accident
previously analyzed. The proposed change will increase diesel generator reliability, thereby increasing overall
plant safety.

2. Operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment does not create the possibility of a new or different
kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. Accidents involving loss of off-site power and single failure
have been previously evaluated. The change does not introduce any new mode of plant operation or new accident precursors,
involve any physical alterations to plant configurations, or make any changes to system setpoints which could initiate
a new or different kind of accident. 

3. Operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment does not involve a significant reduction in
a margin of safety. This change does not result in a reduction in the margin of safety since there is no margin of safety
associated with the supplemental immediate and daily testing of the operable EDG. If a margin of safety were presumed
to exist, no reduction would result because of the proposed amendment: no physical modification to the plant or change
to procedurally prescribed operator actions resulted from the proposed amendment. 



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

Maine Yankee Atomic Power Company, Docket No. 50-309, Maine Yankee
Atomic Power Station, Lincoln County, Maine




Date of amendment request: 

May 25, 1994 


Description of amendment request: 

The proposed amendment would 1) allow entry through an operable personnel air lock hatch to perform surveillance
testing, repair an inoperable hatch, or perform other necessary activities inside containment, 2) update plant
Technical Specifications to reflect a previous change to the list of containment boundary valves, 3) add a new exception
to allow quarterly surveillance testing of the excess flow check valves, 4) add a new exception to allow periodic preventive
maintenance on control room ventilation lasting up to 30 minutes per calendar quarter without a written report of
such inoperability, and 5) make related administrative changes to reflect and clarify items 1 through 4 above. 


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration.
The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis against the standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c). The staff's analysis
is presented below:


1. The proposed amendment would not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated. 
Containment air lock hatch entry, surveillance testing of the excess flow check valves, and preventive maintenance
of control room ventilation are of short duration and do not alter any associated remedial action completion times,
or the requirements of Technical Specification 3.0.A. If necessary, prompt operator action to restore containment
integrity, excess flow check valve position, or control room ventilation is assured by plant operators, or individual(s)
procedurally dedicated to perform such restoration. The subject containment boundary valves are manual containment
isolation valves, and the current specification allows them to be repositioned under administrative control without
compensatory measures to isolate the penetration. The boundary valves to be added remain closed during power operation,
and are opened only after the reactor is shut down and cooldown has begun. The boundary valves to be deleted are open
only during plant heatup. 


The staff therefore concludes that implementation of the proposed change will not involve a significant increase
in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. 


2. The proposed amendment would not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident
previously evaluated.
The proposed change to containment air lock hatch entry, surveillance testing of the excess flow check valves, and
preventive maintenance of the control room ventilation system, will not affect equipment reliability when such
equipment is required to be operable. The Limiting Conditions for 
Operation and Remedial Actions for these items remain unchanged to govern operability of the equipment. The containment
boundary valves being added are closed when the reactor is at power, and are opened only after the 
reactor is shut down. The boundary valves being deleted are open only during plant heatup. The subject boundary valves
are manual containment isolation valves, and the current specification allows them to be repositioned under administrative
control without compensatory measures to isolate the penetration. 
The staff therefore concludes that implementation of the proposed change will not create any new or different kind
of accident from any accident previously evaluated.
3. The proposed amendment does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. 
The proposed change would allow excess flow check valves to be exercised through approximately 1.5 inches of valve
travel on a quarterly basis without declaring the valves inoperable or taking compensatory measures. Such testing
constitutes approximately 15 minutes per calendar quarter, during which time containment isolation can easily
be reestablished. Similarly, access through an operable air lock hatch would allow the hatch to be open for only a short
period of time and while under control of an individual dedicated to operating the hatch. The proposed change also
permits the control room ventilation system to be inoperable for 30 minutes per calendar quarter, without a written
report of such inoperability. Because of the short time during which these systems are unavailable, and because operation
is easily reestablished, there is no significant reduction in a margin of safety. The containment boundary valves
being added are closed when the reactor is at power, and are opened only after the reactor is shut down. The boundary
valves being deleted are open only during plant heatup. The subject boundary valves are manual containment isolation
valves, and the current specification allows them to be repositioned under administrative control without compensatory
measures to isolate the penetration. 


The staff therefore concludes that implementation of the proposed change would not involve a significant reduction
in a margin of safety. 
Based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff
proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.

Millstone Nuclear Power Station, Unit 1, New London County, Connecticut




Date of amendment request: 

April 29, 1994


Description of amendment request: 

The amendment would change the requirement for reactor operators (RO) in Table 6.2-1 from 2 to 3 for the RUN, STARTUP/HOT
STANDBY and HOT SHUTDOWN conditions. In addition, two typographical corrections are made to page 6-4.


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:


NNECO has reviewed the proposed changes in accordance with 10CFR50.92 and concluded that the changes do not involve
a significant hazards consideration (SHC). The basis for this conclusion is that the three criteria of 10CFR50.92(c)
are not compromised. The proposed changes do not involve a significant hazards consideration because the changes
would not:

1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously analyzed.

Accident analyses for Millstone Unit No. 1 do not require a specific number of operators. Increasing the Technical
Specification minimum to require a third RO does not decrease the effectiveness of the shift staff in response to normal
or abnormal conditions. In fact, the third RO enhances the ability of the operating crew to mitigate complex transients
which could occur during beyond design basis events. The shifts have trained and functioned at the higher staffing
level for several years.

The typographical corrections to page 6-4 provide a clearer representation of the required actions, and do not affect
the intent nor implementation of the specification.

Therefore, the proposed change does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of a previously
analyzed accident.
 
2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously analyzed.

The addition of a third RO to the minimum shift-crew composition required by Technical Specification Table 6.2-1
does not affect the operation of the unit, nor does it change any of the operating procedures, off-normal procedures,
or EOPs [emergency operating procedures]. Staffing the control room with an additional operator enhances the capability
of the operating crew to mitigate transients. Therefore, addition of a third RO to the minimum shift-crew composition
cannot create the possibility of a new or different accident.

3. Involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety.

The proposed addition of a third reactor operator is to ensure that sufficient operating staff is available to respond
to complex transients involving multiple equipment failures. Ensuring that sufficient resources are available
to cope with beyond design basis event scenarios provides an increase in the margin of safety.



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

Date of amendment request: 

May 6, 1994


Description of amendment request: 

The proposed amendment would modify the Limiting Conditions for Operation (LCO) for the Millstone Unit 2 Technical
Specifications 3.8.2.3 and 3.8.2.4 and the surveillance requirement of TS 4.8.2.3.2.c.3. These changes relate
to the amperage requirements and the charging capability of the DC distribution systems.


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:



The proposed changes do not involve an SHC [significant hazards consideration] because the changes would not:

1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously analyzed.

In 1993, revised battery and battery charger sizing calculations demonstrated that a charger capacity of 400 amperes
is sufficient to provide the continuous DC loads, and is capable of recharging a fully discharged station battery
in a timely manner consistent with the design basis discussed in Section 8.5.3.1 of the Millstone Unit No. 2 FSAR [Final
Safety Analysis Report]. The calculations determined that the largest continuous load was 154 amperes; therefore,
400 amperes of charging capacity could provide 246 amperes to recharge a battery.

The calculations conservatively demonstrated that this charging capacity could recharge a battery in 10.37 hours.
This recharging time is well within the 12-hour recharging time discussed in Section 8.5.3.1 of the Millstone Unit
No. 2 FSAR. Additionally, this recharging time is more conservative than the 24-hour recharging time stated in Section
8.3.2 of the original Safety Evaluation for Millstone Unit No. 2. Therefore, the proposed changes do not involve a
significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously analyzed.

2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously analyzed. 

The proposed LCO and surveillance changes do not alter the existing DC bus configuration, as described in Section
8.5.3.1 of the Millstone Unit No. 2 FSAR. This bus configuration has been previously analyzed, and was found acceptable.
The proposed changes also meet the recharging time specified in the design basis. Therefore, the proposed changes
do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously analyzed.

3. Involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety.

In 1993, revised battery and battery charger sizing calculations demonstrated that a charger capacity of 400 amperes

Date of amendment request: 

May 6, 1994


Description of amendment request: 

The proposed amendment would provide additional Technical Specification requirements regarding non-Quality
Assurance (QA) equipment utilized to achieve feedwater isolation in response to a main steam line break (MSLB) inside
containment. Specifically the amendment would incorporate additional sections numbered 3/4.7.1.6, titled ``Plant
Systems - Main Feedwater Isolation Components (MFICs);'' 3/4.8.2.1A, titled '' Onsite Power Distribution Systems
- A.C. Distribution - Operating;'' and 3/4.8.2.5, titled ``Onsite Power Distribution Systems (Turbine Battery)
- D.C. Distribution - Operating.'' In addition, the proposed amendment would modify the Index and the Bases to reflect
the additional requirements. 


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:



NNECO has reviewed the proposed changes in accordance with 10CFR50.90 and has concluded that the changes do not involve
a significant hazards consideration (SHC). The basis for this conclusion is that the three criteria of 10CFR50.92(c)
are not compromised. The proposed changes do not involve an SHC because the changes would not:

1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously analyzed.

Currently, the Millstone Unit No. 2 Technical Specifications contain response time requirements for the feedwater
isolation valves to ensure rapid isolation of feedwater to the steam generators and to maintain the peak containment
pressure below the containment design pressure of 54 psig. However, clear Action Statements specifying operability
requirements for the non-QA equipment associated with feedwater isolation are not included within the Millstone
Unit No. 2 Technical Specifications. NNECO's proposal to add sections 3/4.7.1.6, 3/4.8.2.1A, and 3/4.8.2.5 into
the Millstone Unit No. 2 Technical Specifications will incorporate additional requirements regarding components
that are credited to provide feedwater isolation in the event of an MSLB inside containment. These proposed changes
will impose additional limitations, restrictions, and controls not currently in place in the Millstone Unit No.
2 Technical Specifications.

Additionally, NNECO's proposals to modify the Bases and the Index of the Millstone Unit No. 2 Technical Specifications
will: 1) provide personnel with information concerning the additional requirements, and 2) correct an editorial
error. These proposed changes to the Bases and the Index do not alter the manner in which equipment is operated, nor
do they affect equipment availability. 
Based on the above, the proposed license amendment does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences
of an accident previously analyzed. 

2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously analyzed.

NNECO's proposal to add section 3/4.7.1.6, 3/4.8.2.1A, and 3/4.8.2.5 into the Millstone Unit No. 2 Technical Specifications
will incorporate additional requirements regarding components that are credited to provide feedwater isolation
in the event of an MSLB inside containment. These proposed changes will impose additional limitations, restrictions,
and controls not currently in place in the Millstone Unit No. 2 Technical Specifications.

Additionally, NNECO's proposals to modify the Bases and the Index of the Millstone Unit No. 2 Technical Specifications
will: 1) provide personnel with information concerning the additional requirements, and 2) correct an editorial
error. These proposed changes to the Bases an the Index do not alter the manner in which equipment is operated, nor do
they affect equipment availability.

Based on the above, the proposed license amendment cannot create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident
from any previously analyzed.

3. Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.

NNECO's proposal to add sections 3/4.7.1.6, 3/4.8.2.1A, and 3/4.8.2.5 into the Millstone Unit No. 2 Technical Specifications

will: 1) provide personnel with information concerning the additional requirements, and 2) correct an editorial
error. These proposed changes to the Bases and the Index do not alter the manner in which equipment is operated, nor
do they affect equipment availability.

Therefore, this proposed license amendment does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. In fact.
The margin of safety will be increased due to the imposition of restriction on the non-QA equipment credited for feedwater
isolation in the event of an MSLB inside containment.

Date of amendment request:

Description of amendment request: 

The proposed amendment modifies the monthly operational test of the reactor trip bypass breakers to monthly staggered,
such that each breaker is tested every 62 days.


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:


The proposed changes do not involve an SHC [significant hazards consideration] because the changes would not:

1. Involve a significant increase in probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.

Revising the technical specifications to require a staggered monthly surveillance operational test of the reactor
trip bypass breakers (such that each breaker is tested every 62 days) will only make operational testing of the reactor
trip bypass breakers consistent with operational testing of the trip breakers and the automatic trip and interlock
logic. It will also reduce cycling of the reactor trip bypass breakers by eliminating the requirement to test both
bypass breakers during the monthly surveillance, thereby reducing maintenance and surveillance time. The proposed
changes do not affect any of the design basis accidents nor are there any malfunctions associated with these changes.

Additionally, this technical specification bases change only clarifies both the meaning of a reactor trip breaker
and trip breaker train which have been included for completeness and clarity concerning the reactor trip breaker
system.

2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident previously evaluated.

Revising the technical specifications to require a staggered monthly surveillance operational test of the reactor
trip bypass breakers (such that each breaker is tested every 62 days) will only make operational testing of the reactor
trip bypass breakers consistent with operational testing of the reactor trip breakers and the automatic trip and
interlock logic. There are no new failure modes associated with the proposed changes. Since the plant will continue
to operate as designed, the proposed changes will not modify the plant response to the point where it can be considered
a new accident.
 
3. Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.

Revising the technical specifications to require a staggered monthly surveillance operational test of the reactor
trip bypass breakers (such that each breaker is tested ever 62 days) will only make operational testing of the reactor
trip bypass breakers consistent with operational testing of the reactor trip breakers and the automatic trip and
interlock logic. It will also reduce cycling of the reactor trip bypass breakers by eliminating the requirement to
test both bypass breakers during the monthly surveillance, thereby reducing maintenance and surveillance time.
The proposed changes do not have any adverse impact on the protective boundaries nor do they affect the consequences
of any accident previously analyzed. The surveillance requirements will still ensure that the reactor trip breakers
and the reactor trip bypass breakers are tested and within the limits. Therefore, the proposed changes will not impact
the margin of safety as designated in the bases of any technical specification. 



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

Date of amendment request: 

May 18, 1994


Description of amendment request: 

The amendment would change operability requirements for the Fuel Building Exhaust Filter System to require it to
be operable whenever irradiated fuel is in the spent fuel pool, which has had less than 60 days of decay time. Surveillance
requirements for the Fuel Building Exhaust Filter System would be changed to require that the system be tested and
verified operable at no greater than 31 days prior to its required usage. 


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:


...The proposed change does not involve an SHC [significant hazards consideration] because the change would not:

1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.

The proposed modification will revise the period of time during which the Fuel Building Exhaust Filter System must
be operable. 

The propose[d] change will require that the system is operable whenever irradiated fuel, which has decayed less than
60 days, is in the spent fuel pool. Currently, the system is required to be operable whenever a load is moved over the
pool or fuel is being moved in the pool.

The modification has no effect on the probability of a fuel handling accident. The consequences of a fuel handling
accident has been evaluated at two intervals. The first time is the minimum decay time. At this time (t=100 hours) with
irradiated fuel in the pool, the Fuel Building Exhaust Filter System is required, per the existing and the proposed
Technical Specification, to be operable. Therefore, the consequences of an accident are identical to that described
in the FSAR [Final Safety Analyses Report]. The second scenario evaluated is when the filters are initially isolated
(t=60 days). The resultant offsite dose, assuming no filtration and lower core inventory due to decay, are significantly
lower than was calculated at t=100 hours. Therefore, the existing accident analysis in FSAR Section 15.7.4 is limiting
and the proposed modification will not impact the probability or consequences of an accident.

2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated.

The proposed change does not impact any system or component which could cause a fuel handling accident. The Fuel Building
Exhaust Filter System is used for accident mitigations. It's failure cannot, in any way, create the possibility of
a new or different kind of accident.

3. Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.

The proposed change to the Fuel Building Exhaust Filter System has been analyzed at the two most critical times. The
first analysis was done when the fuel is first placed in the pool, and the second analysis was done when the filtration
system is isolated. The first event resulted in no change in assumptions in the analysis presented in the FSAR, ergo
no change in dose. The second event has been analyzed and doses have decreased, when compared to the first event. The
system will be verified operable per the performance of Surveillance Requirement 4.9.12a prior to fuel or load movement
over the pool. Therefore, there is no reduction in the margin of safety.



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

Date of amendment request: 

May 13, 1994


Description of amendment request: 

This amendment would revise Technical Specifications Surveillance Requirement 4.8.1.1.2e.8, which requires
that an emergency diesel generator be retested within 5 minutes after completing a 24-hour endurance run.


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:



1. The proposed Technical Specifications (TS) change does not involve a significant increase in the probability
or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.

The proposed TS change would revise the Emergency Diesel Generator (EDG) surveillance criteria to allow the hot restart
test to be performed independent of the Engineered Safety Features (ESF) load sequencing test and the 24 hour endurance
run. The proposed surveillance requirements would continue to demonstrate that the objectives of each of these tests
are met. Specifically, the EDG's are shown to be capable of starting the ESF loads in the required sequence, operating
at full load for an extended period of time, and restarting from a full load temperature condition. Therefore, the
proposed changes would not adversely affect the EDG's ability to support mitigation of the consequences of any previously
evaluated accident. The proposed changes to the surveillance requirements do not affect the initiation or progression
of any accident sequence.

Therefore, the proposed change does not involve an increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated.

2. The proposed TS change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated.

This proposed TS change does not require physical changes to the plant or equipment, and does not impact any design
or functional requirements of the Emergency Diesel Generators (EDGs). The proposed change affects surveillance
test criteria such that increased scheduling flexibility is allowed while the test objectives associated with demonstrating
EDG operability continue to be met. The proposed changes do not allow any plant configurations that are presently
prohibited by the Technical Specifications.

Therefore, the proposed TS change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously
evaluated.

3. The proposed TS change does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.

The proposed TS change does not involve a change to the physical design or functional requirements of the Emergency
Diesel Generators (EDGs). Surveillance testing in accordance with the proposed Technical Specification will continue
to demonstrate the ability of the EDG's to perform their intended function of providing electrical power to ESF systems
needed to mitigate design basis transients, consistent with the plant safety analyses. The margin of safety demonstrated
by the plant safety analyses is therefore not affected by the proposed change.

Therefore, the proposed TS change does not involve a reduction in a margin of safety.



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

Description of amendment request: 

The proposed amendment would extend the Type A test (i.e., Containment Integrated Leak Rate Test) interval on a one-time
basis.


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:


1. The proposed Technical Specifications (TS) change does not involve a significant increase in the probability
or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.

The accidents which are potentially negatively impacted by the proposed change are any Loss of Coolant Accident (LOCA)
inside primary containment as described in the PBAPS [Peach Bottom Atomic Power Station], Units 2 and 3 UFSAR [Updated
Final Safety Analysis Report].

The proposed change increases the surveillance interval of the 10 CFR [Part] 50, Appendix J Type A test (i.e., Containment
Integrated Leakage Rate Test (CILRT)) from 42 months to 66 months. This test is performed to determine that the total
leakage from containment does not exceed the maximum allowable primary containment leakage rate (i.e., designated
La) at a calculated peak containment internal pressure (Pa), as defined in 10 CFR [Part] 50, Appendix J. The primary
containment limits the leakage of radioactive material during and following design bases accidents in order to comply
with the offsite dose limits specified in 10 CFR [Part] 100. Accordingly, the primary containment is not an accident
initiator, it is an accident mitigator. No physical or operational changes to the containment structure, plant systems,
or components would be made as a result of the proposed change. Therefore, the probability of occurrence of an accident
previously evaluated is not increased.

The failure effects that are potentially created by the proposed one-time TS change have been considered. The relevant
components important to safety which are potentially affected are the containment structure, plant systems, and
containment penetrations. There are no physical or operational changes to any plant equipment associated with the
proposed TS change. Therefore, the probability or consequences of a malfunction of equipment important to safety
is not increased.

The proposed change introduces the possibility that primary containment leakage in excess of the allowable value
(i.e., La) would remain undetected during the proposed 24 month extension of the interval between the second and third
Type A test. The types of mechanisms which could cause degradation of the primary containment can be categorized into
two types. These are: 1) degradation due to work which is performed as part of a modification or maintenance activity
on a component or system (i.e., activity-based), or; 2) degradation resulting from a time-based failure mechanism.

A review of activity-based failure mechanisms has determined that the potential from degradation due to activity
based mechanisms is minimal.

Regarding the potential for primary containment degradation due to a time-based mechanism, we have concluded that
the PBAPS Local Leak Rate Test (LLRT) program would identify most types of penetration leakage. The LLRT program involves
measurement of leakage from Type B and Type C primary containment penetrations as defined in 10 CFR [Part] 50, Appendix
J.

The 10 CFR [Part] 50, Appendix J, Type B tests are intended to detect local leaks and to measure leakage across pressure
containing or leakage-limiting boundaries other than valves, such as containment penetrations incorporating
resilient seals, gaskets, expansion bellows, flexible seal assemblies, door operating mechanism penetrations
that are part of the containment system, doors, and hatches. 10 CFR [Part] 50, Appendix J, Type C testing is intended
to measure reactor system primary containment isolation valve leakage rates. The frequency of the Type B and Type
C testing is not being altered by the proposed TS change. [However, in an April 18, 1994 letter, the licensee has requested
a 60-day extension of the Type B and Type C testing.] The acceptance criterion for Type B and Type C leakage is 0.6 La (i.e.,
0.3 % wt/day) which, when compared to the Type A test acceptance criterion of 0.75 La (i.e., 0.375 % wt/day), is a significant
portion of the Type A test allowable leakage.

The proposed TS change only extends the interval between two consecutive Type A tests. The Type B and Type C tests will
be performed as required. The Type B and Type C tests will continue to be used to confirm that the containment isolation
valves and penetrations have not degraded. Containment system components that would not be tested are the containment
structure itself and small diameter instrumentation lines. Time-based degradation of any of the instrumentation
lines would most likely be identified by faulty instrument indication or during instrument calibrations that will
be performed during the PBAPS, Unit 2 refueling outage 10. In examining the potential for a time-based failure mechanism
that could cause significant degradation of the containment structure, we concluded that the risk, if any, of such
a mechanism is small since the design requirements and fabrication specifications established for the containment
structure are in themselves adequate to ensure containment leak tight integrity.

Based on the above evaluation, we have concluded that the proposed TS change will have a negligible impact on the consequences
of any accident previously evaluated. To support this conclusion, a review of the PBAPS, Unit 2 CILRT history was performed.
This review identified that the only failure mechanism that has been detected during the past CILRTs is an activity
based component failure, and that there is no indication of any time-based degradation that would not be identified
during performance of Type B and Type C tests.

Although this review concluded that the risk of undetected primary containment degradation is not increased, the
Individual Plant Examination (IPE) for PBAPS, Units 2 and 3, was also reviewed in order to assess the impact of exceeding
the primary containment allowable leakage rate, if a non-mechanistic activity type (i.e., time-based) failure
were to occur. The IPE included an evaluation of the effect of various containment leakage sizes under different scenarios.
The IPE results showed that a containment leakage rate of 35% wt/day would represent less than a 5% increase in risk
to the public being exposed to radiation. This evaluation was based on a study performed by Oak Ridge National Laboratory
for light water reactors that evaluated the impact of leakage rates on public risk. As stated earlier, the current
value of La for PBAPS, Unit 2, is 0.5% wt/day, which is significantly less than the 35% wt/day discussed in the IPE evaluation.

Therefore, the proposed TS change involving a one-time extension of the Type A test interval and performing the third
Type A test after the second Appendix J 10-year service period will not involve an increase in the probability or consequences
of an accident previously evaluated.

2. The proposed TS change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated.

The proposed change is an increase of a surveillance test interval and does not make any physical or operational changes
to existing plant systems or components. Primary containment acts as an accident mitigator not initiator. Therefore,
the possibility of a different type of accident than any previously evaluated or the possibility of a different type
of equipment malfunction is not introduced.

Therefore, the proposed TS change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident
previously evaluated.

3. The proposed TS change does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.

The total primary containment leakage rate ensures that the total containment leakage volume will not exceed the
value assumed in the safety analyses at the peak accident pressure. As an added conservatism, the measured overall
leakage rate is further limited to less than or equal to 0.75 La during performance of periodic tests to account for
possible degradation of the containment leakage barriers between leakage tests. There is the potential that containment
degradation could remain undetected during the proposed 24 month surveillance interval extension and result in
the containment leakage exceeding the allowable value assumed in safety analysis. A review of activity-based failure
mechanisms has determined that the potential from degradation due to activity based mechanisms is minimal.
 
Regarding the potential for primary containment degradation due to a time-based mechanism, we have concluded that
the PBAPS Local Leak Rate Test (LLRT) program would identify most types of penetration leakage. The LLRT program involves
measurement of leakage from Type B and Type C primary containment penetrations as defined in 10 CFR [Part] 50, Appendix
J.

The 10 CFR [Part] 50, Appendix J, Type B tests are intended to detect local leaks and to measure leakage across pressure
containing or leakage-limiting boundaries other than valves, such as containment penetrations incorporating
resilient seals, gaskets, expansion bellows, flexible seal assemblies, door operating mechanism penetrations
that are part of the containment system, doors, and hatches. 10 CFR [Part] 50, Appendix J, Type C testing is intended
to measure reactor system primary containment isolation valve leakage rates. The frequency of the Type B and Type
C testing is not being altered by the proposed TS change.

Finally, a review of the results of previous PBAPS, Unit 2 CILRT results concluded that the only failure mechanism
which has been detected during the past CILRTs is activity-based and that there is no indication of time-based failures
that would not be identified during performance of Type B and Type C tests. Therefore, we have concluded that the proposed
extended test interval would not result in a non-detectable PBAPS, Unit 2 primary containment leakage rate in excess
of the allowable value (i.e., 0.5% wt/day) established by the TS and 10 CFR [Part] 50, Appendix J.

Therefore, the proposed TS change does not involve a reduction in a margin of safety.



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

Authority, Docket No. 50-395, Virgil C. Summer Nuclear Station, Unit No. 1, Fairfield County, South Carolina




Date of amendment request: 

March 11, 1994


Description of amendment request: 

The proposed amendment would reduce the allowed outage time for the residual heat removal (RHR) suction relief valves
(SRVs) in accordance with the guidance of Generic Letter (GL) 90-06. 

Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration
which is presented below:



1. The probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated is not significantly increased. 

This change decreases the allowed outage time of a Low Temperature Overpressure Protection (LTOP) system. There
is no hardware, software, or operating methodology change, so there is no increase in probability or consequences.
Since the time allowed for one train of this equipment to be inoperable is shorter, the probability of an overpressure
event not being mitigated has also been reduced. The consequences will not change unless the system or operation of
the system changes. 
 
2. [The proposed change will not] [c]reate the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously
analyzed. 

As this proposed change will not involve any changes to hardware, software, or operating practices, it cannot create
any possibility of new or different kinds of accidents from those previously analyzed. The RHR SRVs are intended to
provide protection against a rupture of a pressure boundary from an over-pressure condition which has the potential
to result in core uncovery. The original design basis of the plant complies with the requirements of 10 CFR 50 Appendix
G and uses the RHR SRVs to meet the fracture toughness requirements of 10 CFR 50 Appendix G. This change only increases
the availability of this protection and does not create any new or different kinds of accidents. 

3. [The proposed amendment does not] [i]nvolve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. 

SCE&G already has administrative controls in place to minimize the possibility of an overpressure event occurring
as well as to assure that there are two trains of LTOP equipment operable during the modes when the potential exists
for this event. There are controls to preclude the inadvertent start-up of a Reactor Coolant Pump or Charging Pump
and controls to ensure that both RHR Suction Isolation Valves for each train are open and remain open except for testing
and maintenance. This alignment is maintained until the RHR System is realigned for its ECCS function. These controls
are proceduralized in plant operating procedures. 

This change does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety as nothing is changed which affects the margin
in a negative direction. The decrease in AOT actually increases the margin since the allowed time for one train to be
inoperable has been reduced. 



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

Date of amendment request: 

May 16, 1994 (TS 94-03) 


Description of amendment request: 

The proposed change would remove Table 3.3-2, ``Reactor Trip System Instrumentation Response Times,'' and Table
3.3-5, ``Engineered Safety Features Response Times,'' from the technical specifications and incorporate the limits
into the Updated Final Safety Analysis Report. In addition, references to these tables in Specifications 3.3.1.1,
3.3.2.1, and 4.3.1.1.3 (for Unit 1) and 3.3.1, 3.3.2, and 4.3.1.1.3 (for Unit 2) would be removed. A footnote would
be added to Specification 4.3.1.1.3 indicating that neutron detectors are exempt from response time testing. These
changes have been proposed in accordance with Generic Letter 93-08. A change to the Bases would indicate that the response
time limits would be maintained in the Updated Final Safety Analysis Report. 


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:



TVA has evaluated the proposed technical specification (TS) change and has determined that it does not represent
a significant hazards consideration based on criteria established in 10 CFR 50.92(c). Operation of Sequoyah Nuclear
Plant (SQN) in accordance with the proposed amendment will not:

1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.

The proposed change does not alter the response time limit requirements for the reactor trip or engineered safety
feature actuation systems or surveillance testing and frequency. Placing these limits in the Updated Final Safety
Analysis Report (UFSAR) will ensure the plant design basis is maintained in accordance with 10 CFR 50.59. Since no
actual changes to response time limits or surveillance requirements are involved, the probability or consequences
of an accident are not increased.

2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously analyzed.

The proposed changes does not affect any plant equipment, functions, or setpoint by relocating response time limits
to the UFSAR. Therefore, the possibility of a new or different kind of accident is not created.

3. Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.

The proposed change will continue to require SQN to maintain the plant functions at the required setpoints necessary
for the design basis and to support the accident analysis. The margin of safety is not reduced because there is no change
to plant functions and the 10 CFR 50.59 process will continue to ensure the plant design basis is appropriately maintained.



The NRC has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this
review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to
determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.

Description of amendment request: 

The proposed change would add a note to the action statement for Limiting Condition for Operation 3.7.7, ``Control
Room Emergency Ventilation System,'' indicating that the provisions of TS 3.0.3 are not applicable while performing
actions associated with a tornado warning. 


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:



TVA has evaluated the proposed technical specification (TS) change and has determined that it does not represent
a significant hazards consideration based on criteria established in 10 CFR 50.92(c). Operation of Sequoyah Nuclear
Plant (SQN) in accordance with the proposed amendment will not:

1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.

The control room emergency ventilation system (CREVS) was designed to ensure control room habitability during accident
conditions. The design basis of SQN does not include an accident creating a contaminated air condition concurrent
with a tornado. The ability of the CREVS to perform its design function has not been affected by this change. The proposed
change will not increase the possibility or consequences of an accident.

2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously analyzed.

An accident involving a contaminated air condition and a tornado have been analyzed as part of the SQN design basis.
Both accidents are assumed to occur independently. This change does not create a new or different accident not previously
analyzed.

3. Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.

The design basis of the CREVS is not impacted by this TS change. There is no change in any assumptions made in the Final
Safety Analysis Report. Therefore, there is no reduction in the margin of safety as a result of this change.



The NRC has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR

Date of amendment request: 

March 19, 1994; superseded May 16, 1994 (TS 93-04) 


Description of amendment request: 

The proposed change would clarify and consolidate the technical specifications (TS) regarding the dual function
of the containment vacuum relief system (i.e., the vacuum relief and containment isolation functions). The proposed
changes would revise TS 3/4.6.6, ``Vacuum Relief Valves,'' to indicate the actions that would be required should
one or more vacuum relief (VR) lines be incapable of performing its containment isolation function or incapable of
performing its VR function. In addition, the testing requirements would be revised to add specific requirements
and reflect the inservice test (IST) program by relocating the testing requirements from TS 4.6.3.2.d and Table 3.6-2
to the new TS 4.6.6 (and to Sequoyah's IST program). Other proposed changes affect Bases 3/4.6.6 section and TS index
pages to reflect the 
proposed changes indicated above. This proposed change was originally noticed on May 12, 1993 (58 FR 28060), which
is superseded by this notice. 

Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below: 


TVA has evaluated the proposed technical specification (TS) change and has determined that it does not represent
a significant hazards consideration based on criteria established in 10 CFR 50.92(c). Operation of Sequoyah Nuclear
Plant (SQN) in accordance with the proposed amendment will not:

1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.

TVA's proposed changes do not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated. The proposed change does not increase the probability of an accident since the proposed change does not
affect any plant systems, equipment, or components. The dual design functions of SQN's containment vacuum relief
(VR) system (i.e., provide containment VR and containment isolation) are not affected. The consequences of an event
are not significantly increased by the proposed increase in allowed outage time from 4 hours to 72 hours for returning
an inoperable VR system to operable status. The probability of an event during the relatively short duration of the
TS completion times, in conjunction with the redundancy provided in the design of the system, provide sufficient
assurance that the VR lines are available for mitigating an accident or abnormal event.

2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously analyzed.

No physical modification is being made to any plant hardware or plant operating setpoints, limits, or operating procedures
as a result of this change. TVA's proposed change provides a TS improvement that clarifies the TS requirements associated
with the dual design function of SQN's VR system. The proposed change removes the potential for creating a conflict
between Specification 3/4.6.3, ``Containment Isolation Valves,'' and Specification 3/4.6.6, ``Vacuum Relief
Valves.''

The proposed change does not alter any accident analysis or any assumptions used to support the accident analyses.
The containment leakage assumptions used to determine offsite dose limits for compliance with 10 CFR 100 are not affected.
The analysis that supports the containment VR system also remains unchanged. The proposed 72-hour and 1-hour completion
times for returning an inoperable VR line to operable status are consistent with the NUREG-1431 and NUREG-1433. Consequently,
the proposed change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously analyzed.

3. Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.

The margin of safety provided by the design of SQN's containment VR system remains unchanged. TVA's proposed change
does not affect the VR function or the containment isolation function that currently exists in SQN TSs. The proposed
change eliminates the potential for conflicting requirements within SQN TSs and ensures that the proper action is
taken to preserve these dual design functions while the plant is in Modes 1, 2, 3, or 4. TVA's proposed change provides
a TS improvement that combines these functional requirements into a single specification. Both VR and containment
isolation requirements will continue to be provided. Accordingly, the proposed change does not involve a reduction
in the margin of safety.



The NRC has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR
50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant
hazards consideration.

TU Electric Company, Docket Nos. 50-445 and 50-446, Comanche Peak Steam Electric Station, Units 1 and 2, Somervell
County, Texas




Date of amendment request: 

February 14, 1993


Brief description of amendments: 

The proposed amendments would revise the Comanche Peak Steam Electric Station (CPSES), Units 1 and 2, technical specifications
(TS) by (1) changing the allowable value for Unit 2 overtemperature N-16 and pressurizer pressure-low setpoints,
(2) deleting Equation 2.2-1 from TS 2.2.1, and (3) administrative changes. 


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:
 


1. The proposed change does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of a previously
evaluated accident.



Overtemperature N-16, Unit 2

Incorporation of the increased temperature uncertainties reported by Rosemount will change the Allowable Value
of the Overtemperature N-16 trip function. The change does not affect the Safety Analysis Limits assumed in the accident
analysis. Because the change only impacts the Allowable Value for a setpoint and does not affect any system designs
or operations, the change does not increase the probability of an accident. Although the Allowable Value is changed
in the conservative direction, the change assures that, considering the newly identified transmitter uncertainty,
the trip actuates prior to the conditions assumed in the accident analyses. As such, there is no impact on the consequences
of any accidents previously evaluated.

Pressurizer Pressure - Low, Unit 2

The added uncertainties change the Allowable Value of the Unit 2 Pressurizer Pressure-Low Reactor Trip function.
The change does not affect the Safety Analysis Limits assumed in the accident analysis. Because the change only impacts
the Allowable Value for a setpoint and does not affect the system design or operations, the change does not increase
the probability of an accident. Although the Allowable Value is changed in the conservative direction, the change
assures that, considering the newly identified transmitter uncertainty, the trip actuates prior to the conditions
assumed for the accident analyses. As such, there is no impact on the consequences of any accidents previously evaluated.

Equation 2.2-1

The changes to Specifications 2.2.1 and 3.3.2, to Tables 2.2-1 and 3.3-3, and to the bases sections will require recalibration
of the channel and removal of any accumulated errors in any function whose ``as found'' setpoint is found to be less
conservative than its allowable value. These changes delete a potentially less conservative option and will result
in actual channel operation closer to the nominal setpoint and within the allowable value band. These changes will
in effect validate one of the assumptions made in the accident analysis and will not increase the probability or consequences
of any accident evaluated in the Safety Analysis Report.

Administrative Changes

The changes to combine the Unit 1 and Unit 2 line items into a dual Unit line if the Trip Setpoint and Allowable Value values
are the same is administrative and meant as a human factors improvement for operator convenience. The change does
not affect the operation of any equipment, the operating point of any equipment, nor any equipment hardware and thus
does not increase the probability or consequences of any accident evaluated in the Safety Analysis Report.

2. The proposed change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously analyzed
accident. 
Overtemperature N-16 and Pressurizer Pressure - Low, Unit 2

As the proposed amendment changes only the Unit 2 Allowable Values of the Overtemperature N-16 reactor trip and the
Pressurizer Pressure-Low reactor trip and does not have any physical effect on the transmitter or circuitry, there
are no new or different types of accident introduced.

Equation 2.2-1

Deletion of this equation and its associated action statements, definitions and values does not introduce any physical
changes to any systems, structures, or components. The change merely assures that setpoints which are less conservative
than their Allowable Value are recalibrated prior to being declared operable. These changes do not introduce any
new credible failure modes which may create the possibility of a new or different accident.

Administrative Changes

Combining line items for Unit 1 and Unit 2 into a dual Unit entry for administrative purposes does not introduce any
new credible failure modes which may create the possibility of a new or different accident.

3. The proposed change does not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety.

Overtemperature N-16 and Pressurizer Pressure - Low, Unit 2

Incorporation of the added temperature uncertainties of the Rosemount transmitters assures that the safety analysis
limits assumed in the accident analyses for Overtemperature N-16 and Pressurizer Pressure-Low reactor trip functions
for Unit 2 are met. There is no change in the acceptance criteria or the results of these analyses due to this change.
Thus there is no effect on the margin of safety.

Equation 2.2-1

Deletion of Equation 2.2-1, related actions and associated definitions and values, merely eliminates one option
to assure that the safety analysis assumptions are met. This option is not presently in use and the accident analyses
assumptions have been and will continue to be met using the other option (to re-calibrate channels prior to restoring
operability). Thus the margin of safety is unaffected.

Administrative Changes

Combining the Unit 1 and Unit 2 line items of Table 2.2-1 for RTS [Reactor Trip Systems] functions and of Table 3.3-3
for ESFAS [Engineered Safety Features Actuation System] functions into dual unit entries does not change the Trip
Setpoint or the Allowable Value for the functions. The margin of safety is unaffected.



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of

Wolf Creek Nuclear Operating Corporation, Docket No. 50-482, Wolf Creek Generating Station, Coffey County, Kansas





Date of amendment request: 

April 19, 1994


Description of amendment request: 

The proposed amendment revises Technical Specification 6.2.2.g to reflect a title designation change within the
Wolf Creek Nuclear Operating Corporation (WCNOC) organization. The title of Supervisor Operations is being changed
to Assistant Manager Operations. The title change does not represent any change in reporting relationships, job
responsibilities, or overall organizational commitments.


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:



1. The proposed change does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated.

The proposed change does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated. This change involves an administrative change to the WCNOC organization and to the position title and
as such has no effect on plant equipment or the technical qualification of plant personnel.

2. The proposed change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated.

The proposed change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated.
This change is administrative in nature and does not involve any change to installed plant systems or the overall operating
philosophy of Wolf Creek Generating Station.

3. The proposed change does not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety.

The proposed change does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. This change does not involve any
changes in overall organizational commitments. A position title change alone does not reduce any margin of safety.



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

Wolf Creek Nuclear Operating Corporation, Docket No. 50-482, Wolf Creek Generating Station, Coffey County, Kansas




Date of amendment request: 

April 19, 1994


Description of amendment request: 

The proposed amendment revises Technical Specification Table 3.6-1, ``Containment Isolation Valves,'' by deleting
reference to two (2) valves. The Technical Specification change reflects a planned modification which removes the
essential service water (ESW) containment air cooler return line isolation valve bypass valves and associated piping.


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:



1. The proposed change does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated.

After the design modification is completed the ESW Containment Penetrations will be provided with stainless steel
isolation valves, which will be provided with automatic SIS [safety injection signal] actuation signals to open
automatically to provide required cooling water flow to the Containment Air Coolers following a LOCA [loss-of-coolant
accident] or MSLB [main steamline break]. Replacement of the current carbon steel isolation valves with stainless
steel valves and removing the unnecessary bypass lines and bypass isolation valves will reduce the amount of seat
leakage currently experienced with these valves. 
The probability of occurrence of a previously evaluated accident is not increased because this modification does
not introduce any new potential accident initiating conditions. The consequences of an accident previously evaluated
is not increased because the ability of containment to restrict the release of any fission product radioactivity
to the environment will not be degraded by this modification.

2. The proposed change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated.

The proposed modification will reduce the number of containment isolation valves and replace several carbon steel
isolation valves with stainless steel valves, which will be less susceptible to erosion and corrosion. Thus, potential
system leakage will be reduced by this modification, while valve reliability will be enhanced. The new valves are
designed to the original ESW System requirements, and removal of the bypass lines and bypass isolation valves will
not result in a malfunction of any other plant equipment. Therefore, this proposed modification will not create the
possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated.

3. The proposed change does not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety.

The removal of the bypass lines and bypass isolation valves will not adversely affect containment isolation capability
for credible accident scenarios. Due to a previous design change, the bypass lines are no longer required to ensure
adequate cooling flow to the Containment Air Coolers. In addition, the operability and reliability of the remaining
isolation valves will be enhanced by replacing the current carbon steel valves with stainless steel valves. 



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

Notice Of Issuance Of Amendments To Facility Operating Licenses And Final Determination Of No Significant Hazards
Consideration And Opportunity For A Hearing (Exigent Public Announcement Or Emergency Circumstances)



During the period since publication of the last biweekly notice, the Commission has issued the following amendments.
The Commission has determined for each of these amendments that the application for the amendment complies with the
standards and requirements of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act), and the Commission's rules and regulations.
The Commission has made appropriate findings as required by the Act and the Commission's rules and regulations in
10 CFR Chapter I, which are set forth in the license amendment. 
Because of exigent or emergency circumstances associated with the date the amendment was needed, there was not time
for the Commission to publish, for public comment before issuance, its usual 30-day Notice of Consideration of Issuance
of Amendment, Proposed No Significant Hazards Consideration Determination, and Opportunity for a Hearing. 
For exigent circumstances, the Commission has either issued a 

Federal Register 

notice providing opportunity for public comment or has used local media to provide notice to the public in the area
surrounding a licensee's facility of the licensee's application and of the Commission's proposed determination
of no significant hazards consideration. The Commission has provided a reasonable opportunity for the public to
comment, using its best efforts to make available to the public means of communication for the public to respond quickly,
and in the case of telephone comments, the comments have been recorded or transcribed as appropriate and the licensee
has been informed of the public comments.
In circumstances where failure to act in a timely way would have resulted, for example, in derating or shutdown of a
nuclear power plant or in prevention of either resumption of operation or of increase in power output up to the plant's
licensed power level, the Commission may not have had an opportunity to provide for public comment on its no significant
hazards consideration determination. In such case, the license amendment has been issued without opportunity for
comment. If there has been some time for public comment but less than 30 days, the Commission may provide an opportunity
for public comment. If comments have been requested, it is so stated. In either event, the State has been consulted
by telephone whenever possible.
Under its regulations, the Commission may issue and make an amendment immediately effective, notwithstanding the
pendency before it of a request for a hearing from any person, in advance of the holding and completion of any required
hearing, where it has determined that no significant hazards consideration is involved. 
The Commission has applied the standards of 10 CFR 50.92 and has made a final determination that the amendment involves
no significant hazards consideration. The basis for this determination is contained in the documents related to
this action. Accordingly, the amendments have been issued and made effective as indicated. 
Unless otherwise indicated, the Commission has determined that these amendments satisfy the criteria for categorical
exclusion in accordance with 10 CFR 51.22. Therefore, pursuant to 10 CFR 51.22(b), no environmental impact statement
or environmental assessment need be prepared for these amendments. If the Commission has prepared an environmental
assessment under the special circumstances provision in 10 CFR 51.12(b) and has made a determination based on that
assessment, it is so indicated.
For further details with respect to the action see (1) the application for amendment, (2) the amendment to Facility
Operating License, and (3) the Commission's related letter, Safety Evaluation and/or Environmental Assessment,
as indicated. All of these items are available for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, the
Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555, and at the local public document room for the particular
facility involved. 
The Commission is also offering an opportunity for a hearing with respect to the issuance of the amendment. By July
22, 1994, the licensee may file a request for a hearing with respect to issuance of the amendment to the subject facility
operating license and any person whose interest may be affected by this proceeding and who wishes to participate as
a party in the proceeding must file a written request for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene. Requests for
a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's ``Rules of Practice
for Domestic Licensing Proceedings'' in 10 CFR Part 2. Interested persons should consult a current copy of 10 CFR 2.714
which is available at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington,
DC 20555 and at the local public document room for the particular facility involved. If a request for a hearing or petition
for leave to intervene is filed by the above date, the Commission or an Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, designated
by the Commission or by the Chairman of the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board Panel, will rule on the request and/or
petition; and the Secretary or the designated Atomic Safety and Licensing Board will issue a notice of a hearing or
an appropriate order. 
As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall set forth with particularity the interest of the
petitioner in the proceeding, and how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding. The petition
should specifically explain the reasons why intervention should be permitted with particular reference to the following
factors: (1) the nature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made a party to the proceeding; (2) the nature and
extent of the petitioner's property, financial, or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect
of any order which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest. The petition should also identify
the specific aspect(s) of the subject matter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Any person
who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has been admitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting
leave of the Board up to 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended
petition must satisfy the specificity requirements described above.
Not later than 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file
a supplement to the petition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions which are sought to be litigated
in the matter. Each contention must consist of a specific statement of the issue of law or fact to be raised or controverted.
In addition, the petitioner shall provide a brief explanation of the bases of the contention and a concise statement
of the alleged facts or expert opinion which support the contention and on which the petitioner intends to rely in proving
the contention at the hearing. The petitioner must also provide references to those specific sources and documents
of which the petitioner is aware and on which the petitioner intends to rely to establish those facts or expert opinion.
Petitioner must provide sufficient information to show that a genuine dispute exists with the applicant on a material
issue of law or fact. Contentions shall be limited to matters within the scope of the amendment under consideration.
The contention must be one which, if proven, would entitle the petitioner to relief. A petitioner who fails to file
such a supplement which satisfies these requirements with respect to at least one contention will not be permitted
to participate as a party. 
Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subject to any limitations in the order granting leave
to intervene, and have the opportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, including the opportunity
to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses. Since the Commission has made a final determination that the amendment
involves no significant hazards consideration, if a hearing is requested, it will not stay the effectiveness of the
amendment. Any hearing held would take place while the amendment is in effect. 
A request for a hearing or a petition for leave to intervene must be filed with the Secretary of the Commission, U.S.
Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Docketing and Services Branch, or may be delivered
to the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555, by the above
date. Where petitions are filed during the last 10 days of the notice period, it is requested that the petitioner promptly
so inform the Commission by a toll-free telephone call to Western Union at 1-(800) 248-5100 (in Missouri 1-(800) 342-6700).
The Western Union operator should be given Datagram Identification Number N1023 and the following message addressed
to 

(Project Director)

: petitioner's name and telephone number, date petition was mailed, plant name, and publication date and page number
of this 

Federal Register 

notice. A copy of the petition should also be sent to the Office of the General Counsel, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,
Washington, DC 20555, and to the attorney for the licensee. 
Nontimely filings of petitions for leave to intervene, amended petitions, supplemental petitions and/or requests
for a hearing will not be entertained absent a determination by the Commission, the presiding officer or the Atomic
Safety and Licensing Board that the petition and/or request should be granted based upon a balancing of the factors
specified in 10 CFR 2.714(a)(1)(i)-(v) and 2.714(d).

<DOCTITLE>Northeast Utilities (Millstone Nuclear Plant, Unit 1); Receipt of Petition for Director's Decision Under 10 CFR
2.206</DOCTITLE>



Notice is hereby given that by letter dated May 23, 1994, Anthony J. Ross (Petitioner) has requested that the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission (Commission): (1) Issue a Severity Level II violation against a maintenance manager at the
Millstone plant, (2) institute other sanctions against the manager, and (3) remove the maintenance manager from
his position until resolution of the issues raised in his request.

Petitioner, who is employed as an electrician at the plant, asks for this action on the grounds that he was told by the
maintenance manager that he must report all safety concerns to the manager before reporting them elsewhere. Petitioner
asserts that this action reflects an environment of harassment, retaliation and intimidation that exists at the
Millstone plant.

The request is being treated pursuant to 10 CFR 2.206 of the Commission's regulations. The request has been referred
to the Director of the Office of Enforcement. As provided by section 2.206, appropriate time will be taken on this request
within a reasonable time.

A copy of the Petition is available for inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, 2120 L Street NW., Washington,
DC 20555.

<DOCTITLE>Illinois Power Co.; Consideration of Issuance of Amendment to Facility Operating License, Proposed No Significant
Hazards Consideration Determination, and Opportunity for a Hearing</DOCTITLE>



The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an amendment to Facility Operating
License No. NPF-62, issued to the Illinois Power Company (the licensee), for operation of the Clinton Power
Station, Unit 1, located in DeWitt County, Illinois.

The proposed amendment would modify Technical Specification 3/4.4.3.1, ``Reactor Coolant System Leakage_Leakage
Detection Systems,'' to permit continued plant operation with inoperable drywell floor drain sump flow rate monitoring
instrumentation. Continued plant operation would be permitted until the first time the plant is required to be brought
to COLD SHUTDOWN after July 10, 1994.

Technical Specification 3/4.4.3.1 requires that systems capable of monitoring unidentified reactor coolant system
leakage rates remain operable. Rector coolant system leakage that falls on the drywell floors is channeled through
the floor drains and enters the drywell floor drain sump. Prior to entering the floor drain sump, water passes through
the drywell floor drain sump flow monitoring instrumentation where the instantaneous flow rates and total integrated
flow are measured. The flow monitoring instrumentation consists of a V-notch weir box containing a capacitance probe.
Water flows through a V-notch water level which is directly proportional to the flow through the weir box. Thus, flow
through the V-notch is equal to the sump inlet flow rate. The capacitance probe is calibrated to correspond to the incoming
flow rate and provides a continuous control room indication of the unidentified reactor coolant system leakage rate.
An alarm is generated when the technical specification limit of 5 gpm of unidentified leakage occurs. The V-notch
weir box instrumentation meets the accuracy and sensitivity requirements of Regulatory Guide 1.45 for drywell floor
drain sump flow monitoring.

The licensee began to observe questionable readings from the indicated drywell floor drain sump inlet flow and subsequently
declared the drywell floor drain sump monitoring instrumentation inoperable on June 10, 1994. Technical Specification
3.4.3.1 permits 30 days of continuous plant operation provided the drywell floor drain sump flow rate is monitored
and determined by alternative means at least once every 8 hours.

All efforts by the licensee to restore the drywell sump inlet flow monitoring instrumentation to operable status
have been unsuccessful. The instrument loop has been recalibrated and equipment external to the drywell has been
verified to be operating properly. The only option remaining for the licensee is to enter the drywell in order to examine
the V-notch weir box and associated capacitance probe. However, the V-notch weir box is located in a keyway beneath
the reactor vessel and inside the biological shield wall. Due to the high radiation and temperatures in this location,
a plant shutdown would be required before personnel would be able to reach the instrumentation.

In a letter dated June 20, 1994, the licensee requested that this amendment application be treated as an emergency
because unless approved, technical specifications would require a plant shutdown. The licensee stated that such
action would be necessary to preclude an unnecessary plant transient and related plant risk associated with a plant
shutdown. Due to time constraints, sufficient time is not available to permit the customary public notices in advance
of this action.

Before issuance of the proposed license amendment, the Commission will have made findings required by the Atomic
Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act) and the Commission's regulations.

Pursuant to 10 CFR 50.91(a)(6) for amendments to be granted under exigent circumstances, the NRC staff must determine
that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration. Under the Commission's regulations
in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not (1) involve
a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated; or (2) create the
possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant
reduction in a margin of safety. As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue
of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below:

(1) The proposed change does not affect any initiators of any previously evaluated accidents. Additionally, the
proposed change involves equipment that only provides indication and therefore, it cannot increase the probability
of any accident previously evaluated. 
As stated in Updated Safety Analysis Report (USAR) Section 7.7.1.24.1, no credit is taken in the safety analysis for
operation of or operator reliance upon the leakage detection monitoring instrumentation associated with the drywell
sumps. Notwithstanding, the drywell floor drain sump flow monitoring system provides the capability to detect and
measure leakage from unknown sources of leakage in the drywell. The drywell floor drain sump inlet flow monitoring
V-notch weir box instrumentation is designed to meet the accuracy requirements of Regulatory Guide 1.45. This instrumentation
does not provide any automatic action or control functions. In addition to the V-notch system, drywell floor drain
sump flow rates can be determined by using the sump pump pump-out timers, cycle counters and level switches. In addition,
unidentified leakage into the drywell is monitored by a flow rate meter in the condensate discharge line from the drywell
air coolers and by a particulate and a gaseous radiation monitoring channel of the drywell fission product monitor.
While the drywell fission product monitor does not provide a quantitative leakage rate, it is sensitive enough to
provide plant operators with early indication of an unanticipated increase in unidentified leakage. Furthermore,
a number of other parameters are monitored with appropriate instrumentation to provide the plant operators with
indirect indication of increases in unidentified leakage. These parameters include drywell pressure and drywell
temperature. These alternative methods of detecting increases in unidentified leakage rates provide operators
with sufficient information to take appropriate action to respond to an increase in leakage. Based on the above, Illinois
Power concludes that the proposed change will not increase the consequences of any accident previously evaluated.

(2) The proposed change does not involve any modification to plant structures or components and only involves equipment
that provides indication of leakage to the plant operators. The affected equipment does not provide any automatic
action or control functions. As a result, the proposed change does not involve a change in the operation of the plant,
nor does it introduce any new failure modes. Therefore, this proposed change cannot create the possibility of a new
or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. 
(3) The margin of safety associated with the instrumentation affected by the proposed change may be related to the
limits on unidentified leakage. As stated in the Bases for Technical Specification 3/4.4.3.2. ``The allowable leakage
rates from the reactor coolant system have been based on the predicted and experimentally observed behavior of cracks
in pipes . . . The evidence obtained from experiments suggests that for leakage somewhat greater than
that specified for unidentified leakage the probability is small that the imperfection or crack associated with
such leakage would grow rapidly. With respect to Intergranular Stress Corrosion Cracking (IGSCC) related cracks
in service sensitive austenitic stainless steel piping however, an additional limit on the allowed increase in unidentified
leakage (within a 24-hour period or less) is imposed in accordance with NRC Generic Letter 88-01, `NRC Position
on IGSCC in BWR Austenitic Stainless Steel Piping,' since an abrupt increase in the unidentified leakage could be
indicative of leakage from such a source.'' The proposed change does not alter any of these limits on the unidentified
leakage. 
As previously described, flow rates into the drywell floor drain sump can be determined based on the indicated run
time for the sump pumps and the known pump flow rates or by monitoring the sump fill-up times and considering the volume
corresponding to the current level control band. These alternate methods are sufficient to determine whether unidentified
leakage in the drywell exceeds the 5 pgm limit and whether changes in this leakage exceed the limit of a 2 gpm increase
in any 24-hour period or less. 
Additionally, with respect to the ability to detect changes in unidentified leakage rates, in addition to the V-notch
system, drywell floor drain sump flow rates can be determined by using the sump pump pump-out timers, cycle counters
and level switches. In addition, unidentified leakage into the drywell is monitored by a flow rate meter in the condensate
discharge line from the drywell air coolers and by a particulate and a gaseous radiation monitoring channel of the
drywell fission product monitor. While the drywell fission product monitor does not provide a quantitative leakage
rate, it is sensitive enough to provide plant operators with early indication of an unanticipated increase in the
unidentified leakage rate involving reactor coolant. Furthermore, a number of other parameters are monitored with
appropriate instrumentation to provide the plant operators with indirect indication of increases in unidentified
leakage. These parameters include drywell pressure and drywell temperature. 
As stated above, the drywell floor drain sump flow monitoring instrumentation does not provide any automatic action
or control functions. Further, as stated in USAR Section 7.7.1.24.1, no credit is taken in the safety analysis for
operation of or operator reliance upon the leakage detection monitoring instrumentation associated with the drywell
sumps. 
In light of all the above, Illinois Power concludes that the proposed change does not involve a reduction in the margin
of safety.



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration. 
The Commission is seeking public comments on this proposed determination. Any comments received within 15 days after
the date of publication of this notice will be considered in making any final determination. 
Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendment until the expiration of the 15-day notice period. However,
should circumstances change during the notice period, such that failure to act in a timely way would result, for example,
in derating or shutdown of the facility, the Commission may issue the license amendment before the expiration of the
15-day notice period, provided that its final determination is that the amendment involves no significant hazards
consideration. The final determination will consider all public and State comments received. Should the Commission
take this action, it will publish in the 

Federal Register

 a notice of issuance. The Commission expects that the need to take this action will occur very infrequently.

NRC Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street NW., Washington, DC 20555.

The filing of requests for hearing and petitions for leave to intervene is discussed below.

By July 22, 1994, the licensee may file a request for a hearing with respect to issuance of the amendment to the subject
facility operating license and any person whose interest may be affected by this proceeding and who wishes to participate
as a party in the proceeding must file a written request for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene. Requests
for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's ``Rules of Practice
for Domestic Licensing Proceedings'' in 10 CFR Part 2. Interested persons should consult a current copy of 10 CFR 2.714
which is available at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington,
DC 20555 and at the local public document room located at the Vespasian Warner Public Library, 120 West Johnson Street,
Clinton, Illinois, 61727. If a request for a hearing or petition for leave to intervene is filed by the above date, the
Commission or an Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, designated by the Commission or by the Chairman of the Atomic Safety
and Licensing Board Panel, will rule on the request and/or petition; and the Secretary or the designated Atomic Safety
and Licensing Board will issue a notice of hearing or an appropriate order.

As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall set forth with particularly the interest of the
petitioner in the proceeding, and how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding. The petition
should specifically explain the reasons why intervention should be permitted with particular reference to the following
factors: (1) The nature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made a party to the proceeding; (2) the nature and
extent of the petitioner's property, financial, or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect
of any order which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest. The petition should also identify
the specific aspect(s) of the subject matter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Any person
who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has been admitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting
leave of the Board up to 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended
petition must satisfy the specificity requirements described above.

Not later than 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file
a supplement to the petition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions which are sought to be litigated
in the matter. Each contention must consist of a specific statement of the issue of law or fact to be raised or controverted.
In addition, the petitioner shall provide a brief explanation of the bases of the contention and a concise statement
of the alleged facts or expert opinion which support the contention and on which the petitioner intends to rely in providing
the contention at the hearing. The petitioner must also provide references to those specific sources and documents
of which the petitioner is aware and on which the petitioner intends to rely to establish those facts or expert opinion.
Petitioner must provide significant information to show that a genuine dispute exists with the applicant on a material
issue of law or fact. Contentions shall be limited to matters within the scope of the amendment under consideration.
The contention must be one which, if proven, would entitle the petitioner to relief. A petitioner who fails to file
such a supplement which satisfies these requirements with respect to at least one contention will not be permitted
to participate as a party.

Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subject to any limitations in the order granting leave
to intervene, and have the opportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, including the opportunity
to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses.

If the amendment is issued before the expiration of the 30-day hearing period, the Commission will make a final determination
on the issue of no significant hazards consideration. If a hearing is requested, the final determination will serve
to decide when the hearing is held.

If the final determination is that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration, the Commission
may issue the amendment and make it immediately effective, notwithstanding the request for a hearing. Any hearing
held would take place after issuance of the amendment.

If the final determination is that the amendment request involves a significant hazards consideration, any hearing
held would take place before the issuance of any amendment.

A request for a hearing or a petition for leave to intervene must be filed with the Secretary of the Commission, U.S.
Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Docketing and Services Branch, or may be delivered
to the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street NW., Washington, DC 20555, by the above
date. Where petitions are filed during the last 10 days of the notice period, it is requested that the petitioner promptly
so inform the Commission by a toll-free telephone call to Western Union at 1-(800) 248-5100 (in Missouri
1-(800) 342-6700. The Western Union operator should be given Datagram Identification Number N1023 and
the following message addressed to John Hannon, Director, Project Directorate III-3; petitioner's name and
telephone number, date petition was mailed, plant name, and publication date and page number of this 

Federal Register

<DOCTITLE>Southern Nuclear Operating Co.; Notice of Consideration of Issuance of Amendment to Facility Operating License,
Proposed No Significant Hazards Consideration Determination, and Opportunity for a Hearing</DOCTITLE>


The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an amendment to Facility Operating
License No. NPF-2 issued to Southern Nuclear Operating Company (the licensee) for operation of the Joseph M.
Farley Nuclear Plant, Unit 1, located in Houston County, Alabama.
The proposed amendment would change Technical Specification 3/4.2.3 to change the nuclear enthalpy rise hot channel
factor (F delta H) from equal to or less than 1.65 [1 plus .3(1-P)] to equal to or less than 1.70 [1 plus .3(1-P)]
where P is a fraction of rated power. The amendment would also revise the action statement to reflect guidance contained
in the improved standard technical specifications.
Before issuance of the proposed license amendment, the Commission will have made findings required by the Atomic
Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act) and the Commission's regulations.
The Commission has made a proposed determination that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.
Under the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facility in accordance with the
proposed amendment would not (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee
has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below:



1. Will the proposed amendment involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated?
The proposed increase in [F delta H] for Vantage 5 fuel does not involve a significant increase in the probability or
consequences of an accident previously evaluated in the Farley Final Safety Analysis Report. No changes in the mechanical
design of the fuel are necessary for this [F delta H] increase. No new performance requirements are being imposed on
the fuel or any system or component because of this change. Vantage 5 fuel contains several features that provide increased
margin to core limits. The proposed increase in [F delta H] is utilization of this margin with no violation of any acceptance
criteria. Subsequently, overall plant integrity is not reduced. [F delta H] is not an accident initiator. Therefore,
the probability of an accident has not significantly increased.

The radiological consequences of all accidents, including the fuel handling accident, remain within the previous
appropriate acceptance limits as well as those included in 10CFR100. Therefore, the radiological consequences
to the public resulting from any accident previously evaluated in the Final Safety Analysis Report has not significantly
increased.

2. Will the proposed amendment create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated?
The proposed specification change to the [F delta H] limit does not create the possibility of a new or different kind
of accident from any previously evaluated in the Final Safety Analysis Report. No new accident scenarios, failure
mechanisms, or limiting single failures are introduced as a result of the increase in [F delta H]. Any accident using
the revised analytical assumption has been evaluated or reanalyzed and it has been determined that there is no adverse
effect on, or do not challenge the performance of, any safety-related system. Therefore, the possibility of a new
or different kind of accident, is not created.

3. Will the proposed amendment involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety?

The Vantage 5 technical specification change for increasing [F delta H] does not involve a significant reduction
in the margin of safety. The margin of safety for the Vantage 5 fuel parameters are defined by the accident analyses
that are performed to conservatively bound the operating conditions defined by the technical specifications and
to demonstrate that the regulatory acceptance limits are met. Performance of analyses (including the LBLOCA [large
break loss-of-coolant accident]) and evaluations for the proposed inclusion of an increased [F delta H] for Vantage
5 fuel type confirmed that the operating envelope defined by the technical specifications continues to be bounded
by the revised analytical basis, which in no case exceeds the acceptance limits. Therefore, the margin of safety provided
by the analyses in accordance with these acceptance limits is maintained and is not significantly reduced.




The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

The Commission is seeking public comments on this proposed determination. Any comments received within 30 days after
the date of publication of this notice will be considered in making any final determination.

Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendment until the expiration of the 30-day notice period. However,
should circumstances change during the notice period such that failure to act in a timely way would result, for example,
in derating or shutdown of the facility, the Commission may issue the license amendment before the expiration of the
30-day notice period, provided that its final determination is that the amendment involves no significant hazards
consideration. The final determination will consider all public and State comments received. Should the Commission
take this action, it will publish in the 

Federal Register 

a notice of issuance and provide for opportunity for a hearing after issuance. The Commission expects that the need
to take this action will occur very infrequently.

Written comments may be submitted by mail to the Rules Review and Directives Branch, Division of Freedom of Information
and Publications Services, Office of Administration, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555,
and should cite the publication date and page number of this 

Federal Register 

notice. Written comments may also be delivered to Room 6D22, Two White Flint North, 11555 Rockville Pike, Rockville
Maryland, from 7:30 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. Federal workdays. Copies of written comments received may be examined at the
NRC Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street NW., Washington, DC 20555.

The filing of requests for hearing and petitions for leave to intervene is discussed below.

By July 22, 1994, the licensee may file a request for a hearing with respect to issuance of the amendment to the subject
facility operating license and any person whose interest may be affected by this proceeding and who wishes to participate

<DOCTITLE>Washington Public Power Supply System Nuclear Project No. 2 (WNP-2); Exemption</DOCTITLE>


I


Washington Public Power Supply System (the licensee) is the holder of Facility Operating License No. NPF-21
which authorizes operation of the WNP-2 Nuclear Plant at steady-state reactor power levels not in excess of
3323 megawatts thermal. The WNP-2 facility is a boiling water reactor located on Hanford Reservation in Benton
County near Richland, Washington. The license provides, among other things, that it is subject to all rules, regulations,
and Orders of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) now or hereafter in effect.


II


Paragraph III.D.3 of Appendix J to 10 CFR Part 50 requires, in part, that ``Type C tests shall be performed during each
reactor shutdown for refueling but in no case at intervals greater than two years.'' By letter dated April 29, 1987,
the staff issued an exemption from the requirement for Type C testing during each reactor refueling shutdown, and
an extension of the maximum interval from 24 months to 27 months for Type B and C testing. This exemption specifically
excluded Containment Purge Supply and Exhaust Valves, which the staff required to continue to be tested at the existing
6-month interval.
Pursuant to 10 CFR 50.12(a), the NRC may grant exemptions from the requirements of the regulations (1) which are authorized
by law, will not present an undue risk to public health and safety, and are consistent with the common defense and security;
and (2) where special circumstances at present.


III


By letter dated March 25, 1994, the licensee requested an exemption from 10 CFR 50 Appendix J to allow Type C testing
of Containment Purge Supply and Exhaust Valves with metal-to-metal seats at 27-month intervals. The licensee plans
to replace approximately half of the valves during the 1994 refueling outage, and the remainder at a future date. No
change to the 6-month test interval is requested for the remaining Containment Purge Supply and Exhaust Valves that
have resilient seats. In a letter dated December 20, 1993, regarding an associated technical specification change
request, the licensee stated that the new valves have been proven by industry experience and design to be capable of
maintaining design requirements for leakage over an extended period of time. The licensee indicated that the replacement
valves will be required to meet even tighter permissible leakage limits. Extending the maximum allowable interval
between tests to 27 months is requested to allow for variations in the weather-related length of the approximately
annual operating cycle from year to year. Details concerning the justification for extending the Type C test interval
from 24 to 27 months are contained in the staff's letter granting the exemption dated April 29, 1987.


IV


Accordingly, the Commission concluded that the licensee's proposed test schedule for the metal-to-metal seated
Containment Purge Supply and Exhaust Valves is acceptable, and can be tested at a 27-month maximum interval. The remaining
valves with resilient seats will continue to be tested every 6 months.
The special circumstances for granting this exemption pursuant to 10 CFR 50.12 have also been identified. As stated
in part 10 CFR 50.12(a)(2)(ii), special circumstances are present when applicable of the regulation in the particular
circumstance is not necessary to achieve the underlying purpose of the rule. Application of the resilient-seated
valve leak test requirements to metallic-seated valves would increase surveillance and maintenance costs for no
increased safety benefit. The vendor certifies that appropriate leakage criteria are met, as applicable. The licensee
states that the valve design, specifications, and qualification documentation for these valves verify that Type
C leakage testing intervals are appropriate. The special circumstance of 10 CFR 50.12(as)(2)(ii) for extending
the Type C leakage test interval from 24 months to 27 months is as described in the staff's letter granting the exemption
dated April 29, 1987. Consequently, the Commission concludes that the special circumstances of 10 CFR 50.12(a)(2)(ii)
exist in that application of the regulation in these particular circumstances is not necessary to achieve the underlying
purpose of the rule.


V


Accordingly, the Commission has determined that, pursuant to 10 CFR 50.12, this exemption as described in Section
III. above is authorized by law, will not present an undue risk to the public health and safety, and is consistent with
the common defense and security. The Commission further determines that special circumstances as provided in 10
CFR 50.12(a)(2)(ii) are present justifying the exemption.
Therefore, the Commission hereby grants an exemption from the requirement for Type C testing during each reactor
refueling shutdown, with an extension of the maximum interval from 24 months to 27 months for Type C testing, as described
in Section III. above.
Pursuant to 10 CFR 51.32, the Commission has determined that the granting of this exemption will have no significant
impact on the environment (59 FR 27075).




Dated at Rockville, Maryland this 15th day of June 1994.




This exemption is effective upon issuance.




For the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

Notice and request for comments.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

Notice is hereby given that the Trade Policy Staff Committee (TPSC) is requesting written public comments with respect
to market access issues, particularly tariffs and non-tariff measures and services, related to China's participation
in the GATT and the WTO. Comments received will be considered by the Executive Branch in developing the U.S. position

<USDEPT>SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION</USDEPT>






June 15, 1994.



Self-Regulatory Organizations; the Depository Trust Company; Notice of Filing of a Proposed Rule Change Relating
to Establishment if the Stock Loan Income-Tracking System 



Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''),
 notice is hereby given that on May 6, 1994, The Depository Trust Company (``DTC'') filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II, and III below, which Items have
been prepared primarily by DTC. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule
change from interested persons.





I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change



The proposed rule change will establish the stock loan income-tracking system that will eliminate the need for participants
to track income distributions on their securities that are the subject of outstanding stock loans.



II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



In its filing with the Commission, DTC included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule
change. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. DTC has prepared summaries,
set forth in sections, A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.



A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



Participants have informed DTC that pursuant to the terms of stock loan agreements, the borrower must promptly pass
to the lender distributions received on the borrowed securities during the period that the loan is outstanding. Stock
loan activity among participants is a high-volume business, and there usually are many outstanding loans in DTC's
system at any one time. Because the underlying collateral involved in these loans constantly changes, careful record
keeping of loan activity for the purpose of determining the proper allocation of income distributions is important.

While existing DTC procedures enable participants to identify stock loan-related deliver orders (``DOs'') through
the use of reason codes, proper allocation of income payments arising from these loans currently rests entirely with
the lending and borrowing participants because DTC currently allocates such income to participants to whom the securities
are credited on the relevant date (

i.e.,

 generally the record date). Lending participants recover income that DTC has allocated to borrowers of securities
either through DTC's securities payment order (``SPO'') service or through some other mechanism upon which the participants
mutually agree.

The proposed stock loan income-tracking system will facilitate participants' processing of income attributable
to securities that are the subject of outstanding stock loans.
 The proposed system will track and monitor participants' stock loan-related DOs; will net the share amounts by participant,
CUSIP, and transaction type; and will automatically credit income distributions to the proper participant on income
payment date. To accomplish this, DTC will create a special stock loan memo account, which will maintain a daily net
balance of loan obligations for each stock loan counterparty of each participant.





Should a stock loan memo position not balance with a participant's records (

e.g.,

 because of a DO processed with an incorrect reason code), either the lending or borrowing participant can adjust the
stock loan memo account position through the participant terminal system (``PTS''). Any such adjustments will be
subject to affirmation by the counterparty participant.

In addition, the proposed rule change will provide that a party from whom distributions are due to be transferred may
unilaterally halt all future distribution transfers by giving a letter of instructions to DTC two or more business
days in advance and by giving a copy to the counterparty. DTC will notify the counterparty participant of any action
DTC takes based on the instructions. DTC will implement the directions contained in the letter of instructions without
making any determination about the parties' legal obligations to each other. If the participant submitting the letter
of instructions is in fact still legally obligated, the noninstructing counterparty may seek to enforce its right
to receive future distributions outside of DTC.

If by reason of merger, acquisition, or the like, one participant's accounts are being transferred to another participant,
DTC also will transfer the transferring participant's open stock loan positions to the transferee participant.

Before permitting a participant to retire, DTC will verify that the participant has closed out all its entitlements
and obligations for future distributions created by stock loans. If DTC ceases to act for a participant, DTC will determine
which other DTC participants are stock loan counterparties and will adjust those participants' stock loan memo account
positions in order to balance the elimination of DTC's obligations and rights to or from the terminated participant.
The counterparties' legal obligations or rights with respect to the terminated participant will not be changed DTC's
action. However, because DTC will cease allocating distributions attributable to the terminated participant's
transactions, remaining counterparty participants will have to make arrangements outside DTC to receive or pay
future distributions on any stock loans with the terminated participant that remains open after DTC has ceased to
act.

Before the stock loan income-tracking system is implemented, DTC will provide a means for participants to load DTC's
stock loan data base with information about currently outstanding stock loans. Deliveries made after implementation
with a stock loan reason code will automatically be added to this data base.

<DOCNO> FR940622-2-00087 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940622-2-00065 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 


The proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of Section 17A of the Act and the rules and regulations
thereunder because it is an automated procedure that will eliminate inefficient income processing by stock loan
counterparties. The proposed rule change also is consistent with DTC's obligation under Section 17A to safeguard
securities and funds in its custody or control or for which it is responsible because the proposal provides reports
and inquiry functions to participants for their review and reconciliation and provides for the termination of future
DTC obligations upon a participants's voluntary or involuntary termination of its membership. 



B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition 



DTC perceives no impact on competition by reason of the proposed rule change. 



C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants,
or Others 



DTC's plan to investigate the automation of stock loan income processing was announced to participants in the 1991
DTC Program Agenda which described a stock loan tracking system, similar to DTC's repurchase agreement tracking,
that would monitor participant stock loan positions and automatically credit the lender instead of the borrower
with dividends or interest due. The system was also noted in the 1992 and 1993 Program Agendas. DTC held a series of meetings
with approximately ten broker and bank participants to solicit their comments on plans for the stock loan income-tracking
system. These comments were incorporated into the final design of the proposed system. 

Written comments received on the 1991 Program Agenda included comments from thirteen participants and others on
stock loan income-tracking system. (No comments were received on either the 1992 or 1993 Program Agenda entry.)
 Two of those comments raised issues to which responses follow. In its November 27, 1991, comment letter, the Securities
Industry Association asked whether DTC could assist participants with the monitoring of substitute payments by
a special report. In response, DTC notes that in the proposed system income payments will be coded as stock loan payments
on DTC's reports to participants, and the participant will have the ability to identify stock loan income payments
on electronic files. In its December 18, 1991, comment letter, the New York Clearing House recommended that DTC develop
access to the stock loan income-tracking service through DTC's computer-to-computer facility and mainframe dual
host as well as through PTS. In response, DTC notes that the reason codes on DOs that will trigger stock loan income-tracking
are accepted by all three means of DO input. 




III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action 



Within thirty-five days of the date of publication of this notice in the 

Federal Register

 or within such longer period (i) as the Commission may designate up to ninety days of such date if it finds such longer
period to be appropriate and published its reasons for so finding or (ii) as to which the self-regulatory organization
consents, the Commission will: 
(A) By order approve the proposed rule change or 
(B) Institute proceedings to determine whether the proposed rule change should be disapproved. 



IV. Solicitation of Comments 



Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views, and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statement,
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying in the Commission's
Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of such filing will also be available
for inspection and copying at the principal office of the above-referenced self-regulatory organization. All submission
should refer to File No. SR-DTC-94-07 and should be submitted by July 13, 1994.

 business days, the Corporation shall give at least [10] 

3

 business days' prior written notice of a Member of any proposed increase in his Required Deposit. If a Member fails
to give written notice to the Corporation of his election to terminate his business with the Corporation within [10]


3

 business days after notice of the increase was given to him, he shall deposit in the Clearing Fund that which is necessary
to satisfy the increase in his Required Deposit; in such event the Member's obligation to so deposit shall not be affected
by his subsequent cessation of membership, whether voluntary or involuntary. At the time the increase becomes effective,

The Gross Debit Value shall equal the largest single daily gross debit value minus 15% of the INS receive value for that
day, calculated in dollars, based on debit values for the calendar week following the week in which the calculation
is performed.
The Market Risk Factor shall be the largest calculated percentage change over 11 days in the Financial Times Index
over a minimum of 365 days.
The Foreign Exchange Factor shall be equal to: (Gross Debit Value x Estimated Foreign Exchange Volatility)

* * * * *


II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change


In its filing with the Commission, ISCC included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule
change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined
at the places specified in Item IV below. ISCC has prepared summaries, set forth in sections A, B, and C below, of the
most significant aspects of such statement.


A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and the Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change


(a) The proposed rule change consists of a change of ISCC's clearing fund formula. ISCC's responsibility to the London
Stock Exchange under the linkage agreement is to pay for securities delivered. ISCC has no responsibility to complete
open pending trades. ISCC's current Clearing Fund calculation therefore is based on the ISCC member's average daily
gross settlement debits and takes into consideration purchases due for settlement and purchases which have failed
to settle.
To cover ISCC's market risk exposure, ISCC has been collecting 21/2% of the average gross settlement value over two
account periods (this 21/2% reflected the calculated market risk exposure in 1986). Because trades are executed
in pounds and ISCC would be required to purchase pounds to meet the settlement obligation, ISCC also has been collecting
a percentage of the gross settlement value to cover the foreign exchange risk. This has amounted to .5%. Since trades
currently settle on a fortnightly settlement basis, the Clearing Fund has been calculated and collected on a bi-weekly
basis.
When the London Stock Exchange moves to a ten day rolling settlement cycle on July 18, 1994, trades will settle on a daily
basis ten days after trade date. ISCC will continue to be obligated to pay for securities which are delivered to members
in the event that the members are unable to complete their settlement obligation. ISCC still will have market risk
and foreign exchange risk, but the period of time to which ISCC will be subject to these risks will change.
To adequately cover ISCC's exposure, the clearing fund deposit will be calculated and collected on a weekly basis.
The formula will be based on trades which are due to settle in the week following the calculation. Calculations will
be made each Tuesday, and ISCC members will be required to deposit additional amounts within three days. This process
will permit ISCC to collect clearing fund deposits prior to the settlement of the transactions.
The formula will take into consideration the largest daily gross debit obligation, for trades due to settle in the
week following the calculation, offset by a percentage for Institutional Net Settlement Participant (``INSP'')
redeliveries. The debits will be offset only partially since these items may be reclaimed by the receiver, and in such
circumstance ISCC will be liable to the London Stock Exchange for the full value of the reclamation. ISCC will apply
a market risk factor and foreign exchange risk factor to this debit obligation. Initially the factors will be determined
as set forth below and will be reviewed annually thereafter.

<PARENT> FR940622-2-00066 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

To determine the appropriate percentage for market risk, ISCC will review the Financial Times Index and assume that
it will take one day to sell all positions. Based on a ten day settlement cycle this will result in 11 days elapsing from
trade date to close out date. Accordingly, the formula will take into consideration the largest price movement over
an 11 day period. Initially ISCC will use the largest price movement in 1993 of 7% for the market risk factor component
of the formula.

To calculate the foreign exchange risk, ISCC will review the daily rate fluctuation for the exchange rate between
the British Pound and U.S. Dollars. Initially, ISCC will use data from the 1989-1992 period and the maximum fluctuation
during that time was 4.445%. This number will be used on the foreign exchange factor component of the formula.

Currently, Clearing Fund Requirements for ISCC members on surveillance are increased, in the discretion of the Corporation,
by requiring up to an additional 3%, 5%, and 7% of average daily debits for members on Advisory, Class A, and Class B surveillance,
respectively. The same increases (of three, five, and seven percent for Advisory, Class A, and Class B surveillance)
will be retained under the new formula, only they will be added to the Market Risk Factor and Foreign Exchange Risk Factor.

(b) The proposed rule changes will permit ISCC to safeguard securities and funds in its custody or control and is therefore
consistent with Section 17A of the Act.



B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition



ISCC does not believe that the proposed rule change imposes any burden on competition.



C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members. Participants,
or Others



ISCC has received no written comments. ISCC will notify the Commission of any written comments received by ISCC.



III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action 



Within thirty-five days of the date of publication of this notice in the 

Federal Register 

or within such longer period: (i) as the Commission may designate up to ninety days of such date if it finds such longer
period to be appropriate and publishes its reasons for so finding or (ii) as to which the self-regulatory organization
consents, the Commission will:

A. By order approve the proposed rule change, or

B. Institute proceedings to determine whether the proposed rule change should be disapproved.



IV. Solicitation of Comments



Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views, and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C.  552, will be available for inspection and copying in the Commission's
Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street, N.W., Washington, D.C., 20549. Copies of such filing also will be available
for inspection and copying at the principal office of the above-mentioned self-regulatory organization. All submissions
should refer to File No. SR-ISCC-94-1 and should be submitted by July 13, 1994.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; the Options Clearing Corporation; Notice of Filing and Immediate Effectiveness
of a Proposed Rule Change Relating to Conversion of Delivery Versus Payment Authorization Process to an On-Line System
</DOCTITLE>



June 15, 1994. 



Pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, (``Act''),
 notice is hereby given that on October 15, 1992, The Options Clearing Corporation (``OCC'') file with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II, and III below, which
Items have been prepared primarily by OCC. On November 12, 1993, OCC submitted an amendment
 so that the proposed rule change would file pursuant to section 19(b)(3)(A)
 instead of section 19(b)(2) of the Act.
 The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons.









I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change 



The purpose of the proposed rule change is to allow OCC to convert its Delivery Versus Payment (``DVP'') authorization
process to an on-line system. The changes proposed herein will require OCC's clearing members to submit DVP authorization
instructions to OCC via electronic means and, thereby, will eliminate the use of paper DVP authorization forms and
the need for clearing members to make physical delivery of such forms to OCC's offices. 



II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change




In its filing with the Commission, OCC included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule
change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined
at the places specified in Item IV below. OCC has prepared summaries, set forth in sections (A), (B), and (C) below of
the most significant aspects of such statements. 



A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change




DVP authorization is an alternate settlement procedure for the settlement of foreign currency options and cross-rate
foreign currency options.
 Pursuant to the DVP authorization process, a clearing member's approved DVP bank guarantee to OCC's agent bank delivery
on the exercise settlement date of either a designated quantity of foreign currency against payment of a specified
sum of U.S. dollars or a specified sum of U.S. dollars against delivery of a designated quantity of a foreign currency.
The current DVP authorization process is a batch system which begins on the first business day following exercise
when a clearing member brings a completed multipart DVP authorization form to the OCC operations window on the business
day following exercise.
 Following submission of the DVP form to OCC, the clearing member must wait until notified by OCC that the DVP instructions
have been accepted. OCC accepts DVP instructions after verifying that the form has been filled out correctly and that
the DVP amounts are valid. 






Once the DVP instructions have been accepted, OCC returns a copy of the form to the clearing member. Upon receiving
the accepted DVP form, the initiating clearing member must deliver a copy of the accepted DVP form to its own agent bank.
OCC transmits the DVP instructions to its own agent bank through an electronic communications link. In addition to
transmitting the DVP information via computer, OCC sends a hard copy DVP log to its agent bank. 

On the second business day following exercise, the clearing member's DVP agent bank must send a SWIFT or tested telex
message to OCC's agent bank guaranteeing payment of dollar and/or foreign currency settlement amounts to OCC's agent
bank or OCC's correspondent bank. On the third business day following exercise, OCC's agent bank must confirm to OCC
that the guarantee message from the clearing member's DVP agent bank was received. OCC receives confirmation from
its agent bank via facsimile. On the fourth business day following exercise, the clearing member's DVP agent bank
must make an irrevocable transfer of U.S. dollars and/or foreign currency to the designated OCC agent bank or OCC's
correspondent bank in the country of origin. 

The current DVP processing system is a manually intensive and time consuming process. Accordingly, OCC is proposing
to convert the DVP authorization process to an on-line system. OCC is proposing to accomplish this goal in two Phases.
Phase 1 will require clearing members to submit DVP instructions to OCC and receive confirmations of acceptance from
OCC via electronic means. This change would eliminate the paper DVP authorization form and the need for clearing members
to physically deliver such forms to OCC. In Phase 2, OCC will propose changes which will allow members to submit DVP
messages to their DVP agency banks via electronic means a well. This filing, File No. SR-OCC-93-17,
seeks to make the changes necessary to accomplish only Phase 1.
 





The proposed rule change will require clearing members to submit and receive electronic DVP messages to and from OCC
through the use of the Clearing Management and Control System (``C/MACS'').
 The on-line DVP instructions will contain the same information currently required on the DVP authorization form.
Once an on-line DVP instruction is entered, the same verification/acceptance process currently performed by OCC
staff will be performed through C/MACS. The clearing member will receive an on-line confirmation of acceptance message
shortly after entering the DVP instruction. In addition, the clearing member will be able to inquire about the status
of a DVP instruction by viewing an on-line screen.

Once the clearing member's DVP instruction has been entered and accepted and OCC has completed its processing, the
clearing member will be able to print an OCC C/MACS-generated authorization report from its own computer terminal.
This new report will replace the DVP authorization form and will contain all of the information currently on the DVP
authorization form with the exception of an OCC signature. The clearing member will be required to deliver the C/MACS-generated
report to its DVP agent bank and to direct such DVP agent bank to issue a SWIFT or tested telex message to OCC's agent bank
guaranteeing delivery or payment, as the case may be, in accordance with the terms of the DVP authorization instruction
contained in the report. 

OCC will send a message to its own agent bank through an electronic communications link to confirm the terms of the accepted
DVP instructions. Following receipt of the guarantee message from the clearing member's DVP agent bank, OCC's agent
bank or correspondent bank will carry out its payment or delivery obligation to the recipient named in the DVP authorization
instruction on the exercise settlement date.

In general, the proposed changes to OCC Rules 1606A and 2107 will require clearing members to submit DVP instructions
to OCC through on-line transmissions.
 Other specific changes are also being made. Language is being added to Rule 1606A(b) to clarify that a clearing member's
``agent bank'' is an approved bank acting on its behalf. The additional language will make the language of Rule 1606A(b)
consistent with the language of Rule 2107(b).





Rules 1606A(c) and 2107(c) are being amended to reflect an operational change in OCC's DVP processing. Currently,
a clearing member may specifically elect to apply a DVP instruction to settle all or part of a gross settlement obligation
or a net settlement obligation. Under the proposed on-line system, a clearing member will not be permitted to elect
whether its DVP instruction is applied to a gross settlement obligation or a net settlement obligation. Rather, the
system will automatically apply the DVP instruction to the clearing member's gross settlement obligation and then
adjust the clearing member's remaining net settlement obligation accordingly. This remaining net settlement obligation
will then settle through the regular settlement procedures pursuant to Rule 1606.

Rules 1606A(d) and 2107(d) are being amended to provide that OCC's confirmation of acceptance of the clearing member's
DVP authorization instruction will be carried out through an on-line confirmation message from OCC to the clearing
member rather than by OCC's signature on a DVP form. Rules 1606A(f) and 2107(f) are being amended to provide that the
clearing member must deliver to its agent bank a C/MACS-generated DVP report that contains the approved DVP instructions
instead of the OCC-endorsed DVP form.
Finally, an interpretation is being added both to Rule 1606A and to Rule 2107 to provide that should unusual or unforeseen
circumstances prevent a clearing member from submitting DVP instructions by on-line data entry prior to any applicable
cut-off time, OCC in its discretion may require the clearing member to submit such item by other approved means, including
the use of hard copy forms, and/or may extend the applicable cut-off time.
As part of the development of the on-line DVP system, extensive testing was undertaken to assess the operational impact
of the new on-line system. Based on OCC's testing of the on-line CVP system, OCC has determined that the implementation
of the on-line DVP authorization process should not stress OCC's current processing systems.
With respect to security, internal and external controls have been put in place to ensure the integrity of the data
and the software of the product. Data security is maintained through security software. In addition, OCC's Security
Administration Department develops, reviews, and maintains appropriate security guidelines and standards. The
integrity of OCC's operating systems is maintained through limited access to central systems libraries. Physical
access to OCC's systems is restricted to those employees that require access. Finally, on-line access is restricted
to users with authorized log-in IDs and passwords.
With respect to contingency procedures, OCC has adequate back-up procedures in place to ensure the timely continuation
of DVP processing in the event that any problem develops with respect to the on-line system. For instance, if C/MACS
were not functioning properly, OCC could permit a clearing member to enter the DVP instructions at one of OCC's offices
or to submit hard copy forms. Furthermore, if a system failure were to prevent a clearing member from submitting any
DVP instruction through on-line data entry prior to any applicable cut-off time, OCC could extend such cut-off time
by such period as OCC deemed reasonable, practicable, and equitable under the circumstances.
OCC believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with Section 17A(b)(3)(F)
 of the Act because it promotes the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of securities transactions by substantially
reducing the paperwork associated with the DVP settlement process. OCC believes that this first step in converting
the DVP authorization process to an on-line system will make the system operationally more efficient and will reduce
the time delays inherent in a system using paper forms. Furthermore, OCC believes that it has sufficiently considered
capacity, security, and contingency issues in its development of the on-line DVP authorization system and that the
proposed on-line DVP system should in no way pose a threat to the integrity or security of OCC's current processing
systems.





B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition



OCC does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any burden on competition.



C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received from Members, Participants
or Others


Written comments were not and are not intended to be solicited with respect to the proposed rule change, and none have
been received.



III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action


The foregoing rule change has become effective pursuant to section 19(b)(3)(A)
 of the Act and pursuant to Rule 19b-4(e)(4)
 in that the proposed rule change effects a change in an existing service of OCC that does not adversely effect the safeguarding
of securities or funds in custody or control of OCC and does not significantly effect the rights or obligations of OCC
or persons using the service. At any time within sixty days of the filing of such proposed rule change, the Commission
may summarily abrogate such rule change if it appears to the Commission that such action is necessary or appropriate
in the public interest, for the protection of investors, or otherwise in furtherance of the purposes of the Act.





IV. Solicitation of Comments



Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views, and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submission should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450 Fifth
Street NW., Washington DC 20549. Copies of the submissions, all subsequent amendments, all written statements with
respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating to
the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying in the Commission's
Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of such filings will also be available
for inspection and copying at the principal offices of OCC. All submissions should refer to File No. SR-OCC-93-17
and should be submitted by July 13, 1994.



For the Commission by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. Chapter 35), this document announces the Office
of Personnel Management's (OPM) request to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for clearance of proposed job
application procedures. These procedures would replace the SF 171, Application for Federal Employment, which is
being discontinued as recommended by the National Performance Review. The proposed procedures described in this
notice were recommended by an interagency task force.



To allow time to implement the proposed procedures, OMB has approved an extension of the authorization of SF 171 and
related forms through September 30, 1994. OPM has further requested that authorization for these forms be extended
through December 31, 1994. The procedures proposed in this notice would take effect on January 1, 1995.
OPM estimates that the public reporting burden to file a Federal job application would vary from 10 minutes to 240 minutes
with an average of 40 minutes. OPM estimates that the public reporting burden to file the Declaration for Federal Employment
would vary from 5 minutes to 60 minutes with an average time of 15 minutes.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Summary of Process To Replace SF 171


The SF 171, Application for Federal Employment, has been the primary form used by individuals to apply for Federal
jobs since 1968. However, the National Performance Review (NPR) recommended eliminating standard application
forms, such as the SF 171, which is considered a barrier to attracting workers to the Federal service because it is long
and complex. Therefore, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) proposes to replace the SF 171 with an approach that
allows applicants to use a resume or other form of written application they choose. 
OPM and agencies need to collect information on education, work experience, and personal background that is necessary
to determine an applicant's qualifications, eligibility, and fitness for Federal employment. OPM and agency authority
to collect this information is primarily in sections 1104, 1302, 3301, 3304, 3320, 3361, 3393, and 3394 of Title 5,
United States Code, covering employment in the competitive service, excepted service, and Senior Executive Service,
including selection from among current and former Federal employees.
To implement the NPR recommendation, OPM convened an interagency task force, representing 16 agencies, which recommended
new application procedures described in this notice. OPM sought comments on implementing these recommendations
from the National Partnership Council, the Interagency Advisory Group (personnel directors from more than 90 agencies),
unions holding national consultation rights with OPM, and organizations representing major constituent groups.
The resulting approach provides:
 Alternative methods for agencies to collect information from job applicants (written, telephone, and automated
techniques);
 Applicant choices in how they submit written applications;
 Two new optional forms and an information flyer for use beginning in 1995; and
 The separation of qualifications and suitability information in applications.


Temporary Extension of SF 171 and Related Forms


1. To allow sufficient time to implement the proposed application procedures, OMB has extended the authorization
for the following standard forms through September 30, 1994, and is considering OPM's request for extension through
December 31, 1994:





SF 171, Application for Federal Employment (OMB Control No. 3206-0012)
SF 171-A, Continuation Sheet for SF 171 (OMB Control No. 3206-0012)
SF 172, Amendment to Application for Federal Employment (OMB Control No. 3206-0002


OMB also has extended authorization for a related form, the SF 61-B, Declaration of Appointee (OMB Control No.
3206-0182), 

through December 31, 1994.


Proposed Procedures for Federal Job Applications


2. Overview


The goal of these proposed application procedures is to make it easier for individuals to apply for Federal jobs and
to present their qualifications in a manner they believe will enhance their job opportunities. At the same time, the
proposal would provide methods for agencies to obtain sufficient information to evaluate job applicants. So that
the public reporting burden may be reduced and agencies may better protect privacy of individuals by restricting
access to more sensitive background data, qualifications information would be collected separately from suitability
information.


3. Agency Options


Agencies could request and collect applicant data electronically or through printed vacancy/examination announcements
(and supplements to them), and paper resume/applications. Electronic media include (but are not liimited to) applications
filed by telephone as well as data that applicants provide on computer scannable forms. (See paragraph 6 on agency
specific forms for use with electronic systems.)
Regardless of the method used, agencies would be authorized to collect necessary information of the type they currently
collect from job applicants, for example: Identification, including name, address, social security number, date
of birth, phone numbers. Job related qualifications, such as work experience, education, minimum college credits
for professional positions, training, licenses, accomplishments, evidence of specialized knowledge, skills,
and abilities.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940622-2-00103 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940622-2-00077 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Personal information to satisfy general legal requirements, when applicable, such as citizenship, veterans' preference,
minimum and maximum age requirements, and proof of competitive status.

Applicant preferences, where applicable, such as work location, work schedule, type of employment (permanent or
temporary). 

To tell applicants what information to include in their resumes/applications, we propose to issue a flyer called
Applying for a Federal Job. The flyer also alerts applicants that fraudulent statements can be punished by fine or
imprisonment, job finalists will be asked to certify the accuracy of their statements, and in some instances all applicants
may be required to provide this certification. (A copy of the flyer is appended to this notice.)

The flyer would be widely available through OPM's field offices, agency personnel offices, State Employment Service
offices, and other organizations that deal with Federal job seekers. Printed versions could be purchased through
the General Services Administration or could be obtained from OPM's electronic bulletin boards without charge.

Agencies could incorporate in their vacancy announcements the information requested in the flyer and could request
any other job-related information required by the position(s) to be filled.

Disposition of incomplete applications would be subject to individual agency policy, as is currently the case. Each
agency determines whether incomplete applications will be rejected, evaluated to the extent possible, or subject
to follow up for additional information.



4. Applicant Options



Beginning January 1, 1995, applicants could choose the format of their written applications, for example, a resume,
the optional application discussed in paragraph 5, or any other written application an individual chooses. Individuals
may have a supply of SF 171 forms or SF 171 computer software; such applications would be acceptable if applicants chose
to use them (but an agency could not require SF 171).

To assist applicants in preparing their resumes/applications, the proposed flyer, Applying for a Federal Job, shows
the types of information agencies require for evaluating job applicants (see paragraph 3). For applicants who prefer
a more structured approach, the proposed optional application form would be available, as discussed in paragraph
5.



5. New Optional Forms



Two new optional forms are proposed:

a. ``Optional Application for Federal Employment'' is a simplified application for individuals who prefer a form.
It would be particularly useful for applicants who do not have extensive job-related qualifications, such as recent
graduates or applicants for entry or wage grade positions. (The form would have a short tear-off sheet with brief instructions
and the Privacy Act and Public Burden Statements). This optional application contains information considered to
be the minimum necessary to determine an applicant's qualifications. (The information requested parallels the
contents of the flyer described in paragraph 3.)

Since the intent of this proposal is to give applicants flexibility in preparing job applications, Federal agencies
could not require all applicants to use the optional application form, except where the agency had developed a computer-compatible
version of the optional application. This exception is necessary because automated systems usually can operate
only with specific formats and questions.

The optional application would be widely available through OPM field offices, agency personnel offices, Statement
Employment Service offices, and other organizations that deal with Federal job seekers. Printed versions could
be purchased through the General Services Administration or the form could be obtained without charge on a computer
file from OPM's electronic bulletin boards.

b. ``Declaration for Federal Employment'' would be used primarily to collect information on conduct and suitability,
and also on other matters, such as receipt of a government annuity. (The form would have a short tear-off sheet with
brief instructions and the Privacy Act and Public Burden Statements.) Agencies would have the option of asking applicants
to complete this optional form at any time during the hiring process, but it would be required of all appointees. We
anticipate that, in most cases, only the final few applicants who have a good chance of receiving a job offer would complete
the form.

Another important purpose of the Declaration for Federal Employment would be to warn applicants of the consequences
of submitting fraudulent information and to ask them to certify the accuracy of all their application materials.
At the time of appointment, individuals would again be asked to sign a certification so that they could indicate any
changes that occurred between the date of the initial certification and date of appointment.

(This certification for appointees is a part of the existing SF 61-B, Declaration of Appointee. The SF 61-B,
which also contains suitability and insurance questions, would be replaced in 1995 by the proposed Declaration for
Federal Employment.)

OPM has proposed a 3-year expiration date (the maximum permitted under the Paperwork Reduction Act) for both the optional
application and declaration form. We also propose that the expiration date not be displayed on the forms because of
the anticipated large volume that would be in circulation at any time. Samples of both forms are appended to this notice.

Agency Variations


6. Agency-Specific Forms


To prevent a proliferation of government application forms and the resulting burden to the public, OMB and OPM would
encourage agencies to use the process described in this notice. We anticipate that only rarely would agencies need
an agency-specific form, for example, when necessary for an electronic application system or for unique occupations
with highly specialized requirements. 
Agencies are required by the Paperwork Reduction Act to obtain OMB approval of any agency-specific application form
required from ten or more persons who are not agency employees. The Act does not preclude an agency, however, from developing
its own form for required use by its current employees. Also, agencies would not need OMB approval to develop a computer-compatible
(but otherwise identical) version of the Optional Application for Federal Employment and require its use by all applicants.
Use of a non-identical computer-compatible application would require OMB approval. 


7. Agency-Specific Questions


In addition to the information items listed in paragraph 3, agencies would be permitted to add any of the following
three items, if applicable, to the information they request for applicants. These items are unique to certain agencies
or positions and, therefore, are not included on the proposed optional forms.


a. Spouse Preference


Under section 806 of the Defense Authorization Act, 1986 (Pub. L. 99-145), the Department of Defense must give
preference in hiring to military spouses. To determine eligibility and extend preference, the Department of Defense
may ask the following question. Without this information, Defense could not comply with the preference requirement.
The question may be included in any document of Defense's choosing, for example, a vacancy announcement or as an addition
to one of the proposed forms.



Are you applying to exercise Spouse Preference?


( ) Yes  ( ) No


If yes, attach a copy of your sponsor's active duty military orders of assignment to the geographic location of the
position vacancy or written evidence or documentation that verifies eligibility. 


b. Child Care Workers


Section 231 of the Crime Control Act of 1990 (Pub. L. 101-647) requires that employment applications for Federal
child care positions contain a question asking whether the individual has ever been arrested for or charged with a
crime involving a child and for the disposition of the arrest or charge. Also, the application containing this information
must state that it is being signed under penalty of perjury, and identify the penalty. The law requires the hiring agency
to obtain the applicant's signed receipt of notice that a criminal record check will be conducted and that the applicant
has a right to review and challenge the accuracy of the report. 


To assure compliance with this law, agencies may add the following question to the Declaration for Federal Employment
for applicants for child care positions: 



Have you ever been arrested for or charged with a crime involving a child? If ``Yes,'' provide the date, ex
