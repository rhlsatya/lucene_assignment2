OFFICE OF PERSONNEL MANAGEMENT











Interagency Placement Program



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Office of Personnel Management.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Interim rule with request for comments.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Office of Personnel Management is issuing revised interim regulations that implement the new Interagency Placement
Program. This new program supersedes the Displaced Employee Program and Interagency Placement Assistance Program
through which OPM provided job placement assistance to employees displaced by reduction in force. In response to
requests for a more effective and simplified program, OPM merged these existing programs into one single automated
comprehensive program, the Interagency Placement Program which became activated on December 1, 1993. Through this
program, OPM can provide quicker and better placement service to employees and agencies. In addition, 5 CFR part 351,
Reduction in Force, is being amended to add  351.807, Certification of Expected Separation, which was erroneously
removed at 58 FR 32046 dated June 8, 1993.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

OPM operated two placement programs, the Displaced Employee Program and the Interagency Placement Assistance Program.
Upon requests from agencies, OPM developed the new Interagency Placement Program. Agencies stated the Displaced
Employee Program and the Interagency Placement Assistance Program did not meet their needs. Among their reasons
were:





 Displaced Employee Program registrants were not required to update their registrations. When employees
were referred to agencies through the Displaced Employee Program, many were no longer available or could not be reached.
This resulted in a high declination rate and a slow, ineffective and cumbersome referral process, and was very costly
and time-consuming to the agencies. It also affected the credibility of the program.

 Each OPM Service Center maintained its own Displaced Employee Program inventory. When an agency recruited
for a position that was located in a geographic area not within the jurisdiction of its local OPM Service Center, it
had to contact another OPM Service Center to clear the Displaced Employee Program. It was confusing to agencies as
to which Service Center to contact.

 The Interagency Placement Assistance Program was not successful in placing employees who were identified
as surplus.

 The Interagency Placement Assistance Program was not successful in placing excepted service employees who
did not have personal competitive status.

Similar to the Displaced Employee Program, agencies must consider Interagency Placement Program registrants before
making competitive appointments to positions that are expected to last more than 1 year. This means that agencies
must consult the Interagency Placement Program inventory when filling positions through a competitive register
held by OPM or an agency with delegated examining authority; direct-hire authority; or the Outstanding Scholar provision.
Agencies do not need to consult the Interagency Placement Program inventory when making noncompetitive appointments
or conversions to the competitive service. No individual may be selected for such a vacancy as long as a qualified IPP
registrant is available. Appointing officers may not pass over an IPP eligible to select a non-IPP eligible unless
an objection to the IPP eligible is sustained.

To meet the needs of its customers and resolve the problems identified, OPM is proposing only a few changes to existing
regulations. The existing regulations remain the same with the following changes to 5 CFR part 330, subparts C, D,
and H; 5 CFR part 323, subpart C and 5 CFR part 351, subpart H:

 these proposed regulations reflect the new Interagency Placement Program name;

 the Interagency Placement Program automates and centralizes OPM's placement program, expedite the referral
process, reduces costs to the agencies, increases the period of placement assistance for career-conditional employees
from 1 year to 2 years, and requires registrants to update their registration every 6 months to maintain a current placement
program inventory;

 excepted service employees must have personal competitive status obtained from a previous appointment and
be in Tenure 1 or 2 to be eligible for registration in the Interagency Placement Program; and

 employees must have received a specific reduction in force notice or a Certification of Expected Separation
to register in the new Interagency Placement Program.

Agency personnel offices have been provided an Interagency Placement Program Operating Plan and an Automated Applicant
Referral System Users Handbook which describe the operation of the Interagency Placement Program.



Waiver of Notice of Proposed Rulemaking and Delay in Effective Date



Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(3)(B), I find that good cause exists for waiving the general notice of proposed rulemaking
because it would be contrary to the public interest to delay access to benefits. Also, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3),
I find that good cause exists to make this amendment effective in less than 30 days. The delay in the effective date is
being waived to give effect to the benefits extended by the amended provisions at the earliest practicable date.



Regulatory Flexibility Act



I certify that this regulation will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities
because it affects only certain Federal employees.

 330.301



Coverage.



This subpart covers the Interagency Placement Program for employees who will be displaced or have been separated
from their Federal jobs as a result of agency work force reductions, compensable on-the-job injury, discontinued
service retirement or disability retirement. Agencies have the primary responsibility for providing placement
assistance to their surplus or displaced employees, and for operating positive placement programs as set forth in
 330.307 of this subpart. OPM supplements these agency efforts by administering an Interagency Placement
Program which gives surplus or displaced employees priority referral to positions in other agencies.



 330.302



OPM Interagency Placement Program.



OPM operates the Interagency Placement Program (IPP) which provides placement assistance to employees who have
received a Certification of Expected Separation or specific notice of separation, or who have been separated.

3. In section 330.303, paragraph (a) is removed and reserved, and paragraphs (b) introductory text and (b)(4)(iii)
are revised to read as follows:



 330.303



Eligibility.



* * * * *



(b) For the IPP, the registrant must:

(4) * * *

(iii) Has fully or partially recovered from a compensable injury in accordance with the provisions of sub-chapter
I of chapter 81 of title 5, United States Code, when the agency is unable to restore the employee;



* * * * *



4. Section 330.304 is revised to read as follows:



 330.304



Period of eligibility.



Employees registered in the IPP receive 2 years of OPM placement assistance renewable in 6 month increments by the
registered employee.

5. In section 330.305, paragraphs (a), (b) and (d) are revised to read as follows:



 330.305



Placement assistance.



(a) IPP registrants are referred ahead of other candidates when they are qualified and available for vacancies expected
to last more than 1 year and that are filled through competitive appointments. No individual may be selected for such
a vacancy as long as a qualified IPP registrant is available. Referrals are based on qualifications of registrants.

(b) Placement assistance is nationwide except that registrants who decline transfer or reassignment outside the
commuting area may register for placement assistance only within the commuting area of the position from which they
will be or were separated. However, these registrants may transfer their eligibility to another commuting area if
they later relocate.



* * * * *



(d) When an agency selects an IPP registrant, it employs him or her under appropriate appointments such as reinstatement,
transfer, position change, or excepted appointment.

6. Section 330.306 is revised to read as follows:



 330.306



Termination of eligibility.



Eligibility for assistance under the IPP will be terminated if one of the following occurs:

(a) A registrant's 2 year period of eligibility expires (except for preference eligibles who are eligible for up to
1 year of additional assistance as specified in  330.407);

(b) The registrant requests, in writing, that placement assistance be terminated;

(c) The registrant is placed in a nontemporary position in either the competitive or excepted service;

(d) The registrant declines an offer of continuing employment in the competitive or excepted service under conditions
(i.e., grade, salary, geographic location, or work schedule) the registrant previously indicated were acceptable,
unless OPM determines that an exception is warranted; or

(e) The agency notifies OPM that the registrant no longer meets the eligibility criteria for program registration
and placement assistance.

7. In  330.307, paragraphs (a)(1), (b) and (c) are revised to read as follows:



 330.307



Agency responsibilities.



(a) 

Agency program

. (1) Each agency has primary obligation to assist, to the maximum extent practical and in keeping with the requirements
set forth in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, in the placement of surplus and displaced employees. OPM's placement
program only supplements these efforts and is not intended to relieve an agency of its responsibility to provide the
maximum placement assistance possible.



* * * * *



(b) 

Registration of eligible employees. 

In accordance with subpart H of part 351 of this chapter, agencies must inform affected employees about the Interagency
Placement Program at the same time that Certifications of Excepted Separation or specific reduction in force notices
are distributed. Employees who receive a Certification of Expected Separation may register up to 6 months prior to
separation. Agencies are responsible for assisting employees with their registration forms, for completing the
information requested on the forms, for ensuring employees meet the minimum qualification requirements for the
position(s) registered, and for sending them to the appropriate office as instructed by OPM.

(c) 

Consideration of individuals referred.

 Agencies will give full consideration to individuals referred through OPM's Interagency Placement Program. Full
consideration is a careful and open review of the qualifications of the registrant as described in the individual's
application forms, contact to determine interest and availability, and an interview; if possible, to further assess
the registrant's ability to perform the duties of the position within a reasonable period of time. An appointing officer
may not pass over an IPP eligible to select a non-IPP eligible unless an objection to the IPP eligible is sustained by
OPM or an agency with delegated authority.


Subpart D_Positions Restricted to Preference Eligibles


8. In subpart D,  330.404 is revised to read as follows:


 330.404 

Displacement of preference eligibles occupying restricted positions in contracting out situations.


OPM and agencies have certain obligations toward preference eligibles occupying restricted positions when a decision
is made to contract out a Government-performed commercial activity in accordance with the Office of Management and
Budget (OMB) Circular A-76. (Copies of the OMB circular are available from Executive Office of the President,
Office of Management and Budget, Publications Office, 725 17th Street, NW., Room 220, New Executive Office Building,
Washington, DC 20503.) Preference eligibles are entitled to additional placement assistance through the Interagency
Placement Program. These preference eligibles must:
(a) Be occupying restricted positions as designated in 5 U.S.C. 3310 and  330.401;
(b) Be in the competitive service (in tenure I or II); and
(c) Meet the eligibility requirements of the IPP which are described in subpart C of this part.
9. In  330.405, paragraph (c) is revised to read as follows:


 330.405 

Agency placement assistance.


* * * * *


(c) Notifying preference eligibles of the right to register in the IPP at least 60 days before the effective date of
separation.


* * * * *


10. In  430.406, paragraphs (c) and (e) are revised to read as follows:


 330.406 

OPM placement assistance.


* * * * *


(c) Assuring that all agencies that have vacancies to fill through the competitive examining process give full consideration
to adversely affected preference eligibles registered in the IPP.


* * * * *


(e) Monitoring this placement assistance through IPP procedures.
11. Section 330.407 is revised to read as follows:


 330.407 

Duration of eligibility for assistance.


Adversely affected preference eligibles may remain in the IPP for 1 year after their normal IPP eligibility expires
with placement assistance renewable in 6 month increments by the registered employee. Eligibility may, however,
be terminated earlier in accordance with other IPP procedures.


 330.801 

[Amended]


12. In  330.801, paragraph (c) is amended by removing the semicolon and the word ``and'' at the end of the paragraph
and inserting a period in their place and paragraph (d) is removed.


PART 332_RECRUITMENT AND SELECTION THROUGH COMPETITIVE EXAMINATION


13. The authority citation for part 332 continues to read as follows:





Authority:

 5 U.S.C. 1302, 3301, 3302; E.O. 10577, 3 CFR, 1954-58 Comp., p. 218.


Subpart C_Period of Competition and Eligibility


14. In subpart C,  332.314 is revised to read as follows:


 332.314 

Displaced employees eligible for placement assistance.


Subject to the time limits and other conditions published by OPM, a person who is eligible for placement assistance
through the Interagency Placement Program described in subpart C of part 330 of this chapter is entitled to file applications
for competitive examinations after the closing date for receipt of applications when there is an existing register
or a register is about to be established. Applications may be filed at any grade or level above the position from which
the person is about to be or was displaced, for which such person is qualified.

16. In  351.803, paragraph (a) is revised to read as follows:



 351.803

Notice of eligibility for reemployment and other placement assistance.



(a) An employee who receives a specific notice of separation under this part must be given information concerning
the right to reemployment consideration under subparts B (Reemployment Priority List) and C (Interagency Placement
Program) of part 330 of this chapter. The employee also must be given information concerning how to apply for unemployment
insurance through his or her appropriate State program. This information must be provided either in or with the specific
reduction in force notice or as a separate supplemental notice to the employee.

15. Section 351.807 is added to read as follows:



 351.807

Certification of Expected Separation.



(a) For the purpose of enabling otherwise eligible employees to be considered for eligibility to participate in dislocated
workers programs under the Job Training Partnership Act administered by the U.S. Department of Labor, an agency may
issue a Certificate of Expected Separation to a competing employee who the agency believes, with a reasonable degree
of certainty, will be separated from Federal employment by reduction in force procedures under this part. A certification
may be issued up to 6 months prior to the effective date of the reduction in force.
(b) This certification may be issued to a competing employee only when the agency determines:

(1) There is a good likelihood the employee will be separated under this part;

(2) Employment opportunities in the same or similar position in the local commuting area are limited or nonexistent;

(3) Placement opportunities within the employee's own or other Federal agencies in the local commuting area are limited
or nonexistent; and

(4) If eligible for optional retirement, the employee has not filed a retirement application or otherwise indicated
in writing an intent to retire.

(c) A certification is to be addressed to each individual eligible employee and must be signed by an appropriate agency
official. A certification must contain the expected date of reduction in force, a statement that each factor in paragraph
(b) of this section has been satisfied, and a description of Job Training Partnership Act programs, the Interagency
Placement Program, and the Reemployment Priority List.

(d) A certification may not be used to satisfy any of the notice requirements elsewhere in this subpart.

(e) An agency determination of eligibility for certification may not be appealed to OPM or the Merit Systems Protection
Board.

(f) An agency also may enroll eligible employees in the Interagency Placement Program and the Reemployment Priority
List up to 6 months in advance of a reduction in force. For requirements and criteria for these programs, see subparts
B and C of part 330 of this chapter.

Airworthiness Directives: Piper Aircraft Corporation PA24, PA30, and PA39 Series Airplanes 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This amendment supersedes Airworthiness Directive (AD) 74-13-01, which currently requires inspecting
(one-time) the stabilator torque tube bearing support fittings for looseness on certain Piper Aircraft Corporation
(Piper) PA24, PA30, and PA39 series airplanes, and, if looseness is found, incorporating Piper Part No. 760 835 (Hi-Shear
Rivet Replacement Kit). This action retains the initial inspection of the stabilator torque tube bearing support
fittings, and makes these inspections repetitive unless the above referenced service kit is incorporated. Incidents
of looseness of the stabilator torque tube bearing support fittings on several of the affected airplanes in compliance
with the current AD prompted this action. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent loss of pitch control
because of looseness of the stabilator torque tube bearing support fittings, which could result in loss of control
of the airplane. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) to include an AD that would apply to certain
PA24, PA30, and PA39 series airplanes was published in the 

Federal Register

 on Februrary 1, 1994 (59 FR 4605). The action proposed to supsersede AD 74-13-01, Amendment 39-1870,
with a new AD that would retain the initial inspection of the stabilator torque tube bearing support fittings, and
make these inspections repetitive unless Piper Part No. 760 835 (Hi-Shear Rivet Replacement Kit) is incorporated.




Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. No comments
were received on the proposed rule or the FAA's determination of the cost to the public. 

After careful review of all available information, the FAA has determined that air safety and the public interest
require the adoption of the rule as proposed except for minor editorial corrections. The FAA has determined that these
minor corrections will not change the meaning of the AD nor add any additional burden upon the public than was already
proposed. 

The FAA estimates that 4,409 airplanes in the U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, that it will take approximately
1 workhour per airplane to accomplish the required action, and that the average labor rate is approximately $55 an
hour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $242,495. This figure
does not account for any repetitive inspections that would be required by this AD. However, incorporating Piper Part
No. 760 835 (Hi-Shear Rivet Replacement Kit) on all four stabilator torque tube bearing support fittings eliminates
the need for the repetitive inspection requirement of this AD. In addition, this kit may have been incorporated through
compliance with AD 75-27-08, Amendment 39-2624. This AD requires inspecting the rivets of the stabilator
torque tube bearing support fittings, and incorporating the referenced kit if any rivets are found misaligned. The
cost figure presented above is based on the assumption that none of the owners/operators affected by this AD have incorporated
Piper Part No. 760 835. The FAA anticipates that numerous owners/operators have incorporated this kit, thereby reducing
the cost impact of the required action.

The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.

For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive
Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February
26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small
entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the final evaluation prepared for this action

directive to read as follows: 






94-13-10 Piper Aircraft Corporation: 

Amendment 39-8951; Docket No. 93-CE-60-AD; Supersedes AD 74-13-01, Amendment
39-1870. 






Applicability: 

The following model and serial number airplanes, certificated in any category, that have not incorporated Piper
Part No. 760 835 (Hi-Shear Rivet Replacement Kit) on all four stabilator torque tube bearing support fittings: 






Note 1:

 Piper Part No. 760 835 (Hi-Shear Rivet Replacement Kit), may have been incorporated through compliance with AD 75-27-08,
Amendment 39-2624. This AD requires inspecting the rivets of the stabilator torque tube bearing support fittings,
and incorporating the referenced kit if any rivets are found misaligned. Airplanes incorporating this kit on all
four stabilator torque tube bearing support fittings are not affected by this AD. 






Compliance: 

Required within the next 100 hour time-in-service (TIS) after the effective date of this AD, unless already accomplished,
and thereafter as indicated.

To prevent loss of pitch control because of looseness of the stabilator torque tube bearing support fittings, which
could result in loss of control of the airplane, accomplish the following:

(a) Inspect the stabilator torque tube bearing support fittings for looseness by accomplishing the following:

(1) Remove the tail cone and right rear aft fuselage access door.

(2) Grasp the stabilator tip and shake the tip from left to right and up and down.

torque tube bearing support fittings. 




(b) If looseness is found during the inspection specified in paragraph (a) of this AD, prior to further flight, incorporate
Piper Part No. 760 835 (Hi-Shear Rivet Replacement Kit) on the affected fitting, and reinstall the tail cone and right
rear aft fuselage access door.

(c) If looseness is not found during the inspection specified in paragraph (a) of this AD, prior to further flight,
reinstall the tail cone and right rear aft fuselage access door, and reinspect the stabilator torque tube bearing
support fittings for looseness at intervals not to exceed 100 hours TIS until Piper Part No. 760 835 (Hi-Shear Rivet
Replacement Kit) is incorporated on all four stabilator torque tube bearing support fittings.

(d) Incorporating Piper Part No. 760 835 (Hi-Shear Rivet Replacement Kit) on all four stabilator torque tube bearing
support fittings is considered terminating action for the inspection requirement of this AD.

(e) Special flight permits may be issued in accordance with sections 21.197 and 21.199 of the Federal Aviation Regulations
(14 CFR 21.197 and 21.199) to operate the airplane to a location where the requirements of this AD can be accomplished.

(f) An alternative method of compliance or adjustment of the compliance time that provides an equivalent level of
safety may be approved by the Manager, Atlanta Aircraft Certification Office (ACO), 1669 Phoenix Parkway, Suite
210C, Atlanta, Georgia 30349. The request shall be forwarded through an appropriate FAA Maintenance Inspector,
who may add comments and then send it to the Manager, Atlanta ACO. 






Note 3:

 Information concerning the existence of approved alternative methods of compliance with this AD, if any, may be obtained
from the Atlanta ACO. 




(g) All persons affected by this directive may obtain copies of the document referred to herein upon request to the
Piper Aircraft Corporation, 2926 Piper Drive, Vero Beach, Florida 32960; or may examine this document at the FAA,
Central Region, Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel, Room 1558, 601 E. 12th Street, Kansas City, Missouri 64106.

(h) This amendment (39-8951) supersedes AD 74-13-01, Amendment 39-1870.

Airworthiness Directives; Dassault Aviation Model Mystere Falcon 900 Series Airplanes 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule; request for comments. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to all Dassault Aviation Model Mystere
Falcon 900 series airplanes. This action requires either pressure checks and charging, if necessary, of the low pressure
chamber of the nose gear shock absorber, or torque checks of the nose wheel steering to determine if the charging operation
is within specified limits; recharging of the shock absorber, if necessary; and installation of a relay in the electrical
rack. This amendment is prompted by reports of failure of the nose landing gear (NLG) to extend fully. The actions specified
in this AD are intended to prevent malfunction of the NLG during extension due to recompression of the nose gear shock
absorber.


 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Direction G&eacute;n&eacute;rale de l'Aviation Civile (DGAC), which is the airworthiness authority for France,
recently notified the FAA that an unsafe condition may exist on all Dassault Aviation Model Mystere Falcon 900 series
airplanes. The DGAC advises that it has received reports of recompression of the nose landing gear (NLG) shock absorber
due to the relative wind upon retraction. This condition, if not corrected, could result in failure of the NLG to extend
fully using the normal hydraulic mode, the emergency hydraulic mode, or the emergency mechanical mode. 


Dassault Aviation issued Service Bulletin F900-A149 (F900-A32-11), dated April 13, 1994, which
describes procedures for pressure checks of the low pressure chamber of the nose gear shock absorber or a torque check
of the nose wheel steering to determine if the charging operation is within specified limits; and recharging of the
shock absorber, if necessary. Dassault Aviation also issued Service Bulletin F900-150 (F900-32-12),
dated May 9, 1994, which describes procedures to install a relay in the right side of the electrical rack. The purpose
of this relay is to interrupt the NLG retraction cycle if the NLG shock absorber is not fully expanded. This will prevent
a lock-up of the NLG and a subsequent inability to deploy the NLG when necessary. The DGAC classified these service
bulletins as mandatory and issued French Airworthiness Directive 94-098-014(B)R1, dated May 11, 1994,
in order to assure the continued airworthiness of these airplanes in France. 
This airplane model is manufactured in France and is type certificated for operation in the United States under the
provisions of  21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.29) and the applicable bilateral airworthiness
agreement. Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, the DGAC has kept the FAA informed of the situation
described above. The FAA has examined the findings of the DGAC, reviewed all available information, and determined
that AD action is necessary for products of this type design that are certificated for operation in the United States.

Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes of the same type
design registered in the United States, this AD is being issued to prevent failure of the NLG to extend (deploy) using
the normal hydraulic mode, the emergency hydraulic mode, or the emergency mechanical mode. This AD requires either
repetitive pressure checks and charging, if necessary, of the low pressure chamber of the nose gear shock absorber,
or torque checks of the nose wheel steering to determine if the charging operation is within specified limits; and
recharging of the shock absorber, if necessary. This AD also requires installation of a relay in the right side of the
electrical rack. Installation of the relay terminates the repetitive pressure and torque checks. These actions
are required to be accomplished in accordance with the service bulletins described previously. 
Since a situation exists that requires the immediate adoption of this regulation, it is found that notice and opportunity
for prior public comment hereon are impracticable, and that good cause exists for making this amendment effective
in less than 30 days.

Comments Invited 


Although this action is in the form of a final rule that involves requirements affecting flight safety and, thus, was
not preceded by notice and an opportunity for public comment, comments are invited on this rule. Interested persons
are invited to comment on this rule by submitting such written data, views, or arguments as they may desire. Communications
shall identify the Rules Docket number and be submitted in triplicate to the address specified under the caption 

ADDRESSES

. All communications received on or before the closing date for comments will be considered, and this rule may be amended
in light of the comments received. Factual information that supports the commenter's ideas and suggestions is extremely
helpful in evaluating the effectiveness of the AD action and determining whether additional rulemaking action would
be needed. 
Comments are specifically invited on the overall regulatory, economic, environmental, and energy aspects of the
rule that might suggest a need to modify the rule. All comments submitted will be available, both before and after the
closing date for comments, in the Rules Docket for examination by interested persons. A report that summarizes each
FAA-public contact concerned with the substance of this AD will be filed in the Rules Docket. 
Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments submitted in response to this rule must submit
a self-addressed, stamped postcard on which the following statement is made: ``Comments to Docket Number 94-NM-82-AD.''
The postcard will be date stamped and returned to the commenter. 
The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
The FAA has determined that this regulation is an emergency regulation that must be issued immediately to correct
an unsafe condition in aircraft, and is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866. It has
been determined further that this action involves an emergency regulation under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures
(44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979). If it is determined that this emergency regulation otherwise would be significant
under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures, a final regulatory evaluation will be prepared and placed in the Rules
Docket. A copy of it, if filed, may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption

Airworthiness Directives: Piper Aircraft Corporation 
Models PA34-200, PA34-200T, PA34-220T, PA44-180, and 
PA44-180T Airplanes 






AGENCY:

 Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. 



<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness 
directive (AD) that applies to certain Piper Aircraft 
Corporation (Piper) Models PA34-200, PA34-200T, PA34-220T, PA44-180, and PA44-180T
airplanes. This action requires repetitively 
inspecting the main landing gear trunnions for cracks, 
replacing any trunnions found cracked, and eventually 
replacing these trunnions with improved parts as 
terminating action for the repetitive inspection 
requirement. Several reports of the main landing gear 
trunnions cracking on the affected airplanes prompted 
this action. The actions specified by this AD are 
intended to prevent collapse of the main landing gear 
caused by cracked trunnions, which could result in 
airplane damage.

 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 A proposal to amend part 39 
of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) to 
include an AD that would apply to certain Piper Models 
PA34-200, PA34-200T, PA34-220T, PA44-180, and PA44-180T 
airplanes was published in the 

Federal Register

 on 
January 12, 1994 (59 FR 1676). The action proposed to 
require repetitively inspecting the MLG trunnions for 
cracks, replacing any trunnions found cracked, and 
eventually replacing these trunnions with improved 
parts as terminating action for the repetitive 
inspection requirement. The proposed inspections would 
be accomplished in accordance with Piper Service 
Bulletin (SB) No. 787B, dated August 25, 1993. The 
proposed replacement would be accomplished in 
accordance with the applicable maintenance manual. 



Interested persons have been afforded an 
opportunity to participate in the making of this 
amendment. Due consideration has been given to the 
four comments received. 

One commenter states that, with the way the 
compliance of paragraph (b) of the proposal is 
currently written, airplanes with trunnions that have 
over 2,000 hours time-in-service (TIS) are grounded. 
The commenter requests that the FAA give airplane 
operators in this scenario a grace period. The FAA 
concurs and has changed the compliance portion of 
paragraph (b) of the AD to: ``Upon the accumulation of 
2,000 hours TIS on a MLG trunnion or within the next 
100 hours TIS, whichever occurs later, * * *''. This 
change would give 100 hours TIS for compliance to those 
operators with 1,901 hours TIS or more accumulated on a 
trunnion as of the effective date of the AD. 

This same commenter also states that, in paragraph 
(b)(1) of the proposal, an affected airplane could be 
grounded if parts were not available after 2,500 hours 
TIS (2,000 hours TIS replacement compliance and 500 
hours TIS for parts unavailability grace period). This 
commenter recommends that, if parts are unavailable, 
the FAA allow the owner/operator to inspect the 
airplane every 100 hours TIS until parts are available 
and not just for the next 500 hours TIS. The FAA 
concurs that airplanes would be grounded at 2,500 hours 
TIS if parts were not available. However, the Piper 
Aircraft Corporation has assured the FAA that an 
adequate surplus of parts currently exist for all 
operators to comply with this action. The AD is 
unchanged as a result of this comment. 

One commenter recommends that, instead of 
mandatory replacement, the FAA mandate the 100-hour TIS 
repetitive inspections with mandatory replacement of 
trunnions found cracked. The FAA does not concur. The 
FAA analyzed information related to MLG trunnion 
failures from service difficulty reports and 
manufacturer's warranty claims; and, from this 
information, the FAA established the mandatory 
replacement in order to maintain these airplanes at 
their original type certification level of safety. The 
AD is unchanged as a result of this comment. 

Another commenter feels that an eddy current 
inspection of the MLG trunnions is more reliable than 
the dye penetrant inspections. This commenter states 
that, based upon similar MLG trunnion failures in the 
United Kingdom, the dye penetrant inspection method may 
not detect a critical crack. The FAA does not concur. 
Past experience based on FAA reports indicates that dye 
penetrant inspections are very successful in detecting 
cracks in the MLG trunnions, and the equipment needed 
is more readily available and less costly than that for 
eddy current inspections. The FAA will consider any 
requests to accomplish an eddy current inspections as 
an alternative method of compliance to paragraph (a) of 
the AD under provisions specified in paragraph (d) of 
the AD. The AD is unchanged as a result of this 
comment. 

This same commenter addresses lateral grinding 
marks found on a significant number of MLG trunnions in 
the area of the past crack initiation. This commenter 
recommends blending these marks out to remove any 
traces of scoring. The FAA concurs, and has added 
provisions for this requirement to the AD.

A commenter recommends that this AD action also cover inspections in two other locations in the MLG, the swivel pin
and trunnion attach fittings. The FAA issued an advanced notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPRM) on February 11, 1994,
to seek comments regarding the best action (if any) to take in order to correct any possible problems with retractable
MLG swivel pins. The FAA is currently reviewing comments from this ANPRM and has not determined that there is an unsafe
condition that requires AD action under part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39). The MLG trunnion
attach fittings are the subject of Piper SB No. 956, dated March 3, 1992. The FAA has evaluated all information related
to this issue and has determined that AD action is not justified at this point. The FAA will continue to evaluate any
additional information, and, if necessary, will implement future rulemaking. The AD is unchanged as a result of this
comment. 

The manufacturer has informed the FAA that certain Piper Model PA34-220T airplanes (serial numbers 34-8133001
through 34-8233088) may be equipped with trunnion housing assemblies, Piper part number 39486-802 (left)
and 39486-803 (right) with embossed forging number 67924-2. The FAA has determined that this AD should
not apply to airplanes with these trunnion housing assemblies installed. The FAA has revised the Applicability section
of the final rule to reflect this change. 

No comments were received on the FAA's determination of the cost impact of this proposed action upon U.S. operators
of the affected airplanes. 

After careful review of all available information, the FAA has determined that air safety and the public interest
require the adoption of the rule as proposed except for the compliance time change in paragraph (b) of the proposal,
the Applicability section change, the addition of the provision to blend any lateral grinding marks, and minor editorial
corrections. The FAA has determined that these changes, the addition, and any editorial corrections will not change
the meaning of the AD nor add any additional burden upon the public than was already proposed. 

The FAA estimates that 2,265 airplanes in the U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, that it will take approximately
16 workhours per airplane to accomplish the required action, and that the average labor rate is approximately $55
an hour. Parts cost approximately $1,100 per airplane. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the AD on U.S.
operators is estimated to be $4,484,700. This figure is based on the assumption that no affected airplane owner/operator
has accomplished the required action. The FAA believes that some airplane owners have already accomplished the required
actions. With this in mind, the FAA anticipates that the cost of this AD will be much lower than the figure referenced
above. 

The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 

For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive
Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February
26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small
entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the final evaluation prepared for this action
is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting the Rules Docket at the location provided

Airworthiness Directives; Boeing Model 747 Series Airplanes



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Federal Aviation Administration, DOT.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to certain Boeing Model 747 series airplanes,
that requires inspections to detect cracking in certain fuselage upper deck tension ties, and repair or modification
of any cracked tension ties. This amendment is prompted by reports of fatigue cracking in tension ties. The actions
specified by this AD are intended to prevent failure of two or more tension ties and the resultant rapid decompression
of the airplane.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) to include an airworthiness directive
(AD) that is applicable to certain Boeing Model 747 series airplanes was published in the 

Federal Register

 on January 24, 1994 (59 FR 3527). That action proposed to require inspections to detect cracking in certain fuselage
upper deck tension ties, and repair or modification of any cracked tension ties.



Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration
has been given to the comments received.

Two commenters support the proposed rule.

Several commenters request that the proposed 1,000-flight cycle compliance time for low-time airplanes be revised
to require that the inspection be performed ``upon the accumulation of 20,000 total flight cycles or within 1,000
flight cycles after the effective date of this AD, whichever comes later.'' The FAA does not concur. Since cracking
has been found on airplanes that had accumulated less than 20,000 flight cycles, the FAA reasoned that requiring inspection
of all airplanes within 1,000 flight cycles, regardless of the total number of flight cycles, would be prudent to preclude
the propagation of cracks in airplanes in the Model 747 fleet.

Two commenters request that the proposed rule be revised to include a provision specifying that pressurization cycles
of 2.0 psi or less need not be counted as a flight cycle when determining the number of flight cycles relative to the proposed
compliance thresholds. The FAA does not concur. The FAA finds that operating at cabin pressure differentials of 2.0
psi or less is applicable to only one operator. The FAA does not consider it appropriate to include various provisions
in an AD applicable to a single operator's unique use of an affected airplane. Further, this commenter does not compile
data for each of its airplanes so that an individual airplane's pressurization cycles could be determined; instead,
it uses a fleet average to calculate the equivalent number of pressurization cycles. The FAA does not consider it appropriate
to use approximations for determining compliance with this AD. Furthermore, since there are numerous factors that
affect the calculation of flight cycles, such as total number of low pressure cycles, amount of thrust, number of gross
weight flight cycles, etc., the FAA has determined that these mitigating factors could be best evaluated through
requests for alternative methods of compliance, as provided for in paragraph (c) of the final rule.

One commenter requests that the FAA and Boeing review the requirement for inspections contained in AD 93-06-01,
amendment 39-8526 (58 FR 19571, April 15, 1993), which requires that the FAA-approved maintenance inspection
program include inspections that will give no less than the required damage tolerance rating (DTR) for each Structural
Significant Item (SSI). This commenter states that the proposed inspection of the tension ties may be included in
the requirement for inspections contained in AD 93-06-01. The FAA concurs and has reviewed the requirement
for inspections contained in AD 93-06-01. This AD was prompted by reports of fatigue cracks that were detected
while performing inspections specified by the Supplemental Structural Inspection Document (SSID) program, which
was required to be implemented by AD 93-06-01. The purpose of that AD is to implement an inspection program
of a sample number of airplanes, which will detect the potential for cracking in specific areas of the airplane that
are critical for safety of flight. Whenever cracks are found in an SSI during an inspection in accordance with the SSID
program, the FAA takes rulemaking action to correct these findings of an unsafe condition within the applicable fleet.
This AD is issued in response to such a finding. Therefore, the FAA will, in a separate rulemaking action, revise AD
93-06-01 to remove the requirement to inspect the tension ties.

After careful review of the available data, including the comments noted above, the FAA has determined that air safety
and the public interest require the adoption of the rule as proposed.

There are approximately 203 Model 747 series airplanes of the affected design in the worldwide fleet. The FAA estimates
that 113 airplanes of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, that it will take approximately 5 work hours per airplane
to accomplish the required actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Based on these figures, the
total cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $31,075, or $275 per airplane.

The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the
requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not
adopted.

The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.

For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive
Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February
26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small
entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been prepared for this action
and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under

Airworthiness Directives; Fokker Model F28 Mark 0100 Series Airplanes 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Federal Aviation Administration, DOT.

 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule; request for comments.

 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to certain Fokker Model F28 Mark 0100 series
airplanes. This action requires modification of the electrical connections in a certain relay panel. This amendment
is prompted by a report that, as a result of a previous modification, certain electrical wires with a positive voltage
were connected to an electrical connector that is also wired to the liftdumper system, which could negatively affect
the liftdumper system. The actions specified in this AD are intended to ensure protection against uncommanded deployment
of the liftdumper.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Rijksluchtvaartdienst (RLD), which is the airworthiness authority for the Netherlands, recently notified
the FAA that an unsafe condition may exist on certain Fokker Model F28 Mark 0100 series airplanes. The RLD advises that
certain Model F28 Mark 0100 series airplanes were modified to increase air conditioning airflow at higher altitudes
by augmenting the airflow through the turbine bypass valves. These airplanes were modified in accordance with Fokker
Service Bulletin SBF100-21-026. On some airplanes, this modification resulted in the installation
of electrical wires with a positive voltage into an electrical connector that is also wired for the liftdumper system.
Incorporation of this modification on these airplanes could negatively affect the liftdumper system, since only
electrical wires that are directly connected to a ground should be installed in this connector. This condition, if
not corrected, could result in reduced protection against uncommanded deployment of the liftdumper. 


Fokker has issued Service Bulletin SBF100-21-045, Revision 1, dated November 17, 1993, that describes
procedures for modification of the electrical connections in a certain relay panel. This modification entails disconnecting
certain electrical wires from the connector in the number 2 relay panel and connecting these wires to a different connector.
Accomplishment of this modification must be performed after or 
in conjunction with Fokker Service Bulletin SBF100-21-026, in order to ensure that only electrical wires
that are directly connected to ground are installed to the electrical connector that is also wired for the liftdumper
system. 
The RLD classified Fokker Service Bulletin SBF100-21-045, as mandatory and issued Netherlands Airworthiness
Directive BLA 92-079/2 (A), dated December 24, 1993, in order to assure the continued airworthiness of these
airplanes in the Netherlands. 
Fokker has also issued Service Bulletin SBF100-21-056, Revision 1, dated November 24, 1993, which supersedes
Fokker Service Bulletins SBF100-21-026 and SBF100-21-045. Fokker Service Bulletin SBF100-21-056
describes procedures for augmentation of the flow through the turbine bypass valves of the air conditioning system
to increase the air conditioning airflow at higher altitudes. The RLD classified this service bulletin as optional;
however, the service bulletin incorporates the provisions of Fokker Service Bulletin SBF100-21-045,
including the instructions necessary to correct the wiring. 
This airplane model is manufactured in the Netherlands and is type certificated for operation in the United States
under the provisions of Section 21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations and the applicable bilateral airworthiness
agreement. Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, the RLD has kept the FAA informed of the situation
described above. The FAA has examined the findings of the RLD, reviewed all available information, and determined
that AD action is necessary for products of this type design that are certificated for operation in the United States.

Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes of the same type
design registered in the United States, this AD is being issued to prevent reduced protection against uncommanded
deployment of the liftdumper. This AD requires modification of the electrical connections in a certain relay panel.
The actions are required to be accomplished in accordance with either of the service bulletins described previously.

There currently are no Fokker Model F28 Mark 0100 series airplanes affected by this AD on the U.S. Register. All airplanes
included in the applicability of this rule currently are operated by non-U.S. operators under foreign registry;
therefore, they are not directly affected by this AD action. However, the FAA considers that this rule is necessary
to ensure that the unsafe condition is addressed in the event that any of these subject airplanes are imported and placed
on the U.S. Register in the future. 
Should an affected airplane be imported and placed on the U.S. Register in the future, it would require approximately
7 work hours to accomplish the required actions, at an average labor charge of $55 per work hour. Required parts would
cost approximately $80 per airplane. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of this AD would be $465 per airplane.

Since this AD action does not affect any airplane that is currently on the U.S. register, it has no adverse economic
impact and imposes no additional burden on any person. Therefore, notice and public procedures hereon are unnecessary
and the amendment may be made effective in less than 30 days after publication in the 

Federal Register

. 


Comments Invited 


Although this action is in the form of a final rule and was not preceded by notice and opportunity for public comment,
comments are invited on this rule. Interested persons are invited to comment on this rule by submitting such written
data, views, or arguments as they may desire. Communications shall identify the Rules Docket number and be submitted
in triplicate to the address specified under the caption 

ADDRESSES

. All communications received on or before the closing date for comments will be considered, and this rule may be amended
in light of the comments received. Factual information that supports the commenter's ideas and suggestions is extremely
helpful in evaluating the effectiveness of the AD action and determining whether additional rulemaking action would
be needed. 
Comments are specifically invited on the overall regulatory, economic, environmental, and energy aspects of the
rule that might suggest a need to modify the rule. All comments submitted will be available, both before and after the
closing date for comments, in the Rules Docket for examination by interested persons. A report that summarizes each
FAA-public contact concerned with the substance of this AD will be filed in the Rules Docket. 
Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments submitted in response to this notice must submit
a self-addressed, stamped postcard on which the following statement is made: ``Comments to Docket Number 94-NM-47-AD.''
The postcard will be date stamped and returned to the commenter. 
The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive
Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February
26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small
entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been prepared for this action
and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under

Airworthiness Directives: Sikorsky Aircraft Model S-58T Series Helicopters 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This amendment supersedes an existing airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to Sikorsky Aircraft Model S-58T
series helicopters, that currently requires a one-time inspection of the engine drive shaft assembly (drive shaft
assembly) for cracks and loose balance weights. This amendment requires initial and repetitive visual and florescent
penetrant inspections of the drive shaft assembly for cracks and improperly installed rivets. This amendment is
prompted by three reported incidents of loose or missing drive shaft assembly balance weights and two reported incidents
of fatigue cracks on the drive shaft assembly near the balance weight rivet hole. The actions specified by this AD are
intended to prevent failure of the drive shaft assembly, loss of power to the rotor system, and a subsequent forced
landing of the helicopter. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) by superseding AD 90-10-02,
Amendment 39-6590 (55 FR 18305, May 2, 1990), which is applicable to Sikorsky Aircraft Model S-58T series
helicopters, was published in the 

Federal Register

 on August 31, 1993 (58 FR 45859). That action proposed to require initial and repetitive visual and florescent penetrant
inspections of the engine drive shaft assembly for cracks and loose balance weights, and replacement as necessary.



Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. No comments
were received on the proposal or the FAA's determination of the cost to the public. The FAA has determined that air safety
and the public interest require the adoption of the rule as proposed, except for editorial changes. 
The FAA estimates that 58 helicopters of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, that it will take approximately
18 work hours per helicopter to accomplish the required actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour.
Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $57,420. 
The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive
Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February
26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small
entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been prepared for this action

with the effective date of revised regulations.

I. Introduction 



In the Matter of: Before Commissioners: Elizabeth Anne Moler, Chair; Vicky A. Bailey, William L. Massey, and Donald
F. Santa, Jr.




In a companion order in Docket No. RM94-6-000, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (Commission)
is issuing a final rule revising its standards of conduct and reporting requirements for transportation and affiliate
transactions. The final rule continues some of the existing reporting requirements under Order No. 497.
 To prevent a regulatory gap between the termination of the existing reporting requirements and the effective date
of new reporting requirements, the Commission is extending the sunset date for the existing reporting requirements
from June 30, 1994 until July 31, 1994. 





II. Reporting Requirements 



This order does not change the reporting burden under the current Order No. 497 regulations. The order merely extends
these requirements until the effective date of the Commission's new regulations to prevent a regulatory gap. 



III. Discussion 



In Order No. 497-E, the Commission extended the sunset date for the reporting requirements under  250.16
of the Commission regulations until June 30, 1994. On December 23, 1993, the Commission issued a Notice of Proposed
Rulemaking in Docket No. RM94-6-000 which proposed to revise these reporting requirements significantly.
 





Contemporaneously with this order, the Commission is issuing a final rule in Docket No. RM94-6-000 which
significantly revises the marketing affiliate reporting requirements. The final rule continues some of the reporting
requirements from the previous regulations, in particular the requirement that pipelines maintain transportation
discount information for both affiliates and non-affiliates.

Section 553(d) of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA)

3

 generally requires that a rule is to be effective not less than 30 days after publication in the 

Federal Register

 unless good cause is shown to shorten the time period. Because the final rule continues some of the reporting requirements
from the existing rule, a gap between the termination of the old requirements and the implementation of the new could
result in a loss of information.

4

 Rather than preventing this regulatory gap by requiring pipelines to undertake expedited implementation of the
final rule in Docket No. RM94-6-000, the Commission finds it preferable to extend the current reporting
requirements for only one month, until July 31, 1994, which will correlate with the August 1, 1994 effective date of
the new regulations. 





IV. Environmental Analysis 


The Commission is required to prepare an Environmental Assessment or an Environmental Impact Statement for any action
that may have a significant adverse effect on the human environment.

5

 The Commission has categorically excluded certain actions from these requirements as not having a significant effect
on the human environment.

6

 The action taken here falls within the categorical exclusions provided in the Commission's regulations.

7

 Therefore, an environmental assessment is unnecessary and has not been prepared in this rulemaking. 






V. Regulatory Flexibility Act Certification 



The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (RFA)

8

 generally requires a description and analysis of final rules that will have significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities. The regulations extend the reporting requirements on interstate natural gas pipelines.
Since these pipelines are not small entities, the regulations will not have significant economic impact on small
entities. Thus, pursuant to section 605(b) of the RFA, the Commission hereby certifies that the regulations proposed
herein will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities.

VI. Information Collection Requirement 


Office of Management and Budget (OMB) regulations require approval of certain information collection requirements
imposed by agency rules.

9

 This final rule neither contains new information collection requirements nor makes any changes to existing information
collection requirements. Therefore, it is not subject to OMB approval. 




VII. Effective Date 


Section 553(d) of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA)

10

 generally requires that a rule is to be effective not less than 30 days after publication in the 

Federal Register

 unless good cause is found to shorten the time period. The sunset date for the current reporting requirements will
expire on June 30, 1994 before the APA's 30 day publication requirement is fulfilled, which would result in a gap in
the reporting requirements. To prevent such a gap,   250.16 (a)(3), (c)(1), and (d)(1) will be revised,
effective June 30, 1994, to continue the current reporting requirements until July 31, 1994.

I. Introduction 



In the matter of: Before Commissioners: Elizabeth Anne Moler, Chair; 
Vicky A. Bailey, James J. Hoecker, 
William L. Massey, and Donald F. Santa, Jr. 





The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (Commission) is amending its regulations governing Standards of Conduct
and reporting requirements for transportation and affiliate transactions. The Commission is significantly reducing
its reporting requirements based on changes in the way pipelines will be allocating capacity after implementation
of Order No. 636

1

 and the Commission's experience with the reporting requirements. 




II. Reporting Requirements 


The Commission estimates the public reporting burden for this collection of information under the final rule to average
60 hours per respondent, including the time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering
and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information. In lieu of being physically
filed with the Commission on a periodic basis as a ``response'' or ``filing'', the data will be posted on pipeline Electronic
Bulletin Boards (EBBs), established and maintained by the pipeline respondents pursuant to Order No. 636, and collected
under FERC-592, Marketing Affiliates of Interstate Pipelines to be provided to the Commission upon request.
The annual reporting burden for some 61 respondents under the rule is estimated to total approximately 3,500 hours.

Because the rule provides for fewer information items, eliminates regular, periodic filings, and requires certain
information to be posted or made available upon request in text format, the burden estimate for FERC-592 in the
Final Rule represents a burden reduction of about 70 hours per respondent_or a total reduction of about 4,300 hours.
The current annual reporting burden attributable to the FERC-592 information collection is 7,881.2 hours.
A copy of this final rule is being provided to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). 
Interested persons may send comments regarding the burden estimates or any other aspect of this collection of information,
including suggestions for further reductions of this burden, to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 941 North
Capitol Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20426 [Attention: Michael Miller, Information Services Division, (202)
208-1415, FAX (202) 208-2425]. Comments on the requirements of this rule may also be sent to the Office
of Information and Regulatory Affairs of OMB, Washington, D.C. 20503 [Attention: Desk Officer for Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission (202) 395-6880]. 


III. Background 


The Commission, in Order No. 497,

2

 issued a rule intended to prevent pipelines from providing preferential treatment to their marketing or brokering
affiliates. The rule adopted Standards of Conduct (codified at Part 161 of the Commission's regulations)

3

 and tariff and reporting requirements (codified in  250.16)

4

 The Standards of Conduct establish the principles applicable to relationships between pipelines and their affiliates.
In general, they provide that the pipeline cannot favor affiliates with information or transportation discounts
not available to non-affiliates. The tariff provisions require pipelines to include in their tariffs a list of operating
personnel shared with affiliates, the information and format for transportation service requests, the procedures
used to resolve complaints, the procedures used to inform shippers about the availability and pricing of transportation
services.

<DOCNO> FR940627-0-00027 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940627-0-00009 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The reporting requirements require pipelines to provide information relating to transportation transactions
with affiliates. The pipelines must file FERC Form No. 592, a log containing information relating to requests for
transportation service by affiliated marketers and to discounts provided to affiliates. The regulations also require
the pipelines to maintain the same information for non-affiliated shippers and to provide that information to the
Commission upon request. 
The Commission imposed a sunset provision requiring a reevaluation of the requirements of the rule within one year
to determine whether increased competition in transportation had mitigated the concerns about affiliate abuse.
The Commission has extended the sunset provision on several occasions, most recently extending it until June 30,
1994.

5

 




In Order No. 636, the Commission created a new operating environment for interstate pipelines and shippers by requiring
pipelines to unbundle their sale of gas from their transportation service and by implementing changes in the terms
and conditions for providing transportation service. One of the principal changes introduced by Order No. 636 was
the initiation of capacity release mechanisms through which firm shippers can release their firm transportation
capacity, including storage capacity, to others wanting to obtain the capacity. The Commission also required that
pipelines establish EBBs to provide information about available firm and interruptible capacity on the pipeline,
including the firm capacity available through capacity release.

6

 




The Commission previously has addressed the effect of EBBs and capacity release on the Order No. 497 requirements.
In Order No. 497-D, the Commission eliminated the requirement that pipelines file the Form No. 592 containing
the affiliated transportation log with the Commission, requiring instead that they provide this information on
their EBBs.

7

 The Commission also determined that Order No. 497 does not apply to temporary capacity releases, because such releases
are not a request for transportation to the pipeline.

8

 The releasing shipper, not the pipeline, controls and makes the determination to release capacity; the pipeline
merely facilitates the transaction. 





With the implementation of Order No. 636 on virtually all pipelines, the Commission reevaluated its Order No. 497
requirements in light of the requirements of Order No. 636 as well as the Commission's experience under Order No. 497.
On December 23, 1993, the Commission issued the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NOPR)

9

 in this docket in which the Commission proposed significant reductions in the Order No. 497 reporting requirements
as well as the elimination of one of the Standards of Conduct. The Commission, however, also invited comment on the
need for, and retention of, the requirements as a whole. The Commission has received 22 comments on the NOPR.

10

 





IV. Summary of the Final Rule 


The final rule revises both the Standards of Conduct and the reporting requirements in a number of respects. The Commission
is reducing the pipelines' reporting burden by eliminating maintenance and posting requirements relating to requests
for transportation service and implementing in their stead limited requirements that better comport with pipeline
operations under Order No. 636.

<PARENT> FR940627-0-00009 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

In particular, the regulations are being revised to reflect the data used by pipelines to allocate capacity among
shippers when available capacity is not sufficient for the pipelines to honor all requests for service. For those
pipelines whose tariffs rely upon contract information to allocate capacity, the pipelines will be required to maintain
a log (for both affiliates and non-affiliates) of contract dates or other relevant information that they use to allocate
capacity. Pipelines that allocate capacity on a 

pro rata

 basis (or use a method that does not rely on contract data) will not have to maintain the log. The affiliate log must be
posted on the pipelines' EBBs, while the full log (for both affiliates and non-affiliates) must be provided to the
Commission, within a reasonable time, upon request according to the specifications and format contained in Form
No. 592.
 




The Commission also is coordinating its posting requirements for affiliate discounts to eliminate duplicative
EBB postings. Current  250.16 requires the pipelines to post information about affiliate discounts on their
EBBs. Current Standard of Conduct I requires pipelines to make any discount offered to an affiliate contemporaneously
available to non-affiliates. In order for the pipelines to fulfill this obligation, the Commission has required
that they make a contemporaneous posting on their EBBs of information about affiliate discounts, so that non-affiliates
will be aware of the discount and can request a comparable discount if they believe they are similarly situated.
 To eliminate the posting of duplicative information, the Commission is incorporating a contemporaneous posting
requirement for affiliate offers into former Standard I (new Standard H)
 and is deleting the similar requirement for posting affiliate discounts under  250.16. In effect, the Commission
is not adding a new reporting requirement here. It is merely moving a current EBB posting requirement from  250.16
to new Standard H in order to eliminate duplicative postings. 






Section 250.16 also required pipelines to maintain discount information for both affiliate and non-affiliate transactions
and provide this information to the Commission upon request. The Commission is retaining this maintenance requirement,
because information on affiliate and non-affiliate transactions is needed for the Commission to monitor affiliate
transactions and compare these transactions with non-affiliate transactions.

The current reporting requirements expire on June 30, 1994. Section 553(d) of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA)
 generally requires that a rule is to be effective not less than 30 days after publication in the 

Federal Register

 unless good cause is shown to shorten the time period. Because the final rule continues some of the reporting requirements
from the existing rule, a gap between the termination of the old requirements and the implementation of the new could
result in a loss of information. Rather than requiring the pipelines to expedite implementation of the new regulations
to prevent a regulatory gap, the Commission in a contemporaneous order, in Docket No. RM87-5-016, is extending
the current reporting requirements for only one month, until July 31, 1994. The regulations adopted by this order
will then go into effect on August 1, 1994. 




The Commission will first provide an overview of the Order No. 497 requirements and address the general comments relating
to retention of these provisions as a whole and will then address specific comments and issues regarding the Standards
of Conduct, tariff requirements, and reporting requirements. 



V. Overview of the Standards of Conduct and Reporting Requirements 


In the NOPR, the Commission stated that, as part of its continuing assessment of the Order No. 497 regulations, it would
consider comments on the need to retain these requirements as a whole. Many pipeline commenters submit that all the
Order No. 497 requirements should be removed as unnecessary and duplicative of existing prohibitions on undue discrimination.
 They maintain that six years after promulgation of the regulations, no pattern of abuse has been demonstrated. 




They further contend that the potential for pipelines to provide preferential treatment to their affiliates has
been virtually eliminated by the restructuring of pipeline operations pursuant to Order No. 636. They maintain that
the unbundling of pipeline gas sales from transportation service has resulted in a truly competitive market in which
all gas sellers will be able to compete on an even basis. They argue that the Commission's establishment of a mechanism
permitting firm shippers to release capacity has eliminated the pipelines' monopoly over transportation service,
so that the pipelines' ability to grant significant preferences to affiliates is reduced or eliminated. The capacity
release mechanism, they maintain, creates an open auction for firm capacity in which the pipeline must award capacity
to the highest bidder and so cannot favor its affiliate.
 They also assert that the ability of pipelines to favor affiliates with important transportation information has
been undercut by the Commission's requirement that the most critical transportation information be disclosed publicly
on pipeline EBBs. Moreover, if some potential for abuse remains, they contend the Commission's complaint process
and enforcement staff provides adequate means to detect and prevent such abuse. 




These commenters also contend that the limited need, if any, for the regulations, must be juxtaposed with the anticompetitive
effects of the regulations. They assert the regulations run counter to the Commission's goal of fostering competition
because they have the effect of inhibiting beneficial communication between pipelines and affiliates, thereby
limiting the ability of affiliates to compete in the marketplace.
 
If the Commission decides to retain some or all of these requirements, these commenters recommend that the Commission
provide a sunset date (generally one year) on which the regulations will expire. They assert that a sunset provision
will ensure a comprehensive reevaluation of the requirements after further experience with capacity release. 
On the other side, Hadson and Indicated Parties support the continuation of the requirements, with some additions.
Hadson asserts that the new deregulated gas environment will increase competitive pressures on all players, thereby
increasing the incentive and likelihood that pipelines will try to enhance the competitive position of their affiliates
and sales marketing divisions.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940627-0-00030 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940627-0-00009 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Indicated Parties argue that the Commission should add a new provision prohibiting pipelines from providing a discount
to an affiliate which is a supply area interruptible shipper.
 They assert that affiliates can use a pipeline's standing offer of a transportation discount to undercut a transaction
negotiated by a non-affiliated competitor and that even contemporaneous disclosure of the discount does not provide
the non-affiliate with sufficient time to save its transaction. 




At this time, the Commission is not convinced that pipelines' incentives or ability to favor affiliates has been so
significantly reduced by Order No. 636 that these provisions can be removed entirely.
 While the unbundling of pipeline gas sales from transportation service does create a more competitive gas market,
pipelines may still have an incentive to skew transportation transactions and information in such a way as to benefit
affiliates. The requirement to post information on EBBs has not eliminated the pipelines' ability to favor their
affiliates with information. By virtue of their position, pipelines may still be privy to important information
regarding transportation capacity that they are not required to post on their EBBs.
 More important, at this stage, the Commission does not have sufficient experience with the new capacity release mechanism
established by Order No. 636 to evaluate whether this mechanism will create such a competitive market for transportation
capacity that pipeline preferences for affiliates will no longer be of significance. 





Nonetheless, the purposes of Order No. 497 can be achieved in a manner that is substantially less burdensome to pipelines.
The Standards of Conduct and reporting requirements that remain establish a reasonable balance between preservation
of the affiliates' ability to compete and the prevention of undue favoritism to the affiliates. 
As discussed later, the Commission is retaining all the Standards of Conduct (with the exception of Standard H). These
Standards generally require pipelines to: refrain from disclosing non-affiliate information to affiliates; contemporaneously
disclose to the market any general transportation information provided to affiliates; make any discount offered
to an affiliate contemporaneously available to similarly situated non-affiliates by posting the information on
the pipelines' EBB; and maintain separation of pipeline and affiliate operating personnel to the maximum extent
practicable. These Standards of Conduct do not prevent pipelines from transacting business with their affiliates
or communicating with or providing discounts to affiliates; they require only that the pipelines initiate common
sense procedures to ensure that affiliates are not provided with information or discounts not available to others.

Only two reporting requirements remain: the current requirement to maintain discount information for affiliates
and non-affiliates and a revised requirement that some pipelines maintain and disclose the data used to allocate
service on their systems. These requirements are much reduced from those under the current regulations and are the
minimum needed to provide sufficient information about affiliate transactions for the Commission and shippers
to monitor and police these transactions. 
The Commission will not prohibit supply area discounts to affiliates, as Indicated Parties suggest. Preventing
all supply area discounts would seriously impede the ability of affiliates to compete by denying them justifiable
discounts available to non-affiliates. New Standard H requires pipelines to make any such discounts contemporaneously
available to other similarly situated shippers and this provision strikes the appropriate balance between protection
of non-affiliates and maintenance of competition between affiliates and non-affiliates. 
The Commission is not proposing a sunset provision for these regulations, because a firm date, such as one year, may
not provide a sufficient period for a comprehensive evaluation of the impact of Order No. 636 on the affiliate regulations.
The Commission, however, is committed to reviewing these requirements as the industry obtains more experience operating
in the restructured environment, and, in particular, is interested in the effect of capacity release on pipeline
interruptible service. 


VI. Standards of Conduct 


The Commission proposed to delete only one provision from the Standards of Conduct ( 161.3 dealing with take-or-pay
issues). Tenneco and KGPC contend that all Standards of Conduct provisions should be removed because the conduct
they seek to prevent is already precluded by the requirements, in   284.8 and 284.9, that pipelines must
not unduly discriminate in the provision of transportation service. Tenneco asserts the standards actually may
send the wrong signal by suggesting that unduly discriminatory conduct not mentioned in the standards is somehow
considered less egregious than conduct specifically mentioned. Many other commenters request that the Commission
delete or modify specific provisions.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940627-0-00031 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940627-0-00009 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The Commission continues to find that retention of most of the Standards of Conduct are necessary to prevent affiliate
abuse, as will be discussed below with respect to specific provisions. 


A. Definitions 


Indicated Parties suggest that the Commission include a new definition of marketing affiliate that makes clear it
applies to pipelines' new merchant service established under Order No. 636 and a revision in the definition of transportation
to make clear that transportation includes storage. Section 284.286 provides that pipelines' new merchant divisions
are subject to the marketing affiliate regulations,
 and, therefore no new definition is needed. The Commission, however, will revise both Part 161 and  250.16 to
cross-reference  284.286.
 The Commission also is revising  284.286 to conform to the changes being made in  161.3.
 Section 284.1 of the Commission's regulations defines transportation as including storage,
 and the Commission will revise the definition of transportation in  161.2 to parallel the Part 284 definition.
 








 B. Information Disclosure Requirements 


Standard E provides that pipelines may not disclose to affiliates any information the pipeline receives from non-affiliated
shippers. Standard F provides that pipelines must contemporaneously disclose to all shippers any information related
to transportation that the pipelines provide to affiliates. In Order No. 497-E, the Commission revised Standard
F to eliminate the requirement for contemporaneous disclosure of sales and marketing information the pipelines
provide to marketing affiliates.
 




1. Standard E_Disclosure of Information Received From Non-affiliates 


Tenneco contends Standard E should be removed entirely. It argues no basis exists for prohibiting disclosure to marketing
affiliates of information received from other shippers, while permitting that information to be disclosed to non-affiliates.
It maintains that if a shipper would be harmed by pipeline disclosure of information the shipper provides, the same
harm would result from disclosure of that information to another non-affiliate. 
The Commission concludes that the Standard needs to be retained to prevent potential affiliate abuse. The Standard
recognizes that the pipelines have access to non-affiliate information due to the pipelines' control over transportation
service and that the pipelines have an economic incentive to favor affiliates with such information when disclosure
will benefit the affiliate. The same incentive does not apply to sharing of non-affiliate information with other
non-affiliates.

CNG contends Standard E should be modified to permit disclosure of sales and marketing information: only the sharing
of transportation related information would be prohibited. CNG recognizes the Commission took a contrary position
in Order No. 497-E, but urges the Commission to reexamine that conclusion.

28

 CNG argues that the transmission of sales and marketing information is unrelated to the pipeline's exercise of market
power over transportation, which is the only legitimate basis for restricting disclosure. CNG also claims Standard
E may work to the disadvantage of non-affiliated shippers. For example, it states that, during the recent cold weather,
it received requests for help in locating gas supplies that, due to Standard E, it was unable to pass along to its marketing
affiliates, which may have been able to assist those customers. 





The Commission reaffirms its decision in Order No. 497-E to retain the Standard E restrictions on disclosure
of all information (including sales and marketing information) received from non-affiliated shippers. Unlike
sales and marketing information that the pipelines obtain from the public domain (and can provide to affiliates under
Standard F), sales and marketing information obtained from non-affiliated shippers (Standard E information) is
directly related to the pipelines' control over transportation service. While public domain information is available
to all, the information pipelines obtain from their customers is not, and Standard E prevents the pipelines from favoring
their affiliates by providing them with non-public information that the pipelines have obtained as result of providing
transportation service. 

CNG contends the Standard prohibits disclosure of information to affiliates when such disclosure may benefit the
non-affiliated shipper providing the information to the pipeline. The Standard is intended to protect a non-affiliated
shipper against the disclosure of confidential or commercially sensitive information to marketing affiliates.
If the non-affiliated shipper finds such disclosure to be in its interest, it can waive its Standard E protection.

29

 





2. Standard F_Disclosure of Transportation-Related Information 




Panhandle Eastern Pipelines and Tenneco contend Standard F should be deleted. They contend even the remaining requirement
to disclose transportation-related information needlessly inhibits competition, because the pipelines are uncertain
what information they need to publicly disclose and, therefore, may act cautiously by withholding beneficial, legitimate
information from affiliates. They assert that with the advent of capacity release, the pipelines' monopoly over
transportation has been lessened, so that the rationale for the regulation no longer exists. Further, they contend
that all important information related to transportation is now required to be made publicly available on the pipelines'
EBBs. Tenneco observes that a less intrusive means of preventing abuse would be for the Commission to specify the transportation
information that could provide competitive advantages and require that this information be posted on the EBBS. 

The Commission will retain Standard F. By requiring contemporaneous disclosure of transportation information
provided to affiliates, Standard F ensures equal treatment of non-affiliates and affiliates, without undue burden
on the pipelines. Not all transportation related information may be disclosed on pipeline EBBs, yet advance knowledge
of such transportation information could be of value to an affiliate.

30

 The Commission fails to see how capacity release justifies deletion of the Standard. The potential to acquire released
capacity does not mitigate the harm to non-affiliates that could result from selective disclosure of important non-public
transportation information to affiliates. 





Further, the Commission is not in the best position to determine all the types of transportation information that
may be of competitive significance. The more general requirement of Standard F to post any information pipelines
provide to affiliates permits the market itself to determine whether the information is of value. The Standard, therefore,
strikes a reasonable balance between the need to protect against undue favoritism to affiliates and the need to permit
pipelines to transact business with their affiliates. 

KGPC also requests clarification of what transportation information must be contemporaneously disclosed. It asserts
that in Order Nos. 497 and 497-A, the Commission stated that specific transportation, sales, and marketing
information related to the affiliate's request need not be disclosed. It claims that although the Standard was difficult
to interpret even before Order No. 497-E established different requirements for disclosure of sales and marketing
information and transportation information, the distinction between these categories of information has made
the determination of what information must be disclosed even more complex.

As the Commission stated in Order Nos. 497 and 497-A, pipelines need only contemporaneously disclose general
transportation information provided to an affiliate; they need not disclose information related to the affiliate's
specific transportation request.
 This distinction appears reasonably self-explanatory, and KGPC has not explained why the distinction is difficult
to make, nor has it identified specific situations that cause it difficulty, so that the Commission can provide guidance.





KGPC further requests clarification of the Commission's statement in Order No. 497-E that, even though sales
and marketing information no longer must be disclosed under Standard F, the Commission is not barred from examining
such questions, if relevant and necessary, in specific cases. KGPC requests that the Commission specify the circumstances
in which it will consider such issues. 
In Order No. 497-E, the Commission removed the general requirement for pipelines to disclose sales and marketing
information. However, the Commission still retains the right to determine in individual proceedings that certain
pipelines must disclose sales and marketing information when the circumstances show such disclosure is needed to
prevent undue discrimination. 


 C. Standard H_Tieing Gas Subject to Take-Or-Pay Relief 


In the NOPR, the Commission proposed to eliminate  161.3(h) of the regulations which prohibits pipelines from
conditioning or tieing an agreement to release gas subject to take-or-pay relief to the purchase of services from
a marketing affiliate. The Commission stated that this provision should no longer be needed since Order No. 636 established
procedures for dealing with gas supply realignment (GSR) costs resulting from the reformation or termination of
take-or-pay contracts after the unbundling of sales from transportation service.
 




Hadson and Indicated Parties argue for retention of this provision. Hadson states that, while the size of the take-or-pay
problem has been reduced, the Commission has approved pricing differential mechanisms for reducing GSR costs under
which gas subject to take-or-pay contracts is auctioned by the pipeline or marketing affiliate on a monthly basis.
It also states the Commission has approved reverse auctions. These mechanisms, it asserts, still create the potential
for anticompetitive tieing. Indicated Parties suggest that the phrase gas supply realignment costs be substituted
for take-or-pay costs to ensure that pipelines do not attempt to tie the availability of unbundled transportation
and storage services to the purchase of specific gas supplies.
 But they do not explain why retention of this requirement is necessary in light of the procedures established in Order
No. 636 and the restructuring cases for dealing with GSR costs. 




The Commission will delete this requirement. Hadson has not demonstrated how the pipeline would rig an auction or
a reverse auction
 that would result in tieing of an agreement to release gas to the purchase of services from an affiliate. The auction
or reverse auction involves bidding on gas contracts which is independent of any services provided by a marketing
affiliate. Moreover, the Commission can better monitor potential affiliate abuse in auctions by considering the
circumstances of the auction mechanism proposed in individual cases rather than by promulgating a generic standard,
which may not apply to certain cases.
 





D. Standard I (New Standard H)_Affiliate Discounts Contemporaneously Disclosed To Similarly Situated Shippers



1. Retention of Standard H 


The Commission is retaining the current standard, which is being renumbered Standard H. Current Standard I requires
pipelines making a transportation discount to an affiliate to make a comparable discount contemporaneously available
to all similarly situated non-affiliates. A number of commenters contend this provision should be removed. 
El Paso asserts the regulation is not needed, contending pipelines will not make an unjustified discount to an affiliate,
because the pipelines will lose money. It further argues that pipelines may actually forgo making beneficial and
competitive case specific discounts to affiliates because of the vagueness of the term ``similarly situated.''
It asserts pipelines may not offer their affiliates a discount to avoid the risk of having to unjustifiably reduce
rates to other shippers.

<TEXT>
 

K N Energy similarly contends that pipelines may not provide a market-justified discount to affiliates given the
extra obligations and heightened scrutiny created by the provision. KGPC maintains the requirement seriously restricts
negotiations between pipelines and affiliates because the parties must be continuously concerned about whether
a conversation could be construed as an offer. 
K N Energy and Tenneco contend the requirement is not needed because the Commission has sufficient mechanisms to monitor
and prevent undue discrimination. They point out the pipelines are required to file discount reports under Part 284,
which enable non-affiliates to monitor discounts and file complaints of undue discrimination. 
The Commission will not delete Standard H, because requiring pipelines to make discounts contemporaneously available
to similarly situated non-affiliates is needed to ensure equal treatment. Standard H does not substantially inhibit
the provision of justified discounts to affiliates. When pipelines offer discounts to affiliates, they must only
be able to provide a valid explanation for why another shipper requesting a comparable discount is not similarly situated
to the affiliate. 
The discount information required to be filed under Part 284 is not a substitute for Standard H. Standard H requires
pipelines to make offers contemporaneously available to similarly situated shippers. In contrast, the Part 284
discount information is not filed until 15 days after the close of the billing period, which is not equivalent to the
contemporaneous notice required under Standard H. 


2. Revision of the Standard to Eliminate Duplicative Posting Requirements 


The Commission is revising the standard to eliminate duplicative postings of information about affiliate discounts.
Section 250.16 currently requires the pipelines to post information about affiliate discounts on their EBBs. This
information includes the duration of a discount, the discounted rate, the maximum rate, and the quantity of gas scheduled
at the discounted rate during the billing period for each delivery point. A number of commenters requested that the
Commission reduce or eliminate the  250.16 reporting requirement. 
Former Standard I required pipelines to make discounts available to similarly situated non-affiliates.
 In 

Colorado Interstate Gas Company

 (CIG),
 the Commission sought to eliminate any potential ambiguity about the way in which pipelines are to determine similarly
situated shippers under the standard. The Commission found that pipelines could make a determination of similarly
situated only if the pipelines first informed non-affiliates of the terms of the affiliate offer so the non-affiliates
would have the opportunity to request a comparable discount if they thought they were similarly situated.
 Since all pipelines are now required by Order No. 636 to maintain EBBs, the Commission provided that the pipelines
needed, at a minimum, to provide notice of affiliate discounts by posting them on the pipelines' EBBs. The information
to be posted is virtually identical to that required under  250.16, including the date of the offer, the discount
rate, the quantity of gas scheduled to be moved at the discounted rate, and the delivery points in the offer. Most pipelines
now comply with the standard by using EBB posting. 






The Commission has determined that the duplicative posting requirements for affiliate discounts are not necessary.
The Commission, therefore, will modify Standard H to clarify that pipelines are to comply with the Standard by contemporaneously
posting information about affiliate discounts on their EBBs and permitting non-affiliates to request such discounts
if they conclude they are similarly situated. The Commission will then eliminate the requirement to make similar
EBB postings under  250.16. These revisions do not add a new reporting requirement. They essentially eliminate
duplicative postings by moving the affiliate discount posting requirement from  250.16 to Standard H.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940627-0-00035 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940627-0-00009 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The elimination of the  250.16 reports will not adversely affect the ability of non-affiliates to monitor affiliate
transactions. The only significant difference between the Standard H and  250.16 EBB posting requirements
is that the  250.16 reports are posted at the close of the billing period so they include the quantity of gas actually
scheduled by the affiliate whereas scheduled quantity information could not be included in a contemporaneous posting
under Standard H. But after-the-fact information on actual quantities scheduled is not needed for shippers adequately
to monitor affiliate transactions. Non-affiliates only need to be able to determine whether they were denied a discount
offered to an affiliate, and the information in the contemporaneous postings will allow them to make this determination.
The actual quantities scheduled under a discount casts no light on whether the pipeline engaged in undue discrimination
when the discount was offered.

39

 





Accordingly, the Commission will incorporate into Standard H the requirement that a pipeline offering a discount
to an affiliate (or a discount for a transportation transaction in which an affiliate is involved) must contemporaneously
post the offer on its EBB and maintain the posting for 90 days. The posting must include the date of the offer, the discount
rate, the quantity of gas scheduled to be moved at the discounted rate, the delivery points in the offer, any conditions
underlying the offer (for example, if the discount is dependent on an agreement to move a certain quantity of gas or
on the use of a specific transportation path), and the procedures by which shippers can request a comparable discount.
The posting of the information must conform with the requirements applicable to pipelines' EBBs as required in  284.8(b)(4).

40

 





3. Specific Issues 

a. Affiliate's Role in a Transportation Transaction 



In the NOPR, the Commission proposed to require the pipelines to disclose an affiliate's role in a transportation
transaction when they are not the shipper in the transaction.

41

 Several pipelines object to this proposal, contending it creates an impossible burden since pipelines will not know
the affiliate's role if it is not a shipper.

42

 KGPC contends that disclosure of an affiliate's role, when it is not a shipper, runs counter to the Commission's determination
in Order No. 497-E to eliminate Standard F's contemporaneous posting requirements for non-transportation
related information. Texas Gas states that since the pipeline generally will not know whether an affiliate is involved,
the Commission should permit pipelines to obtain this information from shippers.

43

 







The Commission's requirement to disclose discounts when an affiliate is involved in the transaction is merely a continuation
of the requirement in  250.16(b)(2) of the existing regulations to report such transactions.

44

 In many instances, pipelines are aware of the role played by its affiliate or sales operating unit. For instance, when
the affiliate acts as an agent in a transaction (by arranging for gas supplies and transportation), the pipeline may
know of the affiliate's role even when it is not the official shipper because the affiliate will be making the transportation
arrangements on behalf of its client. In response to Texas Gas's comment, the Commission will not require the pipelines
to obtain the information from shippers about affiliate involvement. The pipelines need disclose that information
only when they have knowledge of the affiliate's involvement in the transaction. 





The Commission finds no inconsistency between the requirement to disclose transactions in which an affiliate is
involved and its decision in Order No. 497-E to eliminate the contemporaneous disclosure requirement for sales
and marketing information provided to an affiliate. When a pipeline is aware that its affiliate is involved in a transportation
transaction, it may offer a selective transportation discount to the actual shipper in order to ensure that the shipper
does business with the affiliate. Thus, a pipeline's provision of a transportation discount in a transaction in which
an affiliate is involved can raise the same question of potential undue discrimination as a discount provided directly
to the affiliate. Conversely, when the pipeline does not know of its marketing affiliate's involvement in a transaction,
the possibility of unduly preferential behavior seems unlikely.

<DOCNO> FR940627-0-00036 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940627-0-00009 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

b. Inclusion of Receipt Points 



The National Registry contends that receipt point information should be included because discounts may sometimes
depend on the point at which gas enters the system. The Commission, however, will not include receipt points because
receipt point information is often voluminous. If in a particular case, a discount is based on the receipt point used,
that condition would be disclosed as a condition for granting the discount. 



c. Disclosure of Non-Affiliate Discounts 



Indicated Parties suggest that the Commission require posting of non-affiliate discount information on the EBB
within 15 days of the commencement of service. KGPC also suggests that the Commission should replace the affiliate
reporting requirements with a general requirement for EBB posting of all interruptible transactions. 

The Commission will not require posting of non-affiliate information, because information on discounts to non-affiliates
is unrelated to the goal of the reporting requirements_to permit non-affiliates to monitor affiliate discounts
for possible discrimination. A non-affiliate need not have access to other non-affiliate information to monitor
affiliate transactions; the non-affiliate can compare any affiliate discounts with the rate the non-affiliate
pays. The non-affiliate information will be available to the Commission upon request, under  250.16, should
the Commission need to compare the discounts offered to affiliates and non-affiliates in investigating a complaint
of discrimination. 



E. Standard G & Standard K (New Standard J)_Separation of Operating Employees and Books of Account 



Current Standards G and K require that the operating employees of pipelines and affiliates function independently
to the maximum extent practicable and that the books of account for the pipelines and affiliates be maintained separately.
Tenneco contends these provisions are unnecessary after Order No. 636, because pipelines are required by Order No.
636 to unbundle sales from transportation service and, therefore, must establish separate operations and staffs.
Moreover, as a practical matter, it contends employees making day-to-day decisions regarding gas transportation
will not be making decisions for the affiliate. 

By requiring separation of operating personnel to the maximum extent practicable, Standard G complements the other
Standards of Conduct by reducing the possibility that information will improperly be shared with an affiliate. Tenneco
is correct that in Order No. 636, the Commission did adopt new regulations under Part 284 that, like Standard G, require
pipelines to ensure that their unbundled sales operating personnel operate independently from its transportation
operating personnel.

45

 But these regulations do not apply to marketing affiliates, and, therefore, Standard G still is needed to ensure adequate
separation of pipeline and marketing affiliate personnel. 





Standard J's requirement for separation of books of account is needed to permit scrutiny of costs so that affiliate
costs are not shifted to the pipeline's rate base and recovered from the pipeline's transportation customers. 



VII. Tariff Requirements 



A. Shared Operating Personnel 



Section 250.16(b)(1)(i) requires pipelines to maintain in their tariffs a list of operating personnel shared by
the pipelines and their affiliates, which, under  250.16(d)(2), they must update quarterly, if any changes
occur. The NOPR proposed to continue this requirement. CNG and Panhandle Eastern Pipelines request clarification
that the pipelines will not be required to make quarterly filings if no changes in shared personnel or facilities have
occurred. The Commission agrees that a filing need only be made if changes have occurred. 



B. Request For Service Information 



The Commission proposed to eliminate the requirement, in current  250.16(b)(1)(ii), that pipelines include
in their tariffs the information required for a valid request for service, including the information required for
the Form No. 592 affiliate transportation log. Indicated Parties suggest this provision be retained, so parties
will know what must be included in a valid request for service. They assert that, as far they can determine, this requirement
is not duplicated in other regulations and that such information is important, because a valid request for service
is often a prerequisite for participation in the capacity release program. 

The Commission finds that the requirement for pipelines to include information needed for a valid service request
is no longer related to affiliate abuse. Under the previous regulations, pipelines were required to report certain
information about shippers that the pipelines could obtain only through the transportation request form.

46

 Under this rule, the Commission is no longer requiring pipelines to report these categories of information, and,
therefore, a tariff provision requiring shippers to disclose such information is no longer needed. The Commission
notes, however, that, under Part 284, pipelines must have tariff provisions that provide for equality of transportation
service, with reasonable and non-discriminatory terms and conditions for acquiring such service.

47

 To comply with these requirements, the pipelines still must have tariff provisions describing the procedures necessary
to request service and participate in the capacity release program.

<PARENT> FR940627-0-00009 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

C. Availability And Pricing Of Transportation Services 



The Commission proposed to eliminate current  250.16(b)(1)(iv) that requires pipeline tariffs to include
the procedures used to inform affiliated and non-affiliated shippers of the availability and pricing of transportation
service and of the capacity available for transportation. The Commission concluded this requirement was superfluous
in light of the Order No. 636 requirement for pipelines to provide equal and timely access on their EBBs to information
relevant to the availability of service on their systems.

48

 





Indicated Parties contend that the current Order No. 636 requirements do not require pipelines to post the procedures
used to determine the availability of transportation services, the amount of capacity the pipelines have available,
or the pricing of services. They submit that the Commission should ensure that pipeline tariffs require pipelines
to post information on ``operationally available'' capacity on their EBBs and to describe the procedures used in
posting the information, such as the timing of postings. 

The Commission concludes that the requirements of Part 284 provide sufficient disclosure of the necessary information
about capacity on pipelines. Towards that end, the Commission recently issued Order No. 563 detailing the information
about capacity that the pipelines must disclose on their EBBs (as well as through downloadable files), including
operationally available capacity.

49

 In that proceeding, the Commission found no need for requiring pipelines to file tariffs setting forth the way in which
the pipelines will provide the information required by the rule.

50

 






VIII. Transportation Information 



Current  250.16 requires pipelines to post a variety of information about affiliate transportation service
requests and affiliate discounts on the pipelines' EBBs. The regulations also require the pipelines to maintain
the same information for non-affiliate transactions, so that it can be provided to the Commission upon request. 

In the NOPR, the Commission proposed to reduce significantly the information concerning shippers' requests for
transportation service, retaining only a few elements, principally relating to the position of requests in the pipelines'
transportation queues.

51

 But the Commission was unsure about the value of these requirements and requested comments on whether they should
be retained. In the NOPR, the Commission proposed to retain the maintenance and posting requirements related to affiliate
and non-affiliate discounts, but proposed to limit these requirements to interruptible transportation. 





A. Capacity Allocation Log 



Many commenters contend all service request information should be deleted. WGM and WNG/Northwest contend the original
basis for these requirements was to monitor the process of awarding contracts so that affiliates would not receive
preferential queue positions. They maintain this rationale is no longer valid since queues are no longer used in the
restructured environment. Numerous other commenters similarly contend that queues no longer have any effect on
curtailment or bumping rights.

52

 Texas Gas also points out that  284.13 of the Commission's regulations requires pipelines to keep, and make
publicly available, a log of requests for service that contains much of the same information as required by  250.16.

53

 






Panhandle Eastern Pipelines, Natural, and TGPL contend the requirement to post complaints parallels the Commission's
requirement to disclose complaint procedures in the tariff and only one should be retained. TGPL and Natural contend
that complaints are solely between the pipeline and the complaining party, so electronic posting serves no purpose.
TGPL further argues that posting of complaints is too complex for electronic format. AER/MRT request that complaints
by end-users should not be included since the Commission has proposed deleting the requirement to post the state of
the ultimate end-user (former  250.16(b)(2)(xi)). 

AER/MRT and TGPL contend the requirement to post tariff waivers duplicates Standard L, which requires pipelines
to maintain a log of tariff waivers that must be available for copying on a daily basis. Indicated Parties, however,
requests the waiver provision be amended to require separate reporting of waivers granted to affiliates and sales
marketing units. 

The Commission agrees that the data now required to be posted concerning service requests do not reflect the methods
used by the pipelines to allocate capacity. As the commenters point out, Commission policy and pipeline tariffs require
that interruptible transportation be allocated first on the basis of price paid when the pipeline is unable to provide
the amount of requested service. If the rate bid still is not sufficient to allocate interruptible capacity, some
pipelines rely on 

pro rata

 allocation or some other means to allocate capacity that does not depend on contract dates or other similar information.
For these pipelines, the Commission agrees that posting contract information is not necessary because that information
bears no relation to the capacity allocation decision.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940627-0-00038 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940627-0-00009 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

However, some pipelines continue to rely on contract or other information to break ties and determine to whom interruptible
capacity is allocated. But even for these pipelines, the current regulations may not capture the appropriate information
used to allocate interruptible capacity. The current regulations only require the pipelines to maintain information
about the service request date, while some pipelines use other dates or other information for allocation of interruptible
capacity, such as the contract execution date, the date gas is first shipped under a contract, rate schedule, transportation
type, or other rankings.

54

 Some pipelines rely on similar contract information in allocating firm capacity during curtailments. 





Accordingly, the Commission will revise the regulations to better fit the current need for contract information
and to reduce the reporting burden on the pipelines. Those pipelines that continue to rely upon contract execution
dates, service request dates, or other data to allocate firm or interruptible capacity must maintain (for both affiliate
and non-affiliate shippers) a log of those contract dates or other information used to allocate capacity.

55

 





The pipelines must post on their EBBs the current relevant capacity allocation data for their affiliates.

56

 This posting is equivalent to the current requirement to post transportation request information, and will enable
shippers to monitor the pipelines' allocation of capacity to their affiliates. The posting of the information must
conform with the requirements applicable to pipelines' EBBs as required in  284.8(b)(4).

57

 The pipelines also must provide the full capacity allocation log (for affiliates and non-affiliates) to the Commission
upon request, within a reasonable time and must make it available pursuant to the Commission's discovery procedures,
18 CFR, Part 385, Subpart D.

58

 







The Commission is deleting the requirements to post complaints and tariff waivers. If a complaint is not handled by
the pipeline to the satisfaction of the complaining party, the complainant can bring the matter to the Commission
either through the Commission's Enforcement Task Force hotline or the Commission's formal complaint procedures.
In addition, if shippers have questions about tariff waivers, the ability to obtain such information under former
Standard L (new Standard K) is sufficient. 

Indicated Parties support continuation of the current requirement to disclose the maximum daily quantity of gas
to be transported under a contract and contend the requirement should be expanded to include the receipt and delivery
points under the contract. The Commission, however, does not find that continued disclosure of this information
is necessary. Information on maximum daily quantities under each contract is already available for all shippers
in the initial reports that pipelines must file under Part 284.

59

 Such information does not appear so critical to capacity allocation that a duplicative reporting requirement for
affiliate transactions should be imposed.

B. Discount Information for Affiliate and Non-Affiliate Transactions 



The current  250.16 regulations require pipelines to disclose affiliate discounts on their EBB and to maintain
non-affiliate information, which will be provided to the Commission, upon request. As discussed earlier, the Commission
is deleting the requirement for pipelines to post affiliate information on their EBBs, because the pipelines contemporaneously
post affiliate discount information under Standard H. 

A number of commenters contend the Commission should eliminate the reporting requirements entirely. Tenneco maintains
that the reporting requirements are not needed to monitor or prevent abuse, because sufficient information about
the processing of transportation requests and rates is maintained by the pipelines and would be available if allegations
of undue discrimination are made. It states permanent data collection and posting requirements should not be imposed
based on unsubstantiated suspicions that abuses will occur in the post Order No. 636 environment. Several commenters
argue the Order No. 497 requirements are duplicative of the requirement in  284.7(d)(5)(iv) that pipelines
file discount information with the Commission.

61

 Natural argues that since the Commission found the Part 284 reporting requirements to be sufficient for firm service,
these requirements similarly should be sufficient for interruptible service. Columbia argues that, like the allocation
of firm capacity, the allocation of interruptible capacity on its system takes place during the nominating/bidding
process conducted through and disclosed on its EBB, and therefore no separate Order No. 497 posting requirement is
needed. 





The Commission will retain the requirement for pipelines to maintain discount information for affiliates and non-affiliates
and provide that information to the Commission upon request. Information on discounting is needed for the Commission
to monitor affiliate transactions, and this information is not duplicated elsewhere.

62

 The information required in  250.16 is more extensive than the discount information required to be filed under
Part 284. For example, the discount information under  250.16 includes the quantity of gas scheduled at the
discount for each delivery point, which is not included in the Part 284 reports. The Commission requires the more detailed
information to adequately monitor and compare affiliate and non-affiliate transactions.

63

 






Accordingly, the Commission will continue to require pipelines to maintain discount information for both affiliate
and non-affiliate transactions. They must provide this information to the Commission upon request, within a reasonable
time, according to specifications and formats prescribed by the Commission in Form No. 592.

64

 





The Commission had proposed to eliminate the requirement for the pipelines to provide the discount information for
firm capacity, stating that, under Order No. 636, much of the posting and awarding of firm service by the pipelines
will take place on the pipelines' EBBs. The Commission, however, has reconsidered and will continue the current requirement
that pipelines include firm discount information in the data to be made available to the Commission. First, after
review of pipeline tariffs, the Commission is not sure that all pipelines will be posting the details of their sales
of firm capacity on their EBBs. Second, including firm discounts in this data will enable Commission staff to process
the information more easily, because all relevant discount information will be provided in one format. 



IX. EBB Access and Archiving Requirements 



Under Standard H, pipelines will be posting information related to affiliate discount offers on their EBBs and, under
 250.16(c), they also will be posting the affiliate contract allocation data on their EBBs. In the NOPR, the
Commission proposed to conform the Order No. 497 EBB posting requirements with the EBB requirements under Part 284,
and the Commission is adopting this approach. 

The pipelines, therefore, must ensure that the affiliate information is displayed in a user-friendly format and
that their EBB incorporates the same features as apply to the other aspects of the pipelines' EBBs.

65

 The protocols and procedures for accessing the affiliate information also must be the same as those used to access
each pipeline's EBB. Thus, the pipelines must permit users to obtain the affiliate information by using the same phone
number and log-on procedures used to access the information about available capacity on the pipelines' EBBs.

Columbia and Texas Gas contend that pipelines should be permitted to post the affiliate information in a manner consistent
with their EBB formats and not be required to adhere to the Form No. 592 formats. Hadson contends the Commission should
continue to require a hard copy filing of the Form No. 592 information with the Commission, because many pipelines'
Order No. 497 boards are so poorly designed that shippers experience difficulty in accessing and abstracting useful
information. 

Form No. 592 is not intended to dictate the mode of displaying information on EBBs, but to provide the requirements
for providing information to the Commission electronically. The EBB regulations require the pipelines to display
information in a user-friendly format and pipelines, therefore, are responsible for developing a user-friendly
display for the affiliate information posted on their EBBs. Since the Commission has established EBBs as the mode
of communication between pipelines and their customers and the EBBs are required to be user-friendly, the Commission
will not require hard copy filings. Moreover, any possible benefits from hard copy filing are outweighed by the filing
burden on the pipelines and the administrative burden on the Commission of collecting and maintaining the hard copy
information. 

Panhandle Eastern Pipelines contend that integrating the Order No. 497 information into their EBB would be costly
and if the Commission insists on merger of the boards, it suggests the Commission should provide 9 months within which
to do so. The Commission concludes that integrating the marketing affiliate information required here into the pipelines'
current EBB structure is necessary to ensure shippers can access the information easily without having to use an entirely
different set of procedures and protocols to view the affiliate information. In fact, many pipelines already have
integrated their affiliate information with their Order No. 636 EBBs. Pipelines that cannot accommodate such integration,
may file a request for an extension of time, providing good cause for extending the compliance deadline. 

PG&E requests clarification about the pipelines' obligation to archive the information required to be posted
and maintained under the rule. It contends the pipelines should be required to maintain the information for a reasonable
period of time, suggesting they archive the data at least until their next rate case. The EBB posting of affiliate information
must conform with the Commission's requirements for EBBs. 

The current regulations provide that data be maintained consistent with the  284.8(b)(4) requirements relating
to EBBs, which includes a three year archiving requirement.

67

 Thus, all information posted on EBBs must be archived for three years. Similarly, the three year maintenance requirement
will apply to the information in the log of contract allocation data,  250.16(c),

68

 and the discount data,  250.16(d). 






X. Miscellaneous Issues 


A. Reporting of Affiliate Discounts Under Part 284 



Current  250.16(d)(4)(ii) permitted pipelines filing affiliate discount reports to exclude those transactions
from the discount reports required to be filed under  284.7(d)(5)(iv). The Commission proposed to remove this
provision, because, under its proposed regulations, pipelines would no longer file affiliate reports with the Commission,
but would post them on their EBBs. AER/MRT contend that if affiliate discounts are posted on the EBB within 15 days of
the transaction, the Part 284 discount reports still should not be required. 

The Commission will require pipelines to file affiliate discounts under  284.7(d)(5)(iv), because the Commission
is deleting the requirement to post affiliate discounts under  250.16. Under Standard H, pipelines must only
post offers of affiliate discounts. Thus, pipelines must file the affiliate discount information for the completed
transaction under the Part 284 regulations.

B. Relation of the Marketing Affiliate Regulations of This Rule to Tariff Requirements Addressing Similar Problems



El Paso requests clarification that the Commission's Order No. 497 regulations, as codified in Part 161 and  250.16
of the regulations, constitute the exclusive requirements relating to marketing affiliates superseding any specific
tariff provisions related to affiliate transactions. It asserts that the Commission has in the past imposed tariff
requirements for certain transactions (such as gas inventory charges or interruptible sales) that were meant to
address problems similar to those addressed in the affiliate provisions. It maintains that these tariff provisions
should be considered inoperative so all pipelines will be treated equally.

The Commission cannot make a universal determination of the applicability of all outstanding tariff provisions.
The Commission, however, will carefully review pipeline filings to eliminate any such provisions the pipelines
believe are superfluous in light of the marketing affiliate requirements.



C. Applicability of the Marketing Affiliate Regulations of This Rule to Permanent Releases of Capacity



AER/MRT request clarification of whether a permanent release of capacity will trigger the reporting and maintenance
requirements of the rule. They point to the Commission's finding that the Order No. 497 reporting requirements do
not apply to temporary capacity releases,

69

 and contend the same treatment should apply to permanent releases, since permanent releases, like temporary releases,
are controlled not by the pipeline, but by the firm shipper holding capacity.





The Commission does not agree that permanent releases are identical to temporary releases. In a temporary capacity
release, the releasing shipper is still obligated to the pipeline under its initial contract. Thus, even if the releasing
shipper agrees to accept a discounted rate, the pipeline has not agreed to the discount because the releasing shipper
will owe the maximum rate under its contract.

70

 In a permanent capacity release, however, the releasing shipper's contractual obligations end, and the replacement
shipper enters into a new contract with the pipeline. Thus, if the pipeline offers a discount to its affiliate it must
post that discount on its EBB under Standard H and it must maintain the required discount information under  250.16.





D. EBB Posting of Information Constitutes a Filing



Hadson requests clarification that, as stated in Order No. 497-E, the posting of Order No. 497 information on
a pipeline's EBB constitutes a filing with the Commission for the purposes of 18 U.S.C.  1001, which provides
criminal penalties for a knowing and willful misrepresentation to the government.

71

 The Commission reaffirms its position in Order No. 497-E that posting of the affiliate information is deemed
to be a filing for purposes of 18 U.S.C.  1001.





E. Posting of Pipeline Tariffs



Indicated Parties contend that the pipelines should be required to post their tariffs. They assert such posting would
save shippers as well as the pipelines considerable time and money as compared with the current requirement that pipelines
make their tariffs available for public inspection and send copies to shippers. The issue of posting pipeline tariffs
is unrelated to the affiliate regulations and is not appropriately considered in this proceeding. The issue has been
discussed at some of the conferences in Docket No. RM93-4-000 relating to standards for EBBs, and that
would be a more appropriate forum to consider this issue.



F. Relationship to the Commission's EBB Standards Proceeding



The National Registry contends that the issues of affiliate disclosure are related to issues involved in the Commission's
ongoing proceeding, in Docket No. RM93-4-000, to develop standards for electronic dissemination of
information about firm and interruptible capacity. In particular, the National Registry is concerned about the
disclosure of information relating to the firm and interruptible capacity rights of shippers, and suggests that
the Commission hold a technical conference to determine how best to provide disclosure of capacity rights information.

The Commission finds that the issue of disclosure of capacity rights is properly considered only in the Docket No.
RM93-4-000 proceeding. As stated earlier, in Order No. 563-A, the Commission found merit in the
development of an index of capacity rights and directed the industry to develop a final proposal by September 30, 1994.



XI. Environmental Analysis



The Commission is required to prepare an Environmental Assessment or an Environmental Impact Statement for any action
that may have a significant adverse effect on the human environment.

72

 The Commission has categorically excluded certain actions from these requirements as not having a significant effect
on the human environment.

73

 The action taken here falls within the categorical exclusions provided in the Commission's regulations.

74

 Therefore, an environmental assessment is unnecessary and has not been prepared in this rulemaking.

XII. Regulatory Flexibility Act Certification



The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (RFA)

75

 generally requires a description and analysis of final rules that will have significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities. The regulations impose reporting requirements on interstate natural gas pipelines. Since
these pipelines are not small entities, the regulations will not have significant economic impact on small entities.
Thus, pursuant to section 605(b) of the RFA, the Commission hereby certifies that the regulations proposed herein
will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities.





XIII. Information Collection Requirement



Office of Management and Budget (OMB) regulations require approval of certain information collection requirements
imposed by agency rules.

76

 The final rule revises and reduces the reporting requirements/burden under existing FERC-592, Marketing
Affiliates of Interstate Pipelines, (OMB Control No. 1902-0157).





The information required under FERC-592 enables the Commission to carry out its legislative mandate under
the Natural Gas Act and Natural Gas Policy Act and allows the Commission to review/monitor pipeline transportation,
sales, and storage transactions with its marketing affiliates to deter undue discrimination and to take appropriate
action, where and when necessary. The information is also used by others to indicate whether or not there has been discrimination
in pipeline affiliate/non-affiliate transactions.

The Commission is submitting notification of these FERC-592 information requirements to OMB for its review
and approval. Interested persons may obtain further information by contacting the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission,
941 North Capitol Street NE., Washington, D.C. 20426 [Attention: Michael Miller, Information Services Division,
(202) 208-1415]. Comments on the requirements of the subject final rule may also be sent to the Office of Information
and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget, Washington, D.C. 20503 [Attention: Desk Officer for Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission].



XIV. Effective Date



The final rule shall take effect August 1, 1994.

General Information 




I. Purpose



The information required is to support the monitoring of activities of pipeline marketing affiliates (which includes
holders of Subpart J of Part 284 blanket sales certificates) so as to deter undue discrimination by pipeline companies
in favor of marketing affiliates, and to prevent any harassment of non-affiliates. 



II. Who Must Comply 



An interstate natural gas pipeline that:

 Transports natural gas for others, as that term is defined in 18 CFR  161.2, pursuant to Subparts B or G
of Part 284 of 18 CFR Chapter I and 

 Is affiliated, as that term is defined in  161.2 of this chapter, in any way with a natural gas marketing
or brokering entity and 

 Conducts transportation transactions with its affiliate

 


must maintain the requisite information for transportation service as specified in the FERC Form 592 and in the manner
prescribed herein. The requirements of this part also apply to pipeline sales operating units to the extent provided
in  284.286 of this chapter. 



III. How to Comply



An interstate pipeline must maintain the required information for both firm and interruptible transportation service,
and for both pipeline affiliates and nonaffiliates, in a computer file(s) conforming to the file formats specified
in the FERC Form 592. Pipelines may submit the FERC Form 592 computer file(s) on 9-track tape reel(s), 18-track tape
cartridge(s), or on computer diskette(s). In addition, the Commission may request that the pipeline provide one
paper copy of the information submitted in the computer file(s) so as to assist Commission staff in interpreting the
computer file(s).

N. Capitol Street NE., 
Washington, DC 20426. 



General Instructions 

 


1. The notation f(m,n) will be used to denote a numeric string of length ``m'' including a decimal (``.'') with ``n''
digits following the decimal. 

2. In preparing the required flat file, the following conventions must be followed: 

(A) All volumetric data should be stated in MMbtu's (rounded to the nearest MMbtu), except where noted. 

(B) All rates should be stated in 

cents

 per MMbtu fixed decimal numbers, format f(10,2). For example, $1.5264/MMbtu should be stated as 152.64. 

(C) Negative values should be reported with a ``^'' sign preceding the first nonzero digit reported. 

(D) Commas must not be included in any numeric field. 

(E) All dates should be reported as six digit numerics (month, day, year), unless otherwise indicated. 

3. The sequence number is the sequential number assigned to a record as it is recorded on a schedule/record. The sequence
number is incremented as additional records are added to a schedule/record and will be between 1 and 999,999, inclusive.
(Note: the sequence number should be right justified, zero filled.) 

4. The reference number is the alphanumeric string formed by concatenation of the Schedule ID, sequence number, and
beginning character position of the item footnoted. 

E.g.,

 a respondent's Company ID reported in the Discounted Transportation (Storage) Transaction Record would have reference
number ``D000001008'' formed by joining (concatenating) the schedule ID ``D'', the sequence number ``000001'',
and the beginning character position of the item ``008''. 

5. Record any footnote relative to any recorded item in the ``Footnotes Record'', schedule ID `F'. Each footnote should
be cross referenced to the schedule and record (line) it pertains to by the appropriate reference number (see above).


6. Source of Codes. 

(A) Pipeline Company ID_Use the code for the pipeline as contained in 
 the Buyer Seller Code List, U.S. Department of Energy's publication DOE/EIA-0176. A code may be obtained by
calling EIA at (202) 254-5435. 

(B) Contract ID_The respondent's own designation for the contract or agreement covering the transaction being reported.
This identifier will either be assigned by the respondent or the party providing a service to the respondent. 

7. A pipeline blanket sales operating unit is any entity operating under a Subpart J of Part 284 blanket sales certificate,
and is considered the functional equivalent of a marketing affiliate. 

8. Delivery Point ID_The point at which the pipeline company delivers 
 the natural gas to a designated end user, local distribution company, etc. as specified by the transportation service
requested. The respondent will provide a unique 20-byte alphanumeric identifier for each delivery point on his pipeline
system. This delivery point ID will be the alphanumeric label/name which the respondent uses in conducting his daily
business, (or a unique abbreviation thereof if the company identifier is more than 20 characters in length.) 

9. Maximum Rate for Transportation Service_The maximum rate contained in the respondent's currently effective
tariff for the rate schedule 
 under which the transportation service is being conducted. 

10. Discounted Rate for Transportation Service_A rate that is less than the maximum rate on file with the Commission.

Standards of Conduct and Reporting Requirements for Transportation and Affiliate Transactions_Docket No. RM94-6-000

 
(Issued June 17, 1994) 



Hoecker, Commissioner, 

concurring in part and dissenting in part:




Today I concur that the time has come to cut the regulatory burden associated with the marketing affiliate rules, particularly
the filing and record maintenance requirements tentatively adopted six years ago to ensure an equitable transition
to competition among independent and pipeline-affiliated marketers. My colleagues and I disagree only in part and
that disagreement is surely a matter of degree, not principle. 

I support the retention of the modestly revised Standards of Conduct applicable to pipeline relationships with marketing
affiliates because, under these circumstances, they impose a useful and relatively light-handed transactional
discipline on these relationships and help guarantee fair play and equal information in the marketplace. 

I nevertheless think the retention of the reporting and records maintenance requirements in revised FERC Form No.
592 is excessive and unnecessary.

1

 I am inclined to think it demonstrates an unhappy tendency to which we all occasionally fall prey in a bureaucratic
culture: assumptions and requirements, once adopted, tend to perpetuate themselves beyond their useful lives.
As Vice President Gore's National Performance Review observes: 





The federal government does at least one thing well: It generates red tape. But not one inch of that red tape appears
by accident. In fact, the government creates it all with the best of intentions. It is time now to put aside our reverence
for those good intentions and examine what they have created_a system that makes it hard for our civil servants to do
what we pay them for, and frustrates taxpayers who rightfully expect their money's worth.

2

 





This might strike my readers as rhetorical overkill as applied to this case, given the best of intentions that underlies
today's decision to retain the reporting requirements and FERC Form No. 592. After all, the rule claims (somewhat
inexplicably) that on average they will require only 60 workhours from each company per year. Yet, the continuation
of these recordkeeping requirements is not, in my estimation, supported by any strong evidence of need. I find no significant
numbers or patterns of complaints alleging that pipelines have favored affiliates. There is virtually no evidence
of industry interest in these data. In fact, in one of the few pleadings in this case that offers more than opinion, a
major pipeline system indicates that its Order No. 497 log was accessed only an average of 2-3 times monthly since
1990, with a significant portion of those calls (up to 50 percent at times) coming from Commission staff. The rule was
not designed to generate discounting data for rate cases. Nor was it formulated as a device to obviate discovery in
rare complaint cases. The need for these data is, therefore, highly conjectural. 

In the final analysis, it is clear that the majority wants to retain this small part of the Code of Federal Regulations
``just in case.'' And, by eliminating the sunset date, it is likely that FERC Form No. 592 will linger in regulatory
perpetuity. In my opinion, the cost (however small) to the industry and ultimately to ratepayers of continuing any
part of this recordkeeping requirement is greater than any probable benefit. 

Therefore, I dissent from that aspect of the rule that continues FERC Form No. 592.

Extension of Import Restrictions on Significant 
Archaeological Artifacts from Peru 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Customs Service, Treasury. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document amends the Customs Regulations to reflect the extension of the import restrictions on culturally significant
archaeological artifacts from the Sipan Region of Peru which were imposed by T.D. 90-37. The Deputy Director
of the United States Information Agency (USIA) has determined that the emergency conditions which originally warranted
the imposition of import restrictions still exist. Accordingly, the restrictions will continue to be in effect for
an additional three years, and the Customs Regulations are being amended to indicate this extension. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Background 


Pursuant to the provisions of the Convention on Cultural Property Implementation Act, the Deputy Director of the
United States Information Agency (USIA), after consultation with the Secretaries of State and Treasury, determined
that certain archaeological materials from the Sipan Archaeological Region of Peru, which material was identified
as comprising part of Peru's cultural patrimony forming part of the remains of the Moche culture were being pillaged,
or in danger of being pillaged, in crisis proportions and that an emergency condition existed which warranted the
imposition of a prohibition on the importation of such articles into the United States. In T.D. 90-37, the Customs
Service announced the imposition of import restrictions and identified the types of articles covered by the restrictions.

The Deputy Director of the USIA has considered the recommendations of the Cultural Property Advisory Committee and
determined that the emergency conditions which warranted imposition of the initial restrictions still exist and
has decided to extend the import restrictions for another three years. (See 59 FR 30633, June 14, 1944.) 
Accordingly, Customs is amending  12.104g (19 CFR 12.104g) to reflect the extension of the import restriction.



Executive Order 12866 and Regulatory Flexibility Act 


This amendment is not a ``significant regulatory action'' within the meaning of E.O. 12866. Because no notice of proposed
rulemaking is required, the provisions of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq.

) do not apply. 


Inapplicability of Notice and Delayed Effective Date 


Because this amendment reflects the extension of emergency import restrictions on cultural property which is currently
subject to pillage and looting, pursuant to section 553(b)(B) of the Administrative Procedure Act, no notice of proposed
rulemaking or public procedure is necessary. For the same reason, a delayed effective date is both impracticable
and contrary to the public interest. 


Drafting Information 


The principal author of this amendment was Peter T. Lynch, Regulations Branch, Office of Regulations and Rulings,
U.S. Customs Service. However, personnel from other offices participated in its development.

Limitation on Annual Compensation for Qualified Plans 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Internal Revenue Service (IRS), Treasury.

 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final regulations. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document contains final regulations relating to 
the compensation limit for tax-qualified retirement plans under 
section 401(a)(17) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. These 
regulations reflect changes made by the Tax Reform Act of 1986, 
the Technical and Miscellaneous Revenue Act of 1988, and the 
Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993. These regulations 
provide guidance necessary to comply with the law and affect 
sponsors of, and participants in, tax-qualified retirement plans.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Background 


On September 19, 1991, final regulations under section 
401(a)(17) (TD 8362) were published in the 

Federal Register

 (56 
FR 47603). On August 10, 1992, the IRS published in the Federal 
Register (57 FR 35536) regulations proposing to extend the 
effective date of the final regulations under section 401(a)(17) 
(and related regulations), generally to plan years beginning on 
or after January 1, 1994. 
On December 30, 1993, proposed regulations under section 
401(a)(17) amending the final regulations were published in the 


Federal Register

 (58 FR 69302). Written comments were received 
from the public on the proposed regulations. Because the only 
request for a public hearing was withdrawn, no public hearing was 
held. After considering all of the written comments received, 
the proposed regulations are adopted as modified by this Treasury 
decision. 


Statutory Authority 


This document contains amendments to the Income Tax 
Regulations (26 CFR Part 1) under section 401(a)(17) of the 
Internal Revenue Code (Code). These regulations reflect the 
enactment of section 401(a)(17) by section 1106 of the Tax Reform 
Act of 1986 (TRA '86), and subsequent statutory changes made by 
section 1011(d)(4) of the Technical and Miscellaneous Revenue Act 
of 1988 (TAMRA) and section 13212 of the Omnibus Budget 
Reconciliation Act of 1993 (OBRA '93). These regulations are 
issued under the authority contained in section 7805 of the Code. 


Explanation of Provisions 


1. Overview 


Section 401(a)(17) of the Code provides an annual 
compensation limit for each employee under a qualified plan. 
This limit applies to a plan in two ways. First, a plan may not 
base contributions or benefits on compensation in excess of the 
annual limit. Thus, a plan does not satisfy section 401(a)(17) 
unless it provides that an employee's compensation in excess of 
the annual limit is not used in determining allocations or 
accruals for a plan year to which the annual limit applies. 
Second, the amount of an employee's annual compensation that may 
be taken into account in applying certain specified 
nondiscrimination rules under the Code is subject to the annual 
compensation limit. Thus, for example, an employee's 
compensation in excess of the annual limit is disregarded in 
determining the accrual rates for defined benefit plans under 
those nondiscrimination rules. The annual compensation limit 
applies separately to each group of plans that is treated as a 
single plan for purposes of the applicable nondiscrimination 
requirement.

<PARENT> FR940627-0-00011 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

These final regulations adopt the provisions of the proposed regulations with only minor modifications, as described
below.



2. Changes Made by OBRA '93 


a. Lower Limit 


Prior to its amendment by OBRA '93, the annual compensation limit was $200,000 adjusted for cost of living increases
($235,840 for 1993). Section 401(a)(17) was amended by OBRA '93 to reduce the annual compensation limit to $150,000
and to modify the manner in which cost of living adjustments are made to the limit. 



b. Annual Adjustment of Compensation Limit 



Prior to the effective date of the OBRA '93 changes, the annual compensation limit was increased annually based on
the section 415 cost of living adjustment. After the effective date of OBRA '93, the annual compensation limit, as
adjusted for changes in the cost of living, is rounded down to the next lowest multiple of $10,000. Thus, the annual
compensation limit increases only when the cost of living adjustment would increase the limit by an increment of at
least $10,000. These final regulations retain the rules in the September 1991 regulations that any increase in the
limit is effective for the plan year, or other 12-month period used to determine compensation, commencing in the calendar
year for which the limit is adjusted and that the increase applies only to compensation for the year of the increase
and subsequent years that are used in determining an employee's benefit. 



c. Proration of the Limit 



These regulations retain the requirement in the September 1991 regulations that the annual compensation limit must
be prorated if compensation for a period of less than 12 months is used for a plan year. However, in response to comments
on the proposed regulations, the final regulations clarify that no proration is required merely because the amount
of elective contributions, matching contributions, or employee contributions that is contributed for each pay
period during a plan year is determined separately using compensation for that pay period. For example, a section
401(k) plan provides each employee with the right to elect to defer up to 6 percent of compensation for a plan year, and
then, in accordance with each employee's election for the plan year, contributions are made monthly using the employee's
compensation for that pay period. Although the compensation for the plan year that may be taken into account in determining
each employee's elective contributions is subject to the annual compensation limit, the compensation for each month
would not required to be limited to $12,500 (1/12 of $150,000) in this situation. 



3. Effective Date and Transition Rules 



Section 401(a)(17) is generally effective for plan years beginning on or after January 1, 1989. The changes made by
OBRA '93 are generally effective for plan years beginning on or after January 1, 1994. Special statutory effective
dates are provided for collectively bargained plans. In addition, OBRA '93 provides a special grandfather rule for
certain eligible participants in governmental plans. 

These regulations under section 401(a)(17) are generally effective at the same time that the reduced limit under
OBRA '93 applies to the plan. However, in the case of plans maintained by tax-exempt organizations, the regulations
are effective for plan years beginning on or after January 1, 1996. 

Minor modifications have been made to the examples in these regulations to reflect the OBRA '93 statutory change,
the change in the effective date of the regulations from the date in the 1991 regulations, and an employer's choice
of complying with the provisions of these regulations prior to the effective date. 



a. Fresh-Start Rules 



The regulations retain the rule from the September 1991 regulations that benefits accrued or allocations made under
a plan for plan years prior to the effective date of section 401(a)(17) are not subject to the annual compensation limit.
The regulations also retain the rule in the proposed regulations that the benefits accrued or allocations made under
a plan for plan years prior to the effective date of the OBRA '93 changes are not subject to the reduced annual compensation
limit. 

In order to satisfy the requirements of section 401(a)(17), a defined benefit plan must ``fresh start'' the benefits
of all employees with accrued benefits that are based on compensation that exceeded the annual compensation limit.
In order to implement the reduced limit under OBRA '93, a defined benefit plan must again ``fresh start'' the benefits
of all employees with accrued benefits that are based on compensation that exceeded the OBRA '93 $150,000 compensation
limit. 

As in the proposed regulations, these final regulations provide guidance on the implementation of these and other
multiple fresh starts and coordinate the regulations with the fresh-start rules of the section 401(a)(4) regulations.
For example, the regulations continue to cross-reference the section 401(a)(4) regulations for the definition
of an employee's frozen accrued benefit. Thus, an employee's frozen accrued benefit as of the OBRA '93 effective date
includes benefits accrued as a result of an amendment made within the TRA '86 remedial amendment period that is recognized
under section 401(b) as effective before the OBRA '93 effective date. 



b. Amendments to Comply With Section 401(a)(17) 



In conjunction with publishing these regulations under section 401(a)(17), the IRS issued Rev. Proc. 94-13,
1994-3 I.R.B. 18, dated January 18, 1994. Rev. Proc. 94-13 provides guidance on the remedial amendment
treatment for plans being amended for section 401(a)(17), including guidance on the conditions under which a plan
may be amended to comply retroactively with section 401(a)(17) even if the amendment results in a reduction of a benefit
protected under section 411(d)(6). Rev. Proc. 94-13 also provides guidance on the extent to which section 204(h)
of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) will not apply to a plan amendment that limits an employee's
compensation taken into account under the plan to the maximum permitted under section 401(a)(17) of the Code.

Commentators requested that this guidance be incorporated into the final regulations. The IRS and the Treasury believe
these issues are appropriately addressed in Rev. Proc. 94-13. The guidance under section 411(d)(6) in Rev.
Proc. 94-13 is provided pursuant to the specific delegation of authority in  1.411(d)-4, Q&A-2(b)
to the Commissioner to provide, through the publication of revenue rulings, notices, and other documents of general
applicability, for the elimination or reduction of section 411(d)(6) protected benefits to the extent that the reduction
is necessary to permit compliance with the other requirements of section 401(a). The guidance under section 204(h)
of ERISA is provided pursuant to the delegation of authority to the IRS under section 101(a) of Reorganization Plan
No. 4 of 1978 (1979-1 C.B. 480) to issue regulations, rulings, opinions, variances, and waivers under section
204 of ERISA. 




c. Application of $150,000 Limit to Accruals or Allocations in Plan Years for Which OBRA '93 is Effective 



One commentator suggested that the reduced limit should not apply to compensation for years beginning before the
OBRA '93 effective date that is used in determining post-effective date benefit accruals. The regulations, however,
continue to provide that benefits accruing, or allocations made, for plan years beginning on or after the OBRA '93
effective date may not take into account compensation for any year in excess of the OBRA '93 annual compensation limit
applicable to that year (generally $150,000 for years beginning before the OBRA '93 effective date). Thus, compensation
for any plan year before OBRA '93 applies to the plan that is used to determine benefits accruing in plan years beginning
on or after the OBRA '93 effective date is generally limited to $150,000. In the absence of this rule, post-effective
date accruals under many defined benefit plans would be determined taking into account compensation in excess of
$150,000. For example, this happens when a defined benefit plan determines annual accruals as a percentage of each
employee's highest average annual compensation for a specified number of years (including years prior to the effective
date of OBRA '93). 



d. Collectively Bargained Plans 


TRA '86 and OBRA '93 provide a deferred effective date for collectively bargained plans. In response to comments,
these regulations clarify that the rules of  1.410(b)-10(a)(2) apply for purposes of determining whether
a plan is a collectively bargained plan. Thus, if a plan is a collectively bargained plan (within the meaning of  1.410(b)-10(a)(2)(iii)),
the deferred effective date applies in determining the plan allocations or benefit accruals of both collectively
bargained and noncollectively bargained employees. 



e. Governmental Plans 



These final regulations retain the special effective date for governmental plans (within the meaning of section
414(d)) in order to provide governmental employers with adequate time to amend their plans to comply with section
401(a)(17). Thus, the regulations provide that these governmental plans will automatically satisfy the requirements
of section 401(a)(17) for plan years beginning before the later of January 1, 1996, or 90 days after the opening of the
first legislative session beginning on or after January 1, 1996, of the governing body with authority to amend the
plan, if that body does not meet continuously. 

The final regulations continue to implement the grandfather rule in OBRA '93 for individuals who first became participants
in governmental plans before the first plan year beginning after December 31, 1995 or, if earlier, the first plan year
for which the plan is amended to comply with OBRA '93. Under the grandfather rule, the annual compensation limit will
not apply for those individuals to the extent that the limit would reduce the amount of compensation taken into account
under the plan below the amount that was allowed to be taken into account under the plan as in effect on July 1, 1993. However,
in order for this grandfather rule to apply to a plan, the plan must be amended, effective for plan years beginning after
December 31, 1995, to incorporate by reference the annual compensation limits of section 401(a)(17) for those participants
who are not grandfathered under OBRA '93. 



f. Good Faith Compliance Prior to the Regulatory Effective Date 



For plan years beginning on or after the date that section 401(a)(17) first applies to a plan, but before these regulations
apply to the plan, the plan must be operated in accordance with a reasonable, good faith interpretation of the requirements
of section 401(a)(17). Whether compliance is reasonable and in good faith will be determined on the basis of all of
the relevant facts and circumstances, including the extent to which the employer has resolved unclear issues in its
favor. Reasonable, good faith interpretation will be deemed to exist, however, if a plan is operated in accordance
with the 1990 regulations, the September 1991 regulations, the December 1993 regulations, or these regulations.
However, for any plan with a regulatory effective date that is later than the OBRA '93 effective date for the plan (e.g.,
a plan maintained by a tax-exempt organization), a reasonable, good faith interpretation must reflect the OBRA '93
amendments to section 401(a)(17). 



Special Analyses 



It has been determined that this Treasury decision is not a significant regulatory action as defined in EO 12866. Therefore,
a regulatory assessment is not required. It also has been determined that section 553(b) of the Administrative Procedure
Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 5) and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 6) do not apply to these regulations,
and, therefore, a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is not required. Pursuant to section 7805(f) of the Internal Revenue
Code, the notice of proposed rulemaking preceding these regulations was submitted to the Small Business Administration
for comment on its impact on small business. 



Drafting Information 



The principal author of these final regulations is Marjorie Hoffman of the Office of the Associate Chief Counsel (Employee
Benefits and Exempt Organizations), IRS. However, other personnel from the IRS and Treasury Department participated
in their development.

Paragraph 1. The authority citation for part 1 continues to 
read, in part, as follows:

 



Authority:

 26 U.S.C. 7805 * * *

 



Par. 2.

 Section 1.401(a)(17)-1 is revised to read as 
follows: 


 1.401(a)(17)-1 

Limitation on annual compensation. 


(a) 

Compensation limit requirement

_(1) 

In general.

 In 
order to be a qualified plan, a plan must satisfy section 
401(a)(17). Section 401(a)(17) provides an annual compensation 
limit for each employee under a qualified plan. This limit 
applies to a qualified plan in two ways. First, a plan may not 
base allocations, in the case of a defined contribution plan, or 
benefit accruals, in the case of a defined benefit plan, on 
compensation in excess of the annual compensation limit. Second, 
the amount of an employee's annual compensation that may be taken 
into account in applying certain specified nondiscrimination 
rules under the Internal Revenue Code is subject to the annual 
compensation limit. These two limitations are set forth in 
paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, respectively. Paragraph 
(d) of this section provides the effective dates of section 
401(a)(17), the amendments made by section 13212 of the Omnibus 
Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (OBRA '93), and this section. 
Paragraph (e) of this section provides rules for determining 
post-effective-date accrued benefits under the fresh-start rules. 

(2) 

Annual compensation limit for plan years beginning 
before January 1, 1994.

 For purposes of this section, for plan 
years beginning prior to the OBRA '93 effective date, annual 
compensation limit means $200,000, adjusted as provided by the 
Commissioner. The amount of the annual compensation limit is 
adjusted at the same time and in the same manner as under section 
415(d). The base period for the annual adjustment is the 
calendar quarter ending December 31, 1988, and the first 
adjustment is effective on January 1, 1990. Any increase in the 
annual compensation limit is effective as of January 1 of a 
calendar year and applies to any plan year beginning in that 
calendar year. In any plan year beginning prior to the OBRA '93 
effective date, if compensation for any plan year beginning prior 
to the statutory effective date is used for determining 
allocations or benefit accruals, or when applying any 
nondiscrimination rule, then the annual compensation limit for 
the first plan year beginning on or after the statutory effective 
date (generally $200,000) must be applied to compensation for 
that prior plan year. 
(3) 

Annual compensation limit for plan years beginning on or 
after January 1, 1994

_(i) 

In general.

 For purposes of this 
section, for plan years beginning on or after the 
OBRA '93 effective date, annual compensation limit means 
$150,000, adjusted as provided by the Commissioner. The adjusted 
dollar amount of the annual compensation limit is determined by 
adjusting the $150,000 amount for changes in the cost of living 
as provided in paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of this section and rounding 
this adjusted dollar amount as provided in paragraph (a)(3)(iii) 
of this section. Any increase in the annual compensation limit 
is effective as of January 1 of a calendar year and applies to 
any plan year beginning in that calendar year. For example, if a 
plan has a plan year beginning July 1, 1994, and ending June 30, 
1995, the annual compensation limit in effect on January 1, 1994 
($150,000), applies to the plan for the entire plan year. 
(ii) 

Cost of living adjustment.

 The $150,000 amount is 
adjusted for changes in the cost of living by the Commissioner at 
the same time and in the same manner as under 
section 415(d). The base period for the annual adjustment is the 
calendar quarter ending December 31, 1993. 
(iii) 

Rounding of adjusted compensation limit.

 After the 
$150,000, adjusted in accordance with paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of 
this section, exceeds the annual compensation limit for the prior 
calendar year by $10,000 or more, the annual compensation limit 
will be increased by the amount of such excess, rounded down to 
the next lowest multiple of $10,000. 
(4) 

Additional guidance.

 The Commissioner may, in revenue 
rulings and procedures, notices, and other guidance, published in 
the Internal Revenue Bulletin (see  601.601(d)(2)(ii)(

b

) of this 
chapter), provide any additional guidance that may be necessary 
or appropriate concerning the annual limits on compensation under 
section 401(a)(17).

(b) 

Plan limit on compensation

_(1) 

General rule.

 A plan 
does not satisfy section 401(a)(17) unless it provides that the 
compensation taken into account for any employee in determining 
plan allocations or benefit accruals for any plan year is limited 
to the annual compensation limit. For purposes of this rule, 
allocations and benefit accruals under a plan include all 
benefits provided under the plan, including ancillary benefits. 
(2) 

Plan-year-by-plan-year requirement.

 For purposes of 
this paragraph (b), the limit in effect for the current plan year 
applies only to the compensation for that year that is taken into 
account in determining plan allocations or benefit accruals for 
the year. The compensation for any prior plan year taken into 
account in determining an employee's allocations or benefit 
accruals for the current plan year is subject to the applicable 
annual compensation limit in effect for that prior year. Thus, 
increases in the annual compensation limit apply only to 
compensation taken into account for the plan year in which the 
increase is effective. In addition, if compensation for any plan 
year beginning prior to the OBRA '93 effective date is used for 
determining allocations or benefit accruals in a plan year 
beginning on or after the OBRA '93 effective date, then the 
annual compensation limit for that prior year is the annual 
compensation limit in effect for the first plan year beginning on 
or after the OBRA '93 effective date (generally $150,000). 
(3) 

Application of limit to a plan year

_(i) 

In general.

 For purposes of applying this paragraph (b), the annual 
compensation limit is applied to the compensation for the plan 
year on which allocations or benefit accruals are based. 
(ii) 

Compensation for the plan year.

 If a plan determines 
compensation used in determining allocations or benefit accruals 
for a plan year based on compensation for the plan year, then the 
annual compensation limit that applies to the compensation for 
the plan year is the limit in effect for the calendar year in 
which the plan year begins. Alternatively, if a plan determines 
compensation used in determining allocations or benefit accruals 
for the plan year on the basis of compensation for a 12-consecutive-month period, or periods, ending no later than
the 
last day of the plan year, then the annual compensation limit 
applies to compensation for each of those periods based on the 
annual compensation limit in effect for the respective calendar 
year in which each 12-month period begins. 
(iii) 

Compensation for a period of less than 12-months

_(A) 


Proration required.

 If compensation for a period of less than 12 
months is used for a plan year, then the otherwise applicable 
annual compensation limit is reduced in the same proportion as 
the reduction in the 12-month period. For example, if a defined 
benefit plan provides that the accrual for each month in a plan 
year is separately determined based on the compensation for that 
month and the plan year accrual is the sum of the accruals for 
all months, then the annual compensation limit for each month is 
1/12th of the annual compensation limit for the plan year. In 
addition, if the period for determining compensation used in 
calculating an employee's allocation or accrual for a plan year 
is a short plan year (i.e., shorter than 12 months), the annual 
compensation limit is an amount equal to the otherwise applicable 
annual compensation limit multiplied by a fraction, the numerator 
of which is the number of months in the short plan year, and the 
denominator of which is 12. 
(B) 

No proration required for participation for less than a 
full plan year.

 Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(A) of this 
section, a plan is not treated as using compensation for less 
than 12 months for a plan year merely because the plan formula 
provides that the allocation or accrual for each employee is 
based on compensation for the portion of the plan year during 
which the employee is a participant in the plan. In addition, no 
proration is required merely because an employee is covered under 
a plan for less than a full plan year, provided that allocations 
or benefit accruals are otherwise determined using compensation 
for a period of at least 12 months. Finally, notwithstanding 
paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(A) of this section, no proration is 
required merely because the amount of elective contributions 
(within the meaning of  1.401(k)-1(g)(3)), matching contributions 
(within the meaning of  1.401(m)-1(f)(12)), or employee 
contributions (within the meaning of  1.401(m)-1(f)(6)) that is 
contributed for each pay period during a plan year is determined 
separately using compensation for that pay period. 
(4) 

Limits on multiple employer and multiemployer plans.

 For purposes of this paragraph (b), in the case of a plan 
described in section 413(c) or 414(f) (a plan maintained by more 
than one employer), the annual compensation limit applies 
separately with respect to the compensation of an employee from 
each employer maintaining the plan instead of applying to the 
employee's total compensation from all employers maintaining the 
plan. 
(5) 

Family aggregation.

 [Reserved] 
(6) 

Examples

. The following examples illustrate the rules 
in this paragraph (b).

 



Example 1.

 Plan X is a defined benefit plan with a calendar 
year plan year and bases benefits on the average of an employee's 
high 3 consecutive years' compensation. The OBRA '93 effective 
date for Plan X is January 1, 1994. Employee A's high 3 
consecutive years' compensation prior to the application of the 
annual compensation limits is $160,000 (1994), $155,000 (1993), 
and $135,000 (1992). To satisfy this paragraph (b), Plan X 
cannot base plan benefits for Employee A in 1994 on compensation 
in excess of $145,000 (the average of $150,000 (A's 1994 
compensation capped by the annual compensation limit), $150,000 
(A's 1993 compensation capped by the $150,000 annual compensation 
limit applicable to all years before 1994), and $135,000 (A's 
1992 compensation capped by the $150,000 annual compensation 
limit applicable to all years before 1994)). For purposes of 
determining the 1994 accrual, each year (1994, 1993, and 1992), 
not the average of the 3 years, is subject to the 1994 annual 
compensation limit of $150,000. 


Example 2.

 Assume the same facts as Example 1, except that 
Employee A's high 3 consecutive years' compensation prior to the 
application of the limits is $185,000 (1997), $175,000 (1996), 
and $165,000 (1995). Assume that the annual compensation limit 
is first adjusted to $160,000 for plan years beginning on or 
after January 1, 1997. Plan X cannot base plan benefits for 
Employee A in 1997 on compensation in excess of $153,333 (the 
average of $160,000 (A's 1997 compensation capped by the 1997 
limit), $150,000 (A's 1996 compensation capped by the 1996 
limit), and $150,000 (A's 1995 compensation capped by the 1995 
limit)). 
Example 3. Plan Y is a defined benefit plan that bases 
benefits on an employee's high consecutive 36 months of 
compensation ending within the plan year. Employee B's high 36 
months are the period September 1995 to August 1998, in which 
Employee B earned $50,000 in each month. Assume that the annual 
compensation limit is first adjusted to $160,000 for plan years 
beginning on or after January 1, 1997. The annual compensation 
limit is $150,000, $150,000, and $160,000 in 1995, 1996, and 
1997, respectively. To satisfy this paragraph (b), Plan Y cannot 
base Employee B's plan benefits for the 1998 plan year on 
compensation in excess of $153,333. This amount is determined by 
applying the applicable annual compensation limit to compensation 
for each of the three 12-consecutive-month periods. The 
September 1995 to August 1996 period is capped by the annual 
compensation limit of $150,000 for 1995; the September 1996 to 
August 1997 period is capped by the annual compensation limit of 
$150,000 for 1996; and the September 1997 to August 1998 period 
is capped by the annual compensation limit of $160,000 for 1997. 
The average of these capped amounts is the annual compensation 
limit applicable in determining benefits for the 1998 year.

Example 4. 

(a) Employer P is a partnership. Employer P 
maintains Plan Z, a profit-sharing plan that provides for an 
annual allocation of employer contributions of 15 percent of plan 
year compensation for employees other than self-employed 
individuals, and 13.0435 percent of plan year compensation for 
self-employed individuals. The plan year of Plan Z is the 
calendar year. The OBRA '93 effective date for Plan Z is January 
1, 1994. In order to satisfy section 401(a)(17), as amended by 
OBRA '93, the plan provides that, beginning with the 1994 plan 
year, the plan year compensation used in determining the 
allocation of employer contributions for each employee may not 
exceed the annual limit in effect for the plan year under OBRA 
'93. Plan Z defines compensation for self-employed individuals 
(employees within the meaning of section 401(c)(1)) as the self-
employed individual's net profit from self-employment 
attributable to Employer P minus the amount of the self-employed 
individual's deduction under section 164(f) for one-half of self-
employment taxes. Plan Z defines compensation for all other 
employees as wages within the meaning of section 3401(a). 
Employee C and Employee D are partners of Employer P and thus are 
self-employed individuals. Neither Employee C nor Employee D 
owns an interest in any other business or is a common-law 
employee in any business. For the 1994 calendar year, Employee C 
has net profit from self-employment of $80,000, and Employee D 
has net profit from self-employment of $175,000. The deduction 
for Employee C under section 164(f) for one-half of self-
employment taxes is $4,828. The deduction for Employee D under 
section 164(f) for one-half of self-employment taxes is $6,101 

(b) The plan year compensation under the plan formula for 
Employee C is $75,172 ($80,000 minus $4,828). The allocation of 
employer contributions under the plan allocation formula for 1994 
for Employee C is $9,805 ($75,172 (Employee C's plan year 
compensation for 1994) multiplied by 13.0435%). The plan year 
compensation under the plan formula before application of the 
annual limit under section 401(a)(17) for Employee D is $168,899 
($175,000 minus $6101). After application of the annual limit, 
the plan year compensation for the 1994 plan year for Employee D 
is $150,000 (the annual limit for 1994). Therefore, the 
allocation of employer contributions under the plan allocation 
formula for 1994 for Employee D is $19,565 ($150,000 (Employee 
D's plan year compensation after application of the annual limit 
for 1994) multiplied by 13.0435%). 



Example 5. 

The facts are the same as in 

Example 4

, except 
that Plan Z provides that plan year compensation for self-employed individuals is defined as earned income within
the 
meaning of section 401(c)(2) attributable to Employer P. In 
addition, Plan Z provides for an annual allocation of employer 
contributions of 15 percent of plan year compensation for all 
employees in the plan, including self-employed individuals, such 
as Employees C and D. The net profit from self-employment for 
Employee C and the net profit from self-employment for Employee D 
are the same as provided in 

Example 4

. However, the earned 
income of Employee C determined in accordance with section 
401(c)(2) is $65,367 ($80,000 minus $4,828 minus $9,805). The 
earned income of Employee D determined in accordance with section 
401(c)(2) is $146,869 ($175,000 minus $6,101 minus $22,030). 
Therefore, the allocation of employer contributions under the 
plan allocation formula for 1994 for Employee C is $9,805 
($65,367 (Employee C's plan year compensation for 1994) 
multiplied by 15%). Employee D's earned income for 1994 does not 
exceed the 1994 annual limit of $150,000. Therefore, the 
allocation of employer contributions under the plan allocation 
formula for 1994 for Employee D is $22,030 ($146,869 (Employee 
D's plan year compensation for 1994) multiplied by 15%).




(c) 

Limit on compensation for nondiscrimination rules

_(1) 


General rule. 

The annual compensation limit applies for purposes 
of applying the nondiscrimination rules under sections 401(a)(4), 
401(a)(5), 401(l), 401(k)(3), 401(m)(2), 403(b)(12), 404(a)(2) 
and 410(b)(2). The annual compensation limit also applies in 
determining whether an alternative method of determining 
compensation impermissibly discriminates under section 414(s)(3). 
Thus, for example, the annual compensation limit applies when 
determining a self-employed individual's total earned income that 
is used to determine the equivalent alternative compensation 
amount under  1.414(s)-1(g)(1). This paragraph (c) provides 
rules for applying the annual compensation limit for these 
purposes. For purposes of this paragraph (c), compensation means 
the compensation used in applying the applicable 
nondiscrimination rule. 

(2) 

Plan-year-by-plan-year requirement. 

For purposes of 
this paragraph (c), when applying an applicable nondiscrimination 
rule for a plan year, the compensation for each plan year taken 
into account is limited to the applicable annual compensation 
limit in effect for that year, and an employee's compensation for 
that plan year in excess of the limit is disregarded. Thus, if 
the nondiscrimination provision is applied on the basis of 
compensation determined over a period of more than one year (for 
example, average annual compensation), the annual compensation 
limit in effect for each of the plan years that is taken into 
account in determining the average applies to the respective plan 
year's compensation. In addition, if compensation for any plan 
year beginning prior to the OBRA '93 effective date is used when 
applying any nondiscrimination rule in a plan year beginning on 
or after the OBRA '93 effective date, then the annual 
compensation limit for that prior year is the annual compensation 
limit for the first plan year beginning on or after the OBRA '93 
effective date (generally $150,000). 

(3) 

Plan-by-plan limit. 

For purposes of this paragraph (c), 
the annual compensation limit applies separately to each plan (or 
group of plans treated as a single plan) of an employer for 
purposes of the applicable nondiscrimination requirement. For 
this purpose, the plans included in the testing group taken into 
account in determining whether the average benefit percentage 
test of  1.410(b)-5 is satisfied are generally treated as a 
single plan. 

(4) 

Application of limit to a plan year. 

The rules provided 
in paragraph (b)(3) of this section regarding the application of 
the limit to a plan year apply for purposes of this paragraph 
(c). 

(5) 

Limits on multiple employer and multiemployer plans. 


The rule provided in paragraph (b)(4) of this section regarding 
the application of the limit to multiple employer and 
multiemployer plans applies for purposes of this paragraph (c). 
(d) 

Effective date

_(1) 

Statutory effective date

_(i) 


General rule. 

Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph 
(d), section 401(a)(17) applies to a plan as of the first plan 
year beginning on or after January 1, 1989. For purposes of this 
section, statutory effective date generally means the first day 
of the first plan year that section 401(a)(17) is applicable to a 
plan. In the case of governmental plans, statutory effective 
date means the first day of the first plan year for which the 
plan is not deemed to satisfy section 401(a)(17) by reason of 
paragraph (d)(4) of this section.

(ii) 

Exception for collectively bargained plans

. In the case of a plan maintained pursuant to one or more collective bargaining agreements between employee representatives
and one or more employers ratified before March 1, 1986, section 401(a)(17) applies to allocations and benefit accruals
for plan years beginning on or after the earlier of_


(A) January 1, 1991; or 

(B) The later of January 1, 1989, or the date on which the last of the collective bargaining agreements terminates (determined
without regard to any extension or renegotiation of any agreement occurring after February 28, 1986). For purposes
of this paragraph (d)(1)(ii), the rules of  1.410(b)-10(a)(2) apply for purposes of determining whether
a plan is maintained pursuant to one or more collective bargaining agreements, and any extension or renegotiation
of a collective bargaining agreement, which extension or renegotiation is ratified after February 28, 1986, is to
be disregarded in determining the date on which the agreement terminates. 

(2) 

OBRA '93 effective date

_(i) 

In general

. For purposes of this section, OBRA '93 effective date means the first day of the first plan year beginning on or after
January 1, 1994, except as provided in this paragraph (d)(2). 

(ii) 

Exception for collectively bargained plans

_(A) 

In general

. In the case of a plan maintained pursuant to one or more collective bargaining agreements between employee representatives
and 1 or more employers ratified before August 10, 1993, OBRA '93 effective date means the first day of the first plan
year beginning on or after the earlier of_


(

1

) The latest of_


(

i

) January 1, 1994; 

(

ii

) The date on which the last of such collective bargaining agreements terminates (without regard to any extension,
amendment, or, modification of such agreements on or after August 10, 1993); or 

(

iii

) In the case of a plan maintained pursuant to collective bargaining under the Railway Labor Act, the date of execution
of an extension or replacement of the last of such collective bargaining agreements in effect on August 10, 1993; or


(

2

) January 1, 1997. 

(B) 

Determination of whether plan is collectively bargained

. For purposes of this paragraph (d)(2)(ii), the rules of  1.410(b)-10(a)(2) apply for purposes of determining
whether a plan is maintained pursuant to one or more collective bargaining agreements, except that August 10, 1993,
is substituted for March 1, 1986, as the date before which the collective bargaining agreements must be ratified.


(3) 

Regulatory effective date

. This  1.401(a)(17)-1 applies to plan years beginning on or after the OBRA '93 effective date. However,
in the case of a plan maintained by an organization that is exempt from income taxation under section 501(a), including
plans subject to section 403(b)(12)(A)(i) (nonelective plans), this  1.401(a)(17)-1 applies to plan
years beginning on or after January 1, 1996. For plan years beginning before the effective date of these regulations
and on or after the statutory effective date, a plan must be operated in accordance with a reasonable, good faith interpretation
of section 401(a)(17), taking into account, if applicable, the OBRA '93 reduction to the annual compensation limit
under section 401(a)(17). 

(4) 

Special rules for governmental plans

_(i) 

Deemed satisfaction by governmental plans

. In the case of governmental plans described in section 414(d), including plans subject to section 403(b)(12)(A)(i)
(nonelective plans), section 401(a)(17) is considered satisfied for plan years beginning before the later of January
1, 1996, or 90 days after the opening of the first legislative session beginning on or after January 1, 1996, of the governing
body with authority to amend the plan, if that body does not meet continuously. For purposes of this paragraph (d)(4),
the term governing body with authority to amend the plan means the legislature, board, commission, council, or other
governing body with authority to amend the plan. 

(ii) 

Transition rule for governmental plans

_(A) 

In general

. In the case of an eligible participant in a governmental plan (within the meaning of section 414(d)), the annual compensation
limit under this section shall not apply to the extent that the application of the limitation would reduce the amount
of compensation that is allowed to be taken into account under the plan below the amount that was allowed to be taken
into account under the plan as in effect on July 1, 1993. Thus, for example, if a plan as in effect on July 1, 1993, determined
benefits without any reference to a limit on compensation, then the annual compensation limit in effect under this
section will not apply to any eligible participant in any future year. 

(B) 

Eligible participant

. For purposes of this paragraph (d)(4)(ii), an eligible participant is an individual who first became a participant
in the plan prior to the first day of the first plan year beginning after the earlier of_


(

1

) The last day of the plan year by which a plan amendment to reflect the amendments made by section 13212 of OBRA '93 is
both adopted and effective; or 

(

2

) December 31, 1995. 

(C) 

Plan must be amended to incorporate limits

. This paragraph (d)(4)(ii) shall not apply to any eligible participant in a plan unless the plan is amended so that
the plan incorporates by reference the annual compensation limit under section 401(a)(17), effective with respect
to noneligible participants for plan years beginning after December 31, 1995 (or earlier, if the plan amendment so
provides).

(5) 

Benefits earned prior to effective date

_(i) 

In general

. Allocations under a defined contribution plan or benefits accrued under a defined benefit plan for plan years beginning
before the statutory effective date are not subject to the annual compensation limit. Allocations under a defined
contribution plan or benefits accrued under a defined benefit plan for plan years beginning on or after the statutory
effective date, but before the OBRA '93 effective date, are subject to the annual compensation limit under paragraph
(a)(2) of this section. However, these allocations or accruals are not subject to the OBRA '93 reduction to the annual
compensation limit described in paragraph (a)(3) of this section. 

(ii) 

Allocation for a plan year

. The allocations for a plan year include amounts described in  1.401(a)(4)-2(c)(ii) or  1.401(m)-1(f)(6)
plus the earnings, expenses, gains, and losses attributable to those amounts. 

(iii) 

Benefits accrued for years before the effective date

. The benefits accrued for plan years prior to a specified date by any employee are the employee's benefits accrued
under the plan, determined as if those benefits had been frozen (as defined in  1.401(a)(4)-13(c)(3)(i))
as of the day immediately preceding such specified date. Thus, for example, benefits accrued for those plan years
generally do not include any benefits accrued under an amendment increasing prior benefits that is adopted after
the date on which the employee's benefits under the plan must be treated as frozen. 

(e) 

Determination of post-effective-date accrued benefits

_(1) 

In general

. The plan formula that is used to determine the amount of allocations or benefit accruals for plan years beginning
on or after the dates described in paragraph (d)(1) or (2) must comply with section 401(a)(17) as in effect on such date.
This paragraph (e) provides rules for applying section 401(a)(17) in the case of section 401(a)(17) employees who
accrue additional benefits under a defined benefit plan in a plan year beginning on or after the relevant effective
date. Paragraph (e)(2) of this section contains definitions used in applying these rules. Paragraphs (e)(3) and
(e)(4) of this section explain the application of the fresh-start rules in  1.401(a)(4)-13 to the determination
of the accrued benefits of section 401(a)(17) employees. 

(2) 

Definitions

. For purposes of this paragraph (e), the following definitions apply: 

(i) 

Section 401(a)(17) employee

. An employee is a section 401(a)(17) employee as of a date, on or after the statutory effective date, if the employee's
current accrued benefit as of that date is based on compensation for a year prior to the statutory effective date that
exceeded the annual compensation limit for the first plan year beginning on or after the statutory effective date.
In addition, an employee is a section 401(a)(17) employee as of a date, on or after the OBRA '93 effective date, if the
employee's current accrued benefit as of that date is based on compensation for a year prior to the OBRA '93 effective
date that exceeded the annual compensation limit for the first plan year beginning on or after the OBRA '93 effective
date. For this purpose, a current accrued benefit is not treated as based on compensation that exceeded the relevant
annual compensation limit, if a plan makes a fresh start using the formula with wear-away described in  1.401(a)(4)-13(c)(4)(ii),
and the employee's accrued benefit determined under  1.401(a)(4)-13(c)(4)(ii)(B), taking into account
the annual compensation limit, exceeds the employee's frozen accrued benefit (or, if applicable, the employee's
adjusted accrued benefit) as of the fresh-start date. 

(ii) 

Section 401(a)(17) fresh-start date

. Section 401(a)(17) fresh-start date means a fresh-start date as defined in  1.401(a)(4)-12 not earlier
than the last day of the last plan year beginning before the statutory effective date, and not later than the last day
of the last plan year beginning before the effective date of these regulations. 

(iii) 

OBRA '93 fresh-start date

. OBRA '93 fresh-start date means a fresh-start date as defined in  1.401(a)(4)-12 not earlier than the
last day of the last plan year beginning before the OBRA '93 effective date, and not later than the last day of the last
plan year beginning before the effective date of these regulations. 

(iv) 

Section 401(a)(17) frozen accrued benefit

. Section 401(a)(17) frozen accrued benefit means the accrued benefit for any section 401(a)(17) employee frozen
(as defined in  1.401(a)(4)-13(c)(3)(i)) as of the last day of the last plan year beginning before the
statutory effective date.

<PARENT> FR940627-0-00011 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(v) 

OBRA '93 frozen accrued benefit. 

OBRA '93 frozen accrued benefit means the accrued benefit for any section 401(a)(17) employee frozen (as defined
in  1.401(a)(4)-13(c)(3)(i)) as of the OBRA '93 fresh-start date.

(3) 

Application of fresh-start rules

_(i) 

General rule. 

In order to satisfy section 401(a)(17), a defined benefit plan must determine the accrued benefit of each section
401(a)(17) employee by applying the fresh-start rules in  1.401(a)(4)-13(c). The fresh-start rules
must be applied using a section 401(a)(17) fresh-start date and using the plan benefit formula, after amendment to
comply with section 401(a)(17) and this section, as the formula applicable to benefit accruals in the current plan
year. In addition, the fresh-start rules must be applied to determine the accrued benefit of each section 401(a)(17)
employee using an OBRA '93 fresh-start date and using the plan benefit formula, after amendment to comply with the
reduction in the section 401(a)(17) annual compensation limit described in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, as
the formula applicable to benefit accruals in the current plan year.

(ii) 

Consistency rules in  1.401(a)(4)-13(c) and (d)

_(A) 

General rule. 

In applying the fresh-start rules of  1.401(a)(4)-13(c) and (d), the group of section 401(a)(17) employees
is a fresh-start group. See  1.401(a)(4)-13(c)(5)(ii)(A). Thus, the consistency rules of those sections
govern, unless otherwise provided. For example, if the plan is using a fresh-start date applicable to all employees
and is not adjusting frozen accrued benefits under  1.401(a)(4)-13(d) for employees who are not section
401(a)(17) employees, then the frozen accrued benefits for section 401(a)(17) employees may not be adjusted under
 1.401(a)(4)-13(d) or this paragraph (e).

(B) 

Determination of adjusted accrued benefit. 

If the fresh-start rules of  1.401(a)(4)-13(c) and (d) are applied to determine the benefits of all employees
after a fresh-start date, the plan will not fail to satisfy the consistency requirement of  1.401(a)(4)-13(c)(5)(i)
merely because the plan makes the adjustment described in  1.401(a)(4)-13(d) to the frozen accrued benefits
of employees who are not section 401(a)(17) employees, but does not make the adjustment to the frozen accrued benefits
of section 401(a)(17) employees. In addition, the plan does not fail to satisfy the consistency requirement of  1.401(a)(4)-13(c)(5)(i)
merely because the plan makes the adjustment described in  1.401(a)(4)-13(d) for section 401(a)(17)
employees on the basis of the compensation formula that was used to determine the frozen accrued benefit (as required
under paragraph (e)(4)(iii) of this section) but makes the adjustment for employees who are not section 401(a)(17)
employees on the basis of any other method provided in  1.401(a)(4)-13(d)(8).

(4) 

Permitted adjustments to frozen accrued benefit of section 401(a)(17) employees

_(i) 

General rule. 

Except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (e)(4)(ii) and (iii) of this section, the rules in  1.401(a)(4)-13(c)(3)
(permitting certain adjustments to frozen accrued benefits) apply to section 401(a)(17) frozen accrued benefits
or OBRA '93 frozen accrued benefits.

(ii) 

Optional forms of benefit. 

After either the section 401(a)(17) fresh-start date or the OBRA '93 fresh-start date, a plan may be amended either
to provide a new optional form of benefit or to make an optional form of benefit available with respect to the section
401(a)(17) frozen accrued benefit or the OBRA '93 frozen accrued benefit, provided that the optional form of benefit
is not subsidized. Whether an optional form is subsidized may be determined using any reasonable actuarial assumptions.

(iii) 

Adjusting section 401(a)(17) accrued benefits

_(A) 

In general. 

If the plan adjusts accrued benefits for employees under the rules of  1.401(a)(4)-13(d) as of a fresh-start
date, the adjusted accrued benefit (within the meaning of section  1.401(a)(4)-13(d)) for each section
401(a)(17) employee must be determined after the fresh-start date by reference to the plan's compensation formula
that was actually used to determine the frozen accrued benefit as of the fresh-start date. For this purpose, the plan's
compensation formula incorporates the plan's underlying compensation definition and compensation averaging
period. In making the adjustment, the denominator of the adjustment fraction described in  1.401(a)(4)-13(d)(8)(i)
is the employee's compensation as of the fresh-start date using the plan's compensation formula as of that date and,
in the case of an OBRA '93 fresh-start date, reflecting the annual compensation limits that applied as of the fresh-start
date. The numerator of the adjustment fraction is the employee's updated compensation (i.e., compensation for the
current plan year within the meaning of  1.401(a)(4)-13(d)(8)), determined after applying the annual
compensation limits to each year's compensation that is used in the plan's compensation formula as of the fresh-start
date. Similarly, in applying the alternative rule in  1.401(a)(4)-13(d)(8)(v), the updated compensation
that is substituted must be determined after applying the annual compensation limits to each year's compensation
that is used in the plan's compensation formula. Thus, no adjustment will be permitted unless the updated compensation
(determined after applying the annual compensation limit) exceeds the compensation that was used to determine the
employee's frozen accrued benefit.

(B) 

Multiple fresh starts. 

If a plan makes more than one fresh start with respect to a section 401(a)(17) employee, the employee's frozen accrued
benefit as of the latest fresh-start date will either be determined by applying the current benefit formula to the
employee's total years of service as of that fresh-start date or will consist of the sum of the employee's frozen accrued
benefit (or adjusted accrued benefit (as defined in  1.401(a)(4)-13(d)(8)(i))) as of the previous fresh-start
date plus additional frozen accruals since the previous fresh start. If the frozen accrued benefit consists of such
a sum, in making the adjustments described in paragraph (e)(4)(iii)(A) of this section, separate adjustments must
be made to that previously frozen accrued benefit (or adjusted accrued benefit) and the additional frozen accruals
to the extent that the frozen accrued benefit and the additional accruals have been determined using different compensation
formulas or different compensation limits (i.e., the section 401(a)(17) limit before and after the reduction in
limit described in paragraph (a)(3) of this section). In this case, if the plan is applying the adjustment fraction
of  1.401(a)(4)-13(d)(8)(i), the denominator of the separate adjustment fraction for adjusting each
portion of the frozen accrued benefit must reflect the actual compensation formula, and, if applicable, compensation
limit, originally used for determining that portion. For example, the frozen accrued benefit of a section 401(a)(17)
employee as of the OBRA '93 fresh-start date may be based on the sum of the section 401(a)(17) frozen accrued benefit
(determined without any annual compensation limit) plus benefit accruals in the years between the statutory effective
date and the OBRA '93 effective date (based on compensation that was subject to the annual compensation limits for
those years). In this example, in adjusting the section 401(a)(17) frozen accrued benefit, the denominator of the
adjustment fraction does not reflect any annual compensation limit. Similarly, in adjusting the frozen accruals
for years between the statutory effective date and the OBRA '93 effective date, the denominator of the adjustment
fraction reflects the level of the annual compensation limit in effect for those years.

(5) 

Examples. 

The following examples illustrate the rules in this paragraph (e).






Example 1. 

(a) Employer X maintains Plan Y, a calendar year defined benefit plan providing an annual benefit for each year of service
equal to 2 percent of compensation averaged over an employee's high 3 consecutive calendar years' compensation.
Section 401(a)(17) applies to Plan Y in 1989. As of the close of the last plan year beginning before January 1, 1989 (i.e.,
the 1988 plan year), Employee A, with 5 years of service, had accrued a benefit of $25,000 which equals 10 percent (2
percent multiplied by 5 years of service) of average compensation of $250,000. Employer X decides to comply with the
provisions of this section for plan years before the effective date of this section. Employer X decides to make the
amendment effective for plan years beginning on or after January 1, 1989, and uses December 31, 1988 as the section
401(a)(17) fresh-start date. Plan Y, as amended, provides that, in determining an employee's benefit, compensation
taken into account is limited in accordance with the provisions of this section to the annual compensation limit under
section 401(a)(17), and that, for section 401(a)(17) employees, the employee's accrued benefit is the greater of

(i) The employee's benefit under the plan's benefit formula (after the plan formula is amended to comply with section
401(a)(17)) as applied to the employee's total years of service; and

(ii) The employee's accrued benefit as of December 31, 1988, determined as though the employee terminated employment
on that date without regard to any plan amendments after that date.

Employer X decides not to amend Plan Y to provide for the adjustments permitted under  1.401(a)(4)-13(d)
to the accrued benefit of section 401(a)(17) employees as of December 31, 1988.

(b) Under Plan Y, Employee A's accrued benefit at the end of 1989 is $25,000, which is the greater of Employee A's accrued
benefit as of the last day of the 1988 plan year ($25,000), and $24,000, which is Employee A's benefit based on the plan's
benefit formula applied to Employee A's total years of service ($200,000 multiplied by (2 percent multiplied by 6
years of service)). The formula of Plan Y applicable to section 401(a)(17) employees for calculating their accrued
benefits for years after the section 401(a)(17) fresh-start date is the formula in  1.401(a)-13(c)(4)(ii)
(formula with wear-away). The fresh-start formula is applied using a benefit formula for the 1989 plan year that satisfies
section 401(a)(17) and this section, and the December 31, 1988 fresh-start date used for the plan is a section 401(a)(17)
fresh-start date within the meaning of paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section. Thus, Plan Y, as amended, satisfies
paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section for plan years commencing prior to the OBRA '93 effective date.



Example 2. 

Assume the same facts as in 

Example 1, 

except that the plan formula provides that effective January 1, 1989, for section 401(a)(17) employees, an employee's
benefit will equal the sum of the employee's accrued benefit as of December 31, 1988 (determined as though the employee
terminated employment on that date and without regard to any amendments after that date), and 2 percent of compensation
averaged over an employee's high 3 consecutive years' compensation times years of service taking into account only
years of service after December 31, 1988. Thus, under Plan Y's formula, Employee A's accrued benefit as of December
31, 1989 is $29,000, which is equal to the sum of $25,000 (Employee A's accrued benefit as of December 31, 1988) plus
$4,000 ($200,000 multiplied by (2 percent multiplied by 1 year of service)). The formula of Plan Y applicable to section
401(a)(17) employees for calculating their accrued benefits for years after the section 401(a)(17) fresh-start
date is the formula in  1.401(a)-13(c)(4)(i) (formula without wear-away). The fresh-start formula
is applied using a benefit formula for the 1989 plan year that satisfies section 401(a)(17) and this section, and the
December 31, 1988 fresh-start date used for the plan is a section 401(a)(17) fresh-start date within the meaning of
paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section. Thus, Plan Y, as amended, satisfies paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section for
plan years commencing prior to the OBRA '93 effective date.



Example 3. 

(a) Assume the same facts as in 

Example 1, 

except that the plan formula provides that effective January 1, 1989, an employee's benefit equals the greater of
the plan formulas in 

Example 1 

and 

Example 2. 

The formula of Plan Y applicable to section 401(a)(17) employees for calculating their accrued benefits for years
after the section 401(a)(17) fresh-start date is the formula in  1.401(a)-13(c)(4)(iii) (formula with
extended wear-away). The fresh-start formula is applied using a benefit formula for the 1989 plan year that satisfies
section 401(a)(17) and this section, and the December 31, 1988 fresh-start date used for the plan is a section 401(a)(17)
fresh-start date within the meaning of paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section. Thus, Plan Y, as amended, satisfies
paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section for plan years commencing prior to the OBRA '93 effective date.

(b) Assume that for each of the years 1991-93 Employee A's annual compensation under the plan compensation formula,
disregarding the amendment to comply with section 401(a)(17) is $300,000. The annual compensation limit is adjusted
to $222,220, $228,860, and $235,840 for plan years beginning January 1, 1991, 1992, and 1993, respectively. Because
Employer X has decided to amend Plan Y to comply with the provisions of this section effective for plan years beginning
on or after January 1, 1989, and has used December 31, 1988 as the section 401(a)(17) fresh-start date, the compensation
that may be taken into account for plan benefits in 1993 cannot exceed $228,973 (the average of $222,220, $228,860,
and $235,840). Therefore, as of December 31, 1993, the benefit determined under the fresh-start formula with wear-away
would be $45,795 ($228,973 multiplied by (2 percent multiplied by 10 years of service)). The benefit determined under
the fresh-start formula without wear-away would be $47,897, which is equal to $25,000 (Employee A's section 401(a)(17)
frozen accrued benefit) plus $22,897 ($228,973 multiplied by (2 percent multiplied by 5 years of service)). Because
Employee A's accrued benefit is being determined using the fresh-start formula with extended wear-away, Employee
A's accrued benefit as of December 31, 1993, is equal to $47,897, the greater of the two amounts.



Example 4. 

(a) Assume the same facts as in 

Example 3, 


except that Plan Y satisfies  1.401(a)(4)-13(d)(3) through (d)(7) and that the amendment to Plan Y effective
for plan years beginning after December 31, 1988, also provided for adjustments to the section 401(a)(17) frozen
accrued benefit in accordance with  1.401(a)(4)-13(d) using the fraction described in  1.401(a)(4)-13(d)(8)(i).

(b) As of December 31, 1993, the numerator of Employee A's compensation fraction is $228,973 (the average of Employee
A's annual compensation for 1991, 1992, and 1993, as limited by the respective annual limit for each of those years).
The denominator of Employee A's compensation fraction determined in accordance with paragraph (e)(4)(iii) of this
section is $250,000 (the average of Employee A's high 3 consecutive calendar year compensation as of December 31,
1988, determined without regard to section 401(a)(17)). Therefore, Employee A's compensation fraction is $228,973/$250,000.
Because the compensation adjustment fraction is less than 1, Employee A's section 401(a)(17) frozen accrued benefit
is not adjusted. Therefore, Employee A's accrued benefit as of December 31, 1993, would still be $47,897, which is
equal to $25,000 (Employee A's section 401(a)(17) frozen accrued benefit) plus $22,897 ($228,973 multiplied by
(2 percent multiplied by 5 years of service).



Example 5. 

(a) Assume the same facts as in 

Example 3, 


except that as of January 1, 1994, Plan Y is amended to provide that benefits will be determined based on compensation
of $150,000 (the limit in effect under section 401(a)(17) for plan years beginning on or after the OBRA '93 effective
date) and that for section 401(a)(17) employees, each employee's accrued benefit will be determined under  1.401(a)(4)-13(c)(4)(i)
(formula without wear-away) using December 31, 1993 as the OBRA '93 fresh-start date.

(b) Assume that for each of the years 1996-98 Employee A's annual compensation under the plan compensation definition,
disregarding the amendment to comply with section 401(a)(17), is $400,000. Assume that the annual compensation
limit is first adjusted to $160,000 for plan years beginning on or after January 1, 1997, and is not adjusted for the
plan year beginning on or after January 1, 1998. The compensation that may be taken into account for the 1998 plan year
cannot exceed $156,667 (the average of $150,000 for 1996, $160,000 for 1997, and $160,000 for 1998).

(c) Therefore, at the end of December 31, 1998, Employee A's accrued benefit is $63,564, which is equal to $47,897 (Employee
A's OBRA '93 frozen accrued benefit) plus $15,667 ($156,667 multiplied by (2 percent multiplied by 5 years of service)).



Example 6. 

(a) Assume the same facts as in 

Example 5, 


except that, for the fresh-start group (in this case the section 401(a)(17) employees), the amendments to Plan Y provide
for adjustments to the section 401(a)(17) frozen accrued benefit and the OBRA '93 frozen accrued benefit in accordance
with  1.401(a)(4)-13(d) using the fraction described in  1.401(a)(4)-13(d)(8)(i).

(b) Employee A's frozen accrued benefit as of December 31, 1993, is adjusted as of December 31, 1998, as follows: (1)
Employee A's frozen accrued benefit as of December 31, 1993, is the sum of Employee A's section 401(a)(17) frozen accrued
benefit ($25,000) and Employee A's frozen accruals for the years 1989-93 ($22,897).

(2) The numerator of Employee A's adjustment fraction is $156,667 (the average of $150,000, $160,000, and $160,000).
The denominator of Employee A's adjustment fraction with respect to Employee A's section 401(a)(17) frozen accrued
benefit is $250,000, and the denominator of Employee A's adjustment fraction with respect to the rest of Employee
A's frozen accrued benefit is $228,973 (the average of Employee A's annual compensation for 1991, 1992, and 1993,
as limited by the respective annual limit for each of those years).

(3) Employee A's section 401(a)(17) frozen accrued benefit as adjusted through December 31, 1998, remains $25,000.
The compensation adjustment fraction determined in accordance with paragraph (e)(4)(iii) of this section is less
than one ($156,667 divided by $250,000).

(4) Employee A's frozen accruals for the years 1989-93, as adjusted through December 31, 1998, remain $22,897
because the adjustment fraction is less than one ($156,667 divided by $228,973).

(5) Employee A's adjusted accrued benefit as of December 31, 1998, equals $47,897 (the sum of the $25,000 and $22,897
amounts from paragraphs (b)(3) and (b)(4), respectively, of this 

Example

).

(c) Employee A's section 401(a)(17) frozen accrued benefit will not be adjusted for compensation increases until
the numerator of the fraction used to adjust that frozen accrued benefit exceeds the denominator of $250,000 used
in determining those accruals.

Similarly, the portion of Employee A's OBRA '93 frozen accrued benefit attributable to the frozen accruals for the
years 1989-1993 will not be adjusted for compensation increases until the numerator of the fraction used to
adjust those frozen accruals exceeds the denominator of $228,973 used in determining those accruals.

ACTION:

 Final regulations.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document contains amendments to the final regulations under section 414(r) of the Internal Revenue Code, which
provide that an employer may be treated as operating separate lines of business for purposes of applying the minimum
coverage requirements of section 410(b) and the minimum participation requirements of section 401(a)(26). The
regulations reflect the enactment of section 414(r) by the Tax Reform Act of 1986 and subsequent changes made by the
Technical and Miscellaneous Revenue Act of 1988 and the Public Debt Limit Increase Act of 1989. The regulations provide
guidance necessary to comply with the law and affect sponsors of and participants in tax-qualified retirement plans
and certain other employee benefit plans. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:



Background



Proposed regulations under section 414(r) and related provisions of the Internal Revenue Code (Code) were published
in the 

Federal Register

 on February 1, 1991 (56 FR 3988). Written comments were received from the public on the proposed regulations. In addition,
a public hearing on the proposed regulations was held on May 16, 1991. After consideration of all the written comments
received and the statements made at the public hearing, the proposed regulations under section 414(r) were adopted,
as modified, by final regulations (TD 8376) published in the 

Federal Register

 on December 4, 1991 (56 FR 63420). On August 10, 1992, proposed regulations were published in the 

Federal Register

 (57 FR 35536) to extend the effective date of the final regulations under section 414(r) (and related regulations),
generally to plan years beginning on or after January 1, 1994.

On September 7, 1993, proposed regulations amending the final regulations under sections 414(r) and 410(b) were
published in the 

Federal Register

 (58 FR 47090). Written comments were received from the public on the proposed regulations, and a public hearing was
held on November 10, 1993. After consideration of all the written comments received and the statements made at the
public hearing, these regulations are adopted as modified by this Treasury decision.

Temporary regulations (TD 8173) and proposed regulations under section 414(q) of the Code (relating to the definition
of highly compensated employee) were published in the 

Federal Register

 on February 19, 1988 (53 FR 4965 and 4999). In conjunction with the February 1991 proposed regulations under section
414(r), amendments to the temporary regulations (TD 8334) and proposed regulations under section 414(q) were published
in the 

Federal Register

 on February 1, 1991 (56 FR 3976 and 4023). The amendments related to the employee exclusions for purposes of satisfying
the 50-employee requirement for a separate line of business under section 414(r)(2)(A) of the Code.

Under section 7805(e)(2) of the Code, the February 1991 amendments to the temporary regulations under section 414(q)
expired after three years (January 31, 1994). In order to retain the application of those rules, the February 1991
proposed regulations under section 414(q) are adopted by this Treasury decision.



Explanation of Provisions



1. Overview



In general, all employees of a single employer, determined under section 414 of the Code, are taken into account for
purposes of applying the minimum coverage requirements of section 410(b) and the minimum participation requirements
of section 401(a)(26) to a qualified plan. Section 410(b)(5) provides an exception if an employer operates qualified
separate lines of business under section 414(r). If the employer is treated as operating qualified separate lines
of business, section 410(b)(5) generally permits the employer to apply the minimum coverage requirements separately
with respect to the employees of each qualified separate line of business. A similar exception is provided for purposes
of applying the minimum participation requirements of section 401(a)(26) and the 55-percent average benefits test
of section 129(d)(8).

An employer is treated as operating qualified separate lines of business if (1) the employer designates its lines
of business by reference to the property or services provided by each line, (2) each line of business is organized and
operated separately from the remainder of the employer, and (3) each of these separate lines of business meets additional
statutory requirements (including administrative scrutiny) and thus constitutes a qualified separate line of
business. Each employee of an employer that operates qualified separate lines of business is assigned to a particular
line of business for purposes of nondiscrimination testing.

The September 1993 proposed regulations amend the final regulations under section 414(r) generally to address issues
raised since the publication of the final regulations. The proposed regulations include the following major changes:





_Allowing an employee to be treated as a substantial-service employee with respect to a line of business if at least
50 percent of the employee's services are provided to that line.

_Applying the separate management and separate workforce tests to a line of business without regard to substantial-service
employees of other lines.

_Excluding nonresident aliens in applying the separate management and separate workforce tests.

_Expanding the special rules for vertically integrated lines of business and transferred employees.

_Increasing access to individual determinations under administrative scrutiny.

_Clarifying the treatment of employees who change from one disaggregation population to another.

In general, comments received on the changes included in the proposed regulations were favorable. Accordingly,
these final regulations incorporate those changes. In addition, in response to comments, certain further modifications
have been made to the regulations. The more significant modifications are discussed below.



2. Residual Shared employees



Most of the comments received on the September 1993 proposed regulations pertained to the allocation of residual
shared employees, that is, employees who provide services to more than one qualified separate line of business and
who are not substantial-service employees with respect to any line of business. The December 1991 regulations provide
three alternative allocation methods for residual shared employees, which are intended to assure that, as a group,
residual shared employees receive benefits representative of the benefits provided to the workforce generally.

Under the dominant line of business method, all residual shared employees are allocated to the employer's dominant
line of business. Generally, a qualified separate line of business is dominant if at least 50 percent of the employer's
substantial-service employees are assigned to that line. Alternatively, a line of business may be dominant if at
least 35 percent of the employer's substantial-service employees are assigned to that line and the line satisfies
any one of four possible conditions, such as a certain level of revenue or a certain size compared with the employer's
other lines. The other two allocation methods, the pro-rata method and the highly compensated employee (HCE) percentage
ratio method, provide formulas under which residual shared employees are allocated among the employer's various
qualified separate lines of business.

Employers have commented that the allocation rules do not adequately accommodate current benefit arrangements
for employees who provide services to more than one qualified separate line of business. For example, the employer
might cover residual shared employees in the plan maintained for a line that the employer considers its core business,
even though that line does not satisfy the dominant line of business standard. Residual shared employees therefore
cannot all be allocated to that line, potentially causing a change in their benefits. Employers also have commented
that the pro-rata and HCE percentage ratio methods may require employees in the same department to be allocated to
different qualified separate lines of business, which in turn may require different benefits to be provided to employees
who work together.

In response to comments, these final regulations change the allocation rules in two ways. First, the standard for
the alternative test of dominance is lowered from 35 percent to 25 percent, giving employers more flexibility in establishing
a dominant line. Second, the regulations provide an additional allocation alternative, the small group method.

Under the small group method, with respect to each residual shared employee, the employer chooses a qualified separate
line of business to which the employee is allocated. The residual shared employees need not all be allocated to the
same qualified separate line of business; the employer thus has great flexibility in selecting the plans under which
residual shared employees benefit. In order to prevent this new allocation method from being used to provide highly
compensated employees with excessive benefits relative to the nonhighly compensated employees, its use is subject
to three requirements.

First, the entire group of the employer's residual shared employees cannot exceed three percent of the employees
taken into account in applying section 410(b). In addition, the qualified separate line of business to which the employer
allocates a residual shared employee must include at least 10 percent of the employer's substantial-service employees
and must satisfy the administrative scrutiny statutory safe harbor after the allocation, that is, the concentration
of highly compensated employees in the line of business must be between 50 and 200 percent of the concentration of highly
compensated employees in the workforce generally. Finally, the allocation of residual shared employees must be
reasonable; criteria for determining whether an allocation is reasonable are set forth in the regulations.



3. Gateway



Section 410(b)(5)(B) provides that separate-line-of-business testing does not apply to a plan unless the plan benefits
such employees as qualify under a classification that is set up by the employer and is found not to discriminate in favor
of highly compensated employees. Because the employer-wide nondiscriminatory classification test of section
410(b)(5)(B) is a prerequisite to separate-line-of-business testing, it is sometimes referred to as the ``Gateway.''

<TEXT>
 

Under the December 1991 regulations, the Gateway is applied in the same basic manner as the nondiscriminatory classification
test under the section 410(b) regulations. Those regulations establish an unsafe harbor ratio percentage for a plan,
that is, a minimum ratio of the relative coverage rates of nonhighly compensated and highly compensated employees.
The unsafe harbor percentage applicable to a plan depends on the concentration of nonhighly compensated employees
in the employer's workforce.

If a qualified separate line of business has a disproportionate share of the employer's highly compensated employees,
the plan maintained for that line of business may have a very low ratio percentage on an employer-wide basis, even though
it covers a high percentage of the nonhighly compensated employees in that line. The December 1991 regulations therefore
provide a reduced unsafe harbor percentage if the plan has a ratio percentage of at least 90 percent on a qualified-separate-line-of-business
basis. Although most plans pass the Gateway test in its current form, some commentators on the September 1993 proposed
regulations have noted continued difficulty in the case of plans maintained for certain lines of business that cover
a high percentage of the nonhighly compensated employees in those lines.

In response to those comments, these final regulations provide that, if a plan has a ratio percentage of at least 90
percent on a qualified-separate-line-of-business basis, but its employer-wide ratio percentage falls below the
plan's reduced unsafe harbor percentage, the plan nonetheless is deemed to satisfy section 410(b)(5)(B) on an employer-wide
basis if the Commissioner determines that, based on all of the relevant facts and circumstances, the plan benefits
such employees as qualify under a classification of employees that does not discriminate in favor of highly compensated
employees. For this purpose, included among the relevant facts and circumstances are facts and circumstances such
as those listed in  1.410(b)-4(c)(3)(ii). In making these determinations, the Commissioner will determine
which other facts and circumstances are relevant, including any of the facts and circumstances listed in section
5 of Rev. Proc. 93-41, 1993-2 C.B. 536, that the Commissioner determines are relevant.



4. Other Changes



These final regulations also make the following changes: 




_Expansion of the minimum and maximum benefit safe harbor to apply to career average plans.

_Allowing more flexibility in the employees taken into account for purposes of the minimum benefit safe harbor.

_Clarification of the application of section 401(a)(26) to employer-wide plans.

_Clarification of the disaggregation population rules after a change in disaggregation population groups.

_Finalization of the regulations under section 414(q) relating to employees excluded for purposes of the 50-employee
requirement under section 414(r)(2)(A).



5. Notice 92-36 relief



A concern has been raised that the anti-cutback rules of section 411(d)(6) might eliminate an employer's option to
comply with the nondiscrimination requirements of the Tax Reform Act of 1986 (including the provisions of section
414(r)) and related legislation by amending its plans in the 1994 plan year to reduce the level of benefits provided
to highly compensated employees for that year. Employers are reminded that Notice 92-36, 1992-2 C.B.
364, provided broad transition relief giving employers the opportunity to retain their amendment options until
the last day of the 1994 plan year without being treated as violating section 411(d)(6).



Special Analyses



It has been determined that this Treasury Decision is not a significant regulatory action as defined in EO 12866. Therefore,
a regulatory assessment is not required. It also has been determined that section 553(b) of the Administrative Procedure
Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 5) and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 6) do not apply to these regulations,
and, therefore, a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is not required. Pursuant to section 7805(f) of the Internal Revenue
Code, the notice of proposed rulemaking preceding these regulations was submitted to the Small Business Administration
for comment on its impact on small business.



Drafting Information



The principal author of these regulations is Patricia McDermott of the Office of the Associate Chief Counsel (Employee
Benefits and Exempt Organizations), IRS. However, other personnel from the IRS and Treasury Department participated
in their development.

Single plan must be treated as separate plans. 

If a plan (

i.e.

, a single plan within the meaning of section 414(l)) benefits employees of more than one disaggregation population,
the plan must be disaggregated and treated as separate plans, each separate plan consisting of the portion of the plan
benefiting the employees of each disaggregation population. See paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section for the definition
of disaggregation population.

(B) 

Benefit accruals or allocations attributable to current status.

 Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (c)(4)(i)(C) of this section, in applying the rule of paragraph (c)(4)(i)(A)
of this section, the portion of the plan benefiting employees of a disaggregation population consists of all benefits
accrued by, or all allocations made to, employees while they were members of the disaggregation population.

(C) 

Exceptions for certain benefit accruals

_(

1

) 

Attribution of benefits to first disaggregation population.

 If employees benefiting under a plan change from one disaggregation population to a second disaggregation population,
benefits they accrue while members of the second disaggregation population that are attributable to years of service
previously credited while the employees were members of the first disaggregation population may be treated as provided
to them in their status as members of the first disaggregation population and thus included in the portion of the plan
benefiting employees of the first disaggregation population. This special treatment is available only if it is applied
on a consistent basis, if it does not result in significant discrimination in favor of highly compensated employees,
and if the plan provision providing the additional benefits applies on the same terms to all similarly-situated employees.
For example, if all formerly collectively bargained employees accrue additional benefits under a plan after becoming
noncollectively bargained employees, then those benefit increases may be treated as included in the portion of the
plan benefiting collectively bargained employees if they are attributable to years of service credited while the
employees were collectively bargained (e.g., where the additional benefits result from compensation increases
that occur while the employees are noncollectively bargained or from plan amendments affecting benefits earned
while collectively bargained that are adopted while the employees are noncollectively bargained) and if such treatment
does not result in significant discrimination in favor of highly compensated employees.

(

2

) 

Attribution of benefits to current disaggregation population.

 If employees benefiting under a plan change from one disaggregation population to another disaggregation population,
benefits they accrue while members of the first disaggregation population may be treated as provided to them in their
current status and thus included in the portion of the plan benefiting employees of the disaggregation population
of which they are currently members. This special treatment is available only if it is applied on a consistent basis
and if it does not result in significant discrimination in favor of highly compensated employees.

(D) 

Change in disaggregation populations

_(

1

) 

Reasonable treatment.

 If, in previous years, the configuration of a plan's disaggregation populations differed from their configuration
for the current year, for purposes of the benefits accrued by, or allocations made to, an employee for those years,
the employee's status as a member of a current disaggregation population for those years must be determined on a reasonable
basis. A different configuration occurs, for example, if disaggregation populations exist for the first time, such
as when an employer is first treated as operating qualified separate lines of business, or if the existing disaggregation
populations change, such as when an employer redesignates its qualified separate lines of business.

(

2

) 

Example.

 The following example illustrates the application of this paragraph (c)(4)(i)(D).






Example.

 (a) Employer X operates Divisions M and N, which are treated as qualified separate lines of business for the first time
in 1998. Thus, the disaggregation populations of employees of Division M and employees of Division N exist for the
first time. Since 1981 Employer X has maintained a defined benefit plan, Plan P, for employees of Division M. Plan P
provides a normal retirement benefit of one percent of average annual compensation for each year of service up to 25.
Employee A has worked for Division M since 1981 and has never worked for Division N. Employee B has worked for Division
N since 1989 and worked for Division M from 1981 to 1988. Employee C has worked in the headquarters of Employer X since
1981. For the period 1981 to 1988 Employee C was credited with years of service under Plan P.

(b) For purposes of the benefits accrued by Employee A under Plan P during years 1981 through 1997, Employee A is reasonably
treated as having been a member of the Division M disaggregation population for those years. For purposes of the benefits
accrued by Employee B under Plan P during years 1981 through 1988, Employee B is reasonably treated as having been a
member of the Division M disaggregation population for 1981 through 1988 and as having changed to the Division N disaggregation
population for 1989 through 1997. For purposes of the benefits accrued by Employee C under Plan P during years 1981
through 1988, Employee C is reasonably treated as having been a member of the Division M disaggregation population
for those years. Moreover, any benefit accruals for Employee B and Employee C in years after 1988, that result from
increases in average annual compensation after 1988 and that are attributable to years of service credited for 1981
through 1988, may be treated as provided to Employee B and Employee C in their status as members of the Division M disaggregation
population if the requirements of paragraph (c)(4)(i)(C)(

1

) of this section are otherwise met.




(ii) 

Definition of disaggregation population

_(A) 

Plan benefiting employees of qualified separate lines of business.

 If an employer is treated as operating qualified separate lines of business for purposes of section 410(b) in accordance
with  1.414(r)-1(b), and a plan benefits employees of more than one qualified separate line of business,
the employees of each qualified separate line of business are separate disaggregation populations. In this case,
the portion of the plan benefiting the employees of each qualified separate line of business is treated as a separate
plan maintained by that qualified separate line of business. However, employees of different qualified separate
lines of business who are benefiting under a plan that is tested under the special rule for employer-wide plans in  1.414(r)-1(c)(2)(ii)
for a plan year are not separate disaggregation populations merely because they are employees of different qualified
separate lines of business.

<TEXT>
 

(B) 

Plan benefiting collectively bargained employees.

 If a plan benefits both collectively bargained employees and noncollectively bargained employees, the collectively
bargained employees are one disaggregation population and the noncollectively bargained employees are another
disaggregation population. If the population of collectively bargained employees includes employees covered
under different collective bargaining agreements, the population of employees covered under each collective bargaining
agreement is also a separate disaggregation population.

(C) 

Plan maintained by more than one employer.

 If a plan benefits employees of more than one employer, the employees of each employer are separate disaggregation
populations. In this case, the portion of the plan benefiting the employees of each employer is treated as a separate
plan maintained by that employer, which must satisfy section 410(b) by reference only to that employer's employees.
However, for purposes of this paragraph (c)(4)(ii)(C), if the plan of one employer (or, in the case of a plan maintained
by more than one employer, the plan provisions applicable to the employees of one employer) treats compensation or
service with another employer as compensation or service with the first employer, then the current accruals attributable
to that compensation or service are treated as provided to an employee of the first employer under the plan of the first
employer (or the portion of a plan maintained by more than one employer benefiting employees of the first employer),
and the provisions of paragraph (c)(4)(i)(C) of this section do not apply to those accruals. Thus, for example, if
Plan A maintained by Employer X imputes service or compensation for an employee of Employer Y, then Plan A is not treated
as benefiting the employees of more than one employer merely because of this imputation.

(5) 

Additional rule for plans benefiting employees of more than one qualified separate line of business.

 If a plan benefiting employees of more than one qualified separate line of business satisfies the reasonable classification
requirement of  1.410(b)-4(b) before the application of paragraph (c)(4) of this section, then any portion
of the plan that is treated as a separate plan as a result of the application of paragraphs (c)(4)(i)(A) and (ii)(A)
of this section is deemed to satisfy that requirement.

Par. 6.

 Section 1.414(q)-1 is added to read as follows:



 1.414(q)-1

 Highly compensated employee.



Q&A-1 through Q&A-8: [Reserved] See  1.414(q)-1T, Q&A-1 through Q&A-8
for further guidance.

Q-9: How is the top-paid group determined?

(b) 

Number of employees in the top-paid group

_(1) 

Exclusions.

 The number of employees who are in the top-paid group for a year is equal to 20 percent of the total number of active employees
of the employer for such year. However, solely for purposes of determining the total number of active employees in
the top-paid group for a year, the employees described in  1.414(q)-1T, A-9(b)(1) (i), (ii) and
(iii)(B) are disregarded. Paragraph (g) of this A-9 provides rules for determining those employees who are
excluded for purposes of applying section 414(r)(2)(A), relating to the 50-employee requirement applicable to
a qualified separate line of business.

(i) through (iii) [Reserved] See  1.414(q)-1T, Q&A-9(b)(1) (i) through (iii) for further
guidance.

(2) 

Alternative exclusion provisions

_(i) and (ii) [Reserved] See  1.414(q)-1T, Q&A-9(b)(2) (i) and (ii) for further guidance.

(iii) 

Method of election.

 The elections in this paragraph (b)(2) must be provided for in all plans of the employer and must be uniform and consistent
with respect to all situations in which the section 414(q) definition is applicable to the employer. Thus, with respect
to all plan years beginning in the same calendar year, the employer must apply the test uniformly for purposes of determining
its top-paid group with respect to all its qualified plans and employee benefit plans. If either election is changed
during the determination year, no recalculation of the look-back year based on the new election is required, provided
the change in election does not result in discrimination in operation.

(c) through (f) [Reserved] See  1.414(q)-1T, Q&A-9 (c) through (f) for further guidance.

This paragraph (g) provides the rules for determining which employees are excluded employees for purposes of applying
section 414(r)(2)(A), relating to the 50-employee requirement applicable to a qualified separate line of business.

(2) 

Excluded employees

_(i) 

Age and service exclusion

. All employees are excluded who are described in  1.414(q)-1T, A-9(b)(1)(i) (relating to exclusions
based on age or service). For this purpose, the rules in  1.414(q)-1T, A-9 (e) and (f) (relating respectively
to the 171/2-hour rule and the 6-month rule) apply. However, the election in  1.414(q)-1T, A-9(b)(2)(i)
(permitting the employer to elect reduced minimum age or service requirements) does not apply.

(ii) 

Nonresident alien exclusion. 

All employees are excluded who are described in  1.414(q)-1T, A-9(b)(1)(ii) (relating to the exclusion
of nonresident aliens with no U.S.- source income from the employer).

(iii) 

Inclusion of employees covered under a collective bargaining agreement. 

All employees are included who are described in  1.414(q)-1T, A-9(b)(1)(iii)(A) (relating to
employees covered under a collective bargaining agreement) and who are not otherwise described in paragraph (g)(2)
(i) or (ii) of this A-9. For this purpose, the exclusion in  1.414(q)-1T, A- 9(b)(1)(iii)(B)
and the related election in  1.414(q)-1T, A- 9(b)(2)(ii) do not apply.

(3) 

Applicable period. 

The determination of which employees are excluded employees is made on the basis of the testing year specified in the
regulations under section 414(r) and not on the basis of the determination year or the look-back year under section
414(q).

(h) 

Effective date. 

The provisions of this A-9 apply to plan years and testing years beginning on or after January 1, 1994.

Property and services provided to customers

_(i) 

In 
general. 

Property, whether real or personal, tangible or 
intangible, is provided by an employer to a customer if the 
employer provides the property to or on behalf of the customer 
for consideration. Similarly, services are provided by an 
employer to a customer if the employer renders the services to or 
on behalf of the customer for consideration. An individual item 
of property or service is taken into account under this paragraph 
(b)(2) only if the employer provides the item to a person other 
than the employer in the ordinary course of a trade or business 
conducted by the employer and the person to whom the employer 
provides the item is acting in the capacity of a customer of the 
employer. A type of tangible property is deemed to be provided 
to customers of the employer for purposes of this section if, 
with respect to a business that produces or manufactures that 
type of tangible property, the employer satisfies the special 
rule in  1.414(r)-3(d)(2)(iii)(B) for vertically integrated 
businesses.

(ii) 

Timing of provision of property or services.

 Generally 
an employer determines its lines of business on the basis of the 
property and services it provides to its customers for 
consideration during the testing year. However, it is not 
necessary both that property or services actually be provided, 
and that consideration for the property or services actually be 
paid, during the current testing year. For an employer to be 
considered to provide property or services to customers for 
consideration during a testing year under this paragraph (b)(2), 
it is sufficient that the property or services actually be 
provided to customers during the testing year, the consideration 
actually be paid during the testing year, or the employer 
actually incur significant costs during the testing year 
associated with the provision of the property or services to a 
specified customer or specified customers.

Example 1.

 Employer H operates several dairy farms and 
dairy product processing plants. The dairy farms provide part of 
their output of milk and milk by-products to Employer H's dairy 
product processing plants and also sell part to retail 
distributors unrelated to Employer H. The dairy farms' provision 
of milk and milk by-products to Employer H's dairy product 
processing plants does not constitute the provision of property 
or services to customers of Employer H because the milk and milk 
by-products are not provided to a person other than employer H. 
However, the dairy farms' provision of milk and milk by-products 
to independent retail distributors does constitute the provision 
of property or services to customers of Employer H under 
paragraph (b)(2) of this section. 



Example 2.

 The facts are the same as in 

Example 1,

 except 
that the dairy farms provide their entire output of milk and milk 
by-products to Employer H's dairy product processing plants. The 
dairy farms' provision of milk and milk by-products to the dairy 
product processing plants generally does not constitute the 
provision of property or services to customers of Employer H 
because the milk and milk by-products are not provided to a 
person other than Employer H. However, paragraph (b)(2)(i) of 
this section provides a special rule for vertically integrated 
businesses that satisfy  1.414(r)-3(d)(2)(iii)(B). If  1.414(r)-3(d)(2)(iii)(B) is
satisfied, then, under the special rule of 
paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, the milk and milk by-products are deemed to be provided to customers of Employer
H.

 1.414(r)-3 

Separate line of business. 



* * * * * 



(b) * * *

(4) 

Separate employee workforce.

 * * * A line of business 
has its own separate workforce only if at least 90 percent of the 
employees who provide services to the line of business, and who 
are not substantial-service employees with respect to any other 
line of business, are substantial-service employees with respect 
to the line of business. * * *

(c) * * *

(2) * * *

(ii) The denominator of which is the total number of 
employees who provide services to the line of business within the 
meaning of paragraph (c)(5) of this section and who are not 
substantial-service employees with respect to any other line of 
business. 



* * * * * 



(4) 

Employees taken into account.

 For purposes of applying 
this paragraph (c), only employees who are employees on the first 
testing day are taken into account. For this purpose, there are 
no excludable employees except nonresident aliens described in 
section 410(b)(3)(C). Consequently, all other employees who are 
employees on the first testing day are taken into account, 
including collectively bargained employees. For the definition 
of first testing day, see  1.414(r)-11(b)(7). 

(5) * * *

(iii) 

Optional rule for employees who change status

_(A) 

In 
general.

 Solely for purposes of the separateness rules of this 
section and the assignment rules of  1.414(r)-7, if an employee 
changes status as described in paragraph (c)(5)(iii)(B) of this 
section, an employer may, for up to three consecutive testing 
years after the base year (within the meaning of paragraph 
(c)(5)(iii)(B) (

1

) or (

2

) of this section), treat the employee as 
providing the same level of service to its lines of business as 
the employee provided in the base year. 

(B) 

Change in employee's status.

 An employee changes status 
as described in this paragraph (c)(5)(iii)(B) if_

(

1

) For a testing year (the base year), the employee was a 
substantial-service employee with respect to a qualified separate 
line of business of the employer (prior line of business) and, 
for the immediately succeeding testing year, the employee is not 
a substantial-service employee with respect to that prior line of 
business; or 

(

2

) For a testing year (the base year), the employee was a 
residual shared employee and, for the immediately succeeding 
testing year, the employee is a substantial-service employee with 
respect to a qualified separate line of business. 

(c) * * *

(6) * * * Unless otherwise specified, it is assumed that the 
employees and their services described in these examples are 
taken into account under paragraphs (c) (4) and (5) of this 
section for the testing year and that the employer does not use 
the option under  1.414(r)-11(b)(2) to treat employees who 
provide less than 75 percent of their services to a line of 
business as substantial-service employees with respect to the 
line of business. 



* * * * * 





Example 2.

 * * * Moreover, because Employees M and N 
provide at least 75 percent of their services to Employer A's 
tire and automotive products line of business and are 
substantial-service employees with respect to that line, they are 
disregarded in applying paragraph (b)(4) of this section to any 
other line of business, even if they provide services to the 
other line. 



* * * * * 





Example 5.

 * * * Under the definition of substantial-service employee in  1.414(r)-11(b)(2), Employer
A may treat 
Employee R as a substantial-service employee with respect to the 
tire and automotive products line of business because Employee R 
provides at least 50 percent of his services to that line. In 
that case, Employee R would be disregarded in applying paragraph 
(b)(4) of this section to the construction machinery and 
agricultural equipment lines of business.

(7) * * * Unless otherwise specified, it is assumed that employees who provide services to a line of
business are not substantial-service employees with respect to any other line of business and that, in determining
the top-paid employees with respect to a line of business, the employer is using the option under  1.414(r)-11(b)(3)
to disregard all employees who provide less than 25 percent of their services to that line of business.






Example 1.

 (a) Employer C operates three lines of business as determined under  1.414(r)-2. One of its lines of business
is the operation of a chain of athletic equipment and apparel stores. Of Employer C's total workforce, 12,000 employees
provide more than a negligible amount of the services they provide to Employer C to the athletic equipment and apparel
stores line of business, within the meaning of paragraph (c)(5) of this section. Of the 1,200 employees who constitute
the top ten percent by compensation of those 12,000 employees, 930 are substantial-service employees with respect
to that line of business. Because 930 is 77.5 percent of 1,200, less than 80 percent of the top-paid employees with respect
to the line of business are substantial-service employees with respect to that line of business. Therefore, Employer
C's athletic equipment and apparel stores line of business does not have its own separate management under paragraph
(b)(5) of this section.

(b) Assume that, in determining the top-paid employees with respect to the athletic equipment and apparel stores
line of business, Employer C chooses to disregard all employees who provide less than 25 percent of their services
to the line of business as permitted under the definition in  1.414(r)-11(b)(3). Of the 12,000 employees
who provide more than a negligible amount of their services to the athletic equipment and apparel stores line of business,
10,000 provide at least 25 percent of their services to that line. Of the 1,000 employees who constitute the top ten
percent by compensation of those 10,000 employees, 930 are substantial-service employees with respect to the athletic
equipment and apparel stores line of business. Because 930 is 93 percent of 1,000, at least 80 percent of the top-paid
employees with respect to the line of business are substantial-service employees with respect to that line of business.
Therefore, Employer C's athletic equipment and apparel stores line of business has its own separate management and
satisfies the requirement of paragraph (b)(5) of this section.



* * * * *





Example 3.

 The facts are the same as in 

Example 2

 except that Employee X provides 60 percent of his services to Employer C's second line of business, an athletic equipment
factory, and 30 percent of his service to Employer C's third line of business, a fast-food chain. Because Employee
X provides at least 50 percent of his services to the athletic equipment factory line of business, Employer C chooses
to treat him as a substantial- service employee with respect to that line of business, as permitted under  1.414(r)-11(b)(2).
Thus, Employee X is taken into account as a substantial-service employee with respect to the athletic equipment factory
line of business and is disregarded in applying the separate workforce and separate management requirements under
paragraphs (b) (4) and (5) to the fast-food chain line of business.



* * * * *



(d) * * *

(2) 

Requirements.

 Two lines of business satisfy the requirements of this paragraph (d) with respect to a type of property or service only
if_

(i) One of the lines of business (the upstream line of business) provides a type of property or service to the other line
of business (the downstream line of business);

(ii) The downstream line of business either_

(A) Uses, consumes, or substantially modifies the property or service in the course of itself providing property
or services to customers of the employer; or

(B) Provides the same property or service to customers of the employer at a different level in the chain of commercial
distribution from the upstream line of business (e.g., retail versus wholesale); and

(iii) The upstream line of business either_

(A) Provides the same type of property or service to customers of the employer, and at least 25 percent of the total number
of units of the same type of property or service provided by the upstream line of business to all persons (including
customers of the employer, the downstream line of business, and all other lines of business of the employer) are provided
to customers of the employer by the upstream line of business, when measured on a uniform basis; or

(B) Provides to the downstream line of business property consisting primarily of a type of tangible property (i.e.,
goods, not services) that it produces or manufactures, and some entities outside the employer's controlled group
that are engaged in a similar business as the upstream line of business provide the same type of tangible property to
unrelated customers (i.e., customers outside those entities' respective controlled groups).



* * * * *



(4) * * *






Example 1.

 Employer E operates two lines of business as determined under  1.414(r)-2, one engaged in upholstery
textile manufacturing and the other in furniture manufacturing. During the testing year, the upholstery textile
line of business provides its entire output of upholstery textiles to the furniture line of business. The furniture
line of business uses the upholstery textiles in the manufacture of upholstered furniture for sale to customers of
Employer E. The furniture line of business thus substantially modifies the upholstery textiles provided to it by
the upholstery textile line of business in providing upholstered furniture products to customers of Employer E.
In addition, although the upholstery textile line of business does not provide upholstery textiles to customers
of Employer E, some entities engaged in upholstery textile manufacturing provide upholstery textiles to customers
outside their controlled groups. Under these facts, Employer E's two lines of business satisfy the requirements
of this paragraph (d) with respect to upholstery textiles for the testing year.

(ii) No more than five percent of the employees of the 
separate line of business for the current testing year were 
employees of a different separate line of business for the

substantial-service employees with respect to the acquired line 
of business for the immediately preceding testing year are 
substantial-service employees with respect to a different 
separate line of business in the respective testing year. 
(iii) If the transaction described in paragraph (d)(1) of

Example 2. 

The facts are the same as in 

Example 1 

except 
that, by the first testing day in 1997 (Transition Year 1), there 
are 300 additional substantial-service employees with respect to 
the pharmaceutical supplies line of business, increasing the 
total number to 4,300. Of those 300 employees, 250 were 
substantial-service employees with respect to a different 
separate line of business for testing year 1996 and 50 are new 
hires. Assume that, on the first testing day in Transition Year 
1, the pharmaceutical supplies line of business satisfies the 
requirements of  1.414(r)-3 (taking into account  1.414(r)-1(d)(4)) and therefore constitutes
a separate line of business. 
Because 250 is 6 percent of 4,300, no more than ten percent of 
the employees who are substantial-service employees with respect 
to the pharmaceutical supplies line of business were substantial- 
service employees with respect to a different separate line of 
business for the immediately preceding testing year. The 50 
newly hired employees are disregarded in making this 
determination. Under these facts, the pharmaceutical supplies 
separate line of business satisfies the safe harbor in this 
paragraph (d) for Transition Year 1. 



* * * * * 



(g) * * * 

(2) * * * 

(iii) * * * 

(A) * * * For purposes of this paragraph (g)(2)(iii), the 
normal accrual rate is the percentage (not less than 0) 
determined by subtracting the employee's normalized accrued 
benefit as of the end of the prior plan year (expressed as a 
percentage of average annual compensation as of the end of the 
prior plan year) from the employee's normalized accrued benefit 
as of the end of the plan year (expressed as a percentage of 
average annual compensation as of the end of the plan year). 



* * * * * 



(D) * * * However, a plan may disregard in a reasonable and 
consistent manner: years before the effective date of these 
regulations as set forth in  1.414(r)-1(d)(9)(i), years more than 
10 years preceding the current plan year, and years for which the 
employer does not use this paragraph (g)(2) to satisfy this safe 
harbor with respect to the separate line of business. * * * If 
a plan provides a defined benefit minimum that uses more than 
five consecutive years for calculating average annual 
compensation or the plan is an accumulation plan as defined in 
 1.401(a)(4)-12, the 0.75 percent annual accrual rate in 
paragraph (g)(2)(iii)(A) of this section is multiplied by 133.3 
percent, resulting in a normal accrual rate equal to 1.0 percent. 



* * * * * 



(3) * * * 

(iii) * * * 

(C) * * * In addition, no adjustment is made to the maximum 
normal accrual rate because the plan uses more than five 
consecutive years for calculating average annual compensation or 
the plan is an accumulation plan as defined in  1.401(a)(4)-12. 

(D) * * * In the case of a plan with subsidized optional 
forms, the determination of accrual rate for the plan year under 
paragraph (g)(2)(iii)(A) of this section is the percentage (not 
less than 0) determined by subtracting the largest of the sums of 
the employee's normalized QJSAs and QSUPPs determined for each 
age under  1.401(a)(4)-3(d)(1)(ii) as of the end of the prior 
plan year (expressed as a percentage of average annual 
compensation as of the end of the prior plan year) from the 
largest of the sums of the employee's normalized QJSAs and QSUPPs 
determined for each age under  1.401(a)(4)-3(d)(1)(ii) as of the 
end of the plan year (expressed as a percentage of average annual 
compensation as of the end of the plan year). 



* * * * * 



(5) 

Certain contingency provisions ignored. 

For purposes of 
this paragraph (g), an employee's accrual or allocation rate is 
determined without regard to any minimum benefit or any maximum 
benefit limitation that is applicable to the employee only if the 
separate line of business fails otherwise to satisfy the 
requirement of administrative scrutiny. 

(6) * * * For purposes of the minimum benefit requirement 
of paragraph (g)(2) of this section, section 410(b)(4) may be 
applied with reference to the lowest minimum age requirement, and 
with reference to the lowest minimum service requirement, 
applicable under any plan of the employer that benefits highly 
compensated employees of the separate line of business, as if all 
the plans were a single plan under  1.410(b)-6(b)(2), or, if no 
plan of the employer benefits highly compensated employees of the 
separate line of business, with reference to the greatest age and 
service requirements permitted under section 410(a)(1)(A). * * *

section 414(r), taking into account the nondiscrimination 
requirements of sections 401(a)(4) and 410(b). Paragraph (b) of

Authority to establish procedures. 

The Commissioner

guidance that may be necessary or appropriate for requesting and 
granting individual determinations under this section. For 
example, such guidance may specify the circumstances in which an 
employer may request an individual determination and factors to 
be taken into account in deciding whether to grant a favorable

 1.414(r)-7 

Determination of the employees of an employer's 
qualified separate lines of business. 


(a) * *  * 
(1) 

In general.

 * * * Paragraph (c) of this section 
provides methods for allocating residual shared employees among 
qualified separate lines of business. 


* * * * * 


(c) * * * 
(1) 

In general.

 All residual shared employees must be 
allocated among an employer's qualified separate lines of 
business under one of the allocation methods provided in 
paragraphs (c)(2) through (5) of this section. An employer is 
permitted to select which method of allocation to apply for the 
testing year to residual shared employees. However, the same 
allocation method must be used for all of the employer's residual 
shared employees and for all purposes listed in paragraph (a)(2) 
of this section with respect to the testing year. 
(2) * * * 
(iii) * * * (A) 

Determination of percentage.

 The employee 
assignment percentage of a qualified separate line of business is 
the fraction (expressed as a percentage)_
(

1

) The numerator of which is the number of substantial-service employees with respect to the qualified separate line
of 
business who are assigned to that line of business under 
paragraph (b) of this section; and 
(

2

) The denominator of which is the total number of 
substantial-service employees who are assigned to all qualified 
separate lines of business of the employer under paragraph (b) of 
this section. 


* * * * * 


(iv) 

Option to apply reduced percentage.

 An employer is 
permitted to determine whether it has a dominant line of business 
by substituting 25 percent for 50 percent in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) 
of this section. This option is available for a testing year 
only if the qualified separate line of business satisfies one of 
the following requirements: 
(A) The qualified separate line of business accounts for at 
least 60 percent of the employer's gross revenues for the 
employer's latest fiscal year ending in the testing year. 
(B) The employee assignment percentage of the qualified 
separate line of business would be at least 60 percent if 
collectively bargained employees were taken into account. 
(C) Each qualified separate line of business of the employer 
satisfies the statutory safe harbor of  1.414(r)-5(b), the 
average benefits safe harbor of  1.414(r)-5(f), or the minimum or 
maximum benefits safe harbor of  1.414(r)-5(g). Whether a 
qualified separate line of business satisfies one of these safe 
harbors is determined after the application of this section, 
including the assignment of all residual shared employees under 
this paragraph (c)(2). 
(D) The employee assignment percentage of the qualified 
separate line of business is at least twice the employee 
assignment percentages of each of the employer's other qualified 
separate lines of business. 


* * * * * 


(5) 

Small group method

_(i) 

In general.

 Under the method of 
allocation provided for in this paragraph (c)(5), each residual 
shared employee is allocated to a qualified separate line of 
business chosen by the employer. This method does not apply 
unless all of the requirements of paragraphs (c)(5)(ii), (iii), 
and (iv) of this section are satisfied. 
(ii) 

Size of group.

 The total number of the employer's 
residual shared employees allocated under this paragraph (c) must 
not exceed three percent of all of the employer's employees. For 
this purpose, the employer's employees include only those 
employees taken into account under paragraph (c)(2)(iii)(B) of 
this section. 
(iii) 

Composition of qualified separate line of business.

 The qualified separate line of business to which the residual 
shared employee is allocated must have an employee assignment 
percentage under paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section of at 
least ten percent. In addition, the qualified separate line of 
business to which the residual shared employee is allocated must 
satisfy the statutory safe harbor under  1.414(r)-5(b) after the 
employee is so allocated. 
(iv) 

Reasonable allocation.

 The allocation of residual 
shared employees under the small group method provided for in 
this paragraph (c)(5) must be reasonable. Reasonable allocations 
generally include allocations that are based on the level of 
services that the residual shared employees provide to the 
employer's qualified separate lines of business, the similar 
treatment of similarly situated residual shared employees, and 
other bona fide business criteria; in contrast, an allocation 
that is designed to maximize benefits for select employees is not 
considered a reasonable allocation. For example, allocation of 
all residual shared employees who work in the same department, or 
at the same location, to the same qualified separate line of 
business would be an indication of reasonableness. However, 
allocation of a group of similarly situated residual shared 
employees to a qualified separate line of business for which they 
provide minimal services might not be considered reasonable. In 
addition, the allocation of the professional employees of a 
department to one qualified separate line of business and the 
allocation of the support staff of the same department to a 
different qualified separate line of business would not be 
reasonable.

(iii) 

Modification of unsafe harbor percentage for plans 
satisfying ratio percentage test at 90 percent level

_(A) 

General 
rule.

 If a plan benefits a group of employees for a plan year 
that would satisfy the ratio percentage test of  1.410(b)-2(b)(2) 
on a qualified-separate-line-of-business basis under paragraph 
(b)(3) of this section if the percentage in  1.410(b)-2(b)(2) 
were increased to 90 percent, the unsafe harbor percentage in 
 1.410(b)-4(c)(4)(ii) for the plan is reduced by five percentage 
points (not five percent) for the plan year and is applied 
without regard to the requirement that the unsafe harbor 
percentage not be less than 20 percent. Thus, if the 
requirements of this paragraph (b)(2)(iii)(A) are satisfied, the 
unsafe harbor percentage in  1.410(b)-4(c)(4)(ii) is treated as 
35 percent, reduced by 3/4 of a percentage point for each whole 
percentage point by which the nonhighly compensated employee 
concentration percentage exceeds 60 percent. 
(B) 

Facts and circumstances alternative.

 If a plan 
satisfies the requirements of paragraph (b)(2)(iii)(A) of this 
section, but has a ratio percentage on an employer-wide basis 
that falls below the unsafe harbor percentage determined under 
paragraph (b)(2)(iii)(A) of this section, the plan nonetheless is 
deemed to satisfy section 410(b)(5)(B) on an employer-wide basis 
if the Commissioner determines that, on the basis of all of the 
relevant facts and circumstances, the plan benefits such 
employees as qualify under a classification of employees that 
does not discriminate in favor of highly compensated employees. 


* * * * * 


(4) * * * 




Example 2.

 The facts are the same as in 

Example 1.

 All of 
the 50 highly compensated employees treated as employees of Line 
2 benefit under Plan Y, and 80 of the 100 nonhighly compensated 
employees treated as employees of Line 2 benefit under Plan Y. 
Thus, Plan Y benefits 50 percent of all Employer A's highly 
compensated employees (50 out of 100) and only 4 percent of all 
Employer A's nonhighly compensated employees (80 out of 2,000). 
Thus, while Plan Y has a ratio percentage of 80 percent (80%
100%) on a qualified-separate-line-of-business basis, it has a 
ratio percentage of only 8 percent (4%
50%) on an employer-wide 
basis. See  1.410(b)-9. Under  1.410(b)-4(c)(4)(iii), the 
nonhighly compensated employee concentration percentage is 
2,000/2,100 or 95 percent. Because 8 percent is less than 20 
percent (the unsafe harbor percentage applicable to Employer A 
under  1.410(b)-4(c)(4)(ii)), Plan Y does not satisfy the 
nondiscriminatory classification test of  1.410(b)-4 on an 
employer-wide basis. Nor does Plan Y satisfy the ratio 
percentage test of  1.410(b)-2(b)(2) on an employer-wide basis, 
since 8 percent is less than 70 percent. Under these facts, Plan 
Y does not satisfy section 410(b)(5)(B) on an employer-wide basis 
in accordance with paragraph (b)(2) of this section for the plan 
year of Plan Y beginning in the 1994 testing year, and therefore 
fails to satisfy section 410(b) for that year. This is true even 
though Plan Y satisfies section 410(b) on a qualified-separate-line-of-business basis in accordance with paragraph
(b)(3) of 
this section. 


Example 3.

 The facts are the same as in 

Example 2,

 except 
that all of the employees treated as employees of Line 2 benefit 
under Plan Y. Thus, Plan Y benefits 50 percent of all of 
Employer A's highly compensated employees (50 out of 100) and 5 
percent of all of Employer A's nonhighly compensated employees 
(100 out of 2,000). Plan Y therefore has a ratio percentage of 
100 percent (100%
100%) on a qualified-separate-line-of-business basis and a ratio percentage of 10 percent (5%
50%) on 
an employer-wide basis. Because Plan Y has a ratio percentage of 
at least 90 percent on a qualified-separate-line-of-business 
basis, a reduced unsafe harbor percentage applies to Plan Y under 
paragraph (b)(2)(iii)(A) of this section. The reduced unsafe 
harbor percentage applicable to Plan Y is 8.75 percent because 
Employer A's nonhighly compensated employee concentration 
percentage is 95 percent. Plan Y's employer-wide ratio 
percentage of 10 percent therefore exceeds the unsafe harbor 
percentage. Plan Y thus satisfies section 410(b)(5)(B) on an 
employer-wide basis in accordance with paragraph (b)(2) of this 
section for the plan year of Plan Y beginning in the 1994 testing 
year. Plan Y also satisfies section 410(b) on a qualified-separate-line-of-business basis in accordance with paragraph

(b)(3) of this section. 


Example 4.

 The facts are the same as in 

Example 3,

 except 
that Employer A's total nonexcludable nonhighly compensated 
employees are 2,500 (rather than 2,000), of whom 100 are treated 
as employees of Line 2 and of whom 90 benefit under Plan Y. Plan 
Y has a ratio percentage of 90 percent (90%
100%) on a 
qualified-separate-line-of-business basis, and Employer A's 
nonhighly compensated employee concentration percentage is 
2,500/2,600 or 96 percent. Thus, the reduced unsafe harbor 
percentage applicable to Plan Y under paragraph (b)(2)(iii)(A) of 
this section is 8 percent. Plan Y benefits 50 percent of all of 
Employer A's highly compensated employees (50 out of 100) and 3.6 
percent of all of Employer A's nonhighly compensated employees 
(90 out of 2,500). Plan Y therefore has a ratio percentage of 
only 7.2 percent (3.6%
50%) on an employer-wide basis, which 
falls below the reduced unsafe harbor percentage of 8 percent. 
Nonetheless, under paragraph (b)(2)(iii)(B) of this section, Plan 
Y will be deemed to satisfy section 410(b)(5)(B) on an employer-wide basis if the Commissioner determines that, on
the basis of 
all of the relevant facts and circumstances, the plan benefits 
such employees as qualify under a classification of employees 
that does not discriminate in favor of highly compensated 
employees.

(2) 

Substantial-service employee.

 An employee is a 
substantial-service employee with respect to a line of business 
for a testing year if at least 75 percent of the employee's 
services are provided to that line of business for that testing 
year within the meaning of  1.414(r)-3(c)(5). In addition, if an 
employee provides at least 50% and less than 75% of the 
employee's services to a line of business for the testing year 
within the meaning of  1.414(r)-3(c)(5), the employer may treat 
that employee as a substantial-service employee with respect to 
that line of business provided the employee is so treated for all 
purposes of these regulations. The employer may choose such 
treatment separately with respect to each employee. 
(3) 

Top-paid employee.

 Generally, an employee is a top-paid 
employee with respect to a line of business for a testing year if 
the employee is among the top 10 percent by compensation of those 
employees who provide services to that line of business for that 
testing year within the meaning of  1.414(r)-3(c)(5) and who are 
not substantial-service employees within the meaning of paragraph 
(b)(2) of this section with respect to any other line of 
business. In addition, in determining the group of top-paid 
employees, the employer may choose to disregard all employees who 
provide less than 25 percent of their services to the line of 
business. * * *
(4) 

Residual shared employee.

 An employee is a residual 
shared employee for a testing year if the employee is not a 
substantial-service employee with respect to any line of business 
for the testing year.

Subsistence Management Regulations for Public Lands in Alaska, Subpart D; Subsistence Taking of Fish and Wildlife
Regulations; Extension



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Forest Service, USDA; Fish and Wildlife Service, Interior.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Interim rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This interim rule amends the Subsistence Management Regulations for Public Lands in Alaska implementing the subsistence
priority for rural residents of Alaska under Title VIII of the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (ANILCA)
of 1980 by extending the effective date of 50 CFR 100 and 36 CFR 242,  

XXXX

.26 (Subsistence taking of fish) and  

XXXX

.27 (Subsistence taking of shellfish) (58 FR 31252-31295). This interim rule would extend the regulations
now set to expire June 30, 1994. They would be extended until December 31, 1995, or until revoked or superseded, whichever
comes earlier.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Background_Title VIII of the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (ANILCA) (16 U.S.C. 3111-3126)
requires that the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture (Secretaries) implement a joint program
to grant a preference for subsistence uses of fish and wildlife resources on public lands, unless the State of Alaska
enacts and implements laws of general applicability which are consistent with ANILCA, and which provide for the subsistence
definition, preference, and participation specified in sections 803, 804, and 805 of ANILCA. The State implemented
a program that the Department of the Interior previously found to be consistent with ANILCA. However, in December
1989, the Alaska Supreme Court ruled in 

McDowell

 v. 

State of Alaska

 that the rural preference in the State subsistence statute violated the Alaska Constitution. The court's ruling
in 

McDowell

 required the State to delete the rural preference from the subsistence statute, and therefore, negated State compliance
with ANILCA. The Court stayed the effect of the decision until July 1, 1990.



As a result of the 

McDowell

 decision, the Department of the Interior and the Department of Agriculture (Departments) assumed, on July 1, 1990,
responsibility for implementation of Title VIII of ANILCA on public lands. On June 29, 1990, the Temporary Subsistence
Management Regulations for Public Lands in Alaska were published in the 

Federal Register

 (55 FR 27114-27170). Consistent with Subparts A, B, and C of these regulations, a Federal Subsistence Board
(Board) was established to administer the Federal Subsistence Management Program. The Board's composition includes
a Chair appointed by the Secretary of the Interior with concurrence of the Secretary of Agriculture; the Alaska Regional
Director, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service; the Alaska Regional Director, U.S. National Park Service; the Alaska State
Director, U.S. Bureau of Land Management; the Alaska Area Director, U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs; and the Alaska
Regional Forester, USDA Forest Service. Through the Board, these agencies have participated in development of regulations
for Subparts A, B, and C, and the annual Subpart D regulations.

On June 1, 1993, the 1993-1994 Seasons and Bag Limits for Subsistence Management Regulations for Public Lands
in Alaska were published in the 

Federal Register

 (58 FR 31252-31295). Those regulations which include the sections on the taking of fish and shellfish expire
June 30, 1994.

On July 15, 1993, the Native American Rights Fund, on behalf of a number of individuals and organizations, submitted
a petition to the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture requesting that they include navigable
waters within the definition of ``public lands'' as used in implementing Title VIII. This was a request for administrative
relief. The Secretaries continue their evaluation of this petition.

On March 30, 1994, the U.S. District Court for Alaska issued a decision in the consolidated 

Katie John, et al.

 v. 

the United States, et al.

 litigation. The court concluded that the Secretaries are entitled to manage fish and wildlife on public lands in Alaska
for the purposes of providing the subsistence priority mandated in Title VIII of ANILCA. The court further concluded
that, for the purposes of Title VIII, ``public lands'' includes all navigable waterways in Alaska. The court then
issued a stay of the decision for 60 days to allow the filing of an appeal and ordered that the stay would remain in effect,
pending an appellate decision, if one or more appeals were filed. Because the Federal government has successfully
petitioned the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals for permission to appeal from the district court's decision, the stay
presently remains in effect.

Because the petition for rulemaking is still under consideration by the Secretaries and because of the stayed court
decision relative to actual Federal jurisdiction, the Board believes that issuing regulations immediately, assuming
additional authority or revising existing regulations are not warranted and, in fact, appear to be inappropriate
at this time. However, any comments or proposals received will be carefully considered and retained for use when the
regulations are revised the next time. This interim rule effectively extends the existing regulations until December
31, 1995, or until the Secretaries direct the revision of the subsistence fish and shellfish regulations based on
a revised area of jurisdiction, or until the court directs the preparation of regulations implementing its order.

The Board finds that public notice and comment requirements under the Administrative Procedures Act (APA) for this
extension are impracticable, unnecessary, and contrary to the public interest. A lapse in regulatory control after
July 1 could seriously affect the continued viability of fish and shellfish populations, adversely impact future
subsistence opportunities for rural Alaskans, and would generally fail to serve the overall public interest. Therefore,
the Board finds that good cause pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B) to waive the public notice and comment procedures prior
to publication of this extension.

The Board also finds good cause for the existing rule to be extended until December 31, 1995, (or until they are revoked
or superseded whichever comes earlier). This December 31 date is consistent with earlier Board discussions proposing
to change the regulatory year for fisheries regulations to January 1 through December 31 to avoid having changes occur
during the middle of a fishing season. The Board therefore finds good cause under 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3) to make this extension
effective upon publication.



Conformance With Statutory and Regulatory Authorities



National Environmental Policy Act Compliance_A Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) that described four
alternatives for developing a Federal Subsistence Management Program was distributed for public comment on October
7, 1991. That document described the major issues associated with Federal subsistence management as identified
through public meetings, written comments and staff analysis and examined the environmental consequences of the
four alternatives. Proposed regulations (Subparts A, B, and C) that would implement the preferred alternative were
included in the DEIS as an appendix. The DEIS and the proposed administrative regulations presented a framework for
an annual regulatory cycle regarding subsistence hunting and fishing regulations (Subpart D). The Final Environmental
Impact Statement (FEIS) was published on February 28, 1992.

Based on the public comment received, the analysis contained in the FEIS, and the recommendations of the Federal Subsistence
Board and the Department of the Interior's Subsistence Policy Group, it was the decision of the Secretary of the Interior,
with the concurrence of the Secretary of Agriculture, through the U.S. Department of Agriculture-Forest Service,
to implement Alternative IV as identified in the DEIS and FEIS (Record of Decision on Subsistence Management for Federal
Public Lands in Alaska (ROD), signed April 6, 1992). The DEIS and the selected alternative in the FEIS defined the administrative
framework of an annual regulatory cycle for subsistence hunting and fishing regulations. The final rule for Subsistence
Management Regulations for Public Lands in Alaska, Subparts A, B, and C (57 FR 22940-22964) implements the Federal
Subsistence Management Program and includes a framework for an annual cycle for subsistence hunting and fishing
regulations.



Compliance With Section 810 of ANILCA



The intent of all Federal subsistence regulations is to accord subsistence uses of fish and wildlife on public lands
a priority over the taking of fish and wildlife on such lands for other purposes, unless restriction is necessary to
conserve healthy fish and wildlife populations. A Section 810 analysis was completed as part of the FEIS process.
The final Section 810 analysis determination appears in the April 6, 1992, ROD which concluded that the Federal Subsistence
Management Program, under Alternative IV with an annual process for setting hunting and fishing regulations, may
have some local impacts on subsistence uses, but it does not appear that the program may significantly restrict subsistence
uses.

These rules contain information collection requirements subject to Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval
under 44 U.S.C. 3501-3520. They apply to the use of public lands in Alaska. The information collection requirements
described above are approved by the OMB under 44 U.S.C. 3501 and have been assigned clearance number 1018-0075.

Public reporting burden for this form is estimated to average .1382 hours per response, including time for reviewing
instructions, gathering and maintaining data, and completing and reviewing the form. Direct comments on the burden
estimate or any other aspect of this form to: Information Collection Officer, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 1849

(1018-0075), Washington, D.C. 20503. Additional information collection requirements may be imposed if Local
Advisory Committees subject to the Federal Advisory Committee Act are established under Subpart B. Such requirements
will be submitted to OMB for approval prior to their implementation.

This rule is not subject to OMB review under Executive Order 12866.

The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq.

) requires preparation of flexibility analyses for rules that will have a significant effect on a substantial number
of small entities, which include small businesses, organizations or governmental jurisdictions. The Departments
have determined that this rulemaking will not have a significant economic effect on a substantial number of small
entities within the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

This rulemaking will impose no significant costs on small entities; the exact number of businesses and the amount
of trade that will result from this Federal land-related activity is unknown. The aggregate effect is an insignificant
positive economic effect on a number of small entities. The number of small entities affected is unknown; but, the
fact that the positive effects will be seasonal in nature and will, in most cases, merely continue preexisting uses
of public lands indicates that they will not be significant.

These regulations do not meet the threshold criteria of ``Federalism Effects'' as set forth in Executive Order 12612.
Title VIII of ANILCA requires the Secretaries to administer a subsistence preference on public lands. The scope of
this program is limited by definition to certain public lands. Likewise, these regulations have no significant takings
implication relating to any property rights as outlined by Executive Order 12630.

Final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Commission required Tier 1 local exchange carriers (LECs) (except members of the National Exchange Carrier Association
(NECA)) to provide to interested third parties, including competitive access providers (CAPs), interexchange
carriers, (IXCs), and end users, signalling information necessary to provide tandem switching services. These
parties will thus, for the first time, be able to carry traffic of multiple IXCs from LEC end offices to their own tandems,
switch traffic at that point, and deliver the traffic to the appropriate IXC. LECs must offer signalling information
from their equal access end offices pursuant to tariff.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

This is a summary of the Commission's 

Third Report and Order

 in CC Docket No. 91-141, adopted May 19, 1994, and released May 27, 1994. The full text of this decision is available
for inspection and copying during normal business hours in the FCC Reference Center (Room 239), 1919 M Street, NW.,

Paperwork Reduction Act




Public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated to average 37 hours per response, including
the time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed,
and completing and reviewing the collection of information. Send comments regarding this burden estimate or any
other aspect of this collection of information, including suggestions for reducing the burden, to the Federal Communications
Commission, Records Management Division, Paperwork Reduction Project, Washington, DC 20554 and to the Office of
Management and Budget, Paperwork Reduction Project, Washington, DC 20503.



Summary of the Order



1. The Commission found that this decision represents another step in a series of efforts to remove barriers to competition
in interstate access services. It stated that while the Commission's earlier expanded interconnection decisions
opened the door to competition in special access and switched transport transmission services, interconnectors,
however, had to rely on LECs to perform the switching functions necessary to provide switched transport. The Commission
concluded that the Order will enable interconnectors, as well as other parties, to provide tandem switching functions
for switched transport services.

2. The Commission concluded that LEC-provision of signalling information will open the door to third parties to provide
competitive tandem switching services. By further reducing barriers to competition in switched access services,
this action will benefit all users of tandem switching, especially small IXCs that tend to rely heavily on tandem-switched
transport, who will benefit from more competitively priced tandem switching services. The Commission also found
that its action should promote more efficient use and deployment of the country's telecommunications networks,
encourage technological innovation, and exert downward pressure on access charges and long-distance rates, all
of which should contribute to economic growth and the creation of new job opportunities. In addition, these measures
should increase access to diverse facilities, which could improve network reliability.

3. The Commission required Tier 1 LECs (except NECA pool members) to provide signalling information necessary for
tandem switching from LEC equal access end offices to any interested third party (hereinafter sometimes referred
to as ``tandem switching providers'' or ``TSPs''). (Tier 1 LECs are those with $100 million or more in annual regulated
revenues for a sustained period of time.) In end offices in which common channel signalling (CCS or SS7) is available,
TSPs shall have the option of receiving signalling information via SS7 or multi-frequency (MF) signalling. The provision
of this information will be treated as a new service under the Commission's price caps regime. Tier 1 LECs must file
tariff amendments to reflect the availability of signalling information from LEC equal access end offices within
ninety days of the publication of the Order in the 

Federal Register

. Based on the record and in light of prior decisions on pricing flexibility in the 

Switched Transport Expanded Interconnection Order

 and in the 

Transport

 proceeding, the Commission did not grant LECs additional pricing flexibility at this time. The Commission also found
that the transport interconnection charge is sufficient to protect support flows potentially affected by the provision
of signalling information.

Background



4. The Commission stated that it has taken several initiatives to increase competition in the long-distance market.
First, in 1992, in the 

Special Access Expanded Interconnection Order

, the Commission required Tier 1 LECs, except NECA pool members, to provide expanded interconnection for interstate
special access to all interested parties.
 The Commission also stated that in 1993, it adopted the 

Switched Transport Expanded Interconnection Order

, in which the Commission required LECs providing expanded interconnection for special access to provide expanded
interconnection for switched transport service as well.
 In that order, the Commission opened the opportunity for interconnectors to provide alternative transmission services
to LEC-provided direct-trunked transport and entrance facilities by collocating transmission facilities in LEC
end offices, tandems, serving wire centers (SWCs), and certain remote nodes. The Commission stated that as a result
of those two actions, interconnectors are now able to provide special access and switched transport transmission
services in competition with the LECs.






5. The Commission stated that only LECs, however, currently can provide tandem switching functions. Third parties
cannot now provide such functions because they generally do not have access to the signalling information necessary
to switch and route traffic to IXCs. Thus, virtually all tandem-switched transport currently must be routed through
LEC tandems and switched by the LECs at that point; interconnectors can provide only the link between the LEC tandem
and the IXC point-of-presence (POP).

6. The Commission stated that in a Second Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (

Notice

),
 which is the subject of this proceeding, it proposed to broaden the scope of its access initiatives to address this
limitation. Specifically, the Commission proposed to require LECs to provide other parties to offer tandem switching
functions. Under this proposal, interconnectors would be able to offer tandem-switched transport, using their
own tandems, in competition with the LECs. In addition, third parties, such as IXCs, could obtain economies by aggregating
their traffic from end offices on a single direct trunk, routing that traffic to a third-party tandem, and switching
it at that point.





Technical Requirements and Network Modifications



7. The Commission stated that the record identifies four types of signalling information used to provide switched
transport: (1) The Carrier Identification Code (CIC), which identifies the caller's selected IXC; (2) the OZZ, which
indicates the specific IXC trunk group that is to carry the call; (3) the Automatic Number Identification (ANI), which
identifies the billed number; and (4) the Called Number Identification (CNI), which identifies the called telephone
number. IXCs may use different trunk groups to carry different classes of calls. For example, 0+ calls may be carried
on a different trunk group than direct-dialed domestic calls. The OZZ digits indicate the call type, and thus the trunk
group, onto which a particular call should be routed.



Requirement to Provide Signalling Information



8. The Commission stated that currently, LECs transmit ANI and CNI to their access customers on originating Feature
Group D trunks from LEC end offices and tandems. They do not, however, transmit the CIC and OZZ codes to third parties
because IXCs do not need this information to route and bill calls. Thus, these latter codes are dropped by the LECs from
the signalling data stream after trunk selection has taken place. In the case of direct-trunked traffic, the CIC and
OZZ codes are dropped at the originating end office; in the case of tandem-switched traffic, they are dropped at the
tandem. Because the CIC and OZZ codes are needed for tandem switching and are not currently provided to third parties,
these data are the focus of this proceeding.

9. The Commission affirmed its tentative conclusion that broader interconnection requirements to facilitate access
competition are in the public interest. In accordance with this finding, the Commission required Tier 1 LECs (except
NECA pool members) to provide signalling information from equal access end offices so that third parties may install
their own tandems to provide tandem-switching services. Third parties may collocate at LEC end offices and provide
their own tandem-switched transport between those end offices and their tandems, or they may purchase LEC transport
to their tandems. We do not require LECs to provide signalling information for tandem-switching from their tandems
since we find that the record does not support the establishment of such a requirement at this time.

10. The Commission concluded that the availability to third parties of signalling information needed for tandem
switching could provide significant public benefits. It would facilitate broader access competition by enabling
interconnectors to offer competitive interstate tandem-switching and transport services. In addition, it would
increase opportunities for small IXCs to gain economies of scale by sharing direct-routed transport facilities
and providing their own tandem-switching. The Commission found that as it stated in the 

Notice,

 broader access competition should exert downward pressure on tandem-switched transport rates, while fostering
more efficient provisioning of these services by new competitors and LECs. The Commission also concluded that in
addition, competition should encourage innovation and investment in new technologies and could offer increased
network reliability through route diversity and redundancy. IXCs would benefit from greater competition in the
tandem-switched service market. Small IXCs would especially benefit because they tend to rely more heavily on tandem-switched
transport than larger IXCs. The Commission also stated that in addition, by promoting competition in tandem-switched
transport services and facilitating the use of direct-trunked transport by small IXCs, these measures should help
ensure more rational cost-based pricing relationships between direct-trunked and tandem-switching transport
services, thereby lessening the need for regulatory controls and fostering more efficient use of these services.
All of these benefits should contribute to economic growth_by enabling IXCs to use more efficient transport arrangements,
by fostering better, more reliable, and more rationally priced access services, as well as by creating new market
opportunities for interconnectors.

11. The Commission also concluded that LECs can make signalling information available from their end offices at very
little cost. Indeed, the record indicates that the costs to LECs of providing such information from end offices may
well be 

de minimis,

 involving only a simple change in the end office routing table. The Commission stated that while a few LECs baldly assert
that the costs of providing signalling could be significant, these LECs do not substantiate their allegations with
cost estimates or data. Nor do they distinguish between end-office generated and tandem-generated signalling information.
The Commission found that moreover, no party has shown that the necessary modifications to LEC billing systems would
be unreasonably costly or burdensome, or that the asserted need to change industry standards to accommodate the passage
of CIC and OZZ codes over Feature Group D represents a significant barrier to the implementation of this proposal.
The Commission concluded that any such measures could be accomplished without undue burden or cost.

12. The Commission stated that it was not persuaded that competitive tandem switching services would require assignment
of CICs to IXCs. The record fails to indicate that any entity would actually seek to offer or use that kind of routing
dynamic. Even without additional CIC assignments, IXCs would be able to designate a primary route and an overflow
route for their traffic, thereby securing the benefits of both route and carrier diversity. Moreover, IXCs could
vary routing between a LEC and third party tandem on an end-office-by-end-office basis or, perhaps, based on OZZ codes_thereby
designating one as primary for a particular type of traffic and another for a different type of traffic. No IXC indicates
that these options are insufficient, at least for now. Therefore, the Commission found, no additional CIC code assignments
would have to be made to accommodate competitive tandem-switched networks.

13. The Commission also found that the record belies any contention that third parties do not really want signalling
information and that IXCs do not really want to use competitively-provided tandem-switching services. The Commission
found that the vast majority of parties, including IXCs, CAPs, users, and some LECs, argue that unbundled signalling
information would allow development of alternatives to LEC tandem-switched transport services and they urge us
to make such information available. The Commission stated that even if the measures that it now takes do not produce
an immediate change in the access market, they will be beneficial in the long-term. By eliminating barriers to competition
in the provision of tandem-switched services, this action will pave the way to a more competitive access market in
the future. The Commission also stated that the availability of signalling information to third parties could, in
itself and even without actual entry into the market by competitive tandem-switching providers, subject LEC pricing
to some additional competitive pressures. Since the costs of providing signalling information from equal access
end offices are so small, the Commission concluded, these benefits are well worth the costs. The Commission also stated
that LECs should be required to offer signalling information from equal access end offices is not based on application
of the test that governs LEC BSE offerings since signalling information is not a BSE, but that, nevertheless, its conclusion
was based on the same type of cost/benefit considerations.

14. The Commission stated that it appears that providing signalling information from LEC tandems would require software
upgrades to those tandems. In addition, the record indicates that tandem-provided signalling may be of less utility
to TSPs than end office-provided signalling. Although some parties claim generally that tandem-provided signalling
could provide a useful adjunct to other forms of interconnection, they do not explain with any specificity how they
could use such an architecture, or how a two-tandem architecture could actually be competitively viable, either
from a service quality or pricing standpoint. Therefore, based on the current record, the Commission did not require
LECs to provide this service at this time.
15. The Commission clarified that in proposing access to LEC signalling information from LEC end offices and tandems,
it did not intend to require LECs to reconfigure their SS7 networks. Thus, the Commission held that LECs may provide
end-office-generated signalling information through STPs, and they may require TSPs that are terminating traffic
to transmit signalling formation to LEC end offices through LEC STPs. The Commission recognized that STPs perform
important network screening functions and did not require LECs to decentralize those functions by deploying them
in every switch. Moreover, the record does not indicate that TSPs would seek to interconnect via SS7 at end offices,
rather than at STPs. Rather, as some parties pointed out, it would be far more efficient for them to interconnect at
STPs.
16. Regarding billing of terminating traffic, the Commission stated that, consistent with its earlier expanded
interconnection measures, the customer of record of the terminating LEC should be billed by the terminating LEC for
services provided by that LEC. If the TSP is the customer of record, the LEC should bill the TSP directly. If the TSP's
customer is the customer of record, then the TSP must provide the LEC with billing tapes so that the LEC may properly
count and bill access minutes. The Commission rejected the suggestion of some LECs that all discrepancies between
TSP-provided billing tapes and LEC billing records be resolved in favor of the LECs. The Commission stated that TSPs
and LECs can and should establish fair and reasonable procedures to resolve billing discrepancies.
17. The Commission stated that it does not base its decision that LECs must, in some instances, accept billing tapes
from TSPs on a co-carrier model. It required LECs to make signalling information available to any third party, not
just providers of competitive tandem-switched transport services. Thus, small IXCs may use signalling information
as a way to aggregate their traffic on direct-trunked transport facilities purchased from a LEC so that they can enjoy
the same scale economies as larger IXCs. In that situation, the IXC ordering the signalling and transport would be
a reseller or aggregator, not a co-carrier. Indeed, if the meet-point billing model applied, TSPs would not be able
to purchase direct-trunked transport from a LEC, since LEC tandem-switched transport rates to the ``meet-point''
would apply.


Collocation


18. The Commission affirmed its tentative conclusion that physical collocation of switching equipment should not
be required. Virtually every commenter that addressed this issue supported the tentative conclusion and the reasoning
behind it. Thus, the parties agreed that there is no competitive or technical benefit to locating switching equipment
in LEC offices; that switching equipment is too large and too heavy to be collocated in LEC space; and that interconnectors
would prefer to place their switching equipment on their own premises for monitoring purposes. The Commission found
that the arguments offered in support of mandatory collocation were not convincing. It stated that no one has shown
why the line-drawing process between switching and transmission equipment would be unmanageable or that collocation
is necessary to ensure fair and nondiscriminatory treatment of interconnectors by LECs. The Commission's tariffing
and general nondiscrimination requirements should provide sufficient protection against unfair or unreasonably
discriminatory LEC rates and practices.


Pricing


19. The Commission concluded that LEC provision of CIC and OZZ data to TSPs from LEC end offices will constitute a new
service under the price caps regime, which covers all Tier 1 LECs. New services add to the range of options already available
to customers. While LECs currently transmit CIC and OZZ codes to their own access tandems, they do not provide this
information to their customers. Therefore, these data add to the range of options of LEC customers and hence represent
a new service. While LECs appear to be able to provide this new service without implementing new technology, the need_or
absence of need_for new technology does not dictate the categorization of the service under price caps. Rather, this
factor affects the costs and thus the price that LECs may charge for a new service.

<TEXT>
 

20. LECs will be required to make a cost-based showing under the price caps new services test. This showing will enable
the Commission to ensure that signalling services are reasonably priced. The Commission will not use the net revenue
test in reviewing LEC tariff filings. The Commission stated that this is consistent with its decision to eliminate
the net revenue test for new service offerings under price caps. That test is unnecessary, both because of the Commission's
requirement that LECs submit cost support for new services, and because LECs clearly lack incentives to underprice
signalling services provided to competitive tandem-switching providers.
21. The Commission concluded further that LECs must establish new rate elements for CIC and OZZ signalling data as
a separate service category within the trunking basket. This category will be subject to an upper pricing band of 2%.
The Commission stated that because LECs have no incentive to price signalling services at predatory levels, it saw
no need for a lower band and therefore did not impose one. The Commission believes that these measures are necessary
to prevent LECs from offsetting increases in the price of signalling information provided to TSPs with price reductions
in the LECs' own tandem-switched transport rates.
22. The Commission found that the co-carrier model does not aptly define the LEC/TSP relationship. It found that even
though the Commission has stated in the past that cellular service providers are like co-carriers, it has never held
that cellular interconnection charges should be imposed on all LEC customers or on all cellular users, rather than
on the providers taking interconnection. Thus, a co-carrier model does not necessarily dictate that the costs unique
to providing a joint service should always be directly imposed on the LEC's customers or on all customers of the service
in question. The Commission also stated that a cost recovery mechanism that would have all purchasers of switched
transport or tandem-switched transport bear the costs of making signalling information available to TSPs, is inappropriate
and that instead, TSPs should pay for such costs. The Commission found that this is consistent with its long-held view
that costs should be paid by the cost causer.


Recovery of Support Flows


23. The Commission stated that it appears from the record that there is no need for additional support mechanisms in
conjunction with adoption of this Order. The transport interconnection charge is sufficient to protect support
flows potentially affected by this decision.


ONA Framework


24. The Commission concluded that unbundled CIC and OZZ data are not BSEs as defined in its ONA orders and that there
is no public policy reason to treat them equivalently. BSEs are ``optional unbundled features . . .
that an ESP may require or find useful in configuring an enhanced service.''
 The Commission found that there has been no showing that the CIC and OZZ data that are the subject of the Order will be
used by ESPs to provide enhanced services. Rather, these data will be used by TSPs to provide basic network services.
Thus, these data do not fall within the Commission's definition of a BSE.




25. The Commission also found that no party demonstrated that it would be in the public interest to treat CIC and OZZ
codes as BSEs. The Commission stated that while some parties argued that the four-part test that LECs use in determining
whether to offer an ESP-requested BSE should apply, it has relied on similar considerations in assessing the relative
costs and benefits of LEC-provided signalling information. The Commission also stated that the ``flagging'' requirements
associated with BSEs, under which BOCs must identify BSEs that they intend to use themselves, are irrelevant: There
is no dispute that LECs use CIC and OZZ data for tandem-switched transport service. The Commission also found that
there would be no added benefit from a pricing standpoint in treating CIC and OZZ data as BSEs, since it has already held
that the new services test applies to their initial rates.


Tariffing and Implementation


26. The Commission required Tier 1 LECs (except NECA members) to file tariffs, with requisite cost support, for the
provision of CIC and OZZ codes within ninety days from publication of this Order in the 

Federal Register

, to be effective on forty-five days' notice. The Commission found that the record in this proceeding shows that LECs
can provide CIC and OZZ codes to third parties from equal access end offices simply by modifying their end office routing
tables, without purchasing new end office software and without making other costly and time-consuming modifications.
The Commission concluded that under the circumstances, there is no reason why the LECs cannot tariff this offering
for all of their equal access end offices within ninety days of publication of this Order in the 

Federal Register

.


LEC Pricing Flexibility


27. The Commission did not grant LECs additional pricing flexibility but stated that it will continue to examine these
issues in a broader context in future consideration of pending access reform petitions. The Commission also stated
that it has already addressed virtually all of the specific proposals suggested by LECs in the 

Switched Transport Expanded Interconnection Order

 and the 

First Transport Reconsideration.

 Thus, LECs may offer density zone pricing and volume and term discounts under certain conditions. In addition, they
may price transport between their tandems and SWCs on a flat-rate basis. The Commission also stated that it had considered
and rejected in the 

Switched Transport Expanded Interconnection Order

 various other requests for flexibility. For example, the Commission rejected the suggestion that LECs receive the
same pricing flexibility as their competitors, noting that giving LECs too much flexibility could stifle competitive
entry and harm customers of less competitive services. The Commission also declined to eliminate service category
pricing bands, stating that these bands serve important public policy goals. The Commission found that no party had
shown that providing signalling information to TSPs warrants a different outcome. Nor had any party set forth any
other specific pricing flexibility request related to providing signalling information. The Commission also found
that no party had demonstrated that the availability of signalling information warrants authorization of LEC contract
tariffs. The Commission has limited contract carriage to services found to be ``substantially competitive.'' The
Commission concluded that while the measures it now takes should permit alternatives to LEC tandem-switched access
services to develop, it could not conclude that these services are now subject to substantial competition.
28. The Commission concluded that for these reasons, it would not to grant LECs additional pricing flexibility in
conjunction with its decision to make tandem signalling information available. The Commission stated, however,
that this decision is not intended to prejudge broader questions regarding the possible need for access charge reform.
The Commission stated that by opening the door to greater competition in the provision of tandem-switched services,
it is continuing the process of removing barriers to the development of a more competitive access market in which CAPs
and other entities can participate.

Other Issues





Reciprocity





29. The Commission declined to impose reciprocal signalling obligations on interconnectors at this time. It found,
first, that requests for reciprocal obligations are beyond the scope of this proceeding. The 

Notice 

proposed that LECs provide signalling information to third parties. The Commission stated that it did not propose
to impose reciprocal requirements on these third parties, and that it declined to broaden this proceeding to consider
such requirements here. The Commission stated that second, LEC requests for reciprocity seem to assume that only
CAPs will purchase signalling information. As noted, this information must be made available to any interested party,
including IXCs. LECs requesting reciprocity fail to address the implications of their proposal with respect to these
other types of TSPs. The Commission stated that third, except in the few instances where CAPs have end offices, interconnectors
simply do not have the signalling information to provide to the LECs, and the LECs have not demonstrated specific,
present needs for such information. The Commission found furthermore, that TSPs do not possess market power. It stated,
for example, that the Commission had previously declined to impose reciprocal obligations on interconnectors,
noting, 

inter alia, 

that CAPs and other interconnectors do not control bottleneck facilities.




Jurisdictional Measurement and Reporting






30. The Commission found that most parties agree that the customer of record should be responsible for reporting the
PIU factor for terminating traffic when the LEC cannot itself measure jurisdiction. The Commission stated that this
is consistent with existing reporting arrangements that have worked satisfactorily. If the customer of record is
a TSP, it shall be the responsibility of that TSP to compile PIU reports based on data from those to whom it provides tandem-switching.
If the customer of record is an IXC or other purchaser of access, that entity shall continue to provide PIU reports directly
to the LEC providing terminating access.








Separations Issues






31. The Commission concluded that the signalling information requirement does not raise separations issues that
should be referred to a Joint Board. The record does not show that providing signalling information will raise any
significant issues beyond those already referred to the Joint Board in the 

Switched Transport Expanded Interconnection Order. 

As noted, the costs associated with LEC provision of CIC and OZZ codes from equal access end offices should be minimal.
The Commission found that therefore, these costs or the revenues derived from providing signalling information
do not require Joint Board consideration. The 

Notice 

stated that the Commission did not intend to refer to the Joint Board broader separations issues. The Commission stated
that these matters would be more properly addressed in the context of a comprehensive separations review proceeding.








Conclusion







32. The Commission concluded that in this Order, it took another step in its ongoing effort to promote competition
in the interstate access market. Tier 1 LECs (except NECA members) are required to provide signalling information
from equal access end offices to interested third parties. This measure will allow third parties to provide tandem
switching and thereby promote development of alternatives to LEC-provided tandem-switched transport service.
CAPs may develop their own tandem-switching networks; other TSPs may use tandem-switching to achieve scale economics
attending the aggregation of traffic. The Commission found that by promoting access to diverse facilities and providers,
this action should permit more efficient use and deployment of interstate access services, increase network reliability
and redundancy, encourage innovation, and exert downward pressure on access charges and long-distance rates. These
benefits should, in turn, contribute to economic growth and the creation of new job opportunities.








Regulatory Flexibility Analysis





33. The Commission stated that in the 

Notice, 

it certified that the proposed rule changes would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of
small business entities, as defined by  601(3) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.
 It also stated that the 

Notice 

provided that to the extent that a PIU reporting requirement would apply to small entities, it would not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small business entities. The Commission found that no commenting party
disagreed with its analysis. The Secretary shall send a copy of this Report and Order, including the certification,
to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration in accordance with  605(b) of the Regulatory
Flexibility Act, Public Law 96-354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C.    601

Hazardous Materials Transportation; Registration and Fee Assessment Program 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Research and Special Programs Administration (RSPA), DOT. 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 In July 1992, RSPA published a final rule establishing a national registration and fee assessment program for persons
offering for transportation or transporting certain categories and quantities of hazardous materials in intrastate,
interstate, and foreign commerce. The fees collected under the registration program are to fund a grant program to
enhance State, Indian tribal, and local hazardous materials emergency preparedness and response activities. This
final rule adopts certain changes to the current registration program effective July 1, 1994, the beginning of the
next registration year. The changes delay the requirement for foreign offerors to register and require a merchant
vessel carrier to maintain the Certificate of Registration on board each vessel carrying hazardous materials subject
to the registration requirements or to annotate its registration number on any document readily available to enforcement
personnel. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

1. Background 



On July 9, 1992, RSPA published a final rule under Docket HM-208 (57 FR 30620), establishing a national registration
program, as mandated by Congress in the 1990 amendments to the Hazardous Materials Transportation Act (HMTA), 49
App. U.S.C. 1801 

et seq.

, for persons engaged in the offering for transportation or transportation of certain categories and quantities
of hazardous materials in intrastate, interstate, and foreign commerce. Persons currently subject to the registration
program are required to annually file a registration statement with RSPA and pay an annual fee of $250 to fund a nationwide
emergency response training and planning grant program for States, local governments, and Indian tribes, and a $50
administrative fee to offset DOT processing costs. The fee of $250 is the minimum amount permitted to be collected
for purposes of funding the emergency response preparedness and planning grant program. 

Under the authority of the HMTA, RSPA has developed and implemented a reimbursable emergency preparedness grant
program. The regulations establishing this program were issued in a final rule entitled ``Public Sector Training
and Planning Grants'' under Docket HM-209 on September 17, 1992 (57 FR 43062). The purpose of the grant program
is to provide funds, technical assistance, and support to States, Indian tribes, and political subdivisions to develop,
implement, and improve planning and training programs for emergency responders in the public sector. The funding
for the grant program comes from the fees received from RSPA's registration program. Approximately 26,000 persons
have registered with RSPA for the current registration year, substantially fewer in number than originally anticipated.
RSPA is concerned that many persons who are required to register have not. Therefore, on April 1, 1994, RSPA proposed
two compliance-related requirements in the NPRM to enhance nationwide compliance. 

RSPA proposed that each person who offers or transports a hazardous material for which registration is required may
do so only if both the transporter and the offeror (if required) are registered. They would be required, on an annual
basis, to obtain each other's registration number or a copy of each other's current Certificate of Registration.


Secondly, RSPA decided to further enhance the enforcement of the registration program as it applies to foreign or
domestic merchant vessel carriers. Accordingly, RSPA proposed to require that each merchant vessel carrier carry
a copy of its current Certificate of Registration issued by RSPA or another document bearing the registration number
identified as the ``U.S. DOT Hazmat Reg. No.'' on board each merchant vessel carrying a hazardous material subject
to the registration requirements. 

As discussed in the NPRM, legislation is being considered which would grant DOT the discretionary authority to waive
the registration or fee requirement for any person domiciled outside the United States, if that person's country
does not impose registration or fee requirements on U.S. persons offering hazardous materials to that country (see,
for example, HR 2178 which passed on November 21, 1993). Pending the outcome of these legislative initiatives, RSPA
proposed to further extend the delay in application of the registration program to foreign offerors from July 1, 1994
until July 1, 1996. 



II. Summary of Comments 



Delay in Registering Foreign Offerors 



Commenters overwhelmingly supported RSPA's proposed two-year delay in requiring registration of foreign offerors.
Many commenters recommended that RSPA not implement foreign offeror registration at all because of the possibility
of reciprocal action taken against the United States. A Canadian chemical manufacturers' association noted that
shipments to Canada are exempt from Canadian registration requirements and strongly recommended that Canadian
offerors be afforded reciprocal treatment when shipping to the U.S. Therefore, RSPA is extending, as proposed, the
exemption for foreign offerors from registration and fee requirements until July 1, 1996.

Verification of Registration on Board Vessels 



Several commenters questioned the need for the proposed requirement for vessel carriers to have a copy of a valid registration
certificate or other document displaying a valid registration number on board each vessel. The International Chamber
of Shipping stated that the proposed requirement would add to the paperwork burden on the ship and increase the workload
of the ship's command. This commenter further noted that RSPA already has access to a ship's registration numbers
at the operator's office or at the office of the operator's agent. The Steamship Operators Intermodal Committee claimed
the total population of vessel owners, operators, and their agents is relatively small and readily identifiable.
The U.S. Atlantic and Gulf/Australia New Zealand Conference added that vessels do not present the problems of vast
numbers and mobility presented by motor vehicles. 


Adoption of this requirement could avert potentially significant and costly delays for vessels entering and clearing
U.S. port areas. The marginal cost associated with requiring a transporter's registration number on board a vessel
is clearly outweighed by more significant costs resulting from time-consuming inspections by Coast Guard personnel.
A readily available copy of the certificate of registration or other document indicating a valid registration number
would eliminate any need for communication between the master of the vessel and the vessel owner/lessor (who could
be domiciled in a foreign country) and subsequent inquiries to an agent representing the vessel. Therefore, RSPA
is adopting the proposed requirement for a merchant vessel carrier to maintain the Certificate of Registration or
another document indicating the valid registration number on board each vessel carrying hazardous material subject
to the registration requirements readily available to enforcement personnel. However, because of the brief time
period between publication of this final rule and its effective date, RSPA is providing a delay until January 1, 1995,
to comply with this requirement. 




Other Issues Addressed By Commenters 



Most commenters opposed RSPA's proposal that offerors and transporters check each other's registration status.
Responsibility for enforcing registration requirements, logistical problems, administrative burdens, and increased
costs were the predominant reasons offered by commenters opposing this proposal. 


Commenters overwhelmingly believed that federal and state agencies should be responsible for enforcing the regulations,
not industry. A related concern expressed by commenters is that a person otherwise in compliance with the regulations
could be in violation of the registration requirements by unknowingly doing business with a customer who falsely
claimed to be registered. Furthermore, commenters feared that persons who are in compliance with the registration
requirements and refuse to do business with unregistered customers may lose their customers and revenue to less scrupulous
competitors. 


Administrative burdens were identified as the creation of new databases, maintenance of additional files, and preparation
of correspondence. Increased costs would involve additional function-specific training of personnel to determine
if a shipment is subject to registration, higher clerical expenses for correspondence and recordkeeping, and delays
or cancellations caused by a last-minute exchange of registration information. 


According to many commenters, a ``logistical nightmare'' would result from this proposed requirement, especially
when intermodal transportation is involved. Other complicated situations cited by commenters involve selection
of a transporter by a customer, customer-provided transport vehicles, interlining carriers, and infrequent or
irregular shipments.

<TEXT>
 

Finally, numerous commenters requested a delay in the effective date of this requirement, if adopted, beyond the
beginning of the 1994-95 registration year on July 1, 1994. 

RSPA believes that more time is needed to explore thoroughly the issues and concerns raised by commenters to this proposal;
therefore, the proposal to require verification of registration by a transporter or offeror is not adopted in this
final rule. RSPA anticipates providing a more detailed evaluation of comments and alternatives to this proposed
requirement, clarifying various provisions of the registration program and responding to other miscellaneous
suggestions provided by commenters in a rulemaking action in the near future. 



III. Summary of Regulatory Changes by Section 



Part 107 





Section 107.601

 Paragraph (e) is revised as proposed to clarify the term ``shipment'' as it pertains to the scope of the registration
program. 



Section 107.606

 This section provides exceptions from the registration requirements. In paragraph (f), foreign offerors,
including foreign subsidiaries of U.S. corporations, are excepted from all registration requirements until July
1, 1996. 



Section 107.608

 Paragraph (a) is amended as proposed to remove outdated provisions referring to the first registration year's
compliance dates. 



Section 107.620

 Paragraph (c) is redesignated as paragraph (d). A new paragraph (c) is added to require a merchant vessel carrier
to maintain the Certificate of Registration on board each vessel carrying hazardous materials subject to the registration
requirements or to annotate its registration number on any document readily available to enforcement personnel.
RSPA is providing a delay in compliance with this requirement until January 1, 1995. 



IV. Rulemaking Analyses and Notices 



A. Executive Order 12866 and DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures 



This final rule is not considered a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and
therefore, was not reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget. The rule is not considered a significant rule under
the Regulatory Policies and Procedures of the Department of Transportation (44 FR 11034). A regulatory evaluation
is available for review in the Docket. 



B. Executive Order 12612 



This final rule has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612
(``Federalism''). This registration regulation has no preemptive effect. It does not impair the ability of States,
local governments or Indian tribes to impose their own fees or registration or permit requirements on intrastate,
interstate or foreign offerors or carriers of hazardous materials. 



C. Regulatory Flexibility Act 



I certify that this final rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.
This final rule maintains the minimum fee requirement for all shippers and carriers of hazardous materials who are
subject to the registration requirement. 



D. Paperwork Reduction Act 



Under 49 App. U.S.C. 1805, the information management requirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501


et seq.

) do not apply to this final rule. 



E. Regulation Identifier Number (RIN) 



A regulation identifier number (RIN) is assigned to each regulatory action listed in the Unified Agenda of Federal
Regulations. The Regulatory Information Service Center publishes the Unified Agenda in April and October of each
year. The RIN number contained in the heading of this document can be used to cross-reference this action with the Unified
Agenda.

Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants; Endangered Status for Three Plants From the Waianae Mountains, Island
of Oahu, HI 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) determines endangered status pursuant to the Endangered Species Act
of 1973, as amended (Act), for three plants: 

Cyanea grimesiana 

ssp. 

obatae 

(haha), 

Diellia unisora 

(no common name (NCN)), and 

Gouania vitifolia 

(NCN). These taxa are known primarily from the Waianae Mountain Range, located on the island of Oahu, Hawaii. The three
plant taxa and their habitats have been adversely threatened to varying degrees by one or more of the following_habitat
degradation and competition for space, light, water, and nutrients by naturalized, alien vegetation; and habitat
degradation and potential predation by feral animals. Because of the low number of extant individuals and severely
restricted distributions, populations of these taxa are subject to an increased likelihood of extinction and/or
reduced reproductive vigor from stochastic events. This final rule implements the Federal protection and recovery
provisions provided by the Act.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Background 





Cyanea grimesiana 

ssp. 

obatae 

and 

Diellia unisora 

are endemic to the Waianae Mountain Range on the western side of the island of Oahu, Hawaii. The only known extant population
of 

Gouania vitifolia 

also occurs in the Waianae Mountains, but the species is also known historically from West Maui and the island of Hawaii.


The island of Oahu is formed from the remnants of two large shield volcanoes, the older Waianae Volcano on the west and
the younger Koolau Volcano on the east. Because of the loss of their original shield volcano shape as the result of extensive
erosion, today these volcanoes are called ``mountains'' or ``ranges,'' and consist of long, narrow ridges. The Waianae
Mountains were built by eruptions that took place primarily along three rift zones. The two principal rift zones run
in a northwestward and south-southeastward direction from the summit, and a lesser one runs to the northeast. The
range is approximately 40 miles (mi) (64 kilometers (km)) long. The caldera lies between the north side of Makaha Valley
and the head of Nanakuli Valley (Macdonald 

et al. 

1983). The Waianae Mountains are in the rain shadow of the parallel Koolau Mountains. Except for Mt. Kaala, the highest
point on Oahu (4,020 feet (ft)) (1,225 meters(m)), the Waianaes receive much less rainfall (Wagner 

et al.

 1990). The median annual rainfall for the Waianae Mountains varies from 20 to 75 inches (in.) (50 to 190 centimeters
(cm)), with only the small summit area of Mt. Kaala receiving the highest amount. 

The land that supports these three plant taxa is owned by the State of Hawaii, the Federal government, and a private
estate. Plants on Federal land are located on portions of Lualualei Naval Reservation, under the jurisdiction of
the U.S. Department of Defense
.

Harold St. John (1978) described 

Cyanea grimesiana

 ssp. 

obatae

 based upon a specimen collected by John K. Obata in the Kaluaa Gulch of the Waianae Mountains, Oahu, in 1965. St. John
named the subspecies in honor of its discoverer. 


Cyanea grimesiana

 ssp. 

obatae

, a member of the bellflower family (Campanulaceae), is a shrub, usually unbranched, growing from 3.3 to 10.5 ft (1
to 3.2 m) tall. Its leaves are 10.5 to 23 in. (27 to 58 cm) long by 5.5 to 12.5 in. (14 to 32 cm) wide and are deeply cut into
9 to 12 lobes per side. The plant usually has small prickles on its stem and leaves. Clusters of 6 to 12 stalked flowers
arise from the leaf axils. Sepals are fused to the ovary forming a cup 0.3 to 0.6 in. (0.7 to 1.6 cm) long with small, narrow,
triangular lobes at the tips. The petals are purplish or greenish to yellow-white, often washed or striped with magenta,
and are about 2 to 3 in. (5.5 to 8 cm) long and 0.2 to 0.4 in. (0.5 to 1 cm) wide. Fruits are elliptical orange berries, 0.7
to 1.2 in. (1.8 to 3 cm) long. This subspecies can be distinguished from the other two subspecies by its short, narrow,
calyx lobes which are not fused or overlapping (Lammers 1990, St. John 1978). 
Historically, 

C. grimesiana

 ssp. 

obatae

 is known from the southern Waianae Mountains from Puu Hapapa to Kaaikukai (Hawaii Heritage Program (HHP) 1992a1 to
1992a6, Lammers 1990), a distance of about 4 mi (6.5 km). This taxon is known to be extant in Kaluaa Gulch, but may also
still exist in Ekahanui and North Palawai Gulches. All populations are on privately owned land (HHP 1992a2, 1992a4,
1992a6; Joel Lau, The Nature Conservancy, Steve Perlman, National Tropical Botanical Garden, and Loyal Mehrhoff,
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, pers. comms., 1993). Five plants are known from the Kaluaa population and as many as
13 plants may be found in the other 2 populations (J. Lau, pers. comms., 1992, 1993), though these populations have
not been seen in the last 10 years. 

C. grimesiana

 ssp. 

obatae

 typically grows on steep, moist, shaded slopes in diverse mesic to wet forests at an elevation of 1,800 to 2,200 ft (550
to 670 m) (HHP 1992a2, Lammers 1990). Associated plants include both native and introduced species such as 

Pipturus albidus

 (mamaki), 

Charpentiera

 (papala), 

Claoxylon sandwicense

 (po'ola), 

Pisonia

 (papala kepau), 

Acacia koa

 (koa), 

Aleurites moluccana

 (kukui), 

Cyanea membranacea

 (haha), and various fern taxa (HHP 1992a2). The major threats to 

C. grimesiana

 ssp. 

obatae

 are competition from alien plants such as 

Clidemia hirta

 (Koster's curse) and 

Schinus terebinthifolius

 (Christmas berry), predation of seeds or fruits by introduced slugs, and stochastic extinction and/or reduced reproductive
vigor due to the small number of extant individuals (HHP 1992a2; L. Mehrhoff, pers. comm., 1993). Habitat degradation
by feral pigs is a potential threat (HHP 1992a2). 
Donald L. Topping discovered 

Diellia unisora

 growing on a shaded, mossy bank in Pohakea Pass, Waianae Mountains, Oahu, in 1932. It was first reported and illustrated
by Frances Smith (1934) who believed it to be a specimen of 

D. pumila

, although she pointed out several differences between that species and the Topping specimen. Warren H. Wagner, Jr.,
believing that the plant discovered by Topping merited specific recognition, described the new species, giving
it the specific epithet 

unisora

 in reference to the usually single, marginal spore-producing body (Wagner 1951). 



Diellia unisora

, in the fern family Polypodiaceae, grows from a slender, erect rhizome (underground stem), 0.2 to 1.2 in. (0.5 to 3
cm) tall and 0.2 to 0.4 in. (0.5 to 1 cm) in diameter, which is covered with the bases of the leaf stalks and a few small black
scales. Stalks of the fronds are black and shiny, and about 0.8 to 2 in. (2 to 5 cm) long. The fronds are linear, 3 to 12 in.
(8 to 30 cm) tall by 0.2 to 1.2 in. (0.5 to 3 cm) broad, with 20 to 35 pinnae (leaflets) per side, and gradually narrowing
towards the apex. The pinnae are usually strongly asymmetrical in outline, unequally triangular, with mostly entire
(smooth) margins. There usually is a single marginal sorus (the spore-producing body) running along the upper margin
of the underside of the pinna. This species is distinguished from others in the genus by a rhizome completely covered
by the persisting bases of the leaf stalks, and few, very small scales, by sori mostly confined to the upper pinnae margins,
and by delicate fronds gradually and symmetrically narrowing toward the apex (Wagner 1951, 1952). 
Historically, 

D. unisora

 was known from steep, grassy, rocky slopes on the western side of the Waianae Mountains, Oahu (HHP 1992b1 to 1992b4;
Wagner 1951, 1952). This species is known to be extant in three areas of the southern Waianae Mountains_South Ekahanui
Gulch, Palawai Gulch, and the Pualii-Napepeiauolelo Ridge (HHP 1992b2 to 1992b4). The three known populations,
which are on Lualualei Naval Reservation and on privately owned land, are scattered over a distance of about 2 mi (3
km), and contain approximately 705 to 755 individuals (Center for Plant Conservation 1992; HHP 1992b2 to 1992b4;
J. Lau, pers. comm., 1993). 

Diellia unisora

 is a terrestrial fern which typically grows in deep shade or open understory in dryland forest at an elevation of 1,750
to 2,500 ft (530 to 760 m) (HHP 1992b2 to 1992b4). Associated species include koa, Christmas berry, 

Psidium cattleianum

 (strawberry guava), and 

Metrosideros polymorpha

 ('ohi'a), and a mixture of alien and native grasses, forbs, and shrubs (HHP 1992b2 to 1992b4). The major threat to 

D. unisora

 is competition from alien plant taxa (Christmas berry, 

Melinus minutiflora

 (molasses grass),

 (huehue haole), and (strawberry guava). Habitat degradation by feral pigs is a potential threat (HHP 1992b2, 1992b4).

Gouania vitifolia

 was first collected on dry hills in the district of Waianai [Waianae] during the U.S. Exploring Expedition in 1840.
Asa Gray was given the task of preparing a report on all of the foreign plants collected by the expedition. Of the two
volumes he produced concerning these specimens, only one was published, and in it 

G. vitifolia

 was described as a new species (Gray 1854). The species epithet was derived from the Latin 

vitis

, a vine or grapevine, and 

folium

, leaf, as the toothed leaves of this species resemble those of the grape. The Maui Island population of this species,
first collected above Lahaina on West Maui by Edward F. Bishop, probably in the 1870s, was described and named 

G. bishopii

 in honor of its discoverer by William Hillebrand (1888). In his monograph of the genus, St. John (1969) described 

G. hawaiiensis

 as a new species based upon a collection made in the Kau District of Hawaii Island in 1853 by Jules Remy. Both of these
taxa are currently considered synonyms of 

G. vitifolia

 (Wagner 

et al.

 1990). 


Gouania vitifolia

, a member of the buckthorn family (Rhamnaceae), is a climbing shrub or woody vine with tendrils. Leaves are papery
in texture with a moderate to dense covering of short, soft hairs on both surfaces. The leaves are elliptic to broadly
oval in outline with toothed or lobed margins and 1.2 to 3.2 in. (3 to 8 cm) long by 0.8 to 1.9 in. (2 to 4.8 cm) wide. Flowers
are arranged in axillary spikes 0.3 to 2.8 in. (0.8 to 7 cm) long. The flowers are small with sepals and petals ranging
from 0.03 to 0.04 in. (0.7 to 1.1 mm) in length. Both the sepals and petals are white. The 2- or 3-winged fruit are about
0.4 in. (9 to 10 mm) long. Seeds are oval, glossy, dark brown, and about 0.1 to 0.2 in. (3.4 to 5 mm) long. This species is
the only Hawaiian member of the genus with tendrils and toothed leaf margins (St. John 1969, Wagner 

et al.

 1990). 
Historically, 

G. vitifolia

 was known from West Maui, the Kau District of the island of Hawaii, and the northwestern portion of the Waianae Mountains
in Makaleha, Keaau, and Waianae Kai Valleys (Degener and Greenwell 1947, HHP 1992c1 to 1992c5, St John 1969, Wagner


et al.

 1990). A single population of five individuals was discovered in 1990 on the slopes of Waianae Kai Ridge on State-owned
land (Anon. 1991, HHP 1992c5). The five plants are close to one another, growing in a single patch in a forest of mostly
naturalized, non-native taxa (HHP 1992c5), and may represent clones of a single individual (Joel Lau, HHP, pers.
comm., 1992). A second, smaller patch was discovered near the first, and probably represents a second clone. Information
is scant, but data from herbarium labels indicate that 

G. vitifolia

 prefers dry, rocky ridges and slopes in dry shrubland or dry to mesic forests at an elevation of about 2,000 ft (610 m).
Associated taxa include strawberry guava, kukui, Christmas berry, huehue haole, and mamaki (HHP 1992c5). The major
threats to 

G. vitifolia

 are competition from alien plant taxa such as strawberry guava and Christmas berry, habitat destruction by feral
pigs, and stochastic extinction and/or reduced reproductive vigor due to the small number of extant individuals,
all of which may be genetically identical (HHP 1992c5). 


Previous Federal Action 


Federal action on these plants began as a result of section 12 of the Endangered Species Act (16 U.S.C. 1531 

et seq

.), which directed the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution to prepare a report on plants considered to be endangered,
threatened, or extinct in the United States. This report, designated as House Document No. 94-51, was presented
to Congress on January 9, 1975. 

Diellia unisora

 was considered threatened and 

Gouania vitifolia

 was considered extinct in that document. On July 1, 1975, the Service published a notice in the 

Federal Register

 (40 FR 27823) of its acceptance of the Smithsonian report as a petition within the context of section 4(c)(2) (now section
4(b)(3)) of the Act, and giving notice of its intention to review the status of the plant species named therein. As a
result of that review, on June 16, 1976, the Service published a proposed rule in the 

Federal Register

 (41 FR 24523) to determine endangered status pursuant to section 4 of the Act for approximately 1,700 vascular plant
species. 

Gouania vitifolia

 was considered endangered in the proposed rule, but 

D. unisora

, as a threatened species, was not included. The list of 1,700 plant species was assembled on the basis of comments and
data received by the Smithsonian Institution and the Service in response to House Document No. 94-51 and the
July 1, 1975, 

Federal Register

 publication. 
General comments received in response to the 1976 proposal are summarized in an April 26, 1978, 

Federal Register

 publication (43 FR 17909). In 1978, amendments to the Act required that all proposals over 2 years old be withdrawn.
A 1-year grace period was given to proposals already over 2 years old. On December 10, 1979, the Service published a
notice in the 

Federal Register

 (44 FR 70796) withdrawing the portion of the June 16, 1976, proposal that had not been made final, along with four other
proposals that had expired. The Service published updated notices of review for plants on December 15, 1980 (45 FR
82479), September 27, 1985 (50 FR 39525), and February 21, 1990 (55 FR 6183). 

Gouania vitifolia

 was included as a Category 1* species on all three notices of review. Category 1* species are those for which the Service
has on file substantial information on biological vulnerability and threats in the recent past, but which may have
already become extinct. Because a population of 

G. vitifolia

 was discovered in 1990, it is considered herein for listing. 

Diellia unisora

 was considered a Category 1 species on the 1980 and 1985 notices, but was changed to a Category 1* species on the 1990
notice. Category 1 species are those for which the Service has on file substantial information on biological vulnerability
and threats to support preparation of listing proposals. 

Cyanea grimesiana

 ssp. 

obatae

 first appeared on the 1990 notice, as a category 2 species. Category 2 species are those for which there is some evidence
of vulnerability, but for which there are not enough data to support listing proposals at the time. Additional recently
acquired biological information supports listing of 

C. grimesiana

 ssp. 

obatae

. The September 30, 1993, 

Federal Register

 (58 FR 51143) notice of review indicated all three of these species were proposed for listing.

Section 4(b)(3)(B) of the Act requires the Secretary to make findings on certain pending petitions within 12 months
of their receipt. Section 2(b)(1) of the 1982 amendments further requires that all petitions pending on October 13,
1982, be treated as having been newly submitted on that date. On October 13, 1983, the Service found that the petitioned
listing of these species was warranted but precluded by other pending listing actions, in accordance with section
4(b)(3)(B)(iii) of the Act; notification of this finding was published on January 20, 1984 (49 FR 2485). Such a finding
requires the petition to be recycled, pursuant to section 4(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Act. The finding was reviewed in October
of 1984, 1985, 1986, 1987, 1988, 1989, 1990, and 1991. Publication of the proposed rule constituted the final 1-year
finding for these species. 

On December 14, 1992, the Service published in the 

Federal Register

 (57 FR 39066) a proposal to list the three plant taxa from the Waianae Mountains, island of Oahu, as endangered. This
proposal was based primarily on information supplied by the Hawaii Heritage Program and observations by botanists
and naturalists. The Service now determines the three species primarily from the Waianae Mountains to be endangered
with the publication of this final rule. 



Summary of Comments and Recommendations 



In the December 14, 1992, proposed rule and associated notifications, all interested parties were requested to submit
factual reports or information that might contribute to the development of a final listing decision. The public comment
period ended on January 28, 1993. Appropriate State agencies, county governments, Federal agencies, scientific
organizations, and other interested parties were contacted and requested to comment. A newspaper notice inviting
public comment was published in the ``Honolulu Advertiser'' on December 26, 1993. Two letters of comment were received_one
from a conservation organization and the other from a concerned citizen_supporting the listing of these taxa from
the Waianae Mountains, island of Oahu, but raising no specific issues. 




Summary of Factors Affecting the Species 




Section 4 of the Act and regulations (50 CFR Part 424) promulgated to implement the Act set forth the procedures for
adding species to the Federal lists. A species may be determined to be an endangered or threatened species due to one
or more of the five factors described in section 4(a)(1). These factors and their application to 

Cyanea grimesiana

 ssp. 

obatae

 St. John (haha), 

Diellia unisora

 W.H. Wagner (no common name (NCN)), and 

Gouania vitifolia

 A. Gray (NCN) are as follows (Table 1):

A. 

The present or threatened destruction, modification, or curtailment of its habitat or range.

 The habitats of the plants included in this final rule have undergone extreme alteration because of past and present
land management practices, including deliberate alien plant and animal introductions, agricultural development,
and military use (Frierson 1973, Wagner 

et al.

 1985). Competition with alien plants and degradation of habitat by feral pigs are considered the greatest present
threats to the three taxa. 


All of the three species are threatened by competition from one or more alien plant taxa. 

Schinus terebinthifolius

 (Christmas berry), an aggressive tree introduced to Hawaii before 1911 as an ornamental, has had particularly detrimental
impacts (Cuddihy and Stone 1990). This fast-growing alien plant is able to form dense thickets, displacing other
plants, and also may release a chemical that inhibits the growth of other species (Smith 1985). As early as the 1940s,
Christmas berry had invaded the dry slopes of Oahu and it is now replacing the native vegetation of much of the southern
Waianae Mountains (Cuddihy and Stone 1990). Christmas berry is gradually invading other areas of the Waianae Mountains
as well, and now threatens to occupy the habitat of the three endangered plant taxa (HHP 1992a2, 1992b2 to 1992b4, 1992c5).




Psidium cattleianum

 (strawberry guava), a pervasive alien tree in the southern Waianae Mountains, is distributed mainly by feral pigs
and fruit-eating birds (Smith 1985). Like Christmas berry, strawberry guava is capable of forming dense stands to
the exclusion of other plant taxa (Cuddihy and Stone 1990). Populations of 

Diellia unisora

 and 

Gouania vitifolia

 are immediately threatened by competition with this alien plant (HHP 1992b3, 1992c5). 



Clidemia hirta

 (Koster's curse), a noxious shrub first cultivated in Wahiawa on Oahu, spread to the Koolau Mountains in the early
1960s, where it is now rapidly displacing native vegetation. Koster's curse spread to the Waianae Mountains around
1970 and is now widespread throughout Honouliuli (Cuddihy and Stone 1990, Culliney 1988). This species forms a dense
understory, shading other plants and hindering plant regeneration. At present, Koster's curse is the major threat
to 

Cyanea grimesiana

 ssp. 

obatae 

(HHP 1992a2). 


The native vegetation of the leeward ridges of the Waianae Mountains is being replaced by 

Melinus minutiflora

 (molasses grass), another aggressive alien plant species. Molasses grass ranges from the dry lowlands to the lower
wet forests, especially in open areas with sparse vegetation. This fire-adapted grass produces a dense mat capable
of smothering plants, provides fuel for fires, and carries fires into areas with native woody plants (Cuddihy and
Stone 1990). One population of 

Diellia unisora

 is vulnerable to molasses grass (HHP 1992b2, 1992b4). 




Passiflora suberosa

 (huehue haole), a vine that smothers small plants in the subcanopy of dryland habitats (Smith 1985), poses an immediate
threat to some populations of 

Diellia unisora

 (HHP 1992b2, 1992b3). With its major infestations in the Waianae Mountains, it is also a probable threat to the only
known extant population of 
Gouania vitifolia (HHP 1992c5).

Feral pigs (

Sus scrofa

) have been in the Waianae Mountains for about 150 years and are known to be one of the major current modifiers of forest
habitats (Stone 1985). Pigs damage the native vegetation by rooting and trampling the forest floor and encourage
the expansion of alien plants that are better able to exploit the newly tilled soils than are native taxa (Stone 1985).
Pigs also disseminate alien plant taxa through their feces and on their bodies, accelerating the spread of alien plant
taxa within the native forest. Present throughout the Waianae Mountains in low numbers, feral pigs pose a potential
threat as some pig trails and rooting have been seen in the general areas of all three plant taxa included in this rule.
The rooting was localized and no direct damage to any of the three plant taxa was noted. However, this situation could
change very quickly (HHP 1992a2, 1992b2, 1992b3, 1992c5). 

B. 

Overutilization for commercial, recreational, scientific, or educational purposes.

 Illegal collecting for scientific or horticultural purposes or excessive visits by individuals interested in seeing
rare plants could result from increased publicity. This is a potential threat to all of the taxa included in this final
rule, but especially to 

Cyanea grimesiana

 ssp. 

obatae,

 which is known from only a single population of five plants, and 

Gouania vitifolia,

 which is known from only one population of two probable clones. Collection of whole plants or reproductive parts of
these taxa could cause an adverse impact on the gene pool and threaten the survival of the taxa. Disturbance to the area
by human trampling also could promote erosion and greater ingress by competing alien taxa. 

C. 

Disease or predation.

 Introduced slugs have been observed to feed on ripe fruits and seeds of 

Cyanea grimesiana

 ssp. 

obatae.

 This predation could seriously affect the reproduction of this taxon (L. Mehrhoff, pers. comm., 1993). In addition,
rats (

Rattus

 spp.) and feral goats (

Capra hircus

), as well as feral pigs, are known from the area and damage to fruits, seeds, and plants from their foraging on other
plant taxa has been observed. 

D. 

The inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms.

 Of the three taxa in this final rule, two have populations located on private land, one on State land, and one on Federal
land. 

Diellia unisora

 is known only from Federal and private lands; 

Gouania vitifolia

 is known only from State land; 

Cyanea grimesiana

 ssp. 

obatae

 is known only from private lands. Federal listing automatically results in listing under Hawaii State law, which
prohibits taking of endangered plants in the State and encourages conservation by State agencies. State regulations
prohibit the removal, destruction, or damage of plants found on State lands. However, the regulations are difficult
to enforce because of limited personnel. Hawaii's Endangered Species Act (HRS, Sect. 195D-4(a)) states, ``Any
species of aquatic life, wildlife, or wild plant that has been determined to be an endangered species pursuant to the
[Federal] Endangered Species Act shall be deemed to be an endangered species under the provisions of this chapter
* * *'' Further, the State may enter into agreements with Federal agencies to administer and manage
any area required for the conservation, management, enhancement, or protection of endangered species (HRS, sect.
195D-5(c)). Funds for these activities could be made available under section 6 of the Federal Act (State Cooperative
Agreements). Listing of these three plant taxa, therefore, reinforces and supplements the protection available
to the taxa under State law. The Federal Act also offers additional protection to these three taxa because it is a violation
of the Act for any person to remove, cut, dig up, damage, or destroy any such plant in an area not under Federal jurisdiction
in knowing violation of State law or regulation or in the course of any violation of a State criminal trespass law. 

E. 

Other natural or manmade factors affecting its continued existence.

 The small number of populations and individuals of all of these taxa increases the potential for extinction from stochastic
events. The limited gene pool may depress reproductive vigor, or a single human-caused or natural environmental
disturbance could destroy a significant percentage of the individuals or the only known extant population. All three
taxa in this rule are known from three or fewer populations. 

The Service has carefully assessed the best scientific and commercial information available regarding the past,
present, and future threats faced by these taxa in determining to issue this final rule. Based on this evaluation,
the preferred action is to list these three plant taxa as endangered. These taxa are known from fewer than five populations.
The three taxa are threatened by one or more of the following: Habitat degradation and competition from alien plants;
habitat degradation and potential predation by feral animals, particularly pigs; and lack of legal protection or
difficulty in enforcing laws which are already in effect. Small population size and limited distribution make these
taxa particularly vulnerable to extinction and/or reduced reproductive vigor from stochastic events. Because
these three taxa are in danger of extinction throughout all or a significant portion of their ranges, they fit the definition
of endangered as defined in the Act.

Critical habitat is not being designated for the three taxa included in this rule, for reasons discussed in the ``Critical
Habitat'' section of this final rule. 



Critical Habitat 



Section 4(a)(3) of the Act, as amended, requires that, to the maximum extent prudent and determinable, the Secretary
designate critical habitat at the time a species is listed as endangered or threatened. The Service finds that designation
of critical habitat is not presently prudent for these taxa. The publication of precise maps and descriptions of critical
habitat in the 

Federal Register

 and local newspapers as required in a proposal for critical habitat would increase the degree of threat to these plants
from take or vandalism and, therefore, could contribute to their decline and increase enforcement problems. The
listing of these taxa as endangered publicizes the rarity of the plants and thus can make these plants attractive to
researchers, curiosity seekers, or collectors of rare plants. All involved parties and the major landowners have
been notified of the importance of protecting the habitat of these taxa. Protection of the habitat of the taxa will
be addressed through the recovery process. Although one of these taxa is located on a federally owned military reservation,
it is on steep slopes near the reservation boundaries where it is unlikely to be impacted by Federal activities. Therefore,
the Service finds that designation of critical habitat for these taxa is not prudent at this time, because such designation
would increase the degree of threat from vandalism, collecting, or other human activities and because it is unlikely
to aid in the conservation of these taxa. 



Available Conservation Measures 



Conservation measures provided to species listed as endangered under the Endangered Species Act include recognition,
recovery actions, requirements for Federal protection, and prohibitions against certain activities. Recognition
through listing results in public awareness and conservation actions by Federal, State, and local agencies, private
organizations, and individuals. The Act provides for possible land acquisition and cooperation with the State and
requires that recovery actions be carried out for all listed species. The protection required of Federal agencies
and the prohibitions against certain activities involving listed plants are discussed, in part, below. 

Section 7(a) of the Act, as amended, requires Federal agencies to evaluate their actions with respect to any species
that is proposed or listed as endangered and with respect to its critical habitat, if any is being designated. Regulations
implementing this interagency cooperation provision of the Act are codified at 50 CFR part 402. Section 7(a)(4) requires
Federal agencies to confer informally with the Service on any action that is likely to jeopardize the continued existence
of species proposed for listing or result in destruction or adverse modification of proposed critical habitat. If
a species is listed subsequently, section 7(a)(2) requires Federal agencies to insure that activities they authorize,
fund, or carry out are not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of the species or to destroy or adversely modify
its critical habitat. If a Federal action may affect a listed species or its critical habitat, the responsible Federal
agency must enter into formal consultation with the Service. One of these plant taxa. 

Diellia unisora,

 is located on the Lualualei Naval Reservation under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Department of Defense. However,
because the plant is located on steep slopes near the reservation boundaries, it is unlikely to be impacted by Federal
activities. There are no other known Federal activities that occur within the present known habitat of these three
plant taxa. 

The Act and its implementing regulations found at 50 CFR 17.61, 17.62, and 17.63 set forth a series of general prohibitions
and exceptions that apply to all endangered plant species. With respect to the three endangered plant taxa, all prohibitions
of section 9(a)(2) of the Act, implemented by 50 CFR 17.61, would apply. These prohibitions, in part, make it illegal
with respect to any endangered plant for any person subject to the jurisdiction of the United States to import or export;
transport in interstate or foreign commerce in the course of a commercial activity; sell or offer for sale in interstate
or foreign commerce; remove and reduce to possession any such species from an area under Federal jurisdiction; maliciously
damage or destroy any such species on any area under Federal jurisdiction; or remove, cut, dig up, damage, or destroy
any such species on any other area in knowing violation of any State law or regulation or in the course of any violation
of a State criminal trespass law. Certain exceptions apply to agents of the Service and State conservation agencies.
The Act and 50 CFR 17.62 and 17.63 also provide for the issuance of permits to carry out otherwise prohibited activities
involving endangered plant species under certain circumstances. It is anticipated that few trade permits would
ever be sought or issued because the plants are not common in cultivation nor in the wild. 

Requests for copies of the regulations concerning listed plants and inquiries regarding prohibitions and permits
may be addressed to the Office of Management Authority, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 4401 North Fairfax Drive,
Room 432, Arlington, Virginia 22203-3507 (703/358-2104). 



National Environmental Policy Act 



The Fish and Wildlife Service has determined that an Environmental Assessment or Environmental Impact Statement,
as defined under the authority of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, need not be prepared in connection
with regulations adopted pursuant to section 4(a) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended. A notice outlining
the Service's reasons for this determination was published in the 

Federal Register

 on October 25, 1983 (48 FR 49244).

 Emergency interim rule. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 NMFS publishes this emergency interim rule at the request 
of the South Atlantic Fishery Management Council (South Atlantic Council) to prohibit all taking of live rock in the
exclusive economic zone (EEZ) off the southern Atlantic states from the North Carolina/Virginia boundary to the
Dade/Broward County line in Florida; to prohibit the taking of live rock by chipping in the EEZ from the Dade/Broward
County line in Florida to the Atlantic/Gulf of Mexico boundary; and to limit the harvest of live rock from the EEZ off
the southern Atlantic states in 1994 to 485,000 lb (219,992 kg). 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Coral and coral reefs in the EEZ off the southern Atlantic states and in the Gulf of Mexico are managed under the Fishery
Management Plan for Coral and Coral Reefs of the Gulf of Mexico and the South Atlantic (FMP). The FMP was prepared by
the Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management Council (Gulf Council) and the South Atlantic Fishery Management Council (South
Atlantic Council) and is implemented through regulations at 50 CFR part 638 under the authority of the Magnuson Fishery
Conservation and 
Management Act (Magnuson Act). 



Live rock consists of living marine organisms, or an assemblage thereof, attached to a hard substrate, including
dead coral or rock (excluding mollusk shells), and therefore is a ``fish'' within the meaning of the Magnuson Act.
Live rock is collected by scuba divers and sold to the marine aquarium industry, which markets it as the basis for minireef
aquaria. Live rock is a 
nonrenewable resource providing essential fishery habitat in the Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic Ocean. 

On May 16, 1994 (59 FR 25344), NMFS published an emergency interim rule to control the taking of live rock in the Gulf
of Mexico. A description of the fishery and the rationale for that rulemaking are contained in that rule and are not
repeated here. 

In part because of concerns about effort shifting from recently closed areas in the Gulf of Mexico to current or new
harvest areas off the southern Atlantic states, the South Atlantic Council requested an emergency rule to: (1) Prohibit
the taking of live rock in the EEZ off the southern Atlantic states from the North Carolina/Virginia boundary to the
Dade/Broward County line in Florida; (2) prohibit chipping of live rock in the EEZ from the 
Dade/Broward County line in Florida to the Atlantic/Gulf of Mexico boundary; and (3) limit the harvest of live rock
in 1994 from the EEZ off the southern Atlantic states to 485,000 lb (219,992 kg). 

Reported landings from the Florida portion of the proposed closed area totaled less than 10,000 lb (4,536 kg) in 1993
or about 1 percent of all Florida landings. Florida is the only state in which live rock landings have been recorded.
This emergency closure is designed in part to prevent expansion of harvesting effort into new areas. 

Chipping means breaking up reefs, ledges, or rocks into smaller fragments, usually by means of a chisel and hammer.
Chipping causes serious damage to hard bottom habitats including coral reefs in the Florida Keys. Recent public testimony
to the Gulf and South Atlantic Councils indicated that chipping accounts for about 10 to 20 percent of the live rock
harvest off the southern Atlantic states. In the Gulf of Mexico, chipping of limestone ledges and worm reefs accounts
for about 90 percent of the live rock harvest. 

During a proposed phase out of live rock harvesting under Amendment 2 to the FMP, which is currently under development,
the Gulf and South Atlantic Councils intend to limit harvest to loose rubble rock that is primarily the result of natural
erosion processes. About 485,000 lb (219,992 kg) of rubble live rock were reported landed in Florida in 1992, and this
is the basis for the 1994 quota. Data available to the South Atlantic Council indicate that live rock landings are increasing
and the quota for 1994 is likely to be exceeded prior to implementation of management measures in Amendment 2. 

The Florida Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) estimates that the quota will probably be met sometime
in October 1994. If a shift of harvesting effort from the Gulf of Mexico to the Atlantic occurs due to the Gulf emergency
rule or other factors, the quota could be reached much earlier. Amendment 2 is not expected to be implemented until
mid November 1994. The South Atlantic Council therefore requested emergency action to implement the 1994 quota and
to prohibit all chipping of live rock to prevent damage to the Florida reef tract and serious loss of fishery habitat
in the EEZ off the southern Atlantic states, including the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary.

According to the Florida DEP, the closure of the EEZ north of 
Florida's Dade/Broward County line to live rock collecting may 
affect approximately 12 individuals who reported live rock landings 
in 1993; however, the ex-vessel value of these landings was only 
about $800 per Florida Saltwater Products License (SPL). In Dade 
and Monroe Counties, Florida, live rock landings in 1993 were 
reported by 96 SPL holders. These fishermen will be required to 
confine their harvest to loose rubble rock, which may have a 
marginal effect on the total value of their catch. A 485,000-lb 
(219,992-kg) quota will probably reduce potential 1994 landings by 
at least 15 percent or about $1,000 per SPL holder. 
Amendment 2 is expected to be submitted by the Gulf and South 
Atlantic Councils in July 1994 for review and, if approved, for 
implementation by the Secretary of Commerce. Amendment 2 would 
implement the measures in this emergency interim rule on a 
permanent basis and include a phase out schedule for live rock 
harvests in other areas. 



Compliance With NMFS Guidelines for Emergency Rules 



The South Atlantic Council and NMFS have concluded that the 
present situation constitutes biological and conservation 
emergencies, which are properly addressed by this emergency interim 
rule, and that the situation meets NMFS's policy guidelines for the 
use of emergency rules, published on January 6, 1992 (57 FR 375). 
The situation: (1) Results from recent, unforeseen events or 
recently discovered circumstances; (2) presents a serious 
management problem; and (3) realizes immediate benefits from the 
emergency interim rule that outweigh the value of advance notice, 
public comment, and deliberative consideration expected under the 
normal rulemaking process. The basis for the conclusions regarding 
emergency guidelines (1) and (2) is summarized above. 

Regarding the realization of immediate benefits, the South 
Atlantic Council has determined that an emergency rule under 
section 305(c) of the Magnuson Act is the only means for 
immediately addressing the biological emergency involving the live 
rock resources of the Florida Keys and the remainder of the areas 
off the southern Atlantic states. Going through the formal FMP 
amendment process without the emergency rule would delay 
implementation of the required measures and would result in 
substantial damage to live rock resources and fishery habitats off 
the southern Atlantic states. The immediate benefit of this 
emergency interim rule is that it will prevent expansion of live 
rock collection in the area north of Florida's Dade County, protect 
the Florida reef tract from chipping, and limit the rate of 
harvesting that causes serious damage to habitat in the area of the 
Florida Keys until a phase out can be implemented under Amendment 2 
through the normal FMP amendment and rulemaking process. 

NMFS concurs with the South Atlantic Council's findings about 
the biological emergency and the need for immediate regulatory 
action. Accordingly, NMFS publishes this emergency interim rule, 
effective initially for 90 days, as authorized by section 305(c) of 
the Magnuson Act. By agreement of NMFS and the South Atlantic 
Council, this emergency interim rule may be extended for an 
additional period of 90 days. 



Classification 



The Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, NOAA (AA), has 
determined that this rule is necessary to respond to an emergency 
situation and is consistent with the Magnuson Act and other 
applicable law. 

This emergency interim rule has been determined to be not 
significant for purposes of E.O. 12866. 

The AA finds that the immediate need to prevent environmental 
damage to the Florida reef tract and serious loss of fishery 
habitat in the EEZ off the southern Atlantic states constitutes 
good cause to waive the requirement to provide prior notice and an 
opportunity for public comment, pursuant to authority set forth at 
5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B), as such procedures would be contrary to the 
public interest. Similarly, the need to implement these measures 
in a timely manner to address the conservation and biological 
emergencies described above, constitutes good cause under authority 
contained in 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3), to waive the 30 day delay in 
effective date.

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This final rule establishes new requirements for the 
registration of designated fuels and fuel additives (F/FAs) as 
authorized by sections 211(b)(2) and 211(e) of the Clean Air Act 
(CAA). The registration requirements are organized within a three-
tier structure. Tier 1 requires F/FA manufacturers to perform a 
literature search on the health and welfare effects of F/FA 
emissions, characterize the emissions, and provide qualitative 
exposure information. Tier 2 requires biological testing for the 
examination of subchronic systemic and organ toxicity, as well as 
the assessment of specific health effects endpoints. When 
necessary, Tier 3, which includes follow-up studies or other 
additional tests, may be required. The rule permits adequate 
existing test data to be submitted in lieu of conducting new 
duplicative tests. It also includes special provisions for small 
businesses and certain types of products, and a grouping system 
which permits manufacturers of similar F/FA products to share the 
costs of compliance.

I. Introduction 



Over 2,300 fuels and 4,800 fuel additives were registered by 
EPA as of March 1994 and, to some degree, each of them produces 
emissions which may contribute to potentially harmful air 
pollution. The primary purpose of today's rule is to establish 
registration requirements which will provide information for 
identifying and evaluating the potential adverse effects of 
designated F/FA emissions and for guiding the direction of 
related regulatory actions in the future as specified in section 
211 of the CAA. 

Previous actions have implemented CAA sections 211(a) and 
211(b)(1), which govern the general registration of F/FAs, as 
well as CAA section 211(f). Today's rule amends 40 CFR part 79 
by adding regulatory provisions requiring the testing of F/FAs as 
a requirement for registration, as stipulated in section 
211(b)(2) and section 211(e) of the CAA. 

In addressing these additional statutory provisions, this 
rule focuses on the identification and evaluation of potential 
adverse health effects associated with F/FA evaporative and 
combustion emissions. The required health effects evaluation is 
organized in a tiered structure, and includes emission 
characterization, literature search, and biological testing 
requirements. Although this testing framework focuses on the 
evaluation of health effects, F/FA manufacturers are also 
required to perform data searches to obtain information on the 
potential welfare effects of F/FA emissions. In addition, EPA 
will continue to use existing procedures under CAA section 211(f) 
for the evaluation of potential effects of F/FAs on ECS 
performance. 

The ultimate use of the registration information to be 
submitted in compliance with this rule is to guide EPA in 
potential future regulatory actions under CAA section 211(c). 
Section 211(c) provides authority for the possible control or 
prohibition of any fuel or fuel additive whose emission products 
cause or contribute to air pollution which may reasonably be 
anticipated to endanger the public health or welfare. Evidence 
of adverse effects of F/FA emissions on ECS performance, obtained 
under CAA section 211(f) or from other sources, could also be 
used by EPA to support such regulatory decisions. 



II. Background 


A. Legal Authority and Statutory History 



The legal authority for the F/FA registration program is 
provided by section 211 of the CAA. Section 211(a), 42 U.S.C. 
section 7545, authorizes EPA to designate any fuel or fuel 
additive and prohibits manufacturers of designated fuels or 
additives from selling such products unless they have been 
registered by EPA in accordance with CAA section 211(b). In 
1975, EPA issued regulations (40 CFR part 79) implementing basic 
registration requirements, as stipulated by CAA section 
211(b)(1), that included: commercial identifying information, 
range of concentration, purpose-in-use, and chemical composition. 

Section 211(b)(2) of the CAA also gives EPA discretionary 
authority to establish additional registration requirements. 
According to this section, EPA ``may also require the manufacturer 
of any fuel or fuel additive to conduct tests to determine 
potential public health effects of such fuel or fuel additive 
(including, but not limited to, carcinogenic, teratogenic, or 
mutagenic effects),'' and to furnish other ``reasonable and 
necessary'' information to identify F/FA emissions and determine 
their effects on vehicular emission control performance and on 
the public health and welfare. The statute further stipulates 
that testing for health effects is to be conducted according to 
procedures and protocols established by the Administrator, and 
that test results will not be considered confidential. Once the 
manufacturer has completed registration requirements and has 
given assurances that the Agency will be notified of future 
changes in that information, CAA section 211(b)(3) directs the 
Administrator to register the fuel or fuel additive. 

EPA did not exercise its discretionary authority to require 
testing of F/FAs under CAA section 211(b)(2) as part of the 
general registration regulations issued in 1975. However, in the 
CAA Amendments of 1977 (PL 95-95, August 7, 1977), Congress added 
section 211(e), which made implementation of section 211(b)(2) 
mandatory and contained additional provisions requiring the 
implementation of the regulations within one year of enactment of 
the CAA Amendments. In an effort to fulfill this requirement, 
EPA published an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPRM) 
in 1978 (see 43 FR 38607, August 29, 1978; Docket ORD-78-01). 
However, the rulemaking process did not go forward during the 
next ten years and the rule was not finalized. Nevertheless, 
this action remained on EPA's regulatory agenda and a development 
plan for the rulemaking was created in 1988. 

In 1989, a citizens group brought a lawsuit [

Thomas 

v. 


Browner,

 C.A. No. 89-6269 (D. Oreg. 1989)] challenging EPA's 
failure to promulgate F/FA testing regulations within the one-
year deadline stipulated in CAA section 211(e). EPA entered into 
a Consent Decree in settlement of this lawsuit which, together 
with subsequent modifications, established the rulemaking 
schedule. Accordingly, a new ANPRM was published on August 7, 
1990 (55 FR 32218) and a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) was 
published on April 15, 1992 (57 FR 13168). Public hearings as 
well as periods for written commentary followed both of these 
publications. On February 24, 1994, EPA published a Notice of 
Reopening of Comment Period (59 FR 8886) requesting public 
comment on several compliance-related and technical issues that 
needed clarification and/or reconsideration. Today's action 
culminates the rulemaking process by promulgating F/FA 
registration requirements under CAA sections 211(b)(2) and 
211(e).

B. Public Participation 



In the months following the publication of the ANPRM (55 FR 
32218) and the associated public hearing (on September 26, 1990), 
EPA explored the feasibility and appropriateness of applying 
regulatory negotiation procedures (under the provisions of 
section 583 of the Negotiated Rulemaking Act of 1990) to the 
development of this rule. Interviews and meetings were held with 
representatives of a variety of affected industry groups and 
environmental organizations, to assess their interest and 
willingness to participate in potential negotiations. This 
process indicated that there was insufficient support for 
regulatory negotiation among a number of key parties. A 
traditional rulemaking procedure was then followed to develop 
this rule. 

Following publication of the proposed rule, EPA held a 
public hearing on May 28, 1992, and accepted comments until June 
30, 1992. Public response on the NPRM included five oral 
presentations at the hearing and the subsequent submission of 42 
written comments. EPA also received 13 written comments on the 
issues discussed in the Notice of Reopening of Comment Period 
(referred to as the ``Reopening Notice'' in later portions of this 
document). A transcript of both public hearings and copies of 
all written comments are available in public Docket No. A-90-07. 

A discussion of comments received since the NPRM and EPA's 
responses are included in the ``Summary and Analysis of Comments 
for the Fuels and Fuel Additives Registration Regulations,'' which 
is available in the public docket referenced above. All public 
commentary was carefully considered in developing this final 
rule. Major areas of comment are described in the relevant 
sections of this preamble. 



C. Additional Information on the Effective Date 



The effective date of this rule is May 27, 1994. EPA notes 
that the general requirement (under 5 U.S.C. 553(d), the 
Administrative Procedure Act (APA)), that publication or service 
of a substantive rule be made not less than 30 days before its 
effective date, does not apply here. Under 5 U.S.C. 559, the APA 
states that a subsequent statute does not supersede or modify the 
APA except to the extent that it does so expressly. CAA section 
307(d)(1)(E) specifically applies to the promulgation or revision 
of any regulation pertaining to any fuel or fuel additive under 
CAA section 211. CAA section 307(d)(1) further provides that 
``[t]he provisions of sections 533 through 557 and section 706 of 
title VI shall not, except as expressly provided in this 
subsection, apply to actions to which this subsection applies.'' 
Nowhere does subsection 307(d) expressly provide that section 
553(d) of title 5 applies. 

Further, CAA section 211(e)(2) expressly provides that the 
time period for providing the ``requisite information'' under 
section 211(e)(2) is based on the ``date of promulgation'' of the 
rule. Therefore, the requirements under CAA section 211(e)(2) 
are effective on May 27, 1994. Additionally, even if section 
553(d) were to apply to the portion of the rule promulgated under 
the authority of section 211(b) of the CAA, there is good cause 
under section 553(d)(3) of the APA to provide less than 30 days 
notice following publication in order to simplify implementation 
of the rule by establishing one effective date for the rule's 
requirements. As discussed in the following sections, this final 
rule provides a six year time period for completing Tier 2 
testing, commencing on May 27, 1994. EPA believes this to be 
sufficient for the regulated industry to comply with the rule and 
that, given this compliance schedule, a reasonable amount of 
notice is provided for this type of information-gathering 
regulation. Finally, EPA has taken steps to provide notice of 
this final action to the regulated industry upon signature of the 
rule. For these reasons, EPA believes that establishing the 
effective date as May 27, 1994 is reasonable.

III. Overview of Program Requirements 



A. Overall Scope and Approach 



The requirements of this rule apply to all types of F/FAs 
which have been designated to be registered by EPA (see Section 
III.A.3). Based on the provisions of CAA section 211(e), the 
requirements must be satisfied both by manufacturers of F/FA 
products registered at the time of promulgation as well as 
manufacturers of F/FA products seeking registration after 
promulgation. Considering the large number of F/FA products to 
be evaluated and the potential burden of the program on the 
regulated industry, this final rule maintains the grouping system 
and the tiered approach proposed in the NPRM. 

The grouping system allows manufacturers of similar products 
to share the costs of testing. Rather than mandating 
comprehensive testing as a routine registration requirement for 
every registered fuel and fuel additive, the grouping system 
permits the testing of one product as a representative of all 
relatively similar products (see Section IV of this preamble). 
In addition, the testing program is designed to address testing 
needs on a tiered basis, with allowance for more rigorous, 
resource-intensive requirements contained in each successive 
tier. A detailed description of the scope and requirements of 
each individual tier is provided in Sections VII, VIII, and IX of 
this preamble, and procedures for generating the emissions to be 
tested are explained in Section VI. Additional special 
provisions to reduce the burden on the regulated industry are 
discussed in Section X. 

EPA believes that the program required by this final rule is 
consistent with the CAA and reflects a reasonable and cost-conscious approach to a very complex regulatory area.
The following sections present a general overview of the main provisions of the rule. 



1. Tiered Approach 



As depicted in Figure 1, the registration program's 
requirements are organized within a three-tier structure. In 
part, each tier is intended to function as a screen for 
determining the need for more rigorous requirements in subsequent 
tiers. Consistent with CAA section 211(e)(3), which authorizes 
EPA to avoid duplication of effort, the tiered approach permits 
F/FA manufacturers to use test results and other information 
which may already be available about their products.

a. 

Content of Tiers. 

Except as may be modified by any applicable special provisions, the requirements of Tiers 1 and 2 are mandatory for

all fuels and fuel additives. These requirements may be 
satisfied by manufacturers either on an individual basis or by 
way of a group submission consistent with the provisions of the 
grouping system. 

Under Tier 1, F/FA manufacturers are required to perform a 
literature search on the health and welfare effects of F/FA 
emissions, characterize the emissions, and provide a qualitative 
exposure analysis based on total annual production volume and 
market distribution data (see Section VII for details on Tier 1 
requirements). The modeling analyses proposed in the NPRM have 
been eliminated from Tier 1 as explained in Section III.C of this 
preamble. Tier 2 (see Section VIII) includes biological testing 
for specific health effect endpoints, as well as general systemic 
and organ toxicity. The Tier 2 biological testing requires the 
exposure of laboratory animals to the whole emissions of fuels or 
additive/base fuel mixtures.
 To the extent that previously 
conducted studies are available which are at least comparable to 
the specified guidelines for the chemical and/or biological tests 
required in Tiers 1 and 2, such existing data may be submitted in 
lieu of performing and reporting on new duplicative tests (see 
Section VII.A.2). 








The results of Tiers 1 and 2 are to be reported to EPA 
according to the report formats described in Section XII. EPA 
will evaluate these results to determine if additional testing or 
analysis may be indicated under the provisions of Tier 3. For 
the purpose of peer review during this evaluation process, EPA 
may furnish the submitted data to, and consult with, other 
organizations, such as the Health Effects Institute. Tier 3 
tests will be determined on a case-by-case basis at EPA's 
discretion, as discussed in Section IX. The specific objectives 
and scope of Tier 3 tests will vary depending on the concerns 
identified in the earlier tiers or any other information 
available to EPA. 

b. 

Timing of Requirements: Registered F/FAs.

 EPA proposed to require that Tier 1 and Tier 2 data be submitted within three years for registered F/FAs. In their comments
on the proposal the regulated industry suggested that it would not be possible to complete Tier 2 testing within three

years. As detailed in the Summary and Analysis of Comments, 
these commenters stated that the number of F/FAs to be tested, 
the time needed for development of detailed test protocols, and 
the lack of available test facilities were inconsistent with the 
three-year time frame for completion of Tier 1 and Tier 2 for all 
F/FAs (or groups). None of the commenters, however, suggested an 
alternative time frame within which the testing of all F/FAs (or 
groups) could be completed. 

EPA has thoroughly considered these comments and, 
accordingly, has taken a number of measures to streamline the 
program. As discussed later in this preamble, such measures 
include the deletion from the final rule of some requirements 
proposed in the NPRM (e.g., quantitative modeling requirements), 
modification of the Tier 2 testing scenario for greater 
efficiency, simplification of some of the grouping rules, and the 
addition of special provisions which will result in a smaller 
number of F/FA products requiring testing. 

Nevertheless, EPA recognizes that the number of laboratory 
facilities currently available to conduct the required emission-based toxicological tests is very limited. EPA
expects that the 
promulgation of this rule will create a demand for testing 
laboratories which will encourage the reactivation, modification, 
and/or expansion of existing laboratories, as well as the 
development of new facilities, to accommodate the requirements of 
the F/FA registration program. However, there is likely to be a 
lag between the demand for and the availability of laboratory 
capacity. Thus, while EPA believes that some groups could 
complete the testing required by the rule in three years, it is 
likely that not all of the F/FAs to be tested could complete the 
requirements in the three-year time frame. 

Considering these factors, the final rule allows a six-year 
period for the conduct of Tier 2 testing for registered F/FAs. 
This longer period will provide the necessary start-up time for 
laboratories with previous experience in conducting studies 
reasonably similar to those required in Tier 2 to adapt or build 
the necessary facilities, organize the key technical personnel, 
and conduct verification procedures. In this regard, it is not 
necessary for each laboratory providing services for this program 
to employ experts in each of the toxicology specialty fields 
covered by Tier 2. EPA recognizes that some of the required 
expertise may be in short supply, and envisions that laboratories 
may subcontract with subspecialists as needed for evaluation of 
test results. Furthermore, biological laboratories which 
currently offer inhalation toxicology testing services, but are 
not equipped to generate and deliver engine emissions for such 
testing, should be able to obtain the additional equipment and 
engineering expertise they will need in a relatively short period 
of time. Addition of emission generation capabilities by such 
laboratories will be facilitated by the fact that the final rule 
allows the use of relatively inexpensive and possibly portable 
engine dynamometers for generating the required emissions for 
toxicological testing related both to light-duty and heavy-duty 
engine applications.

EPA estimates that the necessary toxicology laboratory capacity will begin to come on line within 8-15 months
of the effective date of this rule, with expansion of capacity continuing for an additional 12-24 months thereafter.
The initial period should coincide with the start-up time needed by the regulated industry prior to beginning the
required Tier 2 testing. Manufacturers' start-up activities will include review and understanding of the requirements,
formation and functional organization of groups, acquisition of required test fuel supplies, and contracting for
data gathering and testing services. EPA estimates that these activities can generally be accomplished in 6-12
months.

With six years provided for full Tier 2 completion, sufficient time should then be available for completion of all
Tier 2 testing. However, this assumes that the regulated industry will not purposely delay the onset of testing. If
all F/FA groups wait until the fourth and fifth years to begin the Tier 2 testing, it will again become likely that some
will not be able to complete the requirements on time. In such instances, the responsible manufacturers will have
failed to comply with the requirements of this rule and will be subject to enforcement action and/or loss of registration.

Thus, in the case of registered F/FA products, this final rule requires the submission within three years from the
effective date of all applicable Tier 1 requirements plus either: (1) Submittal of all Tier 2 requirements or (2) evidence
of a contractual obligation with a qualified laboratory to conduct the required Tier 2 tests.
 If, within the first three years, a contract for Tier 2 is submitted rather than the Tier 2 data itself, then the final
Tier 2 report is due to EPA no later than six years of the effective date of this rule. Both Tiers 1 and 2 are mandatory.
Failure to submit Tier 2 data for a registered F/FA within six years of the effective date of this rule will subject the
manufacturer to enforcement action and/or revocation of the registration. In the case of F/FAs for which Tier 2 testing
is not required because of special provisions, all applicable requirements are due to EPA within the initial three-year
period after promulgation of this rule.





Existing F/FA registrations are also conditional on satisfaction of any Tier 3 requirements which might be prescribed
by the Agency pursuant to CAA section 211(b). When Tier 3 testing is prescribed for a registered F/FA product, the existing
registration will be extended for that time which EPA specifies as necessary for completion of the additional requirements.
Maintenance of registration will depend upon satisfactory compliance with these requirements.

EPA is promulgating Tier 2 testing requirements under the authority of both sections 211(b) and 211(e) of the CAA.
The requirements for Tier 2 testing are all within EPA's discretion under section 211(b). Section 211(b) gives the
Administrator broad authority ``for the purpose of registration of fuels and fuel additives'' to require manufacturers
``to conduct tests to determine potential public health effects of such fuel or fuel additive.'' EPA interprets ``for
the purpose of registration'' to encompass both gaining and maintaining registration for F/FAs. This interpretation
is supported by section 211(e), which requires implementation of section 211(b) authority with respect to both registered
and new F/FAs and mandates that EPA require testing of F/FAs. The legislative history supports such a view. The 1977
House Report,
 upon which section 211(e) was based, states:





Section 220 of the Committee bill is intended to express the Committee's disapproval of EPA's past handling of its
authority in this area and of its proposed future plans * * * Instead, an aggressive, preventative
approach to the gathering of necessary information is mandated * * *

The bill mandates the Administrator to promulgate regulations within one year after enactment. * * *
These regulations must require testing by the manufacturer of the fuel or fuel additive, except insofar as paragraph
(3) otherwise permits.

All of these requirements are mandatory. 




Tier 2 involves testing ``to determine potential public health effects'' of F/FAs and, therefore, is within the type
of testing that section 211(b) allows EPA to require. The timing requirements of Tier 2 are also within EPA's discretion
under section 211(b), for section 211(b) leaves submission deadlines to EPA's discretion.

The timing for Tier 2 submissions is also governed, at least in part, by section 211(e)(2). That section requires that,
for F/FAs registered when the rule is promulgated, ``requisite information'' be submitted within three years of
the promulgation date. ``Requisite information'' is not defined in the statute. EPA proposed to interpret ``requisite
information'' as the data required by Tiers 1 and 2. In part this was based on EPA's understanding that Congress intended
that the testing rule promulgated under section 211(e) would require manufacturers to conduct testing_not merely
conduct a literature search and compile studies that had already been conducted. As a practical matter, however,
EPA now believes that the Tier 2 tests cannot be completed for all F/FAs within three years. EPA believes this makes
its proposed definition of ``requisite information'' unreasonable and requires a different interpretation of
``requisite information.''

EPA considered redefining ``requisite information'' to mean studies that could be completed for all F/FAs within
three years. Given the time frame, laboratory availability, and the number of groups to be tested, EPA was not sure
that any meaningful health effects testing could be accomplished for all groups within three years. Certainly, such
testing could not include testing of combustion and evaporation products for all groups. As discussed elsewhere,
EPA believes that the testing of combustion and evaporative emissions included in Tier 2 is part of the basic testing
necessary to evaluate potential health effects, because people are exposed to both combustion and evaporative emissions.
Therefore, EPA would require this testing under section 211(b) regardless of whether the testing is required by section
211(e)(2). If EPA had chosen to interpret ``requisite information'' to be testing that could be done in three years,
EPA would have, in any case, required such testing in addition to the Tier 2 testing required by this rule. This would
likely have delayed submission of the information that EPA believes to be necessary (

i.e., 

the combustion emissions testing and evaporative emissions testing).

In today's rule, EPA interprets ``requisite information'' as either data required by Tiers 1 and 2 or data required
by Tier 1 and a commitment to conduct Tier 2 testing. EPA believes that this meets the congressional mandate to require
emissions speciation testing and a demonstration that manufacturers are making progress in their testing by requiring
submission of evidence of a contract with a qualified laboratory to conduct the Tier 2 studies. In addition, this interpretation
imposes testing costs on manufacturers only for types of studies that EPA believes are necessary and useful, and it
requires manufacturers to finish testing in a time frame that EPA believes is possible to meet.

Even if ``requisite information'' were interpreted to mean only data required by Tier 1, EPA would still impose Tier
2 testing and timing requirements as contained in today's rule. In that case, section 211(e) would require Tier 1 data
to be submitted within three years of this rule's promulgation, and section 211(b) would provide authority for EPA
to impose the Tier 2 testing requirements in the time frame set forth in this rule.

c. 

Timing of Requirements: Registrable and New F/FAs. 

Consistent with section 211(e), for F/FAs not yet registered, all test requirements must be satisfied prior to registration,
including any Tier 3 requirements which EPA judges to be necessary. However, as discussed in the Reopening Notice,
this final rule makes a distinction between ``registrable'' and truly ``new'' F/FA products. Registrable F/FAs
are products
 that are not registered as of the effective date of this rule but that meet the program's criteria for grouping with
a currently registered fuel or bulk additive
 in the same fuel family.
 Conversely, a F/FA product not registered as of the effective date of this rule is designated as ``new'' if it does not
meet the program's criteria for grouping with a currently registered fuel or bulk additive in the same fuel family.
In the above definitions, the term ``currently'' refers to the date on which EPA receives the basic registration data
for the F/FA product in question.









For registrable products, similar testing and compliance requirements apply as those pertaining to currently registered
F/FAs in the same group. Upon the manufacturer's submittal of the basic registration data and other pre-Tier 1 application
requirements for a registrable product, registration will be granted by EPA. Once registered, these products will
be legally able to enter the market. The manufacturer will have the same period of time after the effective date of this
rule for the completion of Tiers 1 and 2 as the applicable group of existing F/FAs, and can satisfy these requirements
either by joining the existing group or by testing individually. On the other hand, manufacturers of new F/FA products
(

i.e.,

 F/FAs not registered as of the effective date of this rule 

and 

not fitting the registrable criteria) are required to submit all testing requirements prior to registration, including
Tier 3 when prescribed by the Agency. Thus, if EPA identifies a need for additional testing at the Tier 3 level for a new
F/FA product, registration will not occur until satisfactory completion of all such requirements.

As discussed in the NPRM and in the Reopening Notice, EPA interprets CAA section 211(b) in conjunction with CAA section
211(c), which gives EPA authority to control or prohibit the manufacture, introduction into commerce, offering
for sale, or sale of any fuel or fuel additive if the Administrator finds that the emission products of such fuel or fuel
additive ``cause[s], or contribute[s], to air pollution which may reasonably be anticipated to endanger the public
health or welfare.'' In light of this responsibility, EPA believes that it should exercise particular caution in
registering new F/FA products and that it should have the necessary information to evaluate fully the potential public
health consequences of such new F/FAs prior to allowing their introduction into the market. Thus, before granting
registration to manufacturers of new F/FAs, under the authority of CAA section 211(b), this final rule requires that
they comply with all testing requirements.

Figure 2 summarizes the decision process for determining whether an unregistered F/FA product (i.e., a F/FA product
not registered as of the effective date of this rule) is ``registrable'' and thus handled much like a currently registered
F/FA product, or whether an unregistered F/FA product is ``new'' and must complete all testing requirements before
registration is granted.

An unregistered F/FA product which meets the criteria for grouping only with a currently registered aftermarket
additive (and not with a currently registered fuel and/or bulk additive) is not designated as registrable. This does
not necessarily preclude an unregistered aftermarket additive from being registrable (since aftermarket additives
can group with fuels and bulk additives), nor does it affect the registration status of currently registered aftermarket
additives. 
For example, an unregistered detergent additive (either bulk or aftermarket) intended for use in gasoline and meeting
the criteria for grouping with baseline gasoline fuels and bulk additives will be registrable.
 On the other hand, an unregistered chromium-containing additive (either bulk or aftermarket) intended for use in
gasoline will be considered ``new'' rather than ``registrable,'' because there are no currently registered chromium-containing
fuels or bulk additives in the gasoline fuel family with which the applicant additive could be grouped. Even if a chromium-containing
product had previously been registered as an aftermarket additive for gasoline [e.g., as a ``grandfathered'' product
registered prior to the ban of such aftermarket additives under CAA section 211(f)(1)(B)]
 or as a bulk additive for use in another fuel family (e.g., diesel fuel), the applicant additive would still be considered
``new''. 





As discussed in the Reopening Notice, EPA believes that the distinctions between registrable and new F/FAs, both
in terms of their definitions and their respective compliance requirements, reflect reasonable regard for the public
health and welfare without undue interference in the F/FA marketplace. Because registrable F/FAs are defined such
that they must be reasonably similar in composition and usage to current F/FAs, their entry into the market will generally
not be expected to increase the health or welfare risks potentially related to current F/FA emission exposures, assuming
the overall rate of usage does not increase substantially. 
Today's rule implements EPA's policy that F/FAs that may pose new or different health risks to the public should not
be allowed on the market until EPA has determined that adequate health testing has been conducted. Because it would
cause significant hardships to pull all currently used products off the market until they were tested, products that
are already registered may continue to be sold. If these principles were strictly applied (

i.e., 

EPA refused to register any specific product that does not currently have a registration), there could be significant
stagnation in the marketplace_a new company that wanted to sell the same unleaded gasoline that everyone else is selling
would be prevented from getting a registration until it had tested its gasoline product. Thus, today's rule allows
new registrants to sell products that are similar to registered products in terms of: (1) Expected health effects;
and (2) usage (and, therefore, type or extent of exposure) currently allowed by law. 
If an unregistered product can group with a registered product, EPA has determined that the products should have similar
health effects. To ensure that usage (and, therefore, type or extent of exposure) is similar to a registered product,
under today's rule, a manufacturer cannot rely on registration of an aftermarket fuel additive or on a F/FA in a different
fuel family. Considering a fuel or bulk additive to be registrable based on an aftermarket additive registration
could significantly increase the public exposure to that F/FA. Generally, aftermarket additives are relatively
limited in distribution and usage and, therefore, in exposure. Thus, in seeking a registration for a new product,
a manufacturer cannot rely on the registration of aftermarket additives or any F/FA product in a fuel family other
than the one for which the registration is sought. 
This is consistent with Congress' intent in CAA section 211(f)(1)(B) to preclude introduction into commerce of new
aftermarket additives which do not fit the ``substantially similar'' 
criteria.


,

 
 Looking only to F/FAs in the same fuel family to determine registrability is also intended to prevent potential increases
in exposure to untested products. Expanding the use of an additive from one fuel family to another (e.g., from diesel
fuel to gasoline) would significantly increase the overall size of the potential market for the product and thus the
potential exposure to its emissions. 






EPA interprets section 211(e) to support the distinction between registered or registrable F/FAs and new F/FAs.
EPA believes that the reference in CAA section 211(e)(2) (A) and (B) to a ``fuel or fuel additive which is registered''
or ``which is not registered'' is ambiguous as to whether it refers to the F/FA product generally or to a particular
product-specific registration. Given this ambiguity, EPA believes that it is reasonable to interpret the phrase
``fuel or fuel additive which is registered'' to refer to the F/FAs generally. A contrary interpretation would result
in EPA allowing numerous types of unleaded gasoline to be sold under existing registrations, while at the same time
denying a registration (until completion of necessary testing) to a new company that wanted to sell the same type of
unleaded gasoline that many others now sell. As discussed above, for ``registrable'' products, such an interference
in the market would not likely result in any public health benefit. Therefore, EPA believes it is reasonable to interpret
the phrase ``registered'' to include both F/FAs that are either ``registered'' or ``registrable.'' ``Registrable''
F/FAs are sufficiently similar in composition and use to existing F/FAs that one would not expect them to have dissimilar
health effects; and therefore, it is reasonable to interpret the phrase ``registered fuel or fuel additive'' to include
not only those F/FAs that are identical, but also those that can group with existing F/FAs.

Alternatively, EPA believes that the above approach is consistent with section 211 because EPA interprets section
211(e)(3) (A) and (B) in conjunction with section 211(e)(3)(C), which gives EPA authority to exempt any F/FA product
from duplicative testing. Thus, even if one interprets the phrase ``fuel or fuel additive which [is/is not] registered''
to mean either that an identical F/FA product must already have a registration, or to refer to a product-specific registration,
EPA believes it is reasonable to interpret section 211(e)(3)(C) to allow F/FAs that are similar in composition and
usage to those already on the market to group with those similar F/FAs and complete the testing with the other F/FAs
in their group. At the same time, EPA believes that for F/FAs that differ significantly in composition or usage from
currently registered F/FAs, such testing would not be duplicative of testing of registered 
F/FAs; and therefore, EPA is authorized under section 211(e) to require this information prior to registration.
Under either theory, EPA's authority to obtain information prior to registration is not limited to Tier 1 and Tier
2 data, because section 211(b)(2)(B) gives EPA authority to require for registration any information necessary
to assess the effects of emissions on public health or welfare. Therefore, EPA interprets section 211 (e) and (b) to
give it the authority to require any necessary health or welfare effects information for F/FAs that are significantly
different in composition or usage from currently registered products. 
d. 

Changes to 40 CFR Part 79. 

This final rule includes revisions to the current 40 CFR part 79 registration regulations which are necessary to properly
implement the new testing requirements in Subpart F. These consist of various conforming changes in registration
procedures, requirements, and terminology. 
The submission by which a manufacturer requests registration of a fuel or fuel additive product is now called an ``application''
rather than a ``notification,'' in order to better reflect the additional submissions and requirements upon which
registration is now contingent, and to avoid confusion with the various notifications concerning testing requirements
which will be transmitted to applicants and registrants by EPA. Conforming changes have been made in procedures for
notifying an applicant that a submission does not comply with registration requirements and for granting registration.

As discussed in Section IV of this preamble, in order to determine in which of the F/FA group(s) established under the
criteria set forth in this rule (see  79.56) a particular fuel additive should be enrolled, and to administer
applicable testing requirements separately for each such F/FA group, it is essential that fuel additives be deemed
to be registered only for those specific types of fuel for which they will be sold and used. The Agency interprets and
is already administering the existing part 79 in this manner. However, in the conforming changes included in this
rule, part 79 has been clarified to confirm that registration of fuel additives is fuel specific, and that EPA considers
sale or distribution of a fuel additive product for use in a fuel for which it is not registered to be unlawful. 
In addition, a manufacturer seeking to register a fuel product or a fuel additive product for use in vehicles manufactured
after 1974 must demonstrate that it is ``substantially similar'' to fuels or additives utilized in the certification
of vehicles for 1975 or subsequent model years, or that the manufacturer has obtained a waiver under CAA section 211(f)(4).
This expressly codifies the manner in which EPA has administered the registration program since it adopted criteria
implementing the statutory prohibition in CAA section 211(f)(1) on introduction into commerce of fuels and fuel
additives which are not ``substantially similar.'' 


2. Program Focus On Emissions 


CAA section 211 gives the Agency discretion to determine the focus of the F/FA testing program under CAA section 211(b).
EPA is exercising its discretion by focusing this rule on the testing of emissions, because the main purpose of the
testing program is to provide EPA with information that can be used in regulatory decision-making under CAA section
211(c). 
Section 211(c) of the CAA gives EPA the authority to regulate F/FAs based on the impact of their emissions on public
health or welfare. Specifically, it allows the Administrator to control or prohibit the manufacture, introduction
into commerce, or sale of any fuel or fuel additive whose emission product(s) cause or contribute to harmful air pollution.
The legislative history of the provision also supports a focus on emissions, since House and Senate Reports on the
CAA Amendments of 1970 link the information to be obtained under CAA section 211(b) to EPA's authority to regulate
emissions under CAA section 211(c).
 Thus in the NPRM, EPA proposed to focus this rule's requirements on the potential emissions-based effects of F/FAs
rather than on the effects of the raw (i.e., uncombusted) F/FA product. Public comment received after publication
of the NPRM generally supported the proposed emissions-based focus of the rule. Accordingly, EPA has retained this
focus in today's action. The health effects testing requirements of this final rule specifically address the effects
of inhalation exposure to F/FA combustion and evaporative emissions. The required testing focuses on the evaluation
of health effects of the whole emissions of the fuel or additive/base fuel mixture of interest and not on the toxicity
of the individual emission products.

<TEXT>
 

For the purposes of this rule, combustion emissions are the primary exhaust products of the combustion of a fuel or
additive/base fuel mixture in a motor vehicle engine and do not include secondary atmospheric transformation products.
EPA recognizes that secondary air pollutants are a factor in the characterization of overall risks associated with
F/FA emissions. However, it is not feasible to include this type of laboratory testing as a standard requirement at
this time. When required in specific instances, transformation products will be addressed under Tier 3, as described
in Section III.C. 
As proposed, evaporative emission testing is to be performed for F/FAs meeting specific volatility criteria. While
some commenters asked EPA to eliminate the evaporative emission testing from the program, today's rule maintains
this requirement. EPA's decision is supported by the legislative history, which expresses the concerns of Congress
about the public health impacts of emissions from both combustion and evaporative sources. Public exposure to evaporative
emissions is still significant and, for many F/FAs, the toxicity of evaporative emissions as a whole mixture has not
been characterized. Thus, this rule includes requirements for the characterization and biological testing of evaporative
emissions in certain circumstances. 
While combustion emissions are inevitable products of the engine combustion process, the significance of evaporative
emissions depends on the type of F/FA product. As proposed in the NPRM, this final rule specifies criteria for determining
the need for evaporative emission testing. For fuels that are supplied to motor vehicle engines by way of sealed containment
and delivery systems, evaporative emissions testing is less important, since human and environmental exposure
should be extremely low or nonexistent. Thus, evaporative emissions testing under this final rule would not apply
to methane (compressed natural gas or liquified natural gas) or propane (liquified petroleum gas) formulations.

For liquid F/FAs, the significance of vaporization varies widely, depending largely on the volatility of the fuel
or additive/base fuel mixture. Thus, this final rule uses the Reid Vapor Pressure (RVP) of a fuel or additive/base
fuel mixture to determine its applicability for evaporative emissions testing. An RVP of 2.0 pounds per square inch
(psi) is designated as the threshold for determining the need for evaporative emission testing for fuels. That is,
fuels with RVP of 2.0 psi or greater are subject to the evaporative emissions testing requirements, while those with
RVP less than 2.0 psi are excused from the evaporative emission testing requirements under Tier 1 and Tier 2. 
With respect to additives, the NPRM proposed to require evaporative emission testing if the RVP of the additive/base
fuel mixture was increased by 0.1 psi or more in comparison with the RVP of the base fuel alone. However, methods for
measurement of vapor pressure have a reproducibility of about 0.3 psi.
 To account for this limitation of measurement accuracy, especially when dealing with low pressure measurements,
today's rule uses a 0.4 psi criterion (i.e., 0.1 

#

0.3) for additives. Accordingly, this final rule requires the evaporative emission testing of additives when the
RVP of the associated fuel in the additive/base fuel mixture is increased by 0.4 psi 

and 

the resulting RVP of the additive/base fuel mixture is 2.0 psi or more.
 For example, an additive that causes an increase of 0.6 psi when mixed with a fuel with a vapor pressure of 1.0 psi (i.e.,
the resulting RVP of the additive/base fuel mixture is 1.6), need not be tested for evaporative emissions. On the other
hand, an additive that causes an increase of 1.1 psi when mixed with a fuel with RVP of 1.0 psi is required to undergo evaporative
emission testing because the resulting RVP of the additive/base fuel mixture is 2.1 psi.





The above defined thresholds are used by EPA in determining the applicability of evaporative emission testing for
the purposes of Tier 1 and Tier 2. However, EPA retains the authority to require evaporative emission testing under
Tier 3 for fuels or additive/base fuel mixtures with low vapor pressure, e.g., RVP less than 2.0, if there is a health
or welfare concern associated with the evaporative emissions of the fuel or additive/base fuel mixture in question.
For example, if a highly toxic substance is present in a fuel or additive/base fuel mixture, EPA could require evaporative
emission testing under Tier 3, even if the RVP of the F/FA product in question is below 2.0 psi. These special cases will
be handled on a case-by-case basis under Tier 3. 


3. Program Applicability 


The requirements of this rule apply to manufacturers (including importers) of designated fuels or fuel additives
and to any F/FA manufacturer [see  79.2(d) and (f) as amended in this rule] seeking registration under CAA section
211(a) and 211(b). A fuel is defined to be any material which is capable of releasing energy or power by combustion or
other chemical or physical reaction [see 40 CFR  79.2(c)]. A fuel additive is defined as any substance that is
intentionally added to a fuel (including any added to a motor vehicle's fuel system) and that is not intentionally
removed prior to sale or use (see 40 CFR  79.2(e), as amended in this rule), including both bulk and aftermarket
additives.

<TEXT>
 

At the present time, the designation of F/FAs encompasses 
both leaded and unleaded gasoline F/FAs and diesel


F/FAs produced 
and commercially distributed for use in motor vehicles.
 F/FAs 
intended only for off-road use (e.g., farm and construction 
equipment, aircraft, boats, railroad engines) are not currently 
designated to be registered, and thus are not subject to the 
requirements of today's rule. However, if off-road F/FAs become 
designated in the future (according to provisions under CAA 
section 213), this rule will be modified, as needed, to cover 
them as well. 



While the designated F/FAs include leaded gasoline 
formulations, CAA section 211(n) provides that ``after December 
31, 1995 it shall be unlawful for any person to sell, offer for 
sale, supply, offer for supply, dispense, transport, or introduce 
into commerce, for use as fuel in any motor vehicle (as defined 
in section 7554(a) of this title) any gasoline which contains 
lead or lead additives.'' Because of the upcoming ban of leaded 
F/FAs, compliance with the requirements in today's rule will be 
superfluous for manufacturers of leaded products. Thus, the 
leaded fuel family has been deleted from this final rule. 

While alternative fuels and their additives are currently on 
the market, they are not yet designated and thus not yet required 
to be registered. However, because they are currently used and 
EPA contemplates their future designation, this final rule 
includes provisions for their registration and testing. The 
alternative fuels for which provisions are included are: 
methanol, ethanol, compressed natural gas (CNG), liquified 
natural gas (LNG), and liquified petroleum gas (LPG). EPA is 
currently developing the proposal for the designation of these 
alternative fuels and their additives. In that proposal, EPA 
currently intends to propose to set an effective date for the 
final designation rule far enough in the future so that these 
F/FAs could complete whatever pre-registration testing would be 
required prior to the time they would be required to be 
registered. EPA currently believes the delay of the effective 
date of the designation rule would be justified by the need to 
minimize disruptions in an existing market for alternative F/FAs. 

This rule contains a number of special provisions which 
reduce or modify the program's requirements for certain 
manufacturers or certain classes of products. Such special 
provisions apply to small businesses (as defined in this rule) 
and manufacturers of experimental F/FAs, relabeled products, and 
aerosols. These provisions are described in Section X of this 
preamble. 



B. Health Evaluation Requirements 



The testing program established in this rule focuses on the 
identification and evaluation of potential adverse health effects 
associated with inhalation exposure to F/FA emissions. The Tier 
2 testing program of this rule addresses, in addition to the 
areas of inquiry mandated by the statute (carcinogenicity, 
teratogenicity, and mutagenicity), specific assessments designed 
to detect potential pulmonary, neurotoxic, and general 
reproductive effects of F/FA emissions. 

In the NPRM, short-term (42-day) tests were proposed under 
Tier 2 to address each of the health effect endpoints described 
above. However, in response to public commentary and EPA's own 
analysis, the Tier 2 testing requirements have been modified in 
this final rule to enhance the efficiency and feasibility of the 
program. Today's rule uses a comprehensive 90-day subchronic 
inhalation protocol and ancillary tests to examine general 
systemic and organ toxicity (including pulmonary toxicity), as 
well as the specific areas of concern described above. 

These evaluations require the exposure of laboratory animals 
to the whole emissions of F/FAs. Tier 2 tests are to be 
conducted for both combustion and (when applicable) evaporative 
emissions. The subchronic inhalation protocol allows the 
examination of specific endpoints within the 90-day testing 
framework. For example, pulmonary and neurotoxic effects are 
examined in conjunction with the subchronic study standard 
histopathological requirements. The neurotoxicity assessment 
also includes a biochemical assay to measure the level of glial 
fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). Coordinated with the 90-day 
study is a battery of three assays used in the evaluation of 
carcinogenicity and mutagenicity: the in 

vitro 

Salmonella assay, 
the 

in vivo 

micronucleus assay, and the 

in vivo

 sister chromatid 
exchange assay. A fertility assessment that looks at both 
reproductive and teratogenic effects is also coordinated with the 
general toxicity study. The assessment for reproductive effects 
involves the mating of exposed animals, the measurement of 
reproductive cycles, and the histopathology of male and female 
reproductive organs. The teratogenic assessment requires the 
exposure of pregnant females to F/FA emissions and the subsequent 
examination of the uterus and its contents just prior to the 
normal time of parturition. 

In addition to the evaluation of the health effects 
described above, EPA retains the authority under Tier 3 to 
require additional testing on a case-by-case basis on those 
endpoints evaluated under Tier 2 and/or on other endpoints of 
concern. Further discussion about the specific requirements of 
Tiers 1, 2, and 3 is provided in Sections VII-IX.

C. Welfare Evaluation Requirements 



CAA section 211(b)(2)(B) states that the Administrator may 
require manufacturers to furnish ``reasonable and necessary'' 
information for determining ``the extent to which F/FA emissions 
affect the public health or welfare''. The term ``welfare effects'' 
encompasses a variety of complex and interrelated factors. In 
terms of motor vehicle F/FA emissions, welfare effects could 
include the impact of air pollution on the public health and the 
environment, including a broad range of effects on aquatic and 
terrestrial ecosystems, cultivated crops and other vegetation, 
natural and man-made materials, wildlife, and stratospheric 
ozone. Air pollution effects on the public welfare also include 
important environmental concerns such as noxious odors or 
visibility impairment, which may detract from human well-being. 

Except for stipulating that welfare effects should be 
addressed, the statute gives EPA broad discretion about how to 
address welfare effects. EPA recognizes that, at the present 
time, scientific experience and laboratory screening methods for 
the evaluation of welfare effects are more limited than in the 
area of health effects. Thus, today's rule limits the routinely required welfare evaluation to requirements that
are coincident 
or concurrent with the evaluation of health effects. These 
include the literature search, emission characterization, and 
exposure analysis requirements of Tier 1. While at this time EPA 
is not requiring biological testing for welfare effects, the 
Administrator retains the authority to require additional 
evaluation and/or testing of welfare effects at the Tier 3 level, 
when the outcome of lower tiers demonstrates both significant 
environmental toxicity and exposure potential. EPA will 
determine the need for Tier 3 welfare effects testing on a case-by-case basis. 

In the NPRM, EPA proposed to require modeling analyses for 
atmospheric reactivity, environmental fate/partitioning, and 
exposure as part of the welfare evaluation. EPA requested 
comments on the feasibility of requiring such modeling analyses 
as a routine requirement for registration. Commenters urged EPA 
to limit the modeling requirements due to the lack of 
standardized methods in this area of study. Recognizing the 
limitations of modeling methods and the availability of existing 
data for some of the areas of study of interest in this rule, 
this final rule does not require modeling analyses as part of 
Tier 1. 

EPA recognizes that other EPA programs are actively 
researching and controlling mobile and stationary source 
contributions to major air pollution problems such as 
tropospheric/stratospheric ozone, global warming, and acid rain. 
Furthermore, modeled ozone reactivity data are already available 
for most conventional and alternative fuels. EPA believes that 
if additional modeling is deemed necessary, this could be 
performed by manufacturers under Tier 3. Also, EPA may conduct 
simple modeling, using the emission data submitted by registrants 
under Tier 1, if needed for regulatory decisions. 

Regarding environmental fate and exposure modeling, EPA 
recognizes that these types of analyses will be extremely 
difficult due to the complex nature of F/FA emissions. Because 
both environmental partitioning models and exposure models 
address single compounds rather than mixtures, it would be unduly 
burdensome and unreasonable to require all registrants to perform 
these analyses on each individual emission constituent. 
Requiring the modeling of each individual emission product would 
also result in duplication of information and, therefore, would 
be inconsistent with the original intent of the statute. 

In addition, the environmental models are applicable only to 
a limited number of emission products for which appropriate 
physical/chemical data are available in order to perform the 
analysis. In terms of available exposure models, these usually 
rely on carbon monoxide monitoring data and related emission 
rates to estimate potential exposures. This means that the 
applicability of available exposure models is somewhat limited to 
the analysis of compounds whose chemical/physical behavior is 
similar to carbon monoxide. 

Based on the above factors, EPA believes that quantitative 
evaluations of potential exposures and environmental 
fate/partitioning of F/FA emissions will be better addressed at 
the Tier 3 level on a case-by-case basis, where they can be 
focused on specific compounds of potential environmental concern.

D. Requirements for Emission Control System Testing 



CAA section 211(b)(2) requires F/FA manufacturers to provide 
information to determine their products' effects on ECS 
performance. The NPRM stated that EPA intended to continue 
addressing ECS performance through the existing waiver 
application program under CAA section 211(f). The waiver program 
prevents the introduction into commerce of F/FAs which would 
significantly degrade the performance of emission control 
equipment. Under CAA section 211(f), F/FA formulations which do 
not meet specific chemical and physical criteria considered to be 
``substantially similar'' to EPA certification fuel (see 
interpretive rule in 56 FR 5352), cannot be introduced into 
commerce unless a waiver is issued by EPA. The waiver process 
then requires the applicant to demonstrate, through testing if 
necessary, that ``such fuel or fuel additive or a specified 
concentration thereof, and the emission products of such fuel or 
fuel additive or a specified concentration thereof, will not 
cause or contribute to a failure of any emission control device 
or system (over the useful life of any vehicle in which such 
device or system is used) to achieve compliance by the vehicle 
with the emission standards to which it has been certified.'' For 
products already registered that do not meet ``substantially 
similar'' criteria, i.e., grandfathered products that were 
registered prior to the implementation of the waiver application 
program, EPA proposed to establish a mechanism that would permit 
the public to submit petitions to EPA requesting ECS testing for 
a particular fuel or fuel additive of concern. 

Today's rule reflects EPA's judgment that the mechanisms 
already established under CAA section 211(f) are adequate for the 
ECS testing of F/FAs. EPA's previous experience with the waiver 
application process has demonstrated the practical value of the 
``substantially similar'' concept for determining whether a F/FA 
product needs to be tested for its effects on emission control 
equipment. EPA is not aware of instances in which products 
meeting ``substantially similar'' criteria were later discovered to 
have adverse effects on vehicular emission control performance. 
The implementation of another ECS testing program under section 
211(b) would be duplicative and, therefore, inconsistent with 
Congress' intent. Thus, as proposed, today's rule refers to the 
waiver application process under CAA section 211(f)
 for the 
ECS testing of ``substantially similar'' F/FAs and 


F/FAs required 
to obtain a waiver under CAA section 211(f)(4). Products which 
conform to applicable ``substantially similar'' criteria are not 
required to undergo ECS testing before they can be registered. 
On the other hand, new 
F/FAs which do not meet ``substantially 
similar'' criteria are subject to the standard 211(f) application 
process prior to registration. 





EPA recognizes that there are grandfathered F/FA products 
(see Section III.A above) which fall outside the regulatory 
domain of CAA section 211(f). These grandfathered products 
include gasoline aftermarket additives introduced prior to the 
1990 CAA Amendments. Therefore, statutory authority for the ECS 
evaluation and regulatory control of grandfathered products 
exists under CAA sections 211 (b) and (c) rather than section 
211(f). EPA judges that requiring ECS evaluation of all 
grandfathered products, without evidence of ECS problems, would 
be unreasonable and unnecessarily burdensome on the industry. 
Instead, today's rule provides a petition mechanism for the ECS 
evaluation of grandfathered products. Under this mechanism, EPA 
could require ECS testing of grandfathered products, similar to 
the testing which a waiver applicant would generally conduct, if 
so petitioned by outside parties or if other information 
available to the Agency indicates that such evaluation is 
appropriate. Such information might be obtained as a result of 
the emission characterization requirements included in this final 
rule. In addition, vehicle manufacturers or other outside 
parties are allowed to submit petitions to EPA requesting the 
testing of grandfathered products based on evidence of potential 
harm to vehicular ECS. If EPA judges that ECS testing is 
warranted after reviewing the petition arguments, emission 
characterization results and/or other available information, the 
authority provided by CAA sections 211(b) and 211(c) to require 
specific grandfathered products to test for ECS effects. 



IV. Grouping System 



A. Objectives and Rationale 



CAA section 211(e) provides a number of mechanisms by which 
EPA may reduce the costs and burdens of compliance with the 
registration requirements set forth in CAA section 211(b). In 
particular, CAA section 211(e)(3)(B) permits the Administrator to 
``provide for cost-sharing with respect to the testing of any fuel 
or fuel additive which is manufactured or processed by two or 
more persons, or otherwise provide for shared responsibility'' so 
that the program requirements can be met without duplication of 
effort. In accordance with this provision, today's rule 
maintains the grouping system proposed in the NPRM, which permits 
manufacturers of similar F/FAs, on a voluntary basis, to pool 
their resources and efforts to satisfy the registration 
requirements. The groups defined by the specifications in this 
final rule are the only groups permitted for satisfying the 
requirements of the registration program.

As proposed in the NPRM, the grouping system allows similar fuels and additives to be grouped together, rather than
creating separate fuel groups and additive groups. This convention recognizes that, to meet the requirements of
this final rule, an additive must be mixed with its associated base fuel
 prior to generating the emissions for testing. To the extent that the resulting additive/base fuel mixture is similar
to existing fuel formulations, the tests conducted on the emissions of the additive/base fuel mixture will be duplicative
of tests conducted on the related fuels. To avoid potential duplication, this final rule maintains the proposed approach,
in which closely-related fuels and additives are grouped together. Accordingly, the manufacturers of fuels and
the related additives can fulfill their individual registration responsibilities through jointly-supported
testing rather than through duplicative independent efforts. By grouping similar fuels and additives together,
the grouping scheme also avoids the need to define each generic product or product component as either a ``fuel'' or
an ``additive.'' This would otherwise present a problem when a given substance (or mixture) can serve as either a fuel
or an additive (e.g., ethanol). 




In the NPRM, EPA developed criteria for sorting individual F/FAs into groups of related formulations based on similarities
in the chemical/physical properties of the ``raw'' fuel or additive/base fuel mixture. EPA has maintained this approach
in the final rule. EPA expects F/FAs within each group to have similar emission characteristics and thus essentially
the same general effects on the public health and welfare. Therefore, chemical or toxicologic information associated
with individual members of a given group can reasonably be generalized to all F/FAs in the group. EPA will consider
tests performed on a selected representative of a group to apply to all members of the group for purposes of compliance
with registration requirements, for deciding whether to require additional testing under Tier 3, or for taking regulatory
action under CAA section 211(c). 
While each manufacturer of a fuel or fuel additive will still be held individually accountable for compliance with
the registration program, the grouping system provides an opportunity for meeting the program requirements in a
more cost-effective manner. Participation in the F/FA grouping system is strictly voluntary, and any manufacturer
may choose to fulfill the requirements on an individual basis. Those who choose to take advantage of the grouping opportunity
will be able to share their planning efforts, research capabilities, and financial resources to satisfy the information-gathering
and testing requirements of the F/FA registration program. To satisfy the chemical and biological testing requirements,
the required tests will be done on the selected representative for the respective group, rather than being repeated
for each of the F/FAs in the group. The results of the tests on the group representative will then be submitted jointly
for all members of the group, with applicable costs to be shared by the respective manufacturers (based on their cost-sharing
agreements, as discussed in Section IV.C). Manufacturers who question whether the results obtained for their group's
representative are valid for their own products may conduct confirmatory tests on their products on an independent
basis and at their own cost. However, until such independent test results are made available to EPA, the original results
submitted on behalf of the group will be considered valid for all member products, and could be applied by EPA to support
regulatory decisions under CAA section 211(c) or requirements for further testing under CAA section 211(b). 
The F/FA grouping system is expected to provide a number of benefits to the F/FA manufacturers who are responsible
for registration while increasing the efficiency and functionality of the registration program itself. First,
the grouping system will reduce the overall costs of the registration program by avoiding the generation and submission
of essentially redundant information by individual manufacturers with similar products. In addition, by reducing
the number of individual formulations that will be subject to testing, the grouping system is expected to ease the
pressure and demands on limited laboratory capacity. 


B. Grouping Approach and Criteria 


The basic conceptual framework for the grouping system is illustrated in Figure 3. First, each fuel or additive is
sorted into one of six broad ``fuel families.'' F/FAs in each fuel family are then subdivided into three ``F/FA categories.''
The categories are further subdivided into ``F/FA groups''_the ``working'' units of the grouping system. It is among
the members of the F/FA groups that cooperative evaluation and testing efforts can be pursued using designated group
representatives. This grouping system is very similar to the approach that was proposed in the NPRM, with the exception
that the original proposal has been simplified in today's rule by eliminating the separate concept of ``formulation
class.'' EPA judged that the ``formulation class'' concept could be confusing, and was not necessary for the structure
or implementation of the grouping system. The key parameters and relationships within this grouping framework are
further explained in the following sections. A summary of the grouping system is provided in Table F94-7 (see
 79.56) of the accompanying regulatory text for this rule.

Generic rules for categorization and grouping are used to determine specific F/FA groups based on the raw composition
of the particular products under consideration. The first step entails the selection of the applicable fuel family
and category for the product according to the criteria discussed below. Rules specific to the categories then define
the proper F/FA group. After the group is formed and arrangements are made for cooperative testing efforts, applicable
criteria will be applied to select a representative of the group to be used in group-sponsored testing. In determining
the category and group to which a fuel or fuel additive belongs, impurities present in trace amounts can be ignored
unless otherwise restricted in the definition of the particular fuel family. Impurities in fuels or fuel additives
are substances which are present through contamination, or remain naturally, after processing is completed.


1. Fuel Families


This final rule defines six fuel families, as follows: (1) Gasoline (containing more than 50 percent gasoline by volume),
(2) diesel (containing more than 50 percent diesel by volume; includes both diesel 

#

1 and diesel 

#

2 formulations), (3) methanol (containing at least 50 percent methanol by volume), (4) ethanol (containing at least
50 percent ethanol by volume), (5) methane (includes compressed natural gas and liquified natural gas containing
at least 50 mole percent methane), and (6) propane (i.e., liquid petroleum gas containing at least 50 percent propane
by volume). A manufacturer seeking to register a formulation which does not fit the criteria for inclusion in any of
the above fuel families shall contact EPA for guidance in classifying and testing such formulation.
In the NPRM, EPA proposed to establish two gasoline fuel families: unleaded and leaded. As explained previously,
EPA is not including a leaded fuel family in this final rule due to the upcoming ban of leaded F/FAs under CAA section
211(n). Thus, the unleaded fuel family has been renamed to become simply the ``gasoline'' fuel family in this final
rule.
Fuel families consist of a constellation of F/FA products sharing basic characteristics in regard to their chemical/physical
properties and engine/vehicle applicability. For ease of reference, the gasoline and diesel families are regarded
as the ``conventional'' fuel families, while the remaining four are referred to as the ``alternative'' fuel families.
If a manufacturer develops a F/FA product that does not meet the definition of any of the fuel families included in this
rule, EPA will define additional fuel families to include such a product.
Each fuel family includes not only the fuels referenced in the name of the family, but also bulk and aftermarket additives
which are intended for use in such fuels. Additives which are registered for use in more than one type of fuel are assigned
to each applicable fuel family. For example, an additive product that is registered as both a gasoline additive and
a diesel additive belongs to both the gasoline fuel family and the diesel fuel family. Furthermore, the manufacturer
of such additive product will be required to test the additive in each applicable fuel family. The multiple testing
responsibility can be satisfied by the manufacturer individually or by participating in the applicable groups for
each fuel family. For instance, if an additive product meets the baseline criteria for both gasoline and diesel, then
the product will be assigned to two groups, i.e., the gasoline baseline group and the diesel baseline group. The manufacturer
of such additive product will then be able to share the costs of testing with other manufacturers of baseline gasoline

F/FAs and baseline diesel F/FAs.
Today's rule specifies the chemical and physical characteristics of ``base fuel'' formulations for each defined
fuel family. These are generic formulations (rather than any particular commercial fuel) with average or normative
characteristics for a given fuel family. Once an additive has been assigned to the applicable fuel family or families,
determination of the proper category and group (for each applicable fuel family) for the additive is based on the properties
of the mixture that results when the additive is mixed in the base fuel of the applicable family at the maximum concentration
recommended for use by the additive manufacturer. Moreover, it is this mixture that is used for the generation and
testing of additive emissions.
 Tests conducted on the emissions of the base fuel then serve as one control (the other being a clean-air exposure group)
against which tests on the emissions of the additive/base fuel mixture are to be compared. Further discussion on the
definition and use of base fuels is presented in Section V.




2. F/FA Categories


Fuel families are subdivided into three F/FA categories: ``baseline,'' ``non-baseline,'' and ``atypical.'' The
baseline category consists of fuels and associated fuel additives which resemble the respective base fuel for a particular
fuel family in terms of elemental composition and which conform with certain quantitative limits for particular
constituents. It is important to understand that a baseline category is not limited to base fuels; the baseline category
and group criteria defined below for each fuel family are considerably less restrictive than the respective base
fuel definitions (specified in Section V). Non- baseline F/FAs contain no chemical elements other than those allowed
in the baseline category, but they exceed the allowable baseline limit for certain constituents for the respective
fuel family. The atypical category consists, in general, of F/FAs that contain chemical elements in addition to those
allowed in the baseline category. (In a few circumstances, the atypical category also includes F/FAs that exceed
specified baseline limits for certain constituents, as discussed below.) As mentioned above, the category determination
for fuel additives is based on the properties of the mixture which results when the additive is mixed in the appropriate
base fuel at the maximum concentration recommended for use by the additive manufacturer. If the fuel or additive/base
fuel mixture contains both non-baseline and atypical constituents, the formulation is characterized as atypical.
Thus, atypical constituents take precedence over non-baseline constituents.

In establishing the F/FA categories (and the groups within them), EPA has sought to avoid overly narrow definitions
which would result in unnecessary and duplicative testing by manufacturers, as well as overly broad definitions
which would cause potentially important toxicologic differences between F/FAs to be obscured. A basic guideline
EPA has used to find the proper balance between these two unsatisfactory scenarios is to ask whether the emissions
of a single group representative (i.e., test substance) can reasonably be expected to reflect the chemical and toxicologic
properties of the emissions of the F/FAs proposed to be classified together. In applying this guideline, EPA has kept
in mind both the homogenizing effect of combustion processes, as well as the need in some cases to examine the effects
of evaporative emissions, which generally retain the characteristics of the raw F/FA to a greater degree.
These considerations have led EPA to depend on the chemical elements in F/FA formulations as a primary criterion for
categorization and grouping. Another key criterion is the presence of significant amounts (by volume, weight, or
potential potency) of F/FA constituents that are likely to change the characteristics of the combustion or evaporative
emissions in substantive ways.
Accordingly, the baseline category in each fuel family is generally comprised of F/FAs containing no elements in
addition to carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and/or sulfur.
 These elements are the fundamental chemical building blocks of all of the fuel families defined in this rule. Omitting
any of these elements from the list of permissible baseline elements would eliminate all or most 
F/FAs from the baseline categories. On the other hand, allowing additional elements in the baseline definition would
introduce substances not characteristic of most 
F/FA products in the fuel family. If a group representative (test substance) did not contain the additional element,
it could not reasonably be assumed to reflect the presence and activity of F/FAs that do contain the element. Conversely,
if the group representative did contain the additional element, then the results of the testing would be influenced
by the presence and activity of this element, and would therefore not be valid for the large majority of the baseline
F/FAs. Thus, allowing F/FAs with additional elements to be included in the baseline categories (and groups) would
violate the principles of the grouping system and the objectives of the testing program.




F/FA formulations containing elements in addition to those allowed in the baseline category of a fuel family are classified
in the atypical category for that family. As described further below, such F/FAs are then subdivided into groups based
primarily on which atypical element(s) they contain. Moreover, the rules for choosing representatives of these
atypical groups emphasize the atypical constituent(s). This approach assures separate testing of F/FA products
with unique compositional characteristics that can reasonably be expected to appear in the emissions and may thus
have distinct emissions-based toxicologic effects. EPA believes that this approach best effectuates CAA section
211(e) by avoiding duplicative testing of similar F/FA products while requiring ``each'' F/FA to be tested.
Between the baseline category and the atypical category in each fuel family is the non-baseline category. Broad generalizations
about the non-baseline F/FA categories are somewhat more difficult to make, since they are distinguished from the
respective baseline categories by various attributes other than elemental composition. In the case of gasoline
and diesel F/FAs, the distinction is based primarily on the presence of significant concentrations of oxygenating
compounds. As discussed further below, the presence of such compounds may have a large impact on F/FA emission profiles.
Classification of the oxygenated F/FAs into separate categories from the baseline F/FAs (and further subdivision
into separate groups) is necessary to assure testing of representatives that can reasonably reflect the differences
in these emission mixtures and, possibly, their health effects. Similar principles apply to the non-baseline categories
in the alternative fuel families. In the case of alcohol fuels, non-baseline F/FAs are those which have a substantial
non-alcohol and non-gasoline component in the formulation. Non-baseline propane and methane formulations are
those containing significant amounts of substances other than propane and methane, respectively. In all of these
cases, the non-baseline definitions serve to ensure that F/FAs with properties that are likely to result in significantly
different emission profiles, with possibly different toxicologic effects, are not subsumed in the baseline category.

The following sections describe the criteria which determine 
F/FA categories for each fuel family. It should be noted that 
the criteria that define baseline F/FA products for each fuel 
family are not meant to be fuel specifications. The baseline 
criteria used for grouping purposes in this final rule consider 
the potential health implications of the composition of the fuel 
or additive/base fuel mixture and might differ from previously 
established commercial fuel specifications, such as those 
established by the American Society for Testing and Materials 
(ASTM), the California Air Resources Board (CARB), or federal 
``substantially similar'' criteria. 

a. 

Gasoline. 

EPA discussed in the NPRM two options (Option A and Option 
B) for distinguishing the baseline and non-baseline categories 
for the gasoline fuel family (see 57 FR 13187-13188). Today's 
action uses Option A for the classification of gasoline products. 
A discussion supporting this decision is included in the ``Summary 
and Analysis of Comments for the Fuels and Fuel Additives 
Registration Regulations'' (available in public docket A-90-07). 
A synopsis of EPA's analysis follows. 

The major differences between the two alternative grouping 
options considered by EPA in the NPRM were: (1) The cutoff point 
for oxygen content to distinguish between baseline and non-
baseline products, and (2) the approach for handling F/FAs that 
have received a waiver under CAA section 211(f). Under Option A, 
the baseline category was to be limited to F/FAs having less than 
1.5 weight percent oxygen by weight. Because the cut-off point 
of 1.5 percent is consistent with the minimum oxygen requirement 
for reformulated gasolines, reformulated gasolines would not be 
considered baseline under Option A. Instead, gasolines with 1.5 
percent or more oxygen were to be sorted into different non-
baseline groups depending on the oxygenated compounds they 
contained. In contrast, Option B used an oxygen cutoff point of 
2.7 weight percent, based on current ``substantially similar'' 
criteria (see 56 FR 5352). F/FAs which exceeded this limit but 
had been granted a waiver for the excess oxygen were also to be 
designated as baseline. 

After careful evaluation, EPA has selected Option A for the 
grouping of gasolines in this final rule. In arriving at this 
decision, EPA considered the testing and potential health effects 
implications of both grouping options. The main purpose of the 
grouping system is to sort F/FAs based on the similarities of 
their emission components. After analyzing existing emission 
characterization data, EPA concluded that Option B did not 
provide an adequate approach for the testing of gasoline F/FAs 
because it does not distinguish between formulations that may 
have significantly different emission characteristics. EPA's 
evaluation showed that the emissions from oxygenated gasolines 
are not the same as for non-oxygenated gasolines and that, 
furthermore, the emission profiles differ according to the 
particular oxygenated compound present in a fuel formulation. 
Differences in emission species will affect the toxicological 
characteristics of the fuel or additive/base fuel mixture. 
Option B was found inappropriate because it would have allowed 
the grouping of gasolines containing significant amounts of 
different oxygenated compounds into one single group. These 
different compounds may have distinguishable toxic effects. 
Therefore, EPA selected Option A for the grouping of gasolines in 
this final rule in order to adequately examine the potential 
health effects of the different oxygenated compounds. EPA 
believes this best effectuates the goal of CAA Section(e) to 
require testing of each fuel or fuel additive. 

In this final rule, gasoline formulations are defined as 
those containing more than 50 percent gasoline by volume. Based 
on current ``substantially similar'' criteria (see interpretative 
rule at 56 FR 5352), the sulfur content for all gasoline 
formulations in the gasoline fuel family is limited to 0.1 
percent by weight. 

F/FAs in the baseline gasoline category must contain no 
elements in addition to carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, 
and/or sulfur. Gasoline baseline formulations must possess, at 
the time of manufacture, all the physical and chemical properties 
of an unleaded gasoline and applicable volatility class standards 
as specified in the latest version of ASTM standard for 
Automotive Spark-Ignition Engine Fuel, D 4814. As discussed 
above, the oxygen content of baseline gasolines must be less than 
1.5 percent by weight. The baseline gasoline category includes 
all gasoline fuels and additives (evaluated as additive/base fuel 
mixtures) meeting the above criteria. 

The non-baseline gasoline category is comprised of F/FAs 
which conform to the baseline specifications in terms of 
elemental composition, but exceed the specified baseline oxygen 
limit. Thus, this category includes gasoline formulations with 
no elements in addition to carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, 
and/or sulfur, which have been blended with oxygenates (i.e., 
alcohol, ether, ester, furan, and any other compound used to 
increase the oxygen content of the gasoline formulation), such 
that the total oxygen content of the gasoline-oxygenate blend is 
at least 1.5 weight percent. Included in the non-baseline 
gasoline category are reformulated gasolines and oxygenated 
gasolines with at least 1.5 percent oxygen (by weight), including 
a number of formulations which have previously been granted CAA 
section 211(f) waivers on oxygen content. 

The atypical category in the gasoline fuel family includes 
F/FAs which contain elements in addition to carbon, hydrogen, 
oxygen, nitrogen, and/or sulfur. (Trace contamination by other 
elements does not cause a F/FA to be classified as atypical, 
however.)

The baseline gasoline group is restricted to formulations 
that are derived from conventional petroleum sources. Thus, 
gasolines derived from synthetic crude oils are excluded from the 
baseline category. Synthetic crude oils can be prepared from 
coal, shale and tar sands, heavy oil deposits, and other non-conventional petroleum sources. Compared to petroleum,
these 
synthetic crude oils must be extensively upgraded before they can 
be refined into useful products. Because of the nature of their 
sources, these synthetic products are likely to contain a variety 
of unknown contaminants with unknown health effects. With little 
specific data currently available on their composition, EPA 
believes that separate non-baseline classifications are most 
appropriate for grouping these products. Gasoline formulations 
derived from a particular synthetic crude oil source (e.g., coal) 
will be permitted to group together. The representative of each 
such group will be the first such product to seek registration. 

b. 

Diesel. 

Diesel formulations are defined as those containing more 
than 50 percent diesel by volume. The sulfur content for all 
diesel formulations in the diesel fuel family is limited to 0.05 
percent by weight, based on current EPA limits (55 FR 34120). 

The diesel fuel family includes both diesel 

#

1 and diesel 

#

2 formulations. 

As originally proposed, the diesel baseline category 
includes diesel formulations containing no elements in addition 
to carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and/or sulfur. Baseline 
diesel formulations must also possess, at the time of 
manufacture, all the physical and chemical properties of a diesel 
fuel as specified in the latest version of ASTM standard D 975. 
Oxygen content of baseline diesel formulations must be less than 
1.0 percent by weight. The baseline diesel category includes all 
diesel fuels that meet the above criteria. 

The diesel baseline definition is consistent with existing 
information in EPA's F/FA registration data base, which indicates 
that most commercial diesel fuels, including their bulk 
additives, consist of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and/or 
sulfur. While some currently registered diesel fuels contain 
additives with additional elements, the objectives of the testing 
program are inconsistent with broadening the diesel baseline 
definition to include other elements with potentially different 
health effects from those of basic diesel formulations. A 
broader baseline definition would mean that the atypical diesel 
F/FAs would not be separately examined. Limiting baseline diesel 
F/FAs to those containing no elements in addition to carbon, 
hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and/or sulfur ensures the conduct of 
separate health effects evaluations for the emissions of diesel 
formulations containing atypical elements. 

Similar to baseline gasoline, the baseline diesel category 
excludes fuels derived from synthetic crude oil sources. Thus, 
such formulations are included in the non-baseline category of 
the diesel family. The non-baseline diesel category also 
includes diesel formulations with 1.0 percent or more oxygen by 
weight. Examples of non-baseline diesel formulations are alcohol 
blends and biodiesel formulations. 

c. 

Methanol. 

F/FAs in the methanol fuel family are defined as those 
containing at least 50 percent methanol by volume. The baseline 
methanol category is comprised of methanol and methanol-gasoline 
F/FAs that: (1) Contain at least 50 percent methanol by volume, 
(2) contain no more than 4 percent by volume of substances other 
than methanol and gasoline, and (3) contain no elements in 
addition to carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur, and/or 
chlorine. The sulfur content of baseline methanol formulations 
is limited to 0.004 percent by weight. Chlorine (as chloride) is 
limited to no more than 0.0001 percent by weight. Chlorine is 
allowed in methanol baseline formulations because it is a common 
contaminant remaining from methanol production. 

The baseline methanol category includes all methanol fuels 
meeting the above criteria and is divided into two groups: M100 
group and M85 group. The M100 group includes methanol-gasoline 
formulations containing at least 96 percent methanol by volume, 
while the M85 group consists of methanol formulations containing 
50-95 percent methanol by volume. 

F/FAs within the baseline M100 group are required to contain 
odorants and bitterants. These formulations should have a 
distinctive and noxious taste, for purposes of preventing 
purposeful or inadvertent human consumption. The elemental 
composition of the odorant and bitterant is limited to carbon, 
hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur, and chlorine. Baseline 
methanol formulations in the M85 group must comply with the 
elemental composition specified above for all baseline methanol 
F/FAs, but need not have added odorants and bitterants. 

The non-baseline methanol category is comprised of methanol 
formulations (i.e., containing at least 50 percent methanol by 
volume) that meet the baseline limits on elemental composition, 
but contain more than 4 percent by volume of substances other 
than methanol and gasoline. 
a
Atypical methanol F/FAs contain elements in addition to 
those allowed in the baseline methanol category or exceed the 
specified limits for sulfur or chlorine.

d. 

Ethanol. 

Ethanol formulations in the ethanol fuel family are defined 
as those containing at least 50 percent ethanol by volume. The 
final rule defines a single group (represented by E85) for the 
baseline category of ethanol F/FAs. Although in the NPRM, EPA 
proposed two baseline groups for the ethanol fuel family (i.e., 
E100 and E85), EPA expressed its intention to establish a single 
group for baseline ethanol formulations in the Reopening Notice. 
As discussed in the Reopening Notice, the rationale behind this 
decision is that fuel ethanol is required to contain at least 
five percent denaturant, which means that, in actuality, E100 
formulations contain only 95 percent ethanol (i.e., E95). 
Furthermore, gasoline is normally used as the denaturant for 
ethanol fuels. EPA judged that there was little incremental 
value in requiring tests of E95 in addition to E85. Thus, the 
final rule creates a single baseline ethanol group represented by 
E85. However, EPA retains the authority to require testing on 
other members of any F/FA group under Tier 3 (see Section IX.A). 
 
The baseline ethanol category is comprised of ethanol and 
ethanol-gasoline F/FAs that: (1) Contain at least 50 percent 
ethanol by volume, (2) contain no more than 5 percent by volume 
of substances other than ethanol and gasoline, and (3) contain no 
elements in addition to carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, 
sulfur, chlorine, and/or copper. The sulfur content of ethanol 
baseline formulations is limited to 0.004 percent sulfur by mass. 
Chlorine (as chloride) and copper are allowed in the baseline 
ethanol formulations at a maximum level of 0.0004 percent by mass 
for chloride and 0.07 mg/l for copper. Chlorine and copper are 
permitted in the baseline ethanol formulations because they are 
common contaminants remaining from ethanol production. The 
baseline ethanol category includes all ethanol fuels meeting the 
above criteria. 

The non-baseline ethanol category is comprised of ethanol 
formulations (i.e., containing at least 50 percent ethanol by 
volume) that meet the baseline limits on elemental composition, 
but contain more than 5 percent by volume of substances other 
than ethanol and gasoline. 

Atypical ethanol F/FAs contain elements in addition to those 
specified in the baseline ethanol category or exceed the 
specified limits for sulfur, chlorine, or copper. 

e. 

Methane. 

Methane F/FAs are defined as those containing at least 50 
mole percent methane, including both compressed natural gas (CNG) 
and liquified natural gas (LNG). Baseline methane formulations 
must contain no elements in addition to carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, 
nitrogen, and/or sulfur, and must contain no more than 20 mole 
percent of non-methane hydrocarbons. Sulfur content for baseline 
methane formulations (including additives) is limited to 16 parts 
per million (ppm) by volume. Methane formulations must contain 
added odorants with an elemental composition that satisfies the 
baseline methane definition. The baseline methane category 
includes all methane fuels (and associated additives) meeting the 
above criteria. 

Non-baseline methane formulations are those that exceed the 
limit of 20 mole percent non-methane hydrocarbons. Atypical 
methane formulations include products containing elements in 
addition to carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, and/or sulfur, or 
exceed the baseline sulfur limit of 16 ppm by volume. 

f. 

Propane. 

Propane formulations are defined as those containing at 
least 50 percent propane by volume. The baseline propane 
category includes LPG formulations containing no elements in 
addition to carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and/or sulfur. 
Baseline LPG products are restricted to a maximum of 20 percent 
by volume for non-propane hydrocarbons. Sulfur content 
(including additives) is restricted to 123 ppm by weight. LPG 
formulations must have a distinctive odor. The elemental 
composition of odorants added to LPG formulations is limited to 
carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and sulfur. The baseline 
propane category includes all propane fuels (and associated 
additives) meeting the above criteria. 

Non-baseline propane formulations are those that exceed the 
specified limit for non-propane hydrocarbons. Atypical propane 
formulations include LPG products that contain elements in 
addition to carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, and/or sulfur, or 
exceed the baseline sulfur limit of 123 ppm by weight. 



3. F/FA Groups 



The F/FA groups are subdivisions of the F/FA categories and 
represent the final level of product classification within the 
grouping system. The groups are the actual operating units of 
the grouping system. The objective underlying the group 
definitions is to sort F/FAs together when it is reasonable to 
assume that their emission products will be essentially the same 
on a qualitative basis.

A summary table of the F/FA grouping system is included in the regulations (see Table F94-7 in  79.56).
In this table, the fuel families serve as column headings and the categories define the rows. The resulting combination
of fuel families and categories (i.e., the boxes in the table) contain the F/FA groups. Within each category, one or
more groups are defined according to the presence of differing constituents in the raw fuel or additive/base fuel
mixture. The number of groups in a particular F/FA category depends on the variability among the products in that category.
For example, the atypical category for each fuel family potentially consists of many groups that are defined according
to the atypical element(s) or constituent(s) specified for the particular family. Within each group, one formulation
is chosen to represent all of the member products in compliance with the registration requirements. Related costs
may be shared by participating F/FA manufacturers within each group.



Groups within the Baseline Categories.

 The baseline category for each defined fuel family contains a single F/FA group, with the exception of the baseline
methanol category. As discussed above, the baseline methanol category includes two groups: the M100 group and the
M85 group. The representative to be used in required emission characterization and health effects tests for each
baseline group is the designated base fuel for the respective fuel family (see Section V). For example, all gasoline
formulations meeting the gasoline baseline criteria are sorted into one group, to be represented in testing by the
designated gasoline base fuel. The same holds true for diesel, ethanol, methane, and propane fuel families. In the
case of methanol, baseline formulations are divided into two groups and testing is performed on two representatives,
one for each of the designated baseline groups, i.e., M100 base fuel and M85 base fuel. 



Groups within the Non-Baseline Categories.

 Non-baseline categories are defined for each fuel family. F/FAs in non-baseline groups include products that comply
with the baseline elemental composition restrictions for the respective fuel family, but do not meet quantitative
limits on certain baseline components (e.g., oxygen content). Non-baseline groups are defined according to the
constituent(s) that differentiate the fuel or additive/base fuel mixture from the baseline products in the respective
fuel family. The representative for each non-baseline group is the member of the group with the highest concentration
of the non-baseline constituent. 

(a) 

Gasoline. 

Gasoline formulations which comply with the baseline elemental composition criteria, except that they have a total
oxygen content of 1.5 weight percent or more, are designated as non-baseline. These products are grouped according
to the specific oxygenate compound (e.g., any specific alcohol, ether, or methanol/co-solvent combination) used
to increase the oxygen content of the gasoline formulation. Thus, separate non-baseline groups are defined for ethanol,
methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE), ethyl tertiary butyl ether (ETBE), tertiary amyl methyl ether (TAME), diisopropyl
ether (DIPE), di-methyl ether (DME), tertiary amyl ethyl ether (TAEE), etc. 

In the NPRM, EPA had proposed to define additional non-baseline groups for fuels containing combinations of oxygenate
compounds (or for which the registration contained multiple oxygenate additives), with separate groups defined
for each combination recorded in a registration. However, EPA decided not to require the testing of oxygenate combinations
in this final rule during the routine Tier 1 and Tier 2 testing program. EPA believes that the testing of fuels with individual
oxygenates will satisfy the main objectives of the program by providing basic information about the potential health
effects of particular oxygenated compounds in gasolines. Requiring routine testing of every recorded combination
was judged unreasonable, as it resulted in a number of groups that did not reflect actual formulations in use. If there
is concern about the toxicity of specific mixtures of oxygenated compounds, EPA may require additional testing under
Tier 3 on a case-by-case basis. 

An exception to this treatment of oxygenate combinations occurs in the case of non-baseline formulations containing
methanol. Existing ``substantially similar'' criteria currently limit the use of methanol as an oxygenate in gasoline
to 0.3 percent by volume (i.e., 0.1 percent by weight), unless the formulation contains appropriate alcohol co-solvents.
Thus, methanol-containing gasoline formulations with 1.5 weight percent oxygen or more must also contain a co-solvent.
Accordingly, in the grouping system, each methanol and co-solvent combination used in gasoline formulations defines
a different non-baseline group [e.g, methanol and isopropyl alcohol (IPA), methanol and tertiary butyl alcohol
(TBA), methanol and butanol, etc.]. Those oxygenate compounds used as co-solvents for methanol need to be identified
as such in a fuel's registration. If an oxygenate is not identified as a methanol co-solvent, even if it appears in a
fuel registration that also includes methanol, then EPA will assume that it defines a gasoline/oxygenate group separate
from the methanol/gasoline mixture. 

Within each non-baseline gasoline group, a formulation consisting of the base gasoline fuel blended with the highest
weight percent of the oxygenate or methanol/co-solvent combination registered for any member F/FA product will
serve as the group representative that will be tested to comply with the program's requirements. The selection of
the group representative is to be based on the highest actual concentration-in-use or the highest recommended concentration-in-use,
whichever is the greater, for the particular oxygenate or oxygenate/co-solvent blend.

EPA recognizes that current fuel registration procedures allow manufacturers to include in the original registration
a list of all the potential additives that might be used in the marketed fuel, along with the applicable range of concentration-in-use
for each alternative. Under these circumstances, this final rule makes the non-baseline producer responsible for
the testing of each oxygenate listed in the registration. For example, if a gasoline fuel registration lists methanol/co-solvent,
ethanol, MTBE, and ETBE, then the manufacturer is responsible for separately testing each of four gasoline/oxygenate
blends: gasoline-methanol/co-solvent, gasoline-ethanol, gasoline-MTBE, and gasoline-ETBE. The multiple testing
responsibility can be satisfied by the manufacturer individually or by participating in four applicable groups.
In each group, a formulation consisting of the base gasoline fuel blended with the highest concentration of the oxygenate
listed for any member fuel or additive/base fuel mixture would serve as the group representative to be tested to comply
with the program's requirements. 

The existing fuel registration procedures also allow manufacturers to report a range of concentration-in-use for
each bulk additive listed as a potential component of the registered fuel. Thus, it is possible for the same registration
to include formulations under both baseline and non-baseline definitions. If so, the manufacturer is responsible
for testing formulations in both categories covered by the indicated range listed in the registration. In other words,
if the reported range of concentration-in-use of an added oxygenate could include gasoline formulations with less
than 1.5 weight percent oxygen as well as formulations with 1.5 weight percent oxygen or more, then the manufacturer
is responsible for testing formulations in both baseline and non-baseline categories. For example, suppose a gasoline
registration includes two potential oxygenates with respective concentration-in-use (shown here in terms of the
resulting oxygen content in the formulation), as follows: ethanol (0 to 3.5 percent oxygen by weight) and ETBE (0 to
2.7 percent oxygen by weight). Because the indicated ranges include both baseline and non-baseline formulations,
the manufacturer would be responsible for the testing of three formulations: baseline gasoline, a non-baseline
gasoline-ethanol blend, and a non-baseline gasoline-ETBE blend. If the manufacturer chooses to participate in
grouping arrangements, then he/she would be sharing the cost of the testing for the representative of each of these
three groups. 

(b) 

Diesel.

 Non-baseline diesel formulations contain at least 1.0 percent oxygen by weight. Non-baseline formulations include
alcohol blends, ether blends, biodiesels (e.g., diesel-soy methyl ester blend), and other formulations containing
oxygenating compounds. Separate non-baseline groups are defined for each added alcohol or ether (e.g., methanol,
ethanol, DME, etc.) and for other oxygenating compounds by class (e.g., peroxides, nitroso compounds, nitro compounds,
alkyl nitrites, alkyl nitrates, animal-source alkyl esters, vegetable-source alkyl esters, furans, etc.). 

Diesel fuel manufacturers are responsible for the testing of each added alcohol, ether, or oxygenate class included
in their fuel registration. For example, if the registration includes added methanol and soy methyl ester, the manufacturer
will be responsible for testing two non-baseline formulations: (1) A diesel-methanol blend and (2) a diesel formulation
containing a vegetable-source alkyl ester. In order to satisfy the testing requirements, the manufacturer may perform
the tests individually or take advantage of the grouping provisions to share the testing costs with other manufacturers
of similar products. In the above example, the manufacturer will be able to group with other manufacturers of diesel
formulations containing methanol and with other manufacturers of formulations containing other vegetable-source
alkyl esters (e.g., rape methyl ester). 

For each diesel non-baseline group defined by the presence of an alcohol, ether, or class of oxygenating compound,
the representative to be used in testing will be a formulation consisting of the diesel base fuel blended with the highest
actual or recommended concentration-in-use of the particular alcohol, ether, or class of oxygenating compound,
as recorded for any member of the group. For example, if manufacturers form a group of non-baseline diesel formulations
containing vegetable-source alkyl esters, the group representative will be a diesel formulation containing the
highest volume percent of any of the vegetable-source alkyl esters represented in the group. The alkyl ester is to
be added to the base diesel fuel for conducting the required emission characterization and toxicity tests. 

EPA recognizes that current registration procedures allow manufacturers to include in the original diesel fuel
registration a list of all the potential oxygenating compounds that might be used in the marketed fuel, along with
the applicable range of concentration-in-use for each alternative. As with gasoline formulations, this final rule
requires the diesel fuel producer to test each alcohol, ether, or class of oxygenate listed in the registration. Also,
if a registration lists a range of oxygen content that defines both baseline and non-baseline formulations, then
the manufacturer is required to test both a baseline formulation and a non-baseline formulation. 

(c) 

Methanol.

 Non-baseline methanol formulations conform with the baseline limits in terms of elemental composition, but contain
more than 4 percent by volume of substances other than methanol and gasoline. Individual groups are defined for each
non-methanol, non-gasoline component, and for each unique combination of such components. The representative
of each non-baseline methanol group will be the group member with the highest concentration (i.e., percent by volume)
of the non-methanol, non-gasoline component(s).

<PARENT> FR940627-0-00019 </PARENT>

(d) 

Ethanol.

 Non-baseline ethanol formulations conform with the baseline limits in terms of elemental composition, but contain
more than 5 percent by volume of substances other than ethanol and gasoline. Individual groups are defined for each
non-ethanol, non-gasoline component, and for each unique combination of such components. The representative of
each non-baseline ethanol group will be the group member with the highest concentration (i.e., percent by volume)
of the non-ethanol, non-gasoline component(s). 

(e) 

Methane.

 There is only one non-baseline methane group. This group contains all methane formulations conforming with the baseline
criteria except that they exceed the allowable limit for non-methane hydrocarbons (i.e., 20 mole percent). The representative
for the non-baseline methane group will be the member formulation containing the highest concentration of non-methane
hydrocarbons. 

(f) 

Propane.

 Non-baseline propane formulations are those which conform with the baseline criteria except that they exceed the
allowable limit for non-propane hydrocarbons (i.e., 20 percent by volume). All non-baseline propane formulations
are sorted into a single group. The representative for the non-baseline propane group will be the member formulation
containing the highest concentration of non-propane hydrocarbons. 



Groups within the Atypical Categories.

 Atypical groups within each fuel family are defined according to the distinctive atypical constituent(s). Separate
groups are established for any single atypical constituent and any unique combination of atypical constituent(s)
which occurs among the products in each category. For example, if a gasoline fuel contains sodium, and no other atypical
element, then this atypical fuel will group with other gasoline fuels or additive/base fuel mixtures containing
sodium as their only atypical constituent. However, if a gasoline fuel contains sodium and potassium, then this fuel
will define a separate group for formulations containing both sodium and potassium. As explained previously, EPA
believes that this approach is reasonable because different atypical elements may have distinct toxicological
effects. Thus, while similarly composed F/FAs may group together, EPA believes that testing distinct F/FAs separately
best effectuates CAA Section 211(e), which states that ``each'' F/FA shall be tested.

<PARENT> FR940627-0-00019 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Groups are further subdivided according to the presence of polymers containing atypical element(s) in their molecular
structure. F/FAs containing polymers are considered atypical for a respective fuel family only if the F/FA product
as a whole contains one or more atypical elements. If the polymer contains an atypical element as part of its molecular
structure, then the atypical polymer defines a separate atypical group. For example, the presence of polyethylene
in a gasoline product does not in itself make that product atypical because polyethylene contains no elements in addition
to carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and sulfur. On the other hand, if the gasoline product contains chlorinated
polyethylene, then the product is considered atypical because of the chlorine content (chlorine is an atypical element
for the gasoline fuel family). Such product could group with other atypical gasoline products containing chlorinated
polymers. However, if the atypical gasoline product contains polyethylene and chlorine as two different components
of the formulation, the product will group with other atypical gasoline products containing chlorine in non-polymer
constituents. 

For groups defined by a single atypical constituent, the representative to be used in satisfying the group's testing
requirements will be the member fuel or additive/base fuel mixture with the highest actual or recommended concentration-in-use
of the atypical constituent. Within a group of such products containing a unique combination of two or more atypical
elements, the representative shall be the product which has the highest total concentration of atypical elements.
In the case that two or more products within such a group contain the same and highest concentration of atypical constituents,
the process specified for selecting the representative gives precedence to the highest total concentration of the
atypical constituents in the following priority order: (1) Total concentration of metals, (2) total concentration
of halogens, (3) total concentration of other atypical elements (including sulfur, if applicable), (4) total concentration
of polymers containing atypical elements, (5) total concentration of oxygen. 

As discussed previously, current fuel registration procedures allow manufacturers to include in their registration
a list of potential bulk additives to be used in the fuel. As a result, registrations could include several additives
containing one or more atypical constituents with the same purpose-in-use, but which are not intended by the fuel
manufacturer to be used at the same time. If several additives for the same purpose-in-use are listed in a single registration,
and if these additives contain different atypical elements, the manufacturer is responsible for testing each individual
atypical additive separately. This means that each unique atypical additive listed in a registration for the same
purpose-in-use will define a different testing group. On the other hand, if a fuel registration includes additives
with different functions and different atypical elements, and if these additives are normally blended together
in the same formulation, then the manufacturer 
is allowed to test them together (or to participate in an applicable group). For example, if a diesel fuel registration
lists two atypical biocide additives, one containing boron and the other containing chlorine, the fuel manufacturer
would then be responsible for testing two formulations (one diesel formulation containing boron and one diesel formulation
containing chlorine). However, if the registration includes a boron-containing biocide and a chlorine-containing
detergent, then the manufacturer may test the two additives together. 



C. Implementation of Grouping System and Cost-Sharing Provisions 



The grouping system included in this final rule allows manufacturers of similar F/FAs, on a voluntary basis, to pool
their resources and efforts to satisfy the registration requirements. The primary objectives of the grouping system
and cost-sharing provisions are to reduce the overall costs of the registration program and maximize the efficiency
of the program by avoiding duplication of effort. The grouping and cost-sharing provisions included in today's rule
are supported by CAA section 211(e)(3)(B), which permits manufacturers of similar F/FAs to share the testing costs
of the program so that requirements can be met without duplication. Although this rule allows 
manufacturers to comply with the program's requirements by participation in a group, each manufacturer continues
to be individually subject to this rule and responsible for testing under this rule. 

The practical implementation of the grouping system involves two major tasks: (1) The organization and administration
of group functions, and (2) the development of equitable arrangements for cost-sharing. Backed by its experience
with respect to the TSCA testing program, EPA judges that the F/FA industry, under the aegis of its various trade associations
or other third parties, is capable of accomplishing these tasks with little or no Agency assistance and interference.
EPA's experience with cost-shared testing under TSCA regulations (40 CFR part 791) indicates that manufacturers
prefer to work out their own cost-sharing arrangements, and EPA anticipates that F/FA registration applicants will
likewise prefer to work out their own cost-sharing agreements. Public comments from the regulated industry support
this assumption. Thus, EPA intends for manufacturers to work out cost-sharing agreements by themselves. However,
if F/FA manufacturers cannot work out cost reimbursement, this rule allows F/FA manufacturers to use procedures
similar to existing TSCA procedures [see  79.56(c) of this rule] for resolution of disputes.

<DOCNO> FR940627-0-00134 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940627-0-00019 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

In addition to establishing cost-sharing mechanisms, F/FA manufacturers will also need to develop agreements concerning
the division of responsibilities among group members for meeting the specific requirements of the registration
program. EPA expects the participation of industry trade associations in the formation of groups and management
of these activities. These associations should be able to establish ``third-party'' mechanisms whereby individual
manufacturers can enroll their products in appropriate groups while minimizing the extent to which confidential
data must be revealed. Each manufacturer needs to determine whether the grouping and cost-sharing advantages outweigh
the possible competitive risks involved. 

In general, F/FA manufacturers should be able to determine the appropriate groups for their products without EPA
involvement, according to the grouping criteria specified in this final rule, and to enroll their products into those
groups. However, EPA recognizes that some Agency involvement might be needed in some special cases. When appropriate,
based on EPA's discretion, the Agency will provide limited guidance for those manufacturers needing assistance
with the application of the grouping criteria to their specific products. 
Manufacturers of F/FAs registered prior to the effective date of this rule are required to notify EPA within six months
after the effective date of this rule if they intend to comply with the rule as part of a group and, if so, to identify the
person or entity which is organizing the testing (see Section 
XII.A). In this case, groups of producers would organize prospectively to complete the same program requirements
for their similar products and cost-sharing arrangements could be reached in advance of testing. 

Manufacturers of F/FAs not registered prior to the effective date of this rule are expected to conduct the required
testing individually, unless they certify to EPA that they intend to rely on data to be submitted (and/or previously
submitted) by an existing group or individual manufacturer of a similar registered product. The certification needs
to include assurances that the original submitter has been notified (see Section XII.A for notification requirements)
and that the manufacturer intends to comply with reimbursement as provided in this rule.

Under the reimbursement provisions in this rule, there will be a fifteen years ``reimbursement period'' for the original
submitter (individual or group) to obtain reimbursement from those manufacturers that rely on previously submitted
data. This period has been lengthened from the originally proposed five years in response to public comments. 



V. Base Fuel Specifications and Formulation Requirements 



In this final rule, EPA is establishing chemical and physical specifications to represent base fuel formulations
for each defined fuel family. EPA has adopted the method proposed in the reformulated gasoline rulemaking (56 FR 31176),
which uses sales-weighted averages of fuel survey data to determine national average chemical and physical parameters,
to establish base fuel specifications for gasoline and diesel. Because comparable survey data are not available
for alternative fuels, the base fuels for the alternative fuel families are based on CARB definitions and limited
survey information. 

The generic base fuel formulations will function as archetypes of the F/FAs in each fuel family and will serve as the
test substance or group representatives for the baseline group(s) for the respective fuel family. The use of consistently
formulated base fuels will facilitate the comparison of the emission and health effect test results from the many
fuel and fuel additive products within each fuel family. The base fuels will also serve as the fuel substrates into
which additives undergoing evaluation will be mixed prior to emission generation and testing. Tests conducted on
the emissions of the base fuel will then serve as controls against which tests on the emissions 
of the additive/base fuel mixture will be compared. 

In addition to defining chemical and physical parameters for each base fuel, EPA is also specifying the allowable
additive(s) to be included in the base fuel. EPA recognizes that commercial fuels typically contain additives to
control fuel quality and enhance fuel performance, as well as to help in fuel production and distribution. Ideally,
in order to better isolate the health effects associated with a particular additive or fuel, the base fuel would not
contain additives unless they were the actual test subjects. However, several bulk additive types are common to most
of the fuels within a given fuel family, and these should arguably be included as part of the base fuel. As a practical
matter, it would be difficult in some instances to find a fuel 
that did not contain certain additive types used by refiners to facilitate production or distribution. EPA is thus
requiring that base fuels contain a limited complement of the additives which are essential for the fuel's production
or distribution and/or for the successful operation of the test vehicle/engine throughout the mileage accumulation
and emission generation 
periods required under this rule. Since additives may have a substantial effect on emissions, for purposes of standardization
it is important to specify the additive types which are to be contained in the base fuels. However, the selection of
the specific product within each specified additive functional category is left to the formulator of the base fuel
and/or the manufacturer responsible for the testing. Unless otherwise restricted, the presence of trace contaminants
does not preclude the use of a fuel or fuel additive as a component of a base fuel. 

Additive requirements for each defined base fuel are discussed in the following sections. Additives used as base
fuel components are to be added at the minimum treatment rate needed for effective performance. In contrast, additives
to be tested must be mixed in the base fuel at the maximum in-use concentration recommended by their manufacturers.
 When a fuel additive is tested, any additive normally contained in the base fuel which serves the same function as the
test subject additive must be removed from the base fuel formulation. For example, if a corrosion inhibitor is to be
tested, this test additive would replace the corrosion inhibitor normally included as a component in the base fuel.
This substitution requirement may preclude the use of certain multi-functional additives as base fuel components
(in the case where the subject additive serves one of the functions of the multi-functional additive), since it would
not be possible to replace a portion of a multi-functional additive with the test subject additive. 






Note: 

The specifications in the following sections describe the base fuel(s) for each fuel family, which serve the test
fuel functions discussed above. These base fuel specifications are not the same as the criteria which permit F/FAs
to join the baseline group within a fuel family. The baseline group criteria are provided in the preceding section
of this preamble.

A. Gasoline 



For the gasoline base fuel, EPA is requiring the use of the reformulated gasoline summer baseline fuel as specified
in CAA Section 211(k)(10)(B)(i). This unleaded gasoline fuel, which is free of oxygenates, was determined from fuel
survey data and will be used to represent all grades of conventional gasoline. This base fuel has the same specifications
as the industry average gasoline used in many recent fuel emission studies, including the Auto/Oil Program
 and EPA's reformulated gasoline testing program. Selecting this formulation as the base gasoline fuel allows the
comparison of emission characterization results from the F/FA testing program with a larger body of current emission
data. The blending tolerances for the gasoline base fuel are consistent with certain blending tolerances specified
in the RFG rule (59 FR 7716). 





The gasoline base fuel must contain the following additives: deposit control, corrosion inhibitor, demulsifier,
anti-oxidant, and metal deactivator. In addition to the above required additives, the final rule allows manufacturers
to use anti-static additives in the gasoline base fuel, if needed. Anti-static additives are not required in gasoline
base fuel because this type of additives is not considered essential for the fuel's production, distribution, or
the vehicle operation. Thus, anti-static additives should be used only as a safety measure on a case-by-case basis,
as needed (e.g., when static problems present a risk of explosion). The required and permissible gasoline base fuel
additives may contain no elements in addition to carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and/or sulfur. 

In the Reopening Notice, EPA proposed to preclude the use of sulfur-containing additives in the gasoline base fuel.
However, in response to a number of comments from the regulated industry, this final rule permits up to 15 ppm sulfur
to be included in the additives. The total sulfur content in the base fuel, including any sulfur contributed by the
additive components, must equal 339 ppm (within a tolerance of 

# 

25 ppm). A summary of the gasoline base fuel specifications and its additive components is provided in the accompanying
regulations [see Table F94-1 in  79.55(b)].



B. Diesel 



Reflecting its predominant usage, 

#

2 diesel is selected in this final rule as the base fuel for diesel. The specifications for the diesel base fuel were
determined by calculating an industry average diesel fuel from 1990 industry and government diesel fuel survey data.
The sources of data and methods of 
calculations are contained in the docket for this rulemaking.
 The blending tolerances for the diesel base fuel have been set to be comparable to those used in the gasoline base fuel.
An exception to this general methodology is the base fuel specification for sulfur level. The required sulfur level
(0.05 weight percent) reflects current on-road diesel fuel sulfur limits (55 FR 34120). 





The additives required as diesel base fuel components are: corrosion inhibitor, demulsifier, anti-oxidant, and
metal deactivator. In addition to the above required additives, the final rule allows the use of anti-static and flow
improver additives in the diesel base fuel, as needed. As with gasoline, anti-static additives are not required because
they should only be used in the case of static accumulation problems. Similarly, flow improvers may be used on a need
basis to improve cold weather handling.

As in the gasoline base fuel, the diesel base fuel additives may contain sulfur, as well as carbon, hydrogen, oxygen,
and nitrogen. The total sulfur content in the diesel base fuel formulation, including any sulfur contributed by the
additives, may not exceed 0.05 percent by weight. A summary of the diesel base fuel specifications and allowed additive
components is provided in the regulatory text [see Table F94-2 in  79.55(c)].

EPA has used CARB definitions and other available 
information to establish base fuel specifications for each 
alternative fuel family (see Tables F94-3_F94-6 in  79.55). 
However, due to rapidly developing technology, the fuel additive 
package requirements for these fuels are not as well established 
as for gasoline and diesel. In fact, there is only limited 
information available on the additive requirements for the 
successful long-term operation of each alternative fuel/vehicle 
combination. Hence, it is the responsibility of the F/FA 
manufacturers who are required to test such base fuels (in 
consultation with EPA), to comply with the additive requirements 
of the manufacturer of the particular vehicle/engine used for the 
testing of alternative F/FAs. If the manufacturer of an 
alternatively-fueled vehicle or engine specifies that additives 
(beyond those specified in the regulations), are essential for 
operation, then the F/FA manufacturer should submit a request to 
EPA to use those additional additives as components of the base 
fuel at the minimal effective level. EPA will publish a document 
in the 

Federal Register

 whenever approving such a request to 
modify a base fuel. 


1. Methanol 



The methanol fuel family contains two fuel groups, one for 
M100 fuels and one for M85 fuels. Each of these methanol groups 
has its own base fuel. These base fuels may only contain the 
elements carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur, and 
chlorine. The chlorine (as chloride) is permitted as a 
contaminant remaining from methanol production, and is limited to 
no more than 0.0001 percent by mass. The sulfur content may not 
exceed 0.002 percent by mass in the base M100 fuel and may not 
exceed 0.004 percent by mass in the base M85 fuel. 

The M100 base fuel must consist of 100 percent chemical 
grade methanol by volume. The M85 base fuel is to contain 85 
percent chemical grade methanol by volume, blended with 15 volume 
percent base gasoline fuel (meeting the gasoline base fuel 
specifications outlined in Section V.A., above). Specifications 
for the methanol base fuels are listed in Table F94-3 in 
 79.55(d) of the regulations. 

Some gasoline detergents have been shown to cause intake 
system deposits when used in M85 applications. Likewise, 
lubricating oils containing calcium have been shown to cause 
injector tip deposits in M100 applications. Therefore, EPA 
recommends that F/FA manufacturers determine the methanol 
compatibility of lubricating oils as well as fuel additives used 
in the gasoline portion of the M85 base fuel. 


2. Ethanol 



The ethanol fuel family contains one group, represented by 
E85 base fuel. The E85 base fuel is to contain 85 percent 
chemical grade ethanol by volume, blended with 15 volume percent 
base gasoline. The ethanol base fuel may only contain the 
elements carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur, chlorine, 
and copper. The chlorine (as chloride) is permitted as a 
contaminant remaining from ethanol production, and is limited to 
no more than 0.0004 percent by mass. The sulfur content may not 
exceed 0.004 percent by mass. Copper, also a contaminant from 
ethanol production, is limited to 0.07 mg/L. 

Additives used in the gasoline component of E85 base fuel 
must be ethanol-compatible. The base fuel specifications for E85 
are summarized in Table F94-4 in  79.55(e) of the regulatory 
text. 


3. Methane 



The methane fuel family is represented by a natural gas base 
fuel whose specifications are within the proposed ranges for 
natural gas certification fuel (as proposed in 57 FR 52912). 
This base fuel may only contain the elements carbon, hydrogen, 
oxygen, nitrogen, and sulfur, with the sulfur limited to 16 parts 
per million (by volume). The methane base fuel must contain 
added odorant for leak detection purposes, used at a level such 
that at ambient conditions the fuel has a distinctive odor potent 
enough for its presence to be detected down to a concentration in 
air of not over 1/5 (one-fifth) of the lower limit of 
flammability. 

In the Reopening Notice, EPA proposed that any sulfur in the 
methane base fuel be limited to that contained in the odorant 
additive. In response to public comment, this restriction has 
been removed; however, the total sulfur in the methane base fuel 
formulation, including that contributed by any additives, may not 
exceed 16 parts per million. The methane base fuel specifications 
are listed in Table F94-5 in  79.55(f) of the accompanying 
regulations. 


4. Propane 



The propane fuel family is represented by a commercial LPG 
base fuel. The propane base fuel may only contain the elements 
carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and sulfur, with the sulfur 
limited to 123 ppm (by weight). The propane base fuel must 
contain added odorant, for leak detection purposes, at a level 
such that at ambient conditions the fuel has a distinctive odor 
potent enough for its presence to be detected down to a 
concentration in air of not over 1/5 (one-fifth) of the lower 
limit of flammability. As in the case of the methane base fuel, 
the final rule does not require the sulfur in the formulation to 
be contained only in the odorant additive. Rather, the sulfur 
limitation applies to the fuel/additive mixture in combination. 
The propane base fuel specifications are listed in Table F94-6 in 
 79.55(g) of the regulatory text.

VI. Emission Generation 


A. General Approach 



As part of the registration requirements, F/FA manufacturers 
are required to conduct a detailed characterization of the 
combustion and evaporative emissions of their products, as well 
as biological tests in which animals are exposed to these 
emissions. The next sections describe the methods specified in 
the rule for generating the emissions to be used in these 
chemical and biological tests. 

As proposed in the NPRM, combustion emissions are to be 
generated using applicable portions of the FTP.
 To control 
some of the inherent variability of FTP emissions generated under 
transient engine operation,
 this final rule requires the use 
of a mixing chamber or other apparatus (see Section VI.B.2). 
This is one of the approaches discussed for consideration in the 
Reopening Notice. EPA is permitting the use of either the engine 
dynamometer or the chassis dynamometer for emission generation 
during biological testing using FTP or FTP-equivalent cycles. 
For the reasons discussed in the Reopening Notice, EPA has 
decided to require the use of non-catalyzed emissions (i.e., 
untreated exhaust emissions)
 for biological testing in order 
to assure that the test animals are exposed to the full range of 
emission species potentially resulting from the combustion of 
F/FAs. A brief summary of the rationale behind this decision is 
included below. 






It is important to keep in mind that the purpose of this 
program is not to test the effectiveness of emission control 
devices or to directly evaluate the emission performance of 
various vehicles and engines. Rather, it is to examine the 
potential toxicologic effects of the emissions produced by F/FAs 
in use. With modern emission control technology in place, most 
of the ambient air pollutant species attributable to automobile 
exhaust come from two sources: Malfunctioning vehicles (``high 
emitters'') and normal vehicles during their cold start period, 
when their engines run rich and their catalytic converters have 
not yet reached effective operating temperatures. The variety of 
emissions from these two important sources are not well 
represented by hot, catalyzed exhaust generated from well-
maintained, modern vehicles. Emissions during the cold-start 
include hundreds of organic chemical species which are generated 
before the catalytic converter reaches its effective temperature. 
Once the catalytic converter is warmed-up, its efficiency 
increases to the point where only a dozen or so simple compounds 
remain in readily measurable amounts in the catalyzed exhaust. 
Thus, the use of catalyzed exhaust in the biological testing 
program would exclude from the tests relevant emission species 
that could potentially be harmful to human health or the 
environment. In fact, laboratory animals would be exposed to 
only very few of the organic emission species associated with the 
combustion of the fuel or additive of interest. In contrast, the 
ambient air normally contains the full range of combustion 
emissions, since cold-start emissions are continuously reintroduced and some ``high emitters'' are always in operation.

Since humans experience long-term exposure to these emissions, 
EPA believes it is important that they be included in the test 
exposure atmosphere. EPA's analysis
 of non-catalyzed emission 
data demonstrates that emissions that receive no aftertreatment 
represent a comprehensive aggregate of characteristic combustion 
products at enriched concentrations, including the species which 
may otherwise be emitted only during the cold start or by high-
emitting vehicles. In order to simulate emissions that include 
the full range of potential species produced in the combustion of 
F/FAs, EPA is requiring the use of non-catalyzed emissions for 
biological testing in this program. 





With the exception of exhaust after-treatment devices, this 
final rule requires that all normally required emission control 
equipment be present and fully operational on all test vehicles 
and heavy-duty engines used in the generation of non-catalyzed 
emissions. In order to maintain the appropriate operation of the 
exhaust system while obtaining non-catalyzed emissions, EPA 
requires the use of non-functional aftertreatment devices (e.g., 
a blank catalyst with no catalytic wash coat) in order to 
simulate the back pressure, residence time, and mixing 
characteristics usually provided by normally functioning 
aftertreatment devices. Special emission generation allowances 
for the testing of specific additives which are introduced for 
use in conjunction with certain aftertreatment devices are 
discussed in Section VI.F.

B. Combustion Emission Generation 


1. For Emission Characterization 



Manufacturers are required under Tier 1 to characterize the 
combustion emissions of their F/FAs. Depending on the fuel 
family in question, vapor-phase, semi-volatile, and particulate 
emissions may be required to be characterized.
 As discussed 
in Section VII.B., the emission characterization requirements 
include the measurement of hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, oxides 
of nitrogen, particulates, aldehydes, ketones, alcohols, ethers, 
polycyclic aromatic compounds, and atypical products, as 
applicable. 





Both untreated (non-catalyzed) and treated (tailpipe)
 
emissions generated using FTP conditions are to be characterized. 
Characterization of the tailpipe emissions will allow comparison 
of emissions from the test F/FA product with results from other 
studies. Characterization of the non-catalyzed emissions will be 
used to identify the emissions to which animals will be exposed 
in the biological tests. 




Applicable FTP procedures to be used in generating 
emissions are specified in 40 CFR part 86. The Urban Dynamometer 
Driving Schedule (UDDS)
 and the Engine Dynamometer Driving 
Schedule (EDS)
 cycles of the FTP shall be used in the emission 
generation for light-duty vehicles and heavy-duty vehicles, 
respectively. The motoring portion of the heavy-duty test cycle 
can be eliminated, at the manufacturer's option, for the 
generation of emissions. This will allow the use of relatively 
inexpensive dynamometer equipment without compromising the value 
of the test. 





As discussed earlier, this final rule allows the use of a 
vehicle or engine for emission generation using FTP procedures. 
In the case of F/FAs normally used in light-duty vehicle 
applications, if an engine is to be used, the appropriate speed 
versus torque trace for the UDDS must be determined in a vehicle 
on a chassis dynamometer prior to emission generation. The 
engine used for emission generation in this testing program must 
then be operated under specific speed and torque conditions that 
simulate the UDDS. 

In light-duty vehicle testing, vapor phase emission samples 
are to be collected for each segment of the FTP cycle (i.e., Bag 
1, Bag 2, and Bag 3). In addition, a semi-volatile sample and a 
particulate sample are to be collected during the driving cycle 
for light-duty vehicles. The heavy-duty testing procedure 
includes two tests: a cold-start test and a hot-start test. All 
three emission phases (i.e., vapor, semi-volatile, and 
particulate) are to be collected for each heavy-duty test. Some 
modifications to the standard FTP may be required for collection 
of semi-volatile and particulate emissions, which are required 
for emission characterization and in-vitro biological testing 
(see next section). Special procedures may also be necessary in 
order to characterize emissions from F/FAs containing atypical 
elements. Good engineering and analytical chemistry practices 
should be followed while modifying the applicable test cycle for 
the collection of fractions not specified in 40 CFR part 86. 
Such modifications must be described in detail in the discussion 
of emission generation procedures to be included in the report 
provided to EPA, as discussed in Section XII.B. 

Vapor-phase emissions are to be collected and stored in 
Tedlar bags for subsequent chemical analysis. These emissions 
can be stored for only a limited period of time before chemical 
changes may occur. The critical time period is a function of the 
composition of the emissions, storage temperature and pressure, 
type of storage container, exposure to ultraviolet light, and the 
amount of deterioration that is considered acceptable. The 
maximum allowable storage times for emissions which are to be 
subjected to chemical analysis will vary depending on the 
speciation protocol, and are identified in relevant parts of the 
regulatory text.

<TEXT>
 

The particulate fraction may be collected on a single filter 
instead of on multiple filters as prescribed in the FTP. 
Although the filter collection procedures outlined in the CFR 
were designed for heavy-duty emission testing, these methods are 
applicable and can be used in light-duty applications as well. 
Similarly, semi-volatile phase emissions are to be collected on 
one apparatus for the entire driving cycle. Semi-volatile 
emissions are collected immediately downstream from the 
particulate collection filters using porous polymer beds or other 
equipment designed for their capture.
 After collection, the 
soluble organic fractions of the particulate and semi-volatile 
emissions are to be separately extracted using appropriate 
laboratory procedures.
 Because the extracted materials are 
much more stable than gaseous combustion emissions, they can be 
stored up to six months if protected from ultraviolet light and 
maintained at or below ^20 
 C. Particulate phase emissions can be 
stored either on the collection filter or after extraction. 
Semi-volatile phase emissions must be extracted immediately after 
collection. The duration of the collection process which will be 
needed to obtain sufficient quantities of the test substance will 
vary depending on the emission characteristics of the engine and 
fuel or additive/base fuel mixture, and on the requirements of 
the biological test protocol. If an insufficient amount of 
particulate or semi-volatile material is obtained during a single 
driving cycle, the FTP may be repeated as required and the 
extracted organic fractions combined. 





2. For Biological Testing 


Non-catalyzed emissions are to be generated for conducting 
biological tests, following the same procedures described above 
for emission characterization. 


In vitro 

biological testing (i.e., the Salmonella assay) is 
to be conducted on extracts of the particulate and semi-volatile 
emission phases separately. Particulate and semi-volatile 
emissions are to be collected in a manner identical to the 
procedure used for particulate and semi-volatile emission 
characterization. 
The 

in vivo 

biological testing requires the generation of 
whole untreated emissions for a minimum of six hours per day, 
five days per week, for 13 weeks. To generate these emissions, 
light-duty vehicles (or engines) with non-functional 
after treatment devices (e.g., blank catalyst with no catalytic 
wash coat) are to be operated under FTP or FTP-equivalent engine 
conditions. The continuous generation of emissions throughout 
the required exposure period requires light-duty vehicles/engines 
to be driven through repeated UDDS cycles and heavy-duty engines 
to be operated over repeated EDS cycles. If desired, registrants 
may automate their emission generation system. 
As discussed in the Reopening Notice, EPA was concerned 
about the inherent variability of FTP-generated emissions. To 
accommodate the FTP transient cycle within the biological testing 
program, this rule requires the use of an apparatus to provide a 
more stable exposure environment for biological testing. For 
this purpose, EPA recommends the development and use of a large 
dilution/mixing/integration chamber located between the constant 
volume sampling (CVS) system and the final dilution apparatus, 
just prior to the exposure chamber containing the test animals. 
The mixing chamber will allow the necessary adjustment of the 
exhaust concentrations and integration of the large concentration 
swings typical of FTP exhaust, prior to exposing the test 
animals. This chamber must meet certain performance 
specifications based on the average concentration of total 
hydrocarbons in the exhaust. That is, the average concentration 
of total hydrocarbons leaving the mixing chamber must be within 
ten percent of the average concentration of total hydrocarbons 
entering the chamber. Much of the CVS system concentration 
variability is associated with the rapidly changing dilution 
ratios that result from rapidly changing exhaust flow rates. EPA 
recognizes that vehicle exhaust sampling devices, such as mini- 
diluters,
 are being developed to maintain constant dilution 
ratios during transient testing. These systems will eliminate 
much of the concentration variability of classical CVS exhaust. 
As discussed in the Reopening Notice, these systems are currently 
under development and their use at this time is limited. 
However, today's rule will allow their use if they can meet the 
performance specifications defined above as well as other 
requirements of the testing program.

The combustion emissions generated for animal testing are to 
be diluted prior to delivery to the test animals. The CVS 
system, commonly used to condition exhaust for sampling and 
analysis, provides for controlled ambient air dilution of the 
combustion emissions. However, water condensation can be a 
problem during CVS system sample conditioning, depending upon 
vehicle fuel consumption and fuel economy, dilution air humidity, 
and exhaust/diluent ratio.
 The use of pre-dried dilution air 
will lower the sample humidity, thus permitting lower dilution 
ratios and higher concentration of hydrocarbons to be achieved 
without condensation of water vapor. The minimum dilution ratio 
will vary with fuel composition. For example, a minimum dilution 
ratio of about 1:5 raw exhaust (dewpoint about 125 
 F) with dry, 
clean filtered air is expected for gasoline fuels to reduce the 
water concentration to a dewpoint of about 68 
 F. The minimum 
dilution ratio (maximum exhaust flow rate) occurs at about 200 
seconds into the UDDS transient driving cycle. The dilution 
ratio is expected to be greater for methanol, ethanol, and 
natural gas fuels than for gasoline fuels because the exhaust 
water concentrations are greater with these alternative fuels. 
Heated transfer ducts or tubing can be used to avoid water 
condensation in much of the system, but the 
dilution/mixing/integration chamber will generally be at or near 
laboratory temperature (about 70 
 F), and CVS dilution will have 
to be adequate to assure that the cumulative integrated chamber 
dew point remains below laboratory temperature at all times. 





After initial dilution to preserve the character of the 
emissions, the exhaust stream may be further diluted to achieve 
the desired biological exposure concentrations. In testing the 
emissions of a particular fuel or additive/base fuel mixture, a 
manufacturer shall determine an optimum range of dilutions with 
which to characterize the health effects of the test substance. 
The range of dilutions shall include, at a minimum, an overtly or 
highly toxic concentration, a minimally toxic or non-toxic 
concentration, and a concentration of emissions having an 
intermediate level of toxicity. The selected concentrations must 
allow the determination of a concentration-response relationship 
(see Section VIII.A.3). EPA recommends that manufacturers review 
available literature for information on the design of inhalation 
studies.







One important factor to consider in determining the exposure 
concentrations or dilutions is the effect of carbon monoxide (CO) 
concentration in test animals. The CO concentration in the 
emissions is expected to be a limiting factor in establishing the 
appropriate dilutions for the testing of F/FAs. Anoxia, among 
other negative health effects from this combustion product, may 
mask the more subtle health effects of F/FA emissions. EPA 
recommends that manufacturers review available literature on 
previous toxicity studies for information on appropriate CO 
concentrations that have been used in the exposure of laboratory 
animals to automobile emissions.

3. Verification Testing 


A number of mechanisms can cause emissions to be captured in 
the dilution and sampling system before they can be characterized 
or used for animal exposures. Verification testing is required 
to determine the ratio (``recovery factor'') of emissions that exit 
the sampling system to those that enter the system. This ratio 
must be high in order for subsequent emission testing to be 
meaningful. 
EPA requires testing to verify the exposure atmosphere and 
to monitor the performance of the dilution/sampling system and 
mixing chamber, ensuring the repeatability of test results. 
Verification testing of the dilution/sampling system must be 
accomplished by injecting a known sample at the inlet and 
measuring the amount that exits the sample probe. For example, 
an injected hydrocarbon sample could be detected with a gas 
chromatograph and flame ionization detector to estimate the 
recovery factor. Similar verification procedures apply to the 
verification testing of the mixing chamber. Verification 
procedures for the dilution/sampling system and mixing chamber 
are included in  79.57(e)(2)(v) of the accompanying regulations. 
Additional requirements include the monitoring of conditions 
(e.g., air flow, CO levels, etc.) in the inhalation exposure 
chamber and verification of test animal exposure levels (see 
 79.61). 


C. Evaporative Emission Generation 


Section III.A.2 discusses the RVP criteria which determine 
the applicability of evaporative emission testing to specific 
fuels and additive/base fuel mixtures. Evaporative emissions 
from in-use vehicles include diurnal, hot soak, resting and 
running loss emissions, and refueling emissions. However, to 
simplify the generation and collection procedures and to supply 
evaporative emissions of sufficient concentration for biological 
exposure testing, today's rule requires that evaporative 
emissions be generated using an evaporative emission generator 
(EEG). Emissions to be used both for characterization tests and 
biological exposure tests are to be generated in this way. The 
EEG is a fuel tank or vessel to which heat is applied to cause a 
portion of the fuel or additive/base fuel mixture to evaporate at 
a desired rate. Manufacturers will have flexibility in the 
design of the EEG used to test their particular F/FA. The size 
and/or number of EEG units to be used for evaporative emission 
testing will depend on the rate of emissions needed for the 
inhalation study. The vapor pressure of the F/FA product may 
influence the required tank size, as well. Emission rate 
modifications shall not be adjusted by temperature control, since 
emission composition is sensitive to temperature changes.

<TEXT>
 

In general, the composition of evaporative emissions from 
vehicles does not resemble fully-evaporated whole samples of raw 
fuels or fuel additives. This phenomenon is due to differences 
in the vapor pressure of the fuel or fuel additive components and 
the effects of evaporative emission control equipment. To 
simulate this phenomenon with the EEG, procedures are to be 
followed to ensure that the evaporated fraction contain a 
reasonable representation of potential evaporated emission 
compounds. The EEG will be run at 13

#

05 
 F and will be equipped 
with a drain. The fuel will be drained and replenished 
periodically in order to maintain a constant composition and 
prevent the build-up of heavier compounds in the non-evaporated 
portion. The concentration of emissions of the evaporated fuel 
or additive/base fuel mixture in the vapor space of the EEG 
during the time emissions are being withdrawn for testing shall 
not vary more than ten percent from the equilibrium concentration 
in the vapor space of emissions generated from fresh fuel or 
additive/base fuel mixture in the evaporative chamber. 
EPA recognizes that other methods may also be suitable for 
generating F/FA evaporative emission mixtures for the testing 
purposes of this program. One possible alternative method was 
suggested in a comment received by EPA in response to the 
Reopening Notice.
 Based on the distillation properties of the 
test formulation, the suggested method would involve the 
distillation, condensation, and storage of the light-end 
components of the test fuel mixture, with revaporization of this 
whole fraction to generate test atmospheres. Other alternatives 
may also be valid. To accommodate these potential alternatives, 
the final rule contains a provision (see  79.57(f)(5) of the 
accompanying regulations) which permits manufacturers to request 
approval for methods other than the EEG for generating 
evaporative emission test atmospheres. To be granted, such 
requests must include supporting information which demonstrates 
(among other requirements) that the proposed procedures will 
generate emissions reasonably similar to in-use evaporative 
emission mixtures and that the generated emissions will be 
sufficiently concentrated to be useful in the context of 
toxicology tests. Approved procedures will be placed in the 
public docket. 




For applicable F/FAs, evaporative emission characterization 
requirements include the measurement of total volatile organic 
compounds with speciation of the hydrocarbon compounds, alcohols, 
ethers, and atypical compounds. Characterization requirements 
are discussed in Section VII.B. 
For biological testing, evaporative emissions will be 
diluted and routed to the animal chambers in a manner similar to 
the method used for combustion emissions health effects testing, 
as described in the previous section, except that a mixing 
chamber is not required. The rate of emission generation shall 
be high enough to supply the biological exposure chamber with 
sufficient emissions to allow for a minimum of fifteen air 
changes per hour. 
The concentration of total hydrocarbons in the evaporative 
emission stream routed to the biological exposure chambers is to 
be diluted to three separate concentrations to establish a range 
of responses similar to combustion emission testing (see previous 
section). Evaporative emissions are not constrained by CO, NO

X

, 
or CO

2

 levels, and hence can be used at higher concentrations 
than combustion emissions. Verification testing is required for 
evaporative emissions in a manner analogous to the verification 
testing performed for combustion emissions. 


D. Vehicle Selection 


EPA is requiring that new vehicles or engines be used for 
the combustion emission generation and testing of F/FAs to avoid 
the carry-over effects from previously used fuels. All F/FAs 
must be tested in vehicles or engines (corresponding to chassis 
or engine dynamometer testing, respectively) that have been 
operated exclusively on the fuel or additive/base fuel mixture to 
be tested.

<TEXT>
 

EPA is also requiring that vehicles and engines used for the 
testing of


F/FAs be unaltered from original equipment 
manufacturer (OEM) specifications (with the exception of 
modifications in aftertreatment devices as described in Section 
VI.A). Rebuilds and alteration kits will only be allowed upon 
EPA's approval, when a F/FA manufacturer demonstrates to EPA that 
OEM equipment suitable for their F/FA product's testing is 
unavailable. 


As proposed in the NPRM (57 FR 13192-13193), vehicle and 
engine selection must follow the criteria outlined in  79.57(a) 
of the accompanying regulations. The selection method is 
described in detail in a memorandum entitled, ``Vehicle Selection 
Procedures for the Proposed Fuels and Fuel Additives Rulemaking'' 
(see Item No. II-B-6 in the public docket of this rule). As 
proposed, the final rule does not differentiate between light-
duty vehicles and light-duty trucks. Thus, vehicles/engines are 
separated into two classes: light-duty and heavy-duty. The 
vehicle or engine selected must be a new vehicle or engine of the 
model year in which testing begins. However, vehicle selection 
criteria are to be based on technology characteristics of the 
previous model year. Any one of the top five selling models 
(based on sales figures from the year prior to testing) with the 
appropriate technology in a fuel group may be chosen. Each test 
vehicle or engine must be equipped with all of the normally 
required and functioning emission control equipment, with the 
exception of aftertreatment devices, when applicable (see Section 
VI.A). 
Considering the practical constraints of the rule, EPA is 
requiring that only one vehicle or engine model be used to 
generate emissions for these tiers. Although EPA recognizes that 
emission composition is somewhat dependent on vehicle models and 
may even vary in replicate tests of the same vehicle/fuel 
combination, the use of untreated exhaust in the testing program 
will greatly reduce the significance of these potential sources 
of variability. The purpose of the testing program is to 
determine potential health effects of


F/FA emissions and not to 
establish in-use fleet average emission levels for different 
types of vehicles. However, EPA reserves the right to require 
the testing of F/FAs in additional vehicles or engines, under 
Tier 3, if there is concern for technology-based differences in 
toxicological effects. Furthermore, EPA could require the use of 
catalyzed exhaust to perform tests under Tier 3. 


Although EPA is routinely requiring only one vehicle or 
engine for the testing of F/FAs, EPA foresees that at least one 
backup vehicle/engine of the identical model may be needed to 
replace vehicles/engines that wear out or malfunction during the 
course of testing. The probability of needing a replacement 
vehicle or engine increases in the case of testing F/FAs 
containing atypical elements that require additional mileage 
accumulation (see next section). The decision concerning the 
timing of vehicle and engine replacements is the responsibility 
of the F/FA manufacturer seeking registration. EPA recommends 
that backup vehicles/engines (if present) accumulate mileage 
along with the primary test vehicle, so as to minimize testing 
interruptions if the backup vehicle/engine is needed. 
Manufacturers may, at their own discretion, alternate between 
backup vehicles (or engines) during testing to further decrease 
the probability of problems or interruptions. Similarly 
conditioned vehicles/engines (i.e., primary and backup 
vehicle/engine) would be expected to generate comparable 
emissions. Emissions from backup vehicles/engines must have 
their emissions characterized prior to use in the biological 
studies. Wide discrepancies between the emissions of primary and 
backup vehicle/engine emissions may be cause to void a test. 
During emission generation, vehicles and engines must be 
maintained in good condition by following the OEM recommendations 
for service schedule and parts replacement. If unscheduled 
maintenance becomes necessary, the vehicle or engine must be 
repaired to OEM specifications, using OEM or OEM-approved parts. 
In addition, the manufacturer is required to measure the basic 
emissions (as described in Section VII.B.2.a) after the 
unscheduled maintenance and before resuming testing, to 
demonstrate that the post-maintenance emissions are within 20 
percent of pre-maintenance emission levels. If the basic 
emissions cannot be brought within 20 percent of their previous 
levels, then the manufacturer must restart testing using a new 
vehicle or engine. Provisions in the regulations allow for a 
limited amount of emission generation disruption without voiding 
the biological test. 


E. Mileage Accumulation 


New vehicles (or engines) to be used in emission generation 
for the testing of F/FAs are required to undergo a break-in 
period in which the vehicle (or engine) is run exclusively on the 
fuel or additive/base fuel mixture to be tested. The mileage 
accumulation requirements of this final rule follow the 
approaches discussed in the Reopening Notice. These requirements 
serve the purpose of stabilizing the emissions from the new 
vehicle or engine.

<TEXT>
 

Vehicles to be used in the evaluation of baseline and non-baseline F/FAs are required to accumulate at least 4,000
miles 
prior to emission testing. For engines operated on an engine 
dynamometer, the minimum break-in requirement is 125 hours of 
operation for testing baseline and non-baseline F/FAs. The 4,000 
mile/125 hour mileage accumulation requirements are consistent 
with the emission stabilization procedures used in EPA's new 
vehicle certification program.
 An intact aftertreatment 
device must be used when accumulating mileage in the evaluation 
of baseline and non-baseline F/FAs. Mileage can be accumulated 
in a number of ways, i.e., on a test track, on a dynamometer, on 
the street, or as part of a manufacturer's fleet. No specific 
driving cycle is required, but it must include a reasonable 
amount of transient operation. 




For atypical F/FAs, the minimum mileage accumulation 
required prior to testing is also 4,000 miles for test vehicles 
or 125 hours for test engines. After completion of the 4,000 
mile/125 hour minimum mileage accumulation, an attempt should be 
made to identify and measure the atypical element(s) in the 
emissions. Mileage accumulation must continue until either: (1) 
50 percent or more of the input mass of each atypical element is 
measured in the emissions (i.e., vapor, semi-volatile, and 
particulate combined), or (2) a maximum mileage accumulation 
equivalent to 40 percent of the average useful life of the 
applicable vehicle/engine (e.g., 40,000 miles for light-duty 
vehicles, 116,000 miles for heavy-duty vehicles, or engine 
equivalent) has been reached. When either of these conditions 
has been met, emission generation can begin for purposes of 
emission characterization or biological testing. Because the 
presence of atypical species in specific emission fractions will 
be dependent on the nature of the particular atypical element, 
EPA recommends examination of all emission fractions (i.e., 
vapor, semi-volatile, and particulate). The determination of the 
appropriate intervals for conducting emissions measurements is 
left to the manufacturer's discretion. 
Manufacturers of atypical F/FAs may choose to accumulate the 
required mileage using a vehicle/engine equipped with either an 
intact aftertreatment device or with a non-functional 
aftertreatment device (e.g., a blank catalyst without its 
catalytic wash coat).
 However, the sampling and analysis of 
emissions for detecting the atypical element(s) of interest, 
prior to emission characterization or biological testing, must be 
done with a non-functional aftertreatment device. A brief period 
of warm-up driving (i.e., 10 miles or equivalent time) needs to 
precede the sampling for the detection of atypical element(s). 




During the mileage accumulation period for the testing of 
any fuel or fuel additive, vehicles and engines used for emission 
generation must be maintained in good condition by following the 
recommended maintenance practices in the appropriate vehicle or 
engine owner's manual. Maintenance requirements were described 
in the previous section. 


F. Special Requirements for Additives 


This section describes provisions for the testing of 
specific types of additives that might require modification in 
emission generation requirements. These include additives used 
in conjunction with aftertreatment devices, additives used 
infrequently, and diesel additives produced exclusively for use 
in diesel 

#

1 fuels. 
As explained in the above sections, EPA is requiring that 
emissions used for Tier 1 and Tier 2 testing be generated from 
vehicles/engines with non-functional aftertreatment devices. In 
response to comments received on the Reopening Notice, however, 
EPA is including in this final rule a special allowance for 
specific types of additives that are designed to work in 
conjunction with aftertreatment devices. In the case of fuel 
additives specifically intended to enhance the effectiveness of 
exhaust aftertreatment devices, the related aftertreatment device 
may be used on the emission generation vehicle/engine during all 
mileage accumulation and testing. 
Regarding infrequently used additives, EPA recognizes that 
some aftermarket additives are intended by the manufacturer (as 
stated in the additive's instructions for use) to be added to the 
fuel tank only at infrequent intervals. During mileage 
accumulation, these types of additives may be applied according 
to the manufacturer's specifications. However, during emission 
generation and testing, EPA requires that each tankful of fuel 
used contain the fuel additive at its maximum recommended level. 
In the case of bulk additives used intermittently for the direct 
purpose of conditioning or treating a fuel during storage or 
transport, or for treating or maintaining the storage, pipeline, 
and/or other component of the fuel distribution system (and not 
the vehicle/engine for which the fuel is ultimately intended), 
EPA also requires that the additive be added to the base fuel at 
the maximum concentration recommended by the additive 
manufacturer for treatment of the fuel or distribution system 
component. If the manufacturer of infrequently used aftermarket 
or bulk additives (as described above) is concerned that the test 
vehicle/engine may be adversely affected and/or the emissions may 
be subject to artifacts due to overuse of these types of 
additives, then that manufacturer may submit a request for a 
modification in test procedure requirements. Any such request 
must include test data (e.g., emission characterization data) to 
support the claim that procedural modification is needed, as well 
as a suggested substitute procedure.

In order to simplify diesel additive testing and allow comparability between the test results of all diesel additives
evaluated in this program, EPA requires that all diesel additives (including those produced exclusively for use
in 

#

1 diesel fuels) be tested on the 

#

2 diesel base fuel (specified in Section V). If a manufacturer is concerned that the emissions generated using a blend
of their 

#

1 diesel fuel additive with the 

#

2 diesel base fuel may be subject to artifacts due to this blending, then that manufacturer may submit a request for
a modification in test procedures. Any such request must include supporting data (e.g., emission characterization
data) and suggested test modifications. 


VII. Tier 1 Requirements 


The scope of Tier 1 encompasses: (1) a literature search for available information on the composition and effects
of F/FA emissions on public health and welfare, (2) a chemical analysis to characterize the emissions of fuels or additive/base
fuel mixtures, and (3) a qualitative discussion of potential exposures using information on total production volume
and market distribution patterns of the particular fuel(s) or additive/base fuel mixture(s). 


A. Literature Search 


1. Scope 


The registration program requires


F/FA manufacturers to conduct a comprehensive data search that will include all relevant existing information concerning
previous emission characterization and health effects and welfare studies. The data search must address the chemical
composition and potential adverse effects of whole combustion emissions, relevant combustion emission fractions
(e.g., particulate phase), and whole evaporative emissions, as applicable. The literature search must also address
each of the individual combustion and evaporative (where different) emission products identified by the required
emission speciation procedures, with the exception of carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxides, benzene,
1,3-butadiene, acetaldehyde, and formaldehyde. Special literature search requirements for non-baseline and
atypical F/FAs are described in Section VII.A.3. 


Information considered applicable to a given fuel or additive includes data obtained from the testing of emissions
from the fuel or additive in question or from other similar products. For this purpose, ``similar'' products are those
which meet the criteria for enrollment in the same F/FA group as the subject fuel or additive, pursuant to the grouping
system criteria discussed in Section IV. F/FA manufacturers who choose to participate in the grouping system may
pool information about all member products for purposes of their joint submission and may also make use of available
data on other products which are not enrolled in the group but share the designated formulation characteristics of
group members. Similarly, a manufacturer who chooses not to participate in the grouping system could include any
test results which may be available for products which could theoretically be assigned to the same group as the manufacturer's
own product. 
The survey on health effects studies is not restricted to the particular endpoints and experimental protocols included
in Tier 2. Studies using other scientifically acceptable methods or protocols addressing all health effects of F/FA
emissions must also be included in the Tier 1 report. Most often, data will be available from experiments conducted
with laboratory animals, but other applicable studies must also be considered. Evidence for potential toxicity
or lack of toxicity in exposed humans may be available from epidemiological studies, clinical studies, occupational
exposures, or case reports. In general, referenced experiments must be concerned with the health effects of inhalation
exposure to F/FA emissions (combustion and evaporative). However, data collected from relevant studies using other
routes of exposure must also be included. Available results from 

in vitro 

tests, comparative metabolism studies, and structure-activity analyses are also considered relevant and must
be included in the summary report for health effects of F/FA emissions.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940627-0-00146 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940627-0-00019 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The data search must include available literature on welfare effects, including, but not limited to, the exposure
and response of plants and animals to whole emissions and individual components of emissions, the potential for bioaccumulation,
and the concentration and persistence of emission products in the air, soil, and water. Available results of exposure
modeling analyses, environmental and atmospheric fate modeling studies, field studies, monitoring studies, accident
evaluations, or environmental simulation experiments must be included to characterize potential exposures and
the environmental impact of F/FA emissions. Specific ecological studies addressing the potential environmental
effects of F/FA emissions on vegetation, livestock, wildlife, aquatic species, and soil organisms must be included.
In addition, the data search must address the welfare effects of F/FA emissions concerning their contribution to
odor and visibility nuisances. 



Both public and in-house available sources must be included in the literature survey. Information on the health and
environmental effects of


F/FAs is to be compiled from peer- reviewed scientific journals and other literature as well as internal industry
studies, government-sponsored reports, proceedings of scientific meetings, and other documented sources. In
general, EPA will place greater confidence in studies that have been subject to peer review. A search of appropriate
commercially available chemical, toxicological, and environmental data bases must be conducted to obtain information
from published sources. An example list of commercially available data bases that may be used to obtain information
on potential health and environmental effects, as well as environmental fate data, is available in the public docket
of this rule.
 







In the NPRM, EPA proposed that literature searches cover at least fifteen years. However, in response to public comments,
EPA has increased this time period to cover at least thirty years prior to the date of submission, so that important
information from earlier testing will not be omitted. In addition, literature searches must be current as of six months
prior to the beginning of testing. The thirty years are not meant to be an absolute limit for data collection. EPA encourages
F/FA manufacturers to do a comprehensive search that will include all relevant available information, regardless
of the age of the data. 



The information to be submitted to EPA as a result of the data search includes the following items: (1) Brief text summary
of the general findings and conclusions, including references, (2) a printed copy of the outputs from the data base
searches, including reference list and associated abstracts, (3) complete documentation in scientific journal
format of unpublished in-house or other privately-conducted studies, and (4) tables summarizing the protocols
and results of all cited studies, organized by health or environmental endpoint and type of emissions (e.g., whole
combustion emission, individual emission product). In addition, the person(s) or contractor(s) conducting the
literature search and summary must be identified. Further discussion on the reporting requirements of this final
rule is included in Section XII. 





2. Adequate Existing Information 





The primary purpose of the literature search is to provide EPA with a comprehensive survey of the available data on
health and welfare effects of 


F/FAs. A secondary function of the literature search is to enable F/FA manufacturers to document the extent to which
the emission characterization in Tier 1 and/or the evaluation of health effects included in Tier 2 have already been
addressed by previous adequate testing and/or analysis. If adequate testing/analysis exists, F/FA manufacturers
may submit such previous data in compliance with the requirements of the registration program. For example, if previous
emission characterization studies addressing the speciation requirements of this program are available in the
literature, then F/FA manufacturers may submit those studies in lieu of new characterization tests. Similarly,
F/FA manufacturers could use the literature search to determine the availability of adequate biological tests in
compliance with Tier 2 requirements. 





To satisfy the testing requirements of Tier 1 and/or 2 with previously conducted studies, reports of such previous
tests must be sufficiently detailed to allow EPA to judge the adequacy of protocols, techniques, experimental design,
statistical analyses, and data interpretation. Documentation must be sufficient to determine if the previously
conducted studies were performed in a manner consistent with generally accepted scientific principles, good laboratory
practices, and the specific testing guidelines in question. The age of the data will be considered but will not be the
ultimate determining factor in deciding if an existing study is adequate. Although changes in technological approaches
and methodology might preclude the use of some older studies, EPA recognizes that older literature can be useful for
the purposes of this program. Thus, the quality of the study will be the deciding factor in determining the adequacy
of existing studies, not the age per se. Additional criteria to be used in determining the adequacy of existing data/studies
in relation to Tier 2 compliance are provided in Section VIII.C.

3. Special Requirements for Non-Baseline and Atypical F/FAs 



EPA recognizes that many of the individual chemical species 
that will be present in the emissions of non-baseline and 
atypical F/FAs will also be present in the emissions of baseline 
products in the same fuel family. Non-baseline formulations, as 
defined in this rule, contain the same elements as baseline 
formulations. Thus, on a qualitative basis, the emission 
products from non-baseline F/FAs are expected to overlap with 
those of baseline F/FAs in the same fuel family. For atypical 
F/FAs, the main differentiating characteristic is the presence of 
atypical element(s) which are not included in the baseline 
category for a particular fuel family. The composition of the 
emissions for atypical products, therefore, is expected to 
consist mainly of those species present in the emissions of 
baseline


F/FAs (for the same fuel family), with the addition of 
compounds which host the specific atypical element(s) of 
interest. 



In addition to requiring literature data on the potential 
health and welfare effects of the whole combustion and 
evaporative (where different) emissions of the particular F/FA 
product, Tier 1 also specifies that a literature search be 
conducted on each of the emission products of the tested fuel or 
additive/base fuel mixture. Because of the substantial overlap 
in the emission species of F/FAs in different categories within 
the same fuel family, however, this requirement could result in 
significant duplication of effort and waste of resources. To 
avoid this outcome, as authorized under CAA section 211(e)(3)(C), 
this final rule allows manufacturers of non-baseline and atypical 
F/FAs to limit the literature search done for individual emission 
species to only those compounds which are different from the 
compounds typically present in the emissions of baseline F/FAs 
for the same fuel family. 

In order to take advantage of this reduction in 
requirements, manufacturers of non-baseline or atypical F/FAs 
must compare the emission characterization results of their 
products with emission characterization data for baseline F/FAs. 
Such data may be available from private sources, in-house 
testing, or from publicly available literature or data bases. 
For example, emission characterization data for baseline gasoline 
are expected to be available in published literature from studies 
sponsored by the Auto/Oil Program.
 The data base ``SPECIATE'' 
might also be useful in identifying baseline emissions species 
for gasoline.
 Other applicable literature on gasoline and 
diesel emissions can be obtained in the NRC Report on 
``Feasibility of Assessment of Health Risks from Vapor-Phase 
Organic Chemicals in Gasoline and Diesel Exhaust.''
 Emission 
characterization data for alternative fuels is available in a 
variety of CARB reports.

B. Characterization of Emissions 



1. Scope 



The chemical analysis requirements of Tier 1 satisfy the 
provision in CAA section 211(b)(2)(B) requiring information ``to 
determine the emissions resulting from the use of the fuel or 
additive contained in such fuel.'' The characterization of 
emissions in Tier 1 will provide a useful inventory of 
potentially harmful F/FA emission products for further study and 
evaluation in support of the F/FA testing program, risk 
assessments, and future regulatory actions. 

F/FA manufacturers are responsible for the generation, 
collection, and sampling of the combustion and, if applicable, 
the evaporative emissions of their F/FAs, and for the conduct of 
tests to determine the identity and concentration of individual 
emission products. In general, the required procedures are 
directed toward the detection and measurement of selected 
chemical classes and compounds. The analyses include: (1) the 
measurement of basic emissions (i.e., total hydrocarbons, carbon 
monoxide, oxides of nitrogen, and particulates), (2) the 
speciation of volatile hydrocarbon compounds, aldehydes, ketones, 
alcohols, ethers, and polycyclic aromatic compounds, and (3) the 
speciation of atypical emission products (when atypical elements 
are known to be present in the raw fuel or additive formulation). 
Speciation requirements are summarized in Table 1.

2. Speciation Procedures 


Section VI describes the required procedures for the 
generation of both combustion and evaporative emissions. 
Characterization of combustion emissions must be done both for 
non-catalyzed emissions and for tailpipe emissions. As discussed 
in Section III.A.2, the evaporative emissions of some F/FAs are 
also required to undergo emission characterization analysis. To 
provide an indication of the variability, the emissions must be 
generated and characterized three times on three different days. 
Collection and speciation of background samples is required.
The CAA authorizes EPA to require information to 
characterize F/FA emissions, while giving EPA discretion to 
specify the particular protocols to be used for this purpose. 
The following sections identify the general emission product 
categories of interest and discuss currently available protocols 
which are suitable for their analyses. EPA recognizes that 
scientific methods can be expected to advance in the future. 
Thus, the use of the protocols referenced in this final rule is 
not mandated. Rather, EPA will hold F/FA manufacturers 
accountable for state-of-the-art methods and good analytical 
chemistry and laboratory practices, such as those described in 
the article ``Principles of Environmental Analysis.''





Today's rule does not discourage the use of any validated 
method to perform the characterization of emissions, or the 
submittal of existing speciation results obtained from validated 
methods, as long as the data address the speciation requirements 
of the F/FA registration program. EPA acknowledges the state-of-the-art methods of the Auto/Oil Air Quality Improvement
Research 
Program (Auto/Oil Program) for the characterization of emissions. 
In fact, the speciation requirements included in this rule for 
fuels composed primarily of hydrocarbon compounds of twelve 
carbons (C12) or less (e.g., gasoline) are based on such 
methodology.

48, 49, 50

 Where applicable, EPA will accept results 
from the Auto/Oil Program as adequate data in lieu of new 
testing. However, the Auto/Oil Program might not address all the 
emission characterization requirements of today's rule, so 
additional procedures (e.g., for the analysis of polycyclic 
aromatic compounds) might be needed. EPA recognizes that 
characterization data have already been submitted to EPA in 
relation to the Auto/Oil Program. F/FA manufacturers need not 
resubmit this information, but are required to reference these 
data (e.g., report number, applicable page numbers, etc.) on the 
Tier 1 report so EPA can verify the adequacy of the information 
being used in compliance with the F/FA registration program for 
the particular


F/FA product or group representative. Although 
resubmission of the raw emission data is not required, 
manufacturers are still responsible for providing a summary 
discussion of the emission characterization results in the Tier 1 
report as outlined in Section XII.B. 




For the characterization of diesel


F/FAs, EPA recognizes the 
procedures under the Air Pollution Research Advisory Council 
(APRAC) program. The work done by APRAC provides speciation 
guidelines for unregulated diesel emissions and addresses diesel 
combustion compounds of concern to EPA. As with the Auto/Oil 
Program studies, existing applicable APRAC speciation studies 
will be considered adequate data in lieu of new testing. 
However, today's rule requires manufacturers of diesel F/FAs to 
perform speciation procedures for hydrocarbons which might not be 
included in the APRAC program. These are discussed in the 
following sections. 


a. 

Characterization of Basic Emissions.

 EPA proposed to require the characterization of ``regulated 
emissions'' for fuel/vehicle types for which certification 
procedures existed at the time of the publication of the NPRM 
(i.e., gasoline, diesel, and methanol). Today, EPA is terming 
this requirement ``basic emissions,'' instead of ``regulated 
emissions,'' because certification requirements are not 
established yet for all the F/FAs included in this rule. To be 
consistent and avoid confusion, the term ``basic emissions'' is 
used for all F/FA families included in this rule. Based on the 
current regulated emissions and taking into consideration the 
objectives of this program, EPA selected four basic emissions for 
measurement, as follows: Total hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, 
oxides of nitrogen, and particulates. 
The four basic emissions are to be measured in combustion 
emissions as a routine requirement for all F/FA families, as 
shown in Table 1. Only total hydrocarbons are required to be 
measured in evaporative emissions. Manufacturers are referred to 
the vehicle certification procedures in 40 CFR part 86 for 
general guidance on the measurement of the basic emissions of 
interest to this rule.

b. 

Characterization of Hydrocarbons.

 As shown in Table 1, this rule requires the speciation of hydrocarbons for the vapor phase of combustion emissions
and for evaporative emissions generated using an evaporative emission generator. The speciation is to be performed
using methods that identify and determine the concentration of all hydrocarbon compounds containing twelve or fewer
carbon atoms. The Auto/Oil Program procedures referenced above provide an acceptable speciation method for hydrocarbons.

c. 

Characterization of Aldehydes and Ketones.

 Speciation of aldehydes and ketones containing a maximum of eight carbon atoms is required only for the vapor phase
of combustion emissions. A test procedure for formaldehyde measurement is included in 40 CFR part 86 for formaldehyde.
F/FA manufacturers are also referred to the Auto/Oil Program procedures referenced above for the analysis of aldehydes
and ketones. Additional applicable procedures are available in ASTM D 5197-91, ``Standard Test Method for
Determination of Formaldehyde and Other Carbonyl Compounds in Air (Active Sampler Methodology).'' 
d. 

Characterization of Alcohols and Ethers.

 Alcohol and ether compounds containing six or fewer carbon atoms are to be characterized for both evaporative and
combustion emissions, whenever the fuel or additive/base fuel mixture under evaluation contains alcohols or ethers.
If a F/FA formulation contains an alcohol or ether with more than six carbon atoms, then this manufacturer is required
to measure their presence in the emissions, as well as alcohols or ethers with fewer number of carbon atoms. For example,
if an ether containing seven carbon atoms (e.g., isopropyl tertiary butyl ether) is part of a fuel formulation being
tested in this program, then its manufacturer must characterize ethers with seven or fewer carbon atoms. 
In addition to the Auto/Oil Program procedures referenced above, a test procedure for the characterization of alcohols
and ethers is described in 40 CFR part 80, Appendix F, entitled ``Test Method for Determination of C1-C4 Alcohols
and MTBE in Gasoline by Gas Chromatography''. This procedure can be used for the identification of ethers in addition
to MTBE, but will require appropriate modifications for application to gas phase samples. 
e. 

Characterization of Polycyclic Aromatic Compounds.

 In the NPRM, EPA proposed a broad requirement for the identification and measurement of polycyclic aromatic compounds.
In the final rule, this requirement is narrowed to a limited number of specified compounds which are of significant
concern in terms of their potential non-carcinogenic and/or carcinogenic effects. Included are specified polycyclic
aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) and nitrated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (NPAH) compounds as well as individual
compounds and classes of polychlorinated dibenzodioxins/dibenzofurans (PCDD/PCDFs).

<TEXT>
 

In addition to specifying particular polycyclic aromatic 
compounds for analysis, the final rule reduces the families 
and/or categories of F/FAs which are subject to these 
requirements. PAH and NPAH speciation need not be done for F/FAs 
in the methane and propane fuel families, nor for F/FAs in the 
atypical categories of other fuel families. Furthermore, 
speciation of dioxins/furans is required only for


F/FAs which 
contain chlorine as an atypical element. This is consistent with 
the requirement applicable to atypical F/FAs in general, that all 
emission species containing the relevant atypical elements be 
identified and measured (see section f, below). 



While EPA believes that characterization of dioxins/furans 
is also important in the case of baseline and non-baseline


F/FAs, the NPRM did not propose to require this procedure on a wider 
basis. EPA has thus refrained from including mandatory 
requirements for speciation of dioxins/furans in the case of 
baseline and non-baseline
F/FAs. Instead, for manufacturers of 
F/FAs other than chlorine-containing atypical F/FAs, dioxin/furan 
characterization is included in the final rule only on a 
voluntary basis. EPA strongly encourages manufacturers of 
baseline and non-baseline F/FAs to collect the necessary emission 
samples and conduct these voluntary procedures at the same time 
that mandatory emission characterization requirements are being 
fulfilled. The recent attention and concern about the potential 
health effects of dioxins/furans, combined with the current 
dearth of information on the specific sources and generation of 
these compounds, increases the likelihood that these procedures 
will be prescribed under EPA's discretionary Tier 3 authority if 
the necessary data are not otherwise submitted on a voluntary 
basis. If so, the incremental costs are likely to be 
considerably higher than if the procedures were conducted in 
conjunction with the standard Tier 1 emission characterization 
tasks. 



As was proposed, the final rule requires the measurement and 
speciation of polycyclic aromatic compounds in both the semi-volatile phase and particulate phase of combustion
emissions. 
While, in the past, these compounds have been analyzed primarily 
in the particulate phase, the quantity of these compounds in the 
semi-volatile phase at the temperatures encountered in dilute 
exhaust may also be important. 

Particulate and semi-volatile phase emissions are to be 
collected using methods described in Section VI.B.1. The soluble 
organic fraction (SOF) is to be extracted from the filter and 
polymer bed separately. The extracts of the two phases are to be 
tested separately for PAHs and NPAHs, but may be combined before 
testing for dioxins/furans. Examples of protocols suitable for 
characterizing polycyclic aromatic compounds are available in the 
literature.

f. 

Characterization of Emissions with Atypical Elements. 


F/FAs containing chemical elements other than those included 
in the baseline formulations for the respective fuel family are 
classified as atypical formulations (see Section IV.B.2). In 
addition to the emission characterization requirements described 
above, producers of atypical F/FAs are required to identify and 
measure the emission products containing the associated atypical 
element(s). For example, if a gasoline additive product contains 
chlorine, then this manufacturer must identify and measure all 
emission compounds that contain chlorine. Due to the nature of 
atypical products, special procedures for the generation of 
emissions are required (see Section VI.E). 

The presence of atypical species in specific emission 
fractions will be dependent on the nature of the particular 
atypical element/compound of concern. In view of this, EPA 
recommends that manufacturers of atypical products examine all 
emission fractions (i.e., vapor, semi-volatile, and particulate) 
for the measurement and identification of potential atypical 
species. Because of the variety of potential elements and 
reaction products involved, all of the necessary 
chemical/analytical procedures cannot be specified in this final 
rule. The selection of the particular method(s) for measuring 
atypical elements or compounds is left to the manufacturer. 
However, the procedures used must be state-of-the-art and based 
on sound analytical chemistry principles applicable to the 
atypical element or compound of concern. 



3. Quality Assurance 



While today's rule requires emissions to be generated and 
characterized three times as a way to evaluate the repeatability 
of the test results, additional quality assurance procedures are 
needed to control variability during the characterization of 
emissions. Laboratories conducting emission 
characterization/speciation analyses are required to perform 
verification testing to examine the repeatability and accuracy of 
test procedures. For this purpose, a prepared mixture of 
chemical compounds, as appropriate for each particular procedure, 
should be subjected to the speciation protocols. The use of 
analytical standards and controls for calibration of instruments 
is also required to assure precision and accuracy of results. 

EPA reserves the right in this final rule to audit testing 
facilities involved in the generation and characterization of 
emissions, as well as the health effects testing of F/FAs. Such 
audits will be organized and administered by EPA at its own 
expense. The audit procedures could include a requirement that 
facilities submit a completed questionnaire in which equipment 
and procedural information is described. EPA might make 
recommendations based on the submitted information and/or might 
follow up with a visit to observe the performance of the 
protocols. The audit could also include EPA distribution of 
``blind'' samples for analysis at participating laboratories (at 
their expense). The audit will not have the purpose of 
certifying that the laboratory is ``EPA approved''. Rather, it 
will have the purpose of determining the weaknesses of 
laboratories and the acceptability of the laboratory's current 
performance. 



C. Exposure Analysis

<TEXT>
 

In the NPRM, EPA proposed to require modeling or other 
analytic methods to evaluate potential exposures, expected 
atmospheric reactivity, and environmental partitioning of 
emission products. However, as discussed in Section III.C., this 
final rule does not require modeling analyses to be performed as 
routine requirements under Tier 1. Instead, quantitative 
modeling efforts will be required on a case-by-case basis as 
needed under Tier 3. 

Nevertheless, EPA believes that exposure data are still 
critical for the assessment of the potential risks associated 
with the emissions of F/FAs in question. For this purpose, 
today's rule requires manufacturers to provide a qualitative 
discussion of potential population exposures based on the 
production and use of the particular fuel or additive (or group 
of F/FAs) in question. This qualitative analysis must consider 
the actual and/or projected total annual production volumes and 
the market distribution patterns (e.g., percent of sales by state 
or region) of the particular product or group of products. Group 
submissions must assess the cumulative exposure resulting from 
all members of the group. A quantitative analysis is encouraged 
when appropriate data are available, including any existing 
modeling data, to support the exposure analysis. As discussed 
earlier, EPA retains the authority to require from manufacturers 
more exhaustive exposure analysis for particular products of 
concern under Tier 3 (including modeling), based on the EPA 
evaluation of Tier 1 and Tier 2 results or other available 
information. 



VIII. Tier 2 Requirements 



In the NPRM, EPA proposed short-term (42-day) tests under 
Tier 2 for the evaluation of six health effects endpoints: 
carcinogenicity, mutagenicity, teratogenicity, reproductive 
toxicity, neurotoxicity, and pulmonary toxicity. EPA examined 
the proposed Tier 2 program and found that similar requirements 
among the various proposed tests (in regard to animal subjects, 
exposure scenarios, and general technical principles) provided 
the opportunity to combine several endpoint tests within the same 
exposure protocol. In view of this, EPA has modified the Tier 2 
testing program to allow for concurrent test performance in a 
more cost-effective manner. 

The revised Tier 2 testing program enhances efficiency and 
feasibility, while providing better health effects information. 
In fact, the design of the Tier 2 testing program makes best use 
of animals (minimum number of animals used), laboratory capacity, 
and financial resources. The basic Tier 2 testing framework of 
this final rule consists of a 90-day subchronic inhalation study 
to examine general systemic and organ toxicity (including 
pulmonary effects), with the addition of ancillary tests that 
allow the assessment of several specific health effect endpoints 
(carcinogenicity, mutagenicity, teratogenicity, reproductive 
toxicity, and neurotoxicity) within the same exposure schedule. 
A fertility assessment is coordinated with the 90-day study to 
examine reproductive and teratogenic effects. 

Brief descriptions of test guidelines for the evaluation of 
each health effect endpoint are provided in the sections below. 
Most of these testing guidelines are modified versions of 
guidelines previously published under TSCA (40 CFR part 798, 
revised as of July 1, 1992) and/or the test guidelines which 
accompanied the NPRM. Detailed protocols for the Tier 2 testing 
program are included in  79.62- 79.68 of the accompanying 
regulations. Figure 4 shows a diagram of the suggested timing 
and organization of the Tier 2 studies within the general 90-day 
subchronic exposure schedule.

 A. General Methodology 


1. Exposure Duration 



As mentioned previously, EPA originally proposed a program 
that included six separate tests for the evaluation of the 
endpoints of concern. Because of cost considerations, a minimum 
six-week (42-day) exposure period was proposed in the NPRM, 
instead of the traditional 90-day test. EPA requested comments 
on the adequacy of the proposed exposure period and exposure 
regimen, and on the possibility of extending these tests to 90 
days for comparability to historical data. Comments were also 
requested on the possible use of an alternative approach for the 
testing program, the Screening Information Data Set (SIDS) 
protocol developed for use by the Organization for Economic 
Cooperation and Development (OECD). The standard SIDS protocol 
is designed as a single-study screen (45-day) for repeat dose, 
reproductive, and developmental effects. 

Public comments from industry supported the 90-day test over 
either the proposed 42-day test or the SIDS protocol. Commenters 
expressed concern regarding both of these protocols because 
relatively less scientific experience and historical comparison 
data are available for these shorter test scenarios. Upon 
reconsideration, EPA agrees that the 90-day protocol is more 
suitable and more cost effective than either of the alternatives 
proposed in the NPRM for purposes of the F/FA registration 
program. EPA recognizes that the shorter tests might miss some 
adverse health effects that might be identified with the 90-day 
exposure. Apart from the study duration, the SIDS protocol 
includes somewhat less information for each endpoint, in 
comparison with the selected 90-day subchronic inhalation study, 
with relatively small savings in time and cost. For example, the 
SIDS protocol includes a fertility screen (i.e., one-generation 
reproductive study), but does not include an examination of the 
fetus for teratogenic effects. 

Thus, today's final rule requires F/FA manufacturers to use 
the more standard 90-day subchronic inhalation protocol for the 
evaluation of health effects, with an exposure regimen of at 
least six hours per day, five days per week. EPA judges the 
exposure regimen of five days per week for the 90-day protocol to 
be the minimum acceptable exposure period for the purposes of the 
Tier 2 evaluation. Also, the 90-day protocol provides a broad 
and efficient testing approach that allows the evaluation of 
several endpoints at the end of the same exposure period using 
the same exposed test animals. As a result, the modified Tier 2 
program provides a reduction in the number of animals needed to 
perform the evaluation of the endpoints of concern and savings on 
emission generation and testing costs. 



2. Animal Model and Laboratory Practices 






</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940627-0-00154 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940627-0-00019 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

In general, the Tier 2 testing program requires the exposure 
of live laboratory animals to whole F/FA emissions. Rodent 
species are required and rats are specifically recommended. 
Animal facilities must be operated in compliance with the ``Guide 
for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals'' (U.S. DHHS 
Publication (NIH) 86-23, 1985). To ensure the quality and 
integrity of test results, the performance of all studies will be 
required to conform with good laboratory practice (GLP) 
standards. GLP standards specific to this rule are included in 
 79.60. As proposed in the NPRM, the GLP standards are based on 
those published in 40 CFR part 792 (revised as of July 1, 1992) 
for conducting tests under TSCA, with modifications to 
accommodate the specific goals of this rule. The GLP standards 
address facility, equipment, organization, quality assurance, and 
personnel requirements, as well as specifications for proper care 
of laboratory animals, handling of test substances, 
instrumentation issues, conduct of studies, record keeping, and 
reporting of results. 



3. Exposure Route and Concentrations 



With the exception of the Salmonella assay, the Tier 2 
testing program is based on the inhalation exposure of laboratory 
animals to diluted whole emissions. Such studies require an 
exposure system designed to ensure the controlled generation, 
dilution, and delivery of F/FA emissions to the laboratory 
animals for prolonged periods. Section VI describes the 
methodology for the generation of F/FA combustion and evaporative 
emissions and the procedures to deliver the emissions to the test 
animals. Requirements for hardware, maintenance, and the use of 
emission generation and inhalation systems are included in  79.57 
and  79.61 of this rule. 

Before testing the emissions of a particular fuel or 
additive/base fuel mixture, a manufacturer must determine an 
appropriate range of exposure concentrations to be used in the 
characterization of potential health effects. The objective is 
to select exposure concentrations to determine a reasonable 
concentration-response curve that may predict the potential 
health risks associated with a particular exposure. 
Concentrations should be spaced to produce test groups with a 
range of toxic effects. In order to accomplish this, EPA 
requires that at least three concentration levels be used to 
construct the concentration-response curve. These levels should 
correspond to, at a minimum: (1) an overtly or highly toxic 
concentration, (2) a concentration having an intermediate level of 
toxicity, and (3) a minimally toxic or non-toxic level. The 
highest concentration should result in toxic effects but not 
produce a level of fatalities which would prevent a meaningful 
interpretation of the resulting data. The lowest concentration 
should produce minimal or no observable toxic effects. If more 
than one intermediate concentration level is used, the 
concentrations should be spaced to produce a gradation of toxic 
effects. Due to the inherent toxicity of most vehicle emissions, 
it might be impossible to precisely select an exposure level 
which results in no observable evidence of toxicity, or a no- 
observed-adverse-effect-level (NOAEL). Thus, EPA is not 
requiring manufacturers to specifically achieve a NOAEL. 
Instead, EPA recommends that manufacturers use available 
scientific approaches (e.g., range-finding test and extrapolation 
of data results) to design the study with reasonable 
concentration spacing so as to improve the probability of 
achieving a NOAEL. In recognition of the possibility that the 
highest achievable exposure concentration (considering the 
limiting CO concentration) may also be non-toxic, provisions are 
made for ``limit tests,'' where appropriate. If a test at the 
highest achievable concentration produces no observable toxic 
effect(s), then a full study using three concentration levels 
might not be necessary (see regulatory text for specific endpoint 
tests). 
 



B. Subchronic Inhalation Study and Endpoint Tests 



As described earlier, the Tier 2 health effects testing 
program includes a 90-day subchronic inhalation study and 
ancillary assays/tests for the examination of specific health 
effects endpoints. Specific assays or analyses for 
carcinogenicity, mutagenicity, teratogenicity, reproductive 
toxicity, and neurotoxicity may be conducted at the end of the 
90-day study, coordinated with the 90-day exposure, or conducted 
separately. 

In the NPRM, EPA proposed a separate acute pulmonary test 
(i.e., lung lavage assay) for the evaluation of pulmonary 
toxicity. However, the Tier 2 testing framework of this final 
rule does not require a separate test for the assessment of 
pulmonary effects because the 90-day subchronic study includes 
gross pathology and histopathology of the lungs and respiratory 
tract. Pulmonary effects in this final rule will be examined as 
part of the standard 90-day inhalation study. Positive results 
at the end of the exposure period for pulmonary toxicity will be 
indicated by abnormal gross or histopathological findings 
relative to appropriate control animals. 



1. Subchronic Inhalation Study 



The subchronic inhalation study is designed to determine a 
concentration-response relationship for potential toxic effects 
in rodents, resulting from exposure to vehicle/engine emissions 
over a period of 90 days. This test will provide valuable 
information on general systemic and target organ toxicity, 
including pulmonary effects. This information is considered an 
essential component for the assessment of potential health 
hazards resulting from the exposure to F/FA emissions. The 
exposure period of the subchronic study (i.e., 90 days) covers 
approximately one tenth of the life span for the recommended test 
animal species (i.e., rats). Although life-shortening or tumors 
are not likely to be observed within the 90 days of exposure, the 
subchronic study should be able to identify a wide variety of 
adverse effects. 

The specific guidelines for the subchronic inhalation study 
are included in  79.62 of this final rule. The subchronic study 
requires that animals be observed and weighed during the exposure 
period. Ophthalmological examination, blood chemistry analysis, 
organ examination, and histopathology are basic requirements of 
the 90-day protocol. Hematology and clinical biochemistry 
determinations are required to be carried out after 30 days of 
exposure and just prior to termination. Hematology analyses 
include: hematocrit, hemoglobin concentration, erythrocyte 
count, total and differential leukocyte count, and a measure of 
clotting potential (e.g., clotting time, prothrombin time, 
thromboplastin time, or platelet count). Clinical biochemical 
testing includes assessment of electrolyte balance, carbohydrate 
metabolism, and liver and kidney function. Other specific 
biochemical tests are described in the regulatory text of the 
final rule.

<TEXT>
 

At the end of the exposure period, tissues and/or organs from a subgroup of the test animals are specially preserved
according to the requirements of the neurological, pulmonary, and reproductive organ examinations. Tissues/organs
from the main test population are preserved using standard techniques for the general toxicity evaluation. Test
animals will be subjected to a full gross necropsy which includes examination of the external surface of the body,
all orifices, and the cranial, thoracic, and abdominal cavities and their contents. All major organs must be weighed.
Gross pathology must be performed on the following target organs and tissues: liver, kidneys, lungs, adrenals, brain,
and gonads. Histopathology must be performed on all gross lesions and specific organs/tissues, as follows: respiratory
tract (i.e., lungs, nasopharyngeal tissues, trachea), brain, heart, sternum with bone marrow, salivary glands,
liver, spleen, kidneys, adrenals, pancreas, reproductive organs (i.e., uterus, cervix, ovaries, testes, epididymides),
aorta, gall bladder, esophagus, stomach, intestinal tract, urinary bladder, representative lymph node, and peripheral
nerve/tissue. Other organs and tissues must be preserved in a suitable medium for possible future histopathological
examination, as described in the regulatory text of the final rule. 

As described earlier, the 90-day subchronic inhalation study will serve as a basic framework for the Tier 2 testing
program. The following sections provide brief descriptions of the ancillary assays and other additional test and/or
measures performed under Tier 2. 



2. Carcinogenicity and Mutagenicity Assays 



For the evaluation of carcinogenicity and mutagenicity, Tier 2 includes a battery of three genotoxic assays: Salmonella,
micronucleus (MN) and sister chromatid exchange (SCE). These assays are specific for mutagenic/carcinogenic outcomes
at a cellular level, but the tests may not be indicative of non-mutagenic or initiation/promotion cancer mechanisms.


In general, the Tier 2 genotoxic assays are considered cost-effective indicators of mutagenicity and, by implication,
predictors of suspect carcinogens. The rationale for using these tests for the assessment of potential mutagenic
and carcinogenic effects is based on the general assumption that cancer is a multi-stage process involving a variety
of events that can include genotoxic steps. The general consensus among scientists is that many of the cancers may
be attributable to adverse genetic changes. Because genotoxic steps are generally implicated early in the process
of cancer development, their detection has assumed the status of presumptive carcinogen identification. EPA recognizes
that this working assumption has some limitations because there is always a possibility of having false positive
(mutagenic noncarcinogens) or false negatives (nonmutagenic carcinogens) when evaluating the carcinogenic potential
of the test substance. However, these limitations do not preclude the usefulness and the effectiveness of the genotoxic
assays (i.e., Salmonella, MN, and SCE) as cost-effective predictors of potential mutagenic and carcinogenic effects
in the context of the Tier 2 testing program. 

A description of the Tier 2 assays required for the evaluation of carcinogenicity and mutagenicity is provided in
the following sections. The two in vivo assays (MN and SCE) can be conducted concurrently with the 90-day subchronic
inhalation study (i.e., same animal population). The Salmonella assay is run separately, because it does not require
the exposure of live animals to emissions. 

a. 

Salmonella Assay

. The Salmonella assay is an in vitro test for mutagenicity and, by implication, for carcinogenicity. The assay makes
use of five mutant strains of the bacterium Salmonella typhimurium which cannot grow in a medium deficient in histidine
due to an inherited inability to produce this amino acid. Exposure to mutagenic or carcinogenic substances can elicit
reverse mutations, such that the bacteria regain their ability to grow in a histidine-deficient medium. In this test,
bacteria will be exposed to the semi-volatile and particulate extracts of combustion emissions (see Section VI.B.2
for information on sampling of combustion emissions for testing). Test procedures for this assay have been described
in previous literature.
 After exposure, the cells will be plated on histidine-deficient media (both with and without metabolic activation)
and incubated for a designated period of time. The number of emissions-induced mutant colonies (revertants) growing
on the plates will then be compared to the number of spontaneous revertants in control cultures. The testing guidelines
for the Salmonella assay are included in  79.68 of this final rule. 





A positive result for the Salmonella assay occurs when there is a statistically significant concentration-related
increase in the number of revertants or a reproducible and statistically significant positive response for at least
one of the test concentrations.

b. 

In Vivo Micronucleus (MN) Assay

. Micronuclei are sub-cellular structures containing chromosomes and chromosome fragments not incorporated into
the main nucleus during cell division. While micronuclei do form under natural conditions, exposure to potentially
mutagenic or carcinogenic agents can cause an increase in micronucleated cells. In this assay, live rodents will
be exposed by inhalation to the emissions of the particular fuel or additive/base fuel mixture (this assay is applicable
to the evaluation of both combustion and evaporative emissions). Subsequently, erythrocytes in the bone marrow
will be sampled, stained, and viewed under a light microscope. The number of erythrocytes containing micronuclei
will then be counted and compared with erythrocytes from untreated animals. The use of erythrocytes in this procedure
facilitates the visualization of micronuclei, since their primary nucleus is normally extruded during cell development.
The testing guidelines for the MN assay are contained in  79.62 and  79.64 of this final rule. 

A positive result for the MN assay is determined by a statistically significant concentration-related increase
in the number of micronucleated erythrocytes or a reproducible and statistically significant positive response
for at least one of the test concentrations. 

c. 

In Vivo Sister Chromatid Exchange (SCE)

. SCEs are believed to be caused by chromosome strand breakage resulting in exchanges of genetic material between
the halves of a chromosome ``pair'' (i.e., the chromatids). While some SCEs occur normally, an increase in the frequency
of such exchanges may be indicative of carcinogenic activity. In this assay, animals which have undergone inhalation
exposure to the emissions will be sacrificed (this assay is applicable to the evaluation of both combustion and evaporative
emissions). Peripheral blood lymphocytes will then be isolated and cultured. The cells will be treated with a DNA
base analog (bromodeoxyuridine, BrdU) and with a spindle inhibitor such as colchicine. After appropriate staining
for labeled DNA, SCEs will be scored from cells arrested in the second mitotic division and the results compared with
appropriate controls. Details on the SCE testing procedures are included in  79.62 and  79.65 of this
final rule. 

A positive result for the SCE assay is determined by a statistically significant concentration-related increase
in the number of SCE or a reproducible and statistically significant positive response for at least one of the test
concentrations. 



3. Fertility Screen for Reproductive and Teratologic Effects 



The fertility screen involves mating of test animals previously exposed (by inhalation) to F/FA emissions to examine
the effects of such exposure on conception. The females will continue their exposures throughout pregnancy and will
be assessed for teratologic effects on their offspring. This test is applicable to the evaluation of both combustion
and evaporative emissions. The fertility assessment is coordinated with the 90-day subchronic inhalation study
and replaces the separate reproductive and teratology studies originally proposed in the NPRM. 

The reproductive assessment includes vaginal cell smears to track effects on the estrous cycle. Commenters discouraged
the use of frequent vaginal smearing. In response to the comments, vaginal cyclicity determinations will be performed
on the test subjects for two weeks prior to the start of the exposure period (for culling acyclic females), and will
resume after seven weeks of exposure (for four weeks or until the female is confirmed pregnant). The assessment for
reproductive effects also includes a mating trial and the weighing and histopathological examination of male and
female reproductive organs (i.e., uterus, ovaries, testes, epididymis, and seminal vesicles), all of which can
be performed within the context of the 90-day subchronic inhalation study. 

As compared with appropriate control animals, positive results for reproductive effects include: changes in the
length or stages of the estrous cycle as indicated by the vaginal cytology data, changes in reproductive organ weights,
and pathological changes found during gross or microscopic examination of male or female reproductive organs. Changes
in fecundity, fertility or litter size (number of normal fetuses) will also be regarded as positive results. 

To assess potential teratogenic effects, each dam will be sacrificed on the day prior to normal parturition and its
uterus examined for embryonic or fetal deaths. Viable fetuses will be counted and then examined for skeletal and soft
tissue anomalies. These results will be evaluated relative to the number of spontaneous embryonic or fetal deaths
and abnormalities in unexposed controls. The required analysis covers specific fetal effects outcomes, i.e., in
utero death, growth alteration, and structural abnormalities. 

Although the NPRM proposed the use of two different species for the evaluation of teratogenic effects, today's action
requires the use of only one species to satisfy the Tier 2 requirements. This modification will reduce the number of
animals needed for Tier 2 tests, as requested by some of the commenters, while maintaining an adequate approach for
the screening of teratology effects. 

The above described combined protocol will detect fertility problems and teratogenic effects. EPA realizes that
the protocol will not detect adverse effects on reproductive development that might appear in the offspring as they
grow and mature (since pups are examined just before birth). However, EPA judges that the combined protocol provides
a reasonable screen for both reproductive and teratogenic effects. The testing guidelines for the fertility assessment
are included in  79.62 and  79.63 of this final rule. 



4. Neurotoxicity Screen 



EPA proposed in the NPRM to require the Functional Observational Neurotoxicity Battery (FONB) for the evaluation
of neurotoxic effects. In addition to the FONB, EPA asked for comment on the possible inclusion of a biochemical assay
to measure the level of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). Comments were received on both proposed tests. 

The regulated industry objected to the use of the FONB on the basis of their belief that it would be likely to give artifactual
test results. Commenters also expressed concern about the use of the GFAP assay. They considered it to be a sensitive
marker for neurotoxicity, but discouraged its use because they perceived that adequate historical data are not available
for this test. While not necessarily agreeing with either of these comments, EPA has reconsidered its original proposal
regarding the specific content of the Tier 2 neurotoxicity assessment.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940627-0-00157 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940627-0-00019 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

EPA considers the FONB to be a well-validated standard test and recognizes its extensive use in the past. In the context
of this F/FA emissions testing program, however, EPA believes that, rather than requiring the FONB on a standard basis
within the Tier 2 testing regimen, the FONB is more appropriately reserved for use when a neurotoxicity concern has
been identified and additional testing is needed to clarify the nature and/or significance of the potential adverse
effects (e.g., within Tier 3). 

In regard to the GFAP assay, EPA judges that concerns about the amount of historical data are not sufficient justification
to prevent its use in the F/FA program, given its high specificity and potential applicability as a screening test.
This final rule thus includes the GFAP assay as an element in the Tier 2 assessment of potential neurotoxic effects.


The GFAP assay is a biochemical assay that measures the level of a major intermediate filament protein of astrocytes
(cells of the supporting structure of the nervous system) from brain tissues. An increase in the GFAP level is highly
specific for detecting the existence and location of chemical-induced injury to the central nervous system (CNS)
associated with astrocytic hypertrophy. However, due to its specificity, the assay does not provide information
on other potential sites for neurotoxic effects. To provide a more comprehensive evaluation, today's rule supplements
the GFAP assay with an expanded neurohistopathology examination as part of the 90-day subchronic inhalation study.
The neurohistopathology involves the examination of several brain sections, including the cerebrum, cerebellum,
medulla, cervical bulb of the spinal cord, and peripheral nerves (e.g., tibial or sciatic nerve). Testing guidelines
for the neurotoxicity evaluation are included in  79.62,  79.66 (neuropathology assessment), and  79.67
(GFAP) of this final rule. Positive results at the end of the exposure period for neurotoxicity will be indicated by
an increase in the GFAP level and/or abnormal gross or histopathological findings relative to appropriate control
animals. The neurotoxicity screen is applicable to the evaluation of both combustion and evaporative emissions.




C. Adequate Endpoint Information in Lieu of Tier 2 Tests 



One of the functions of the data search requirement under Tier 1 (as discussed in Section VII.A.2) is to enable F/FA
manufacturers to examine the available literature and determine if adequate data exists (for both combustion and
evaporative emissions, as applicable) that would satisfy the Tier 2 testing requirements, so that duplication of
effort can be avoided. In addition to existing test data from protocols similar to those specified in the Tier 2 testing
program, EPA will consider results from other test protocols to be adequate in lieu of new testing, as long as the alternative
methods provide comparable information. Table 2 provides criteria for determining what constitutes adequate existing
data in lieu of the specified Tier 2 tests, and includes an example list of comparable tests for each Tier 2 endpoint.
EPA recognizes that changes and scientific advances in toxicology testing may result in the development of additional
techniques and methods that could be applicable to the Tier 2 testing requirements of this program in the future. In
deciding if a specific protocol is acceptable in lieu of a Tier 2 test, manufacturers must also address other specific
criteria for Tier 2 requirements, as explained below.

In general, for existing information to fulfill the Tier 2 testing requirements, it must include the in vivo inhalation
exposure to whole motor vehicle emissions (combustion or evaporative, as applicable), except for the few in vitro
studies acceptable for carcinogenicity/mutagenicity assessment. In order to be acceptable, previous toxicity
studies must include exposure to non-catalyzed emissions, as required in this final rule. EPA is requiring the use
of an evaporative emission generator for the evaporative emission testing. However, EPA will accept previous inhalation
exposure studies of whole evaporative emissions in which the emissions were generated using standard evaporative
emission procedures under FTP conditions. Raw product tests, using F/FAs in the uncombusted state, are not considered
adequate replacements for Tier 2 combustion emission testing. In addition, studies using whole aerosolized preparations
or tests on individual emission products of the fuel or additive cannot be used as substitutes for whole emission testing
for either combustion or evaporative emissions. The reason for this requirement is that, as explained in Section
III.A.2 of this preamble, this rule focuses on the effects of whole emissions rather than raw F/FAs or individual emission
products. Tests performed on the emissions of F/FAs which are classified in the same group as the subject fuel or additive
are considered relevant, but tests on products not conforming to the grouping criteria of the subject fuel or additive
do not apply.


Other important parameters to consider in determining if existing studies are adequate include: the type and number
of test subjects, the number and adequacy of dosages, the methodology and duration of exposure, and the technical
methods used for monitoring the progress of the test and for analyzing the results. Generally, 90-days is the minimum
acceptable length of exposure. However, an existing study having a shorter exposure period might be considered adequate
if the test results are positive, i.e., adverse effects are observed. Previously-conducted studies using mammals
other than rodents may be acceptable in lieu of rodent testing, if the existing studies meet all other applicable criteria
for adequacy.


For carcinogenicity and mutagenicity, the Salmonella assay is always required because of its broad sensitivity
and specificity for detecting chemical exposures having mutagenic and/or carcinogenic potential. Manufacturers
should note (see Table 2) that when a registrant needs to conduct new Tier 2 testing, two in vivo assays (MN and SCE),
in addition to the Salmonella assay, are required to satisfy the carcinogenicity endpoint. However, in lieu of new
testing, a manufacturer may rely on one existing in vivo assay for carcinogenicity, in addition to the Salmonella
assay and another in vitro assay. In other words, two in vivo tests for carcinogenicity are required if new testing
is performed, but only one in vivo study is required if the manufacturer relies on existing carcinogenicity information.
The reason for this is that the incremental costs of performing the two specified in vivo assays (MN and SCE) within
the 90-day inhalation protocol (as required in this final rule) is low in comparison with the amount of useful data
obtained. This approach is cost-effective because the same animals used in the inhalation study can also be used for
the in vivo carcinogenicity assays. In fact, fewer resources will be spent to do both the MN and SCE assays within a single
group of inhalation-exposed animals than to conduct just one of these tests along with a separate in vitro carcinogenicity
assay (in addition to the Salmonella assay).




D. Alternative Tier 2 Provision




The Tier 2 tests described above pertain to all designated F/FAs, unless mitigated by special provisions or comparable
data from adequately performed and documented previous studies. In general, EPA considers this standard testing
program to be necessary for the health effects evaluation of F/FA emissions, even if further evaluation may be required
under the provisions of Tier 3. However, this final rule also adopts the special provision discussed in the Reopening
Notice, under which EPA retains the authority to modify the standard Tier 2 test requirements in certain instances.


The exercise of this authority will be done wholly at EPA's initiative and discretion. The alternative Tier 2 provision
is intended to provide a degree of flexibility to EPA when available information indicates that, in a specific case,
another testing regimen is preferable to the standard set of Tier 2 tests. There are three scenarios under which EPA
generally anticipates the possible use of this provision.

<TEXT>
 

First, for a particular fuel or fuel additive (or group), information may be available (independent of the requirements
of this rule) which may cause EPA to be concerned about potential health effects related to an endpoint not specifically
addressed in Tier 2. In such an instance, the alternative Tier 2 provision allows EPA to require additional studies
targeted to the identified area of concern, even though these studies are not normally included in Tier 2. While the
standard structure of this rule also allows EPA to prescribe the additional tests under Tier 3, the alternative Tier
2 provision enables EPA to prescribe and receive the desired data earlier in the process. This flexibility is particularly
important given that this final rule allows up to six years for Tier 2 submittal. When the additional testing can be
coordinated with the standard Tier 2 testing program, the alternative Tier 2 provision will also save costs relative
to conducting the additional tests at a separate point in time.


Second, independent of the information to be submitted under this rule for a particular F/FA product (or group), EPA
may identify a potentially significant public health risk related to a Tier 2 endpoint, such that EPA knows that more
definitive testing will be required for this endpoint than is ordinarily required under Tier 2. Again, EPA could require
such testing under Tier 3 after the evaluation of Tier 2. However, the alternative Tier 2 provision can facilitate
earlier and potentially more efficient acquisition of the required data. If appropriate to the case at hand, EPA would
substitute the more definitive endpoint test for the standard Tier 2 test (with appropriate deadline adjustment).
In such a case, EPA's authority to waive the requirement to provide the respective Tier 2 test derives from its authority
in section 211(e) to provide exemptions from testing when such testing would be duplicative. In this example, because
the substituted test would address the endpoint more rigorously than the standard Tier 2 assessment, it would be duplicative
to require both evaluations.


Third, EPA may identify concerns about the effects of F/FA emissions involving different engine and/or emission
control technologies than those ordinarily required for generating the emissions tested in Tier 2. For example,
biological testing using catalyzed instead of non-catalyzed emissions might be required if emission species of
concern are present in the catalyzed exhaust of a fuel or additive that are not represented in the untreated exhaust.
 In this case, EPA could prescribe a Tier 2 program using catalyzed instead of non-catalyzed emissions under the alternative
Tier 2 provision. Otherwise, the manufacturer of this product would likely be required to conduct a second series
of biological tests with catalyzed emissions, under Tier 3.






In summary, the alternative Tier 2 provision will give EPA the flexibility, when indicated, to prescribe additional
tests to be performed along with the standard Tier 2 program, to substitute different tests, and/or to modify the underlying
vehicle/engine specifications for Tier 2. When EPA exercises its authority under this special provision, it will
allow an appropriate time for completion of the prescribed alternative tests. EPA may also use the alternative Tier
2 authority to waive certain Tier 2 endpoint evaluations (generally on occasions when additional and/or more rigorous
tests are being required for other Tier 2 endpoints). However, Tier 2 endpoint tests will not be waived in the absence
of adequate information or requirements for more rigorous testing of the endpoint(s).


EPA intends to exercise this special authority only in exceptional cases. When EPA decides to use the alternative
Tier 2 provision, EPA will notify the responsible manufacturer (or group) by certified mail letter of the specific
modifications in lieu of the standard Tier 2 program, along with a schedule for compliance and submittal of test results.
The manufacturer (or group of manufacturers) will have 60 days to comment on the prescribed alternative Tier 2 testing
program and timing requirements. If the responsible manufacturer does not provide any comments, EPA will assume
that the manufacturer has consented in full with the prescribed testing regimen. EPA will publish a notice in the 

Federal Register

 to inform the public of its intent to require alternative testing for a particular F/FA manufacturer and that a copy
of the letter to the manufacturer is available in the public record of this rule for review and comment. Additional
correspondence between EPA and the responsible manufacturer regarding alternative testing requirements will
also be placed in the public record. After receipt and review of all comments received (or, if no comments are received),
EPA will publish a notice of final action on the proposed alternative Tier 2 requirements in the 

Federal Register

.


In the Reopening Notice, EPA proposed to notify manufacturers of proposed alternative Tier 2 requirements within
18 months of promulgation of the final rule (for registered F/FAs) or within 18 months of EPA's receipt of intent to
register (for currently unregistered F/FAs). Comments received from the industry indicated that this notification
period was too long relative to the proposed three year deadline for submittal of Tier 2 results. However, EPA believes
the proposed notification period is reasonable, given that this final rule allows manufacturers up to six years for
submittal of Tier 2 results. Furthermore, EPA believes that restricting the time period for exercising the alternative
Tier 2 authority is unnecessary and disadvantageous to the public interest as well as the regulated industry, since
this provision establishes a mechanism to provide needed data on a timely basis and to eliminate unnecessary screening
studies when substitute tests will be required. Therefore, while EPA will endeavor to notify manufacturers of proposed
alternative Tier 2 requirements within 18 months, this final rule permits EPA to notify manufacturers of proposed
alternative Tier 2 requirements at any time prior to EPA's receipt of Tier 2 data. If a manufacturer receiving such
notification has already begun the standard Tier 2 toxicology testing, then EPA will refrain from requiring the testing;
however, in such cases, the manufacturer is required to submit the results of the standard Tier 2 tests within one year
of the date when testing began. In other cases, EPA will consider the potential costs, burdens, and timing factors
in making its final decisions on alternative Tier 2 requirements.

IX. Tier 3 Requirements



A. Scope



On the basis of the submitted Tier 1 and/or Tier 2 data, or any other available information, EPA will determine whether
further testing and/or analysis for the subject fuel or fuel additive is needed under the provisions of Tier 3. Given
the variety of evaluations included in Tiers 1 and 2 and the wide range of possible interrelated outcomes which could
be obtained, EPA proposed to use its discretion in determining the need for Tier 3 testing on a case-by-case basis.
Decisions on the need for follow-up testing within Tier 3 would depend on expert scientific judgment as to the availability
of adequate data to enable a health risk evaluation and the need for more definitive information for developing regulatory
decisions.


EPA requested comments on the proposed discretionary nature of Tier 3 determinations and on a possible alternative
approach involving the establishment of ``automatic triggers'' for Tier 3 decisions, i.e., specific outcomes of
Tiers 1 and 2 which would make Tier 3 testing mandatory. Responses included both support and opposition to the proposed
Tier 3 discretionary approach. EPA evaluated all comments and determined that decisions on Tier 3 requirements should
remain at the discretion of EPA. In order to accomplish the goals of the program, it is essential for EPA to be able to
examine the Tier 1 and Tier 2 data prior to prescribing additional tests. The need for and content of Tier 3 testing will
most often be dependent on the results of the earlier tiers. In these cases, decisions on Tier 3 can only be reasonably
specified after EPA's review of the applicant's initial submittal. The purpose of Tier 3 is not to fill all data gaps,
but to establish a program that provides the Administrator with the necessary and reasonable information to make
regulatory decisions. Based on this rationale, EPA judges that it is neither practical nor desirable to specify criteria
which will automatically force F/FA manufacturers to perform additional testing under Tier 3. Thus, EPA will use
its discretion to determine Tier 3 requirements on a case-by-case basis, allowing EPA to target specific regulatory
needs. Although EPA can use the Tier 3 data to support regulatory actions, referral to Tier 3 level is not mandatory
before beginning actions under CAA section 211(c).


The need for Tier 3 testing and/or analysis will depend, in part, on whether Tier 1 and/or Tier 2 data provide sufficient
toxicity and exposure information to determine the potential health risks associated with a particular fuel or fuel
additive. The endpoints to be addressed and the nature of the studies to be performed under Tier 3 are to be determined
on a case-by-case basis. Tier 3 studies will most often be required to further explicate the results of the tests/analyses
performed under Tiers 1 and 2 or to address other areas of concern highlighted by the literature search. If additional
toxicity testing is required under Tier 3, the test might entail whole emissions (as in Tier 2), or the testing of one
or more individual emission species identified to be of particular concern. EPA could also use other information
(available outside this program) to require testing under Tier 3.


While the specific objectives and scope of Tier 3 testing will vary depending on the concerns identified in the earlier
tiers or any other information available to EPA, examples of possible areas for further testing are: chronic/lifetime
studies, chemical disposition/metabolism studies, exposure studies, dosimetry analyses, additional emission
characterization/speciation, additional modeling analysis, environmental toxicity tests, testing using different
emission generation procedures or emission control systems, or any other additional evaluation approach EPA deems
necessary to assess the health and/or welfare effects of a particular fuel or fuel additive. The previous examples
and the discussion below in no way limit the scope of Tier 3 or EPA's authority to require further testing under this
program.


Today's rule specifically includes under Tier 3 any health effects testing to be performed on aerosol additives (see
Section X.C for details on the special provision for aerosol products). Due to the special nature and use of this type
of product, EPA judges that any testing needs will require non-standard test procedures that can be better addressed
under Tier 3. EPA will review the composition information and literature data on the specific aerosol product and
will determine if health effects testing is needed on a case-by-case basis. For example, if available literature,
submitted under Tier 1, indicates that a component of an aerosol product is highly toxic, and the product is widely
produced, then Tier 3 testing on the aerosol product would likely be indicated.


Modeling of potential exposures, atmospheric reactivity, and/or environmental fate/partitioning may also be
required under Tier 3, as explained in Section III.C. For example, if a fuel or additive is widely distributed and Tier
2 data indicate serious concern for health effects, EPA might require more extensive exposure analysis and/or modeling
under Tier 3 to better define potential risks.


Although the grouping mechanism included in this rule allows F/FA manufacturers to submit Tier 1 and Tier 2 data on
the representative of a designated group for purposes of registration, EPA retains the authority under Tier 3 to require
testing on any member product of a group. Thus, when follow-up testing is required under Tier 3 authority, the specified
test(s) could be required to be conducted on the selected representative or on any other member of an existing group.
Testing on additional F/FA products could be required if EPA identifies a concern for any member of the group other
than the group representative. For example, the testing representative for the M85 group (consisting of methanol
formulations containing 50-95 percent methanol) is an M85 base fuel containing 85 percent methanol by volume.
In the future, other methanol fuels could enter the market and be used extensively, triggering a concern for exposure
and potential health risks. In this case, EPA could require Tier 3 testing for another methanol formulation within
the M85 group.

<TEXT>
 

Another possible Tier 3 effort could involve the testing of combinations of oxygenates. Although groups for non-baseline
gasolines are defined on the basis of individual oxygenates, EPA could request additional testing to address mixtures
of oxygenates under Tier 3 authority. For example, if a registered non-baseline gasoline formulation containing
a mixture of oxygenates is widely produced and used, resulting in high exposures and potential health risks, EPA could
require testing of this formulation under Tier 3. Tier 3 tests for this formulation could involve standard Tier 1 or
Tier 2 tests, testing for other endpoints not addressed under Tier 2, or testing for other areas of concern (e.g., exposure
analysis, environmental testing, etc.).


EPA also retains the authority to require additional testing using different vehicle/engine technologies and/or
emission generation specifications than those prescribed for Tier 1 and Tier 2 analyses. To reduce the costs of the
program, today's action requires the use of a single vehicle model for emission generation. However, if EPA determines
that emissions from other applicable vehicle/engine technologies might differ significantly for a given fuel or
additive/base fuel mixture, then EPA may require additional emission characterization and/or toxicological testing
under Tier 3 using different vehicle/engine technology. Also, although standard Tier 2 tests are to be conducted
using non-catalyzed emissions (as discussed in Section VI.A), EPA could require the use of catalyzed emissions for
testing under Tier 3.


When a determination has been made that Tier 3 testing is required, EPA will inform the responsible manufacturer by
certified mail of the purpose and nature of the testing to be performed along with a schedule for compliance and submittal
of the Tier 3 report to EPA. EPA will also publish a notice in the 

Federal Register

, notifying the public that the letter to the manufacturer is available in the public record for review and comment.
The affected manufacturer's comments and EPA's response to these comments will be placed in the public record, as
well. After receipt and review of all comments received (or, if no comments are received), EPA will publish a notice
of final action on the proposed Tier 3 requirements in the 

Federal Register

.


EPA proposed in the NPRM to provide the responsible manufacturer or group a 30-day comment period to respond to EPA's
requirements under Tier 3. In their commentary, the regulated industry asked EPA to extend this comment period to
60 days to allow for appropriate time for review, analysis, and preparation of a written response to EPA regarding
the designated protocol(s) to be used for Tier 3 tests. EPA judged that this request was reasonable, thus today's rule
gives F/FA manufacturers 60 days to comment on the EPA-prescribed Tier 3 requirements.


The responsible manufacturer is expected to submit detailed protocols for review and approval by EPA prior to beginning
Tier 3 testing. Tier 3 tests must comply with the pre-approved specifications given by EPA. If manufacturers experience
unforeseen difficulties while conducting the prescribed Tier 3 tests approved by EPA (e.g., excess mortality observed
half-way through a chronic bioassay), they will be allowed to request a modification of the requirements. This mechanism
would apply to unusual circumstances that are outside the control of the manufacturer. If testing problems are identified,
EPA must be notified as soon as possible so that requirements can be modified.




B. Criteria for Referral to Tier 3




This section presents some of the guidelines and considerations which EPA will use in determining the necessity for
additional testing under a discretionary Tier 3 testing approach. Consistent with the discretionary decision-making
process for Tier 3, this discussion is not intended to provide an exhaustive, limiting, or definitive listing of relevant
criteria.


The decision to require manufacturers to submit additional testing on the health, environmental, or welfare effects
of F/FA emissions will take into account the cumulative information provided by Tiers 1 and 2, including previous
scientific data, emissions characterization data, biological test results, and any ancillary information which
may be available to EPA. Thus, decisions to require Tier 3 level testing will be made only after all the requirements
of Tiers 1 and 2 have been adequately satisfied (with the exception of special cases as discussed in Section VIII.D).
Adherence to this principle will prevent unnecessarily costly or poorly targeted decisions based on piecemeal,
out-of-context information, and will promote more precise identification and evaluation of data gaps, and more
cost-efficient coordination of potential test requirements.


Ultimately, EPA must be able to decide whether or not the use of a fuel or fuel additive is likely to create unacceptable
health or welfare risks. If a risk decision is made possible by the information from Tiers 1 and 2, then Tier 3 will not
be required. However, if such a risk decision cannot be made on the basis of the Tiers 1 and 2 data, then Tier 3 testing
will be mandated. Therefore, to make a determination on the need for Tier 3 testing, EPA scientists will evaluate the
extent to which the results of Tiers 1 and 2 are adequate for such decisions, guided by the basic principles of risk assessment.


A risk assessment requires the merging of a health effects assessment (including hazard identification and concentration-response
relationship) and an exposure assessment. Such an assessment can range from a qualitative to a highly quantitative
analysis, depending upon the extent of the available data. EPA recognizes that a quantitative assessment might not
be possible at the end of Tier 2.
 However, Tiers 1 and 2 might indicate that little hazard is present and that exposures may be quite low and limited geographically.
In such a case, there may be no reason to pursue further testing at the Tier 3 level to improve risk assessment information.
On the other hand, Tiers 1 and 2 might suggest that a hazard is likely and that exposures could be significant because
of the production volume and ubiquitous use of a product, but the data may still be inadequate for a quantitative risk
assessment. In this case, Tier 3 testing could be indicated to provide the needed information.





In general, the principles and critical data elements of the risk assessment process will provide a useful guide for
identifying whether meaningful information gaps remain and for determining the specific objectives of potential
Tier 3 testing. However, EPA does not intend to conduct a formal risk assessment as part of its decision on whether to
promote a fuel or fuel additive (or group) to Tier 3. Rather, EPA will evaluate the quality and certainty of the toxicity
and concentration-response data and consider qualitatively whether such data weighs in favor of or against further
testing. A formal risk assessment will be more likely to be developed at such a time that there is a need for action to
control or prohibit a product under the regulatory authority of CAA section 211(c).

The following sections discuss key factors which EPA will consider in identifying the need for and content of Tier
3 testing. 


1. Statistical Issues 


As previously mentioned, scientific judgment will be exercised in determining whether Tier 3 testing is indicated.
An important factor in such judgments will be the interpretation of and significance ascribed to ``negative'' results
obtained in Tiers 1 and 2. To address this issue, EPA will consider statistical information such as the probability
of Type I and Type II errors. 
A Type I error occurs when a false positive conclusion is made, while a Type II error is a false negative conclusion.
The acceptability of a specific Type II error is related to the acceptability of false negatives in the particular
study being performed. For example, from a toxicological perspective, screening assays often have a relatively
high probability of producing false negative (Type II) outcomes, since some major aspects of organ or tissue toxicity
are not being examined. Thus, an acceptable Type II error for screening assays will typically be high. However, the
level of Type II error considered acceptable should be tempered by the goal of the study. A higher false negative conclusion
(e.g., Type II error of 0.2) will generally be acceptable if it refers to an effect of minimal severity at a high-exposure
test level relative to ambient concentration and if few people are likely to be exposed. The converse will also hold
true. 
Scientifically sound statistical analyses are a crucial part of any reliable study and will provide key information
for EPA to make judgments on whether or not Tier 3 testing is needed. While it is not feasible to list all possible scenarios
and results for each Tier 2 endpoint, the above discussion describes how some of the statistical factors will be incorporated
into EPA's decisions. 


2. Exposure Assessment 


The Tier 1 requirements will provide EPA with information on the composition of F/FA emissions and potential exposures
to F/FA products. This information includes: (1) Types and emission rates of speciated emission components, (2)
possible literature search findings on ambient, occupational, or epidemiological exposures, (3) literature information
on the potential fate and environmental effects, and (4) a qualitative exposure analysis (submitted by the manufacturer
or group) based on the production and use of the F/FA product(s). As mentioned above, this information will be considered
qualitatively by EPA in determining the extent of potential exposures and whether additional testing or analysis
is needed to assess risks quantitatively. As discussed earlier, EPA has the authority to require exposure modeling
or analysis under Tier 3. 
Significant public health concerns might sometimes be revealed by the submitted information on product composition,
total annual production volume and market distribution data, and emissions data. This might be the case, for example,
if there was a significant annual release of emission compounds with known toxicities, or if the anticipated exposures
approached or exceeded current estimates of apparently safe levels of known toxicants. In the case of high-volume
fuels and their associated bulk additives, EPA will generally assume that human and environmental exposures will
be of sufficient level and extent that significant observed adverse effects could indicate a need for follow-up in
Tier 3. This exposure assumption reflects the high production and consumption of these products, either at the present
time or as anticipated in the future. Thus, decisions to refer these products to Tier 3 will be based on the degree to
which additional testing is needed to clarify the results and potential health effect and environmental implications
identified in the previous tiers. On the other hand, it cannot be assumed that fuel additives used in relatively low
concentrations or produced in relatively low volumes will automatically be excused from Tier 3. For these products,
test results indicative of severe health effects and/or high exposure levels (e.g., during consumer use) might be
cause for escalation to Tier 3. 


3. Health Assessment 


General criteria for evaluating the potential public health effects associated with fuel and additive emissions
will include: (1) The number of positive and negative outcomes related to each endpoint, (2) the identification of
a concentration-effect relationship, (3) the statistical sensitivity and significance of such studies, (4) the
severity of the observed effects (e.g., whether the effects will likely lead to incapacitating or irreversible conditions),
and (5) the consistency and clarity of apparent mechanisms, target organs, and outcomes. Additional parameters
which will influence the decision on whether to require Tier 3 will include: (1) The nature and amount of known toxic
agents in the emissions stream and (2) the observation of lesions which specifically implicate inhalation as an important
exposure route for inducing adverse health effects. 
These criteria will be evaluated in conjunction with the Tier 1 and Tier 2 results to determine whether or not higher
level testing is needed. In this decision, both the biological and statistical significance of the Tiers 1 and 2 results
will be taken into account. Generally, escalation to Tier 3 may be judged necessary when remaining uncertainties
about the significance of observed outcomes and/or potential exposures interfere with EPA's ability to make reasonable
estimates of potential health risks. On the other hand, if no statistically significant effects are obtained at any
exposure level in a scientifically sound Tier 2 study (or existing test submitted in lieu of Tier 2 testing and not contradicted
by other published reports of equal or greater reliability), and if other major sources of concern do not arise (e.g.,
toxic effects of structurally related compounds), then Tier 3 testing is not likely to be required for the endpoint
in question.

This discussion assumes that relevant, high-quality statistical analyses have been done to permit the negative
test results to be properly evaluated and interpreted. The statistical analyses recommended for Tier 2, including
determination of Type I and II error (as discussed in Section IX.B.1), should enable reasonable conclusions to be
drawn as to the significance of negative findings. Factors to be taken into account include the toxicological nature
of the findings and the exposure levels used in the test. For example, if the statistical analyses are applied to a ``severe''
endpoint (e.g., major fetal abnormalities, major lung pathology, etc.) and the exposure in question is moderate,
then a relatively low Type II error level may be appropriate. In contrast, if a high concentration limit test causes
a relatively minor effect (e.g., a small change in estrous cyclicity), a higher Type II error may be allowed, effectively
increasing the chance of false negative conclusions. 


4. Evaluation of Tier 2 Results 


The specific outcomes which will be considered positive and negative results for each Tier 2 test were mentioned briefly
in the previous descriptions of Tier 2 requirements (see Section VIII.B) and are defined and interpreted more precisely
in the regulatory text of this final rule. For example, three primary assays (i.e., Salmonella, MN, and SCE) are included
in Tier 2 for the screening of carcinogenicity and mutagenicity. As compared with appropriate controls, a statistically
significant concentration-related positive response in any one of these assays could be cause for concern, as will
be positive outcomes for at least one concentration in two or more of these tests. Such outcomes will be indicative
of mutagenic and/or carcinogenic risk. Positive results will also indicate that the emissions could initiate some
of the mechanisms involved in carcinogenesis. However, these results will generally not in themselves be sufficient
to determine whether the emissions were in fact carcinogenic because the development of cancer is a multi-step process.
Depending on the internal and historical consistency of the results and their relationship to projected exposures,
further testing might be required to determine the significance of the mutagenic and/or carcinogenic activity/risks
in human populations exposed by inhalation. In contrast, if no statistically significant results are obtained in
the three assays and no conflicting results are found in the literature or in any other Tier 2 tests, then Tier 3 follow-up
of potential carcinogenic/mutagenic effects is not likely to be required. 
To take another example, determination of the need to investigate further reproductive or teratogenic risks will
take into account the outcome of the results of the estrous cyclicity measurements, the histopathological evaluation
of reproductive organs, the outcome of the fertility screen, and the outcome of the teratogenicity evaluation. If
negative results are obtained in the above evaluations (according to statistically sound principles), and if these
results are not refuted by the existing literature, then additional testing is not likely to be required at the Tier
3 level for reproductive or teratogenic effects. Positive results for the teratogenicity study will include a decrease
in neonatal viability relative to that in control studies, a significant change in the proportion of viable male versus
female fetuses or offspring, the presence of soft tissue or skeletal abnormalities, and an increased rate of embryonic
or fetal resorption. Other positive outcomes related to reproductive effects, such as decreased fertility, decreased
litter size, abnormal changes in vaginal cytology or reproductive organ histopathology, will be indicative of hazards
to the adult reproductive systems. The need for additional evaluation under Tier 3 will depend on the specificity,
severity, and consistency of results, the presence or absence of a concentration-effect relationship, and the significance
of these outcomes in view of projected exposures. The greater the remaining uncertainty regarding the risk of reproductive
or teratogenic effects after analysis of such factors, the higher will be the likelihood that Tier 3 will be required.

Similarly, consistent negative results (according to statistically sound principles) obtained in other Tier 2
tests, in the absence of significant related concerns raised in the literature, will (in all likelihood) make Tier
3 unnecessary. If adverse effects are found at Tier 2 and/or reported in the literature, EPA will determine if Tier
3 follow-up is required by attempting to evaluate the nature, severity, and significance of the findings in light
of the likely exposures. If EPA determines that Tier 3 testing is required to resolve the remaining uncertainties,
the Tier 3 requirements will reflect both positive and negative results. For example, if the results of Tier 2 were
positive for pulmonary effects but negative for neurotoxicity (according to criteria discussed earlier), and if
these results were consistent with the literature, only pulmonary toxicity would be a likely candidate for Tier 3
follow-up testing. 


C. Potential Tier 3 Tests 


To be most cost-effective, Tier 3 testing will be designed to address specific data gaps regarding health effects
endpoints of concern or health and environment-related issues requiring further analysis. For instance, Tier 3
requirements could potentially include further emission characterization procedures, perhaps involving additional
vehicles and/or more rigorous pre-conditioning methods, to identify and quantify harmful emission products with
greater precision. Higher-order modeling calculations or exposure field studies could be required to resolve uncertainties
in the Tier 1 emissions exposure information. Health or welfare effects testing requirements will be aimed at providing
sufficient information to make sound conclusions about the degree of health or welfare risk. If more than one endpoint
is of concern, EPA will attempt to reduce testing costs by permitting combined protocols insofar as possible.

<TEXT>
 

Tier 3 tests for specific endpoints could require the determination of a NOAEL. Depending on the endpoint under evaluation,
consideration will be given to including a mid-duration examination in the case of chronic inhalation tests. A mid-duration
evaluation will be useful for affirming the adequacy of exposure levels and, in some cases, might enable interim risk
conclusions to be drawn which will avoid the need for further examination. Inhalation studies will generally make
use of rodent species, but higher order mammals could be required. 
While Tier 3 testing requirements will be targeted to critical areas of concern, EPA will also exercise its judgment
to avoid the false economy of establishing overly narrow requirements. Just as requirements for too many assays would
be wasteful of resources, requirements for too few assays might result in inconclusive findings, creating needs
for still further testing at greater total expense than would have been necessary at the start. Similarly, EPA will
consider the value of including secondary evaluations as useful and low-cost adjuncts to tests already required.
For example, if the histopathology of a specified target organ was the primary examination required at the conclusion
of an inhalation exposure, other organs could be weighed and saved in storage for a limited time period, at low incremental
expense. If indicated, these other organs would then be available for subsequent examination, avoiding the possible
need to repeat the chronic inhalation procedures to assess the effects on other organs. 
Because the specific health testing requirements which will be imposed in Tier 3 will be tailored to individual circumstances,
precise test guidelines cannot be provided in advance. However, some examples of testing scenarios which might be
required under Tier 3 are cited in  79.54 in the accompanying regulatory text. Where possible, existing standard
guidelines for these tests are referenced. It should be recognized, however, that such guidelines might need to be
revised to accommodate emission inhalation requirements and/or to evaluate certain structures or functions which
the current guidelines do not adequately address. Study parameters which might require modification include exposure
routes and concentrations, species selection, number of animal subjects, examination procedures and frequencies,
and analytic requirements. Furthermore, interim advances in the underlying science and testing technology may
provide superior approaches which could be available for use by the time Tier 3 requirements are implemented. 


X. Special Provisions 


The following sections describe special provisions included in the F/FA registration program to avoid duplication
of effort, to alleviate the financial impact on small businesses, and to ease the burdens of the program on the regulated
industry in general. 


A. Experimental F/FAs 


EPA requested comments on the possibility of providing a temporary program exemption or deferment for experimental
F/FAs. Eligibility for this special provision was to be limited to unregistered products (i.e., F/FAs which are not
registered as of the effective date of this final rule) or registered products that had not been placed into wholesale
or retail commerce prior to promulgation of this rule.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940627-0-00166 </DOCNO>

<TEXT>
 

The regulated industry provided comments questioning the need for a special provision for experimental F/FAs under
this rulemaking because a provision for experimental products already exists under existing registration rules.
EPA agrees with the comments received and today's rule relies on existing regulations under 40 CFR 79.4(a)(3) and
79.4(b)(2) for the exemption of experimental F/FAs. 40 CFR section 79.4(a)(3) exempts fuels used for research, development
or testing, and 40 CFR section 79.4(b)(2) similarly exempts fuel additives. Based on these existing provisions,
any designated F/FA product sold to automobile, engine, or component manufacturers for research, development or
test purposes, or sold to automobile manufacturers for factory fill, and not in any case offered for commercial sale
to the public, is exempted from the registration requirements of today's rule. 


B. Relabeled Products 


A company's product is registered as ``relabeled'' if it is simply a repackaged and rebranded version of a formulation
which is already registered by another manufacturer and is procured from that manufacturer for sale or use. Requiring
companies which sell relabeled products to conduct the testing program in today's rulemaking would clearly duplicate
the efforts of the original manufacturer. Thus, under the authority of CAA section 211(e)(3)(C), which provides
that the Administrator may ``exempt any person from such regulations with respect to a particular fuel or fuel additive
upon a finding that any additional testing of such fuel or fuel additive would be duplicative of adequate existing
testing,'' today's rule includes a special provision exempting relabeled products from the evaluation and testing
requirements. For relabeled products, only basic registration information will be required, as described below
in Section XII.A. 
About half of the 4,800 fuel additives registered (as of March 1994) are relabeled products. Manufacturers of these
relabeled products will therefore not be required to comply with the health and welfare effects assessment provisions
of the F/FA registration program. 


C. Aerosols 


Several commenters requested an exemption for aftermarket aerosol additives because of the nature of their mode
of application and their low frequency of use. EPA examined available data on aerosol products and concluded that
the required testing procedures of this rule are not well suited to this type of product. The evaluation of currently
registered additives indicates that aerosols include carburetor cleaners and engine starters that are sprayed
into the air intake valve of the engine and are used only intermittently and, even then, for only a very brief period
of time (i.e., a few seconds). Because of their intermittent use and method of use, it is unlikely that their recommended
application would affect the overall characteristics of vehicle emissions. Direct exposure to the aerosol product
itself is likely to be a more important source of potential hazards than is exposure to its combustion or evaporative
emission products. Thus, the evaluation of potential health and welfare effects of aerosols would require a different
testing regimen tailored to the specific nature of these products. 
Today's rule therefore establishes a special provision for aerosols. Manufacturers of aftermarket aerosol additives
are required to provide only the basic registration data required for all F/FA manufacturers (see Section XII.A),
plus a literature survey of existing information on their products and a discussion on the potential exposures. Thus,
the standard emission characterization and Tier 2 tests are not required for aerosol products. The literature search
(as described in Section VII.A) must include existing data on potential health and welfare effects on the uncombusted
aerosol product as a whole and on the individual components of the product. The analysis of potential exposures should
be based on the total annual production volume data and the market distribution of the product, as explained in Section
VII.C. EPA will review the submitted information and will determine if there is a need to require testing on a case-by-case
basis. Thus, if testing of an aerosol is prescribed by EPA, the testing is to be performed under Tier 3. Using this approach,
EPA will be able to tailor specific tests (as needed) addressing the particular problems related to aerosol product
exposure. 


D. Small Business Provisions

In the NPRM, EPA requested comments on the possibility of establishing special provisions for small businesses.
The regulated industry expressed concerns regarding the costs of the program and the potential impact of the F/FA
regulations on the financial status of small companies. EPA understands that small businesses might be particularly
affected by the F/FA regulations due to their smaller resource base, generally lower rate of representation in trade
organizations and, consequently, their potentially limited opportunity to participate in grouping and cost-sharing
arrangements. In view of these circumstances, EPA is including in today's rule special provisions to alleviate the
economic impact of this rule on small manufacturers of F/FAs, taking into consideration the comments received. 
 
EPA examined the distribution of currently registered F/FA companies across various sales ranges and identified
a sales level which will define a ``small business'' for the purposes of this rule. A comparison between registered
fuel manufacturers and registered additive manufacturers indicates that the distribution across sales ranges
is similar for both industries. Each industry appears to be made up of many small companies and relatively few larger
companies. Approximately a fifth of registered fuel manufacturers and a third of registered additive manufacturers
have sales above $100 million. For 
both industries, most of the companies with sales under $100 million tend to cluster under $50 million. Thus, within
each of the industries, companies tend to cluster above $100 million and below $50 million in sales. Furthermore,
companies with sales below $50 million also tend to have sales below $10 million, especially within the additive industry.


Based on the analysis of F/FA manufacturers' sales data, EPA identified $50 million as a reasonable sales level for
differentiating between small and large companies within each industry.
 As a result, this final rule defines a small business as any motor vehicle fuel or fuel additive manufacturer with total
annual sales of less than $50 million.
 The small business provisions established for this rule are defined below. 






Special provisions for small


F/FA companies were developed based on assumptions regarding the degree to which manufacturers will have the opportunity
to group with other manufacturers to share costs, and the degree to which information on similar products can be expected
to be submitted by larger companies. A review of EPA's registration data base shows that nearly every registered F/FA
manufacturer produces at least one baseline or non-baseline product. Hence, even if generous special provisions
are provided for small manufacturers of these products, EPA is assured that test data on such products will still be
submitted by other, larger companies which do not 
qualify for the special provisions. Therefore, in regard to registration of products in the baseline and non-baseline
categories, this final rule requires small businesses (i.e., companies with annual sales less than $50 million)
to submit only the basic registration data for their baseline and/or non-baseline products. Such companies are not
required to meet the Tier 1 and Tier 2 requirements in order to register their baseline and non-baseline F/FAs. Since
the larger companies will still be submitting the data for these products, this provision does not compromise EPA's
ability to get the necessary information to evaluate the potential health and welfare effects of baseline and non-baseline
products. 



The above assumption, however, is not valid in the case of atypical F/FAs. Analysis of current registrations shows
that there are fewer atypical products than baseline products and fewer large companies that produce atypical F/FAs.
Therefore, if the same small business provisions described above for baseline/non-baseline F/FAs were also applied
to atypical F/FAs, then there would be no data submitted for many atypical F/FAs. EPA would then be unable to evaluate
the health and welfare effects for these atypical products. Nevertheless, EPA realizes that the testing program
will be particularly burdensome for very small manufacturers of atypical F/FAs. In part, this is due to the added compliance
requirements for atypical products (e.g., more rigorous mileage accumulation requirements prior to emission generation
(see Section VI.E) and more extensive emission characterization requirements (see Section VII.B). An even greater
impact results from the fact that grouping 
opportunities for these manufacturers might be quite limited. Not only do atypical products tend to be unique, but
also, the smallest manufacturers rarely are members of the dominant trade associations which are most likely to take
the lead in organizing and administering F/FA group functions. Thus, high program costs could fall on manufacturers
with low financial resources and perhaps few opportunities to share the costs. 

Based on the above reasons, this final rule includes additional special provisions applicable to the atypical F/FAs
of small businesses. However, these provisions apply to fewer manufacturers and are less liberal than those established
for baseline and non- baseline products. Specifically, for manufacturers of atypical products with less than $10
million in annual sales (rather than the $50 million sales level applicable to manufacturers of baseline/non-baseline
F/FAs), the minimal requirements of the program include only basic registration and Tier 1 data. These requirements
fall between those applicable to small manufacturers of baseline/non-baseline F/FAs and the general requirements
of the program for larger manufacturers.

<TEXT>
 

In summary, manufacturers qualifying for small business special provisions for their baseline and non-baseline
products (having less than $50 million annual sales) are excused from both Tier 1 and Tier 2 requirements, while small
manufacturers qualifying for special provisions for their atypical products (having less than $10 million annual
sales) are excused only from Tier 2 requirements for these products. Since small business provisions are based on
both the annual sales and the product category, the possibility exists for a manufacturer to have some products excused
from program requirements while having to comply with testing requirements for others. For 
example, an additive manufacturer having both baseline and atypical products and annual sales of $30 million can
use the special small business provision for the baseline additives, but not for the atypical products. 

Pursuant to CAA section 211(b), 
F/FAs which are excused from any program requirements under these special provisions may still be subject to testing
under Tier 3 at EPA's discretion (on a case-by-case basis). The Tier 3 testing might include (but would not be necessarily
limited to) information which would otherwise have been required under the provisions of Tier 1 and/or Tier 2. 



XI. Timing and Compliance Requirements 



The timing and compliance requirements for the F/FA registration program are dependent on the type of product and
the registration status of the product. As discussed in Section III.A of this preamble, both Tier 1 and Tier 2 are mandatory
requirements for all F/FAs (or groups), except as may be modified by any applicable special provisions. Special provisions
affecting the content and/or timing of these requirements are discussed in Sections VII.A.3, VIII.D, and X of this
preamble. For F/FAs registered as of the 
effective date of this rule, Tier 1 data and evidence of a suitable contractual arrangement for satisfactory completion
of Tier 2 requirements must be submitted to EPA within three years of the effective date. The results of Tier 2 must be
submitted to EPA no later than six years from the effective date. The schedule for completion of any Tier 3 requirements
which EPA may prescribe will be determined based on the nature of the particular requirements. The general reporting
format for submittal of all of these requirements is described in Section XII. 

For registrable F/FAs, i.e., F/FAs not registered as of the effective date of this rule but meeting the criteria for
grouping with a currently registered fuel or bulk additive in the same fuel family, the content and timing of requirements
is essentially the same as for the currently registered F/FAs. Thus, manufacturers of these products will be granted
registration and be permitted to market registrable F/FAs upon EPA's receipt of basic registration 
data for such products. In contrast, for manufacturers of new F/FAs (i.e., F/FAs that are not currently registered
and do not meet the registrable criteria), all testing requirements must be completed prior to registration and introduction
into commerce, including Tier 3 when prescribed by EPA. 

After receipt of Tier 1 and/or Tier 2 data, EPA will determine whether the submitted information is in compliance with
the specified guidelines and whether further testing of a particular fuel or fuel additive is required under the provisions
of Tier 3. For registered F/FAs, EPA intends to determine the adequacy of the submitted data within two years after
receipt. However, if EPA is unable to inform the registered manufacturer of the adequacy of the Tier 1 and/or Tier 2
data within two years after submittal, EPA retains the authority to require that satisfactory data be submitted if,
upon subsequent 
review, EPA finds that the original submittal was inadequate for compliance. In such a case, EPA will not hold the manufacturer
liable for penalties for violating this rule from the time period between the date on which the data were due and the
date on which EPA informs the responsible manufacturer of a violation. Regarding new F/FAs, EPA will send a notification
of compliance within six months after submission of Tier 1 and Tier 2 data. If the manufacturer of the new F/FA product
does not receive a notification of compliance with Tier 1 and Tier 2 within this time frame, then the manufacturer should
assume that the Tier 1 and Tier 2 requirements have been 
satisfactorily met. EPA's determination of the need for Tier 3 testing for new F/FAs will occur within six months after
EPA notifies the manufacturer of satisfactory compliance with Tier 1 and Tier 2 requirements or within twelve months
of the Tier 1 and Tier 2 submittal, whichever occurs first. 

If Tier 3 testing is deemed necessary, EPA will notify the responsible manufacturer (or group) by certified letter
of the specific Tier 3 requirement(s) along with a schedule for compliance and a deadline for submittal of the Tier
3 report to EPA (see Section IX.A). This final rule gives the responsible manufacturer (or group) 60 days to comment
on the prescribed Tier 3 requirements, compliance schedule, and submission deadline. In the event that EPA receives
no comment within the given period, the manufacturer will be assumed to have consented in full to the prescribed Tier
3 requirements. Compliance with Tier 3 requirements is not optional.

<TEXT>
 

Registered (and registrable) F/FAs required to undergo Tier 3 testing will retain their registration for that time
determined to be necessary for the completion of Tier 3 tests. This registration will be contingent on the satisfactory
compliance with the Tier 3 requirements according to a timetable determined by EPA to be appropriate to those requirements.
When Tier 3 is prescribed for new F/FAs (i.e., those not meeting the registrable criteria), EPA may withhold registration
until completion of all testing requirements. For new F/FAs, EPA will determine whether the Tier 3 requirements have
been met within one year of receiving the Tier 3 submittal. If Tier 3 requirements are satisfied, then EPA will send
a notification to the manufacturer granting registration to the new F/FA product. Registration of new F/FAs will
not occur until that time when EPA determines that all Tier 3 requirements have been satisfactorily met. 
 
As described above, EPA's review times for data on new F/FAs are shorter than those for registered F/FAs. The reason
for this discrepancy is that manufacturers of new F/FAs are barred from marketing such products until EPA approves
their compliance with all testing requirements and grants them registration. On the other hand, manufacturers of
registered products can maintain their registration, and thus their ability to sell their products, while EPA is
reviewing their submitted data. Thus, to ensure that undue 
hindrance is not created for manufacturers of new products wanting to enter the marketplace, EPA has abbreviated
the review times for new F/FA products. 

Notwithstanding the granting of a registration (or continued registration for registered F/FAs), if EPA determines
that a fuel or fuel additive causes or contributes to air pollution that may reasonably be anticipated to endanger
the public health or welfare, then EPA could invoke available regulatory authority under CAA section 211(c). Referral
to Tier 3 is not required for EPA to begin a regulatory action under 211(c). 
 
If additional testing is needed to make up for deficiencies in information content or testing technique/procedures
related to Tier 1, Tier 2, and/or Tier 3, then the original compliance deadlines will still be in force. Manufacturers
of existing products who fail to submit data in the prescribed time frames or who submit data from tests that do not comply
with the specified guidelines will be in violation of this rule and will be subject to the penalties specified in CAA
section 211(d). According to CAA section 211(d), persons who fail to submit any information or conduct any tests required
by the Administrator under CAA section 211(b) shall be liable to the United States for a civil penalty of not more than
$25,000 for every day of 
such violation plus the amount of economic benefit or savings resulting from the violation. Each day after the due
date for submission of data will constitute a separate day of violation. Civil penalties will be assessed in accordance
with CAA sections 205(b) and (c), which permit EPA to proceed either in court or in an administrative action. If a group
of manufacturers commits to performing joint testing, each manufacturer would separately be in 
violation of the rule. However, the Administrator would retain the authority to remit or mitigate any penalty under
CAA section 211(d). 

In addition to the above penalties, the district courts of the United States have jurisdiction to compel the furnishing
of information and/or the conduct of tests required under CAA section 211(b). This means that, in addition to the financial
penalties, persons failing to submit data or comply with the specified guidelines would still need to submit the data
originally required. Furthermore, if EPA determines that the data requirements of the rule were not met, EPA could
revoke the registration of the fuel(s) or 
additive(s) in question. 

Because EPA recognizes that unusual circumstances, outside the control of the manufacturer, may occasionally interfere
with the manufacturer's ability to comply with the provisions of the rule, today's rule contains a mechanism to allow
manufacturers to request modification of the requirements under some specific circumstances. This special mechanism
allows persons who experience unforeseen problems or accidents in conducting the EPA-prescribed tests to 
request modification of the requirements in order to avoid being in violation of the rule. This mechanism would apply
to unusual mechanical problems or other unavoidable problems that could arise during the performance of the required
tests. The modification requests must be submitted as soon as the manufacturer is aware of the difficulty, but not
later than thirty days following the event precipitating the request. Additional details on this special mechanism
for modification of requirements is included in the 
regulatory text of this rule. 



XII. Reporting Requirements 



The materials to be submitted to EPA include the basic registration data, a summary report with Tier 1 and Tier 2 results,
and associated appendices. If the results of Tiers 1 and 2 are submitted at the same time, then the summary report must
include both Tier 1 and Tier 2 information and associated appendices, as described below. If Tier 1 and Tier 2 results
are submitted separately, then two individual reports must be provided to EPA, i.e., Tier 1 report and Tier 2 report.
In such a case, each individual report must include the summary information applicable to the respective tier (including
a cover page, executive summary, test substance information, a summary of tier results, conclusions, and associated
appendices). If the Tier 2 report for registered F/FAs is not submitted within three years after the effective date
of the final rule, then evidence of a suitable arrangement for completion of Tier 2 (e.g., a copy of a signed contract
with a qualified laboratory to 
conduct the required Tier 2 tests) must be submitted to EPA prior to that date. F/FA manufacturers who must conduct
additional testing under Tier 3 are required to submit a Tier 3 report when the designated Tier 3 testing is complete.
The nature of the information to be included in the basic registration data, reports, and associated appendices is
described below.

A. Basic Registration Data 



The basic information already required for F/FA registration includes product and manufacturer identification,
concentration and purpose-in-use, and specific compositional data. Today's rule adds the following items to the
basic registration data requirements: total annual production volume data, marketing distribution data, notification
about group participation, and notification on the use of special provisions (i.e., relabeled products, aerosols,
and small business, as discussed in Section X). Manufacturers of F/FAs registered as of the effective date of this
rule must submit the 
additional basic registration data items to EPA within six months of that date. Other manufacturers are strongly
encouraged to submit the basic registration data prior to starting the evaluation tiers (i.e., Tier 1, Tier 2, and/or
Tier 3). 

The production volume information is to be reported in units of gallons per year for F/FA products that are generally
sold in liquid form and kilograms per year for F/FA products that are generally sold in solid form. For F/FAs already
in production, the submitted figure must reflect the most recent annual period as well as the volume projected to be
produced in the third subsequent year. For products not yet in production, the best estimate of expected total production
volume during the third year of production must be provided. Market distribution data for each product must also be
provided. For fuels and bulk additives, the distribution data must be reported as the 
percent of total annual sales volume marketed in each Petroleum Administration for Defense District (PADD), as defined
in  79.59(b)(3) of this rule. For aftermarket additives, the distribution data must be reported as the percent
of total annual sales volume marketed in each state. For products not yet in 
production, the manufacturer must report projected distribution data by PADD or state, as applicable. 

Manufacturers of F/FAs registered as of the effective date of this rule who intend to comply with registration requirements
as part of a group must identify the person or entity which is organizing the testing for the applicable group. Similarly,
if an applicant is relying on another manufacturer's (or group's) previous registration materials in compliance
with the testing requirements for an unregistered product, then the other manufacturer or group must be identified.
In addition, the manufacturer of the unregistered product must provide evidence that the original submitter has
been notified and that reimbursement will occur. 

The basic registration data must be submitted (or resubmitted) individually for 

each

 product being registered, using EPA forms which are in effect at the time of the submittal. This requirement pertains
to all F/FA products registered as of the effective date of this rule, including relabeled products, as well as those
for which first-time registration is sought after promulgation of this rule. If the basic registration data previously
submitted for a currently registered fuel or additive is accurate and complete, then a statement asserting that this
is so will suffice in lieu of the submittal of duplicate information. A finding by EPA that this 
information is not, in fact, accurate and complete as claimed will result in the report being considered inadequate.


A fuel manufacturer may at any time modify an existing fuel registration by submitting a request to EPA to add or delete
a bulk additive to the existing registration information for such fuel product, provided that any additional additive
must be registered by EPA for use in the specific fuel family to which the fuel product belongs. The addition or deletion
of a bulk additive to a fuel registration does not necessarily cause the fuel to be considered ``new''. However, if
the change affects the grouping of such 
registered fuel, it may affect the testing responsibilities of the fuel manufacturer. 



B. Summary Report 



This report will provide a summary of the evaluation procedures, results, and conclusions, pertaining to Tier 1 and/or
Tier 2 requirements.
 References used to support Tier 1 and/or Tier 2 conclusions must be cited in the report. A cover page must be included,
identifying the test substance, the manufacturer's name and address, a designated contact person and phone number,
and grouping information (if applicable). The grouping information must identify the group name or grouping criteria,
all products and manufacturers 
to which the report pertains, and the name and address of the responsible organization or entity reporting for the
group. The body of the summary report must be divided into the following sections.

1. Executive Summary



This section must include a brief description of the general results and conclusions for the tier(s) included in the
report (i.e., Tier 1 and/or Tier 2), emphasizing information and test data which provide evidence for potential adverse
health and/or welfare effects.



2. Test Substance Information



This section must include a detailed test substance description, including (as applicable) base fuel parameter
values or test fuel composition (if other than base fuel), and test additive composition. The base fuel description
must include the types and concentrations of base fuel additive components and values for each of the parameters specified
in the base fuel definition for the applicable fuel family. Similar parameter values must be identified for test fuels
other than base fuels.



3. Tier 1 Summary



This section is intended to provide an overview of Tier 1 analyses. Detailed procedural descriptions, tables, and
other outputs are to be included in the appendices.

a. 

Literature Search.

 The search methods must be described, including the identity of data bases and time periods accessed. Any in-house
and/or other unpublished studies included in the literature search must also be described briefly. The results and
conclusions of the literature search with respect to potential health and welfare effects of the subject fuel or fuel
additive must be summarized. If test documentation provided by the literature search is used to satisfy some or all
of the other program requirements, the relevant studies must be discussed and their adequacy to fulfill the specific
purposes of the associated program requirements must be justified. Finally, the person(s) or contractors conducting
the search are to be identified.

b. 

Emission Generation and Characterization.

 This section of the summary report must identify the vehicle selected and describe the procedures followed in vehicle/engine
preparation and maintenance and in the generation, storage, and processing of emissions for testing. For group submissions,
the report must include a complete description of the group representative used in the generation of emissions. A
description of the analytic methods used to characterize the F/FA emission products must also be provided. Problems
encountered in generating and/or characterizing the emissions must be discussed, including attempts to resolve
the problems and their potential effects on testing outcomes. The laboratories performing these procedures must
be identified.

c. 

Exposure Analysis.

 This section must include a qualitative discussion on the potential exposures to the general, area-specific, and/or
special at-risk population groups based on the production and use of the particular fuel or additive in question.
For group submissions, the analysis must consider potential exposures due to all members of the group. When available,
EPA recommends the use of existing modeling data to support the exposure analysis.



4. Tier 2 Summary



For each study, the objectives, principles, and general procedures must be outlined and the findings and conclusions
summarized. Discussion must be included regarding problems encountered during the performance of the tests and
the methods used to resolve them. This discussion must include the impact which such problems may have had on the study
outcomes.



5. Conclusions



Further testing needs must be identified or else a discussion must be provided explaining why the results of Tiers
1 and/or Tier 2 should not trigger Tier 3 testing requirements.



C. Appendices



Detailed information in support of the general discussions contained in the summary report are to be submitted as
appendices to the report. In regard to the literature search, the appendices must contain (1) summary tables of existing
studies regarding health and environmental effects, including such information as the type of study, species/strain
used, exposure concentration(s), duration of study, endpoints evaluated, results (incidence and statistical
significance), and references, (2) a complete copy of reference lists and associated abstracts obtained from data
base searches (in printed form or on 31/2 inch (IBM compatible) computer diskettes), (3) complete documentation
of in-house studies and other unpublished information sources, and (4) complete documentation (e.g., copies of
journal articles) of previous studies which are being cited in satisfaction of Tier 1 and/or Tier 2 test requirements.
Appendices to the emission characterization section must contain detailed protocols, copies of all relevant laboratory
reports, a list of all speciated emission products and their emission rates, and documentation and results of calibration/verification
procedures. For the section that discusses potential exposures, an appendix must be provided for detailed background
information on the production volume and market distribution data used in the exposure analysis. If exposure models
are used, background calculations and/or model data must also be included in an appendix.

An appendix is also required for each of the tests conducted in compliance with Tier 2 requirements. These appendices
must contain the full detailed study protocol, complete laboratory report, statistical analysis of the findings,
and scientific conclusions. These materials must conform to the reporting requirements of the individual study
guidelines as well as the general standards for recordkeeping and reporting specified in the GLP standards of this
final rule (see  79.60). A final appendix must be provided, containing laboratory certifications and associated
personnel credentials.



D. Tier 3 Report



Reports for additional tests required under the Tier 3 provisions must include a cover page with identifying information
as described above for the Tier 1 and 2 summary report(s). The report must begin with a discussion of the concerns arising
under the previous tiers which led to the Tier 3 requirements, the specific objectives of the additional studies,
and a summary of pertinent results and conclusions. References used in support of Tier 3 conclusions must be cited
in the report. The Tier 3 summary discussion must be supported with appendices containing the kinds of documentation
discussed above with respect to Tier 2. The laboratory conducting the required tests must be identified, and relevant
certifications and personnel credentials provided.



E. Confidential Business Information



CAA section 211(b)(2)(B) states that the results of tests ``conducted in conformity with test procedures and protocols
established by the Administrator,'' pursuant to CAA section 211(b)(2)(A), shall not be considered confidential.
Thus, health and welfare information supplied to EPA in compliance with Tier 1, Tier 2, and Tier 3 testing requirements
will be made available to the public.

Manufacturers (or groups) claiming business confidentiality on any information submitted under the F/FA testing
program must make a claim of confidentiality in writing at the time of submittal of the reporting requirements. To
assert a business confidentiality claim the submitter must clearly mark the confidential information and must submit
a separate document setting forth the claim and listing each location at which the confidential information appears
in the submitted data. If any person subsequently requests access to the test data submitted under the F/FA testing
program (other than health and welfare effects information) and such information is subject to a claim of business
confidentiality, the request and any subsequent disclosure will be governed by the provisions of 40 CFR part 2.



XIII. Administrative Requirements



A. Administrative Designation and Regulatory Analysis



Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735), EPA must determine whether the regulatory action is ``significant'' and
therefore subject to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) review and the requirements of the Executive Order.
The Order defines ``economically significant regulatory action'' as one that is likely to result in a rule that may:
(1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector
of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal
governments or communities; (2) create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned
by another agency; (3) materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs
or the rights and obligations of recipients thereof; or (4) raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal
mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in the Executive Order.

A regulatory support document which presents EPA's analysis of the cost impacts of this final rule is available for
review in the public docket (A-90-07). EPA estimates that the costs to industry for submittal of the requisite
data for Tiers 1 and 2 would total approximately $66 million, assumed to be incurred over the first three-year period
after promulgation of this final rule. Thus, the average annual cost during this period would be about $22 million.
In the subsequent three years, Tier 3 requirements might cost an additional $1 million annually, per product or group.
If ten products or groups were required to conduct Tier 3 testing in the three-year period following the initial compliance
period, the cost would be $10 million per year. These projected overall costs are far less than the $100 million annual
cost criterion which is a major determinant in defining an ``economically significant regulatory action.'' In addition,
this final rule is not expected to adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity,
competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments or communities.

Although not ``economically significant'' based on the above criteria, this final rule is still considered a ``significant
regulatory action'' pursuant to the terms of Executive Order 12866 and was thus submitted to OMB for review. Any written
comments from OMB and any EPA response to OMB's comments are available in the public docket for this rule.



B. Regulatory Flexibility Act

Under section 605 of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 
601 

et seq.,

 the Administrator is required to assess the economic 
impact of regulatory actions on small businesses. Accordingly, a 
Regulatory Flexibility Analysis (RFA) has been prepared for this rule 
and is presented as part of the Regulatory Support Document 
(available in the public docket). The RFA compares the financial 
impacts of this rule on small F/FA manufacturers to the impacts on 
large F/FA manufacturers. The analysis explains the small business 
definition specifically developed in this rule to provide special 
provisions for small F/FA manufacturers (see Section X.D) and 
assesses the effectiveness of these provisions. 
This final rule defines a small business as any motor vehicle 
fuel or fuel additive manufacturer with total annual sales of less 
than $50 million. A comparison of companies classified as small 
under this definition to those classified as small by the Small 
Business Administration (SBA) reveals that the F/FA program 
definition classifies a larger number of F/FA manufacturers as small, 
and more closely groups companies with similar financial 
characteristics. Based on this analysis, EPA determined that the 
small business definition established in this rule is reasonable and 
applicable to the F/FA industry. 
Impacts of this rule on F/FA manufacturers were determined by 
projecting the effects of the estimated compliance costs on each 
company's return on assets (ROA). In general, a reduction in ROA 
(after compliance costs) to less than 2.5 percent is indicative of 
financial distress. A ROA less than ^4 percent indicates that a 
company is in severe financial distress, and a ROA less than ^30 
percent generally indicates closure. According to these ROA 
thresholds, results of the RFA show that approximately 68 unique F/FA 
manufacturers (43 additive manufacturers, 23 fuel manufacturers, and 
2 that produce both fuels and additives) could potentially be pushed 
into some level of financial distress. All of these companies are 
classified as small (i.e., have sales less than $50 million). The 
majority of these companies would fall into the first level of 
financial distress; however, less than one-fifth of them (12 
companies) would potentially be in danger of closure. In relation to 
the total population of F/FA manufacturers, the companies potentially 
falling into some level of financial distress account to about six 
percent, with about 1.2 percent potentially in danger of closure. 
As previously described, this final rule includes two types of 
special provisions for small businesses. With respect to baseline 
and non-baseline F/FAs, all small manufacturers (i.e., annual sales 
under $50 million) are excused from all Tier 1 and Tier 2 testing 
requirements. A segment of these small manufacturers, i.e., those 
having sales under $10 million, are also excused from Tier 2 testing 
responsibility for their atypical F/FAs. Nevertheless, all twelve of 
the manufacturers who are projected to be in danger of closure as a 
result of this rule are very small companies with one or more 
atypical F/FAs. The RFA analysis shows that the special provision 
for small manufacturers with atypical products lowers overall 
compliance costs for 60 such manufacturers by roughly $20 million 
(as compared with costs that would otherwise occur in the 
absence of this special provision). Without this provision, an 
additional 15 manufacturers of atypical products would potentially be 
pushed into closure. 
It should be noted that the RFA has assumed no changes in 
prices, sales, product mix, or financial strategies. In many cases, 
a portion of regulatory costs can be actually passed on to consumers 
or back to suppliers. Manufacturers also have the option of 
reformulating a product to a ``baseline'' standard which has much lower 
compliance costs, or even of dropping products with the greatest cost 
and smallest profit potential. A more detailed discussion on 
circumstances which could mitigate compliance cost impacts is 
provided in the RFA. 


C. Recordkeeping Requirements 
 

The information collection requirements in this rule have been 
submitted for approval to OMB under the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 
U.S.C. 3501 

et seq.

 An Information Collection Request document has 
been prepared by EPA (ICR 

#

1696.01) and a copy may be obtained from

 79.51

General requirements and provisions. 


(a) 

Overview of requirements. 

(1) All manufacturers of fuels and fuel additives that are 
designated for registration under this part are required to 
comply with the requirements of subpart F of this part 
either on an individual basis or as a participant in a group of 
manufacturers of the same or similar fuels and fuel additives, as 
defined in  79.56. If manufacturers elect to comply by 
participation in a group, each manufacturer continues to be 
individually subject to the requirements of subpart F of this 
part, and responsible for testing under this subpart. Each 
manufacturer, subject to the provisions for group applications in 
 79.51(b) and the special provisions in  79.58, shall submit 
all Tier 1 and Tier 2 information required by   79.52, 79.53 and 
79.59 for each fuel or additive, except that the Tier 1 emission 
characterization requirements in  79.52(b) and/or the Tier 2 
testing requirements in  79.53 may be satisfied by adequate 
existing information pursuant to the Tier 1 literature search 
requirements in  79.52(d). The adequacy of existing information 
to serve in compliance with specific Tier 1 and/or Tier 2 
requirements shall be determined according to the criteria and 
procedures specified in   79.52(b) and 79.53 (c) and (d). In all 
cases, EPA reserves the right to require, based upon the 
information contained in the application or any other information 
available to the Agency, that manufacturers conduct additional 
testing of any fuel or additive (or fuel/additive group) if EPA 
determines that there is inadequate information upon which to 
base regulatory decisions for such product(s). In any case where 
EPA determines that the requirements of Tiers 1 and 2 have been 
satisfied but that further testing is required, the provisions of 
Tier 3 ( 79.54) shall apply. 
(2) Laboratory facilities shall perform testing in 
compliance with Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) requirements as 
those requirements apply to inhalation toxicology studies. All 
studies shall be monitored by the facilities' Quality Assurance 
units (as specified in  79.60). 
(b) 

Group Applications. 

Subject to the provisions of  79.56 (a) through (c), EPA will consider any testing requirements 
of this subpart to have been met for any fuel or fuel additive 
when a fuel or fuel additive which meets the criteria for 
inclusion in the same group as the subject fuel or fuel additive 
has met that testing requirement, provided that all fuels and 
additives must be individually registered as described in  79.59(b). For purposes of this subpart, a determination
of which 
group contains a particular fuel or additive will be made 
pursuant to the provisions of  79.56 (d) and (e). Nothing in 
this subsection (b) shall be deemed to require a manufacturer to 
rely on another manufacturer's testing. 
(c) 

Application Procedures and Dates. 

Each application 
submitted in compliance with this subpart shall be signed by the 
manufacturer of the designated fuel or additive, or by the 
manufacturer's agent, and shall be submitted to the address and 
in the format prescribed in  79.59. A manufacturer who chooses 
to comply as part of a group pursuant to  79.56 shall be covered 
by the group's joint application. Subject to any modifications 
pursuant to the special provisions in   79.51(f) or 79.58, the 
schedule for compliance with the requirements of this subpart is 
as follows: 
(1) 

Fuels and fuel additives with existing registrations. 


(i) The manufacturer of a fuel or fuel additive product 
which, pursuant to subpart B or C of this part, is registered as 
of May 27, 1994 must submit the additional basic registration 
data specified in  79.59(b) before November 28, 1994. 
(ii) For these products, the manufacturer must also satisfy 
the requirements and time schedules in either of the following 
paragraphs (c)(1)(ii) (A) or (B) of this section: 
(A) Within May 27, 1997, all applicable Tier 1 and Tier 2 
requirements must be submitted to EPA, pursuant to   79.52, 
79.53, and 79.59; or 
(B) Within May 27, 1997, all applicable Tier 1 requirements 
(pursuant to   79.52 and 79.59), plus evidence of a contract 
with a qualified laboratory (or other suitable arrangement) for 
completion of all applicable Tier 2 requirements, must be 
submitted to EPA. For this purpose, a qualified laboratory is 
one which can demonstrate the capabilities and credentials 
specified in  79.53(c)(1). In addition, within May 26, 2000, 
all applicable Tier 2 requirements (pursuant to   79.53 and 
79.59) must be submitted to EPA.

<TEXT>
 

(iii) In the case of such fuels and fuel additives which, 
pursuant to applicable special provisions in  79.58, are not 
subject to Tier 2 requirements, all other requirements (except 
Tier 3) must be submitted to EPA before May 27, 1997. 
(iv) In the event that Tier 3 testing is also required 
(under  79.54), EPA shall determine an appropriate timeline for 
completion of the additional requirements and shall communicate 
this schedule to the manufacturer according to the provisions of 
 79.54(b). 
(v) The manufacturer may at any time modify an existing fuel 
registration by submitting a request to EPA to add or delete a 
bulk additive to the existing registration information for such 
fuel product, provided that any additional additive must be 
registered by EPA for use in the specific fuel family to which 
the fuel product belongs. However, the addition or deletion of a 
bulk additive to a fuel registration may effect the grouping of 
such registered fuel under the criteria of  79.56, and thus may 
effect the testing responsibilities of the fuel manufacturer 
under this subpart. 
(2) 

Registrable fuels and fuel additives. 

(i) A fuel product which is not registered pursuant to 
subpart B of this part as of May 27, 1994 shall be considered 
registrable if, under the criteria established by  79.56, the 
fuel can be enrolled in the same fuel/additive group with one or 
more currently registered fuels. A fuel additive product which 
is not registered for a specific type of fuel pursuant to subpart 
C of this part as of May 27, 1994 shall be considered registrable 
for that type of fuel if, under the criteria established by  
79.56, the fuel/additive mixture resulting from use of the 
additive product in the specific type of fuel can be enrolled in 
the same fuel/additive group with one or more currently 
registered fuels or bulk fuel additives. For the purpose of this 
determination, currently registered fuels and bulk additives are 
those with existing registrations as of the date on which EPA 
receives the basic registration data (pursuant to  79.59(b)) for 
the product in question. 
(ii) A manufacturer seeking to register under subpart B of 
this part a fuel product which is deemed registrable under this 
section, or to register under subpart C of this part a fuel 
additive product for a specific type of fuel for which it is 
deemed registrable under this section, shall submit the basic 
registration data (pursuant to  79.59(b)) for that product as 
part of the application for registration. If the Administrator 
determines that the product is registrable under this section, 
then the Administrator shall promptly register the product, 
provided that the applicant has satisfied all of the other 
requirements for registration under subpart B or subpart C of 
this part, and contingent upon satisfactory submission of 
required information under paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section. 
(iii) Registration of a registrable fuel or additive shall 
be subject to the same requirements and compliance schedule as 
specified in paragraph (c)(1) of this section for existing fuels 
and fuel additives. Accordingly, manufacturers of registrable 
fuels or additives may be granted and may retain registration for 
such products only if any applicable and due Tier 1, 2, and 3 
requirements have also been satisfied by either the manufacturer 
of the product or the fuel/additive group to which the product 
belongs. 
(3) 

New fuels and fuel additives. 

A fuel product shall be 
considered new if it is not registered pursuant to subpart B of 
this part as of May 27, 1994 and if, under the criteria 
established by  79.56, it cannot be enrolled in the same 
fuel/additive group with one or more currently registered fuels. 
A fuel additive product shall be considered new with respect to a 
specific type of fuel if it is not expressly registered for that 
type of fuel pursuant to subpart C of this part as of May 27, 
1994 and if, under the criteria established by  79.56, the 
fuel/additive mixture resulting from use of the additive product 
in the specific type of fuel cannot be enrolled in the same 
fuel/additive group with one or more currently registered fuels 
or bulk fuel additives. For the purpose of this determination, 
currently registered fuels and bulk additives are those with 
existing registrations as of the date on which EPA receives the 
basic registration data (pursuant to  79.59(b)) for the product 
in question. For such new product, the manufacturer must 
satisfactorily complete all applicable Tier 1 and Tier 2 
requirements, followed by any Tier 3 testing which the 
Administrator may require, before registration will be granted. 
(d) 

Notifications. 

Upon receipt of a manufacturer's (or 
group's) submittal in compliance with the requirements of this 
subpart, EPA will notify such manufacturer (or group) that the 
application has been received and what, if any, information, 
testing, or retesting is necessary to bring the application into 
compliance with the requirements of this subpart. EPA intends 
to provide such notification of receipt in a timely manner for 
each such application. 
(1) 

Registered fuel and fuel additive notification. 


(i) The manufacturer of a registered fuel or fuel additive 
product who is notified that the submittal for such product 
contains adequate information pursuant to the Tier 1 and Tier 2 
testing and reporting requirements (  79.52, 79.53, and 79.59 (a) 
through (c)) may continue to sell, offer for sale, or introduce 
into commerce the registered product as permitted by the existing 
registration for the product under  79.4. 
(ii) If the manufacturer of a registered fuel or fuel 
additive product is notified that testing or retesting is 
necessary to bring the Tier 1 and/or Tier 2 submittal into 
compliance, the continued sale or importation of the product 
shall be conditional upon satisfactorily completing the 
requirements within the time frame specified in paragraph (c)(1) 
of this section. 
(iii) EPA intends to notify the manufacturer of the 
adequacy of the submitted data within two years of EPA's receipt 
of such data. However, EPA retains the right to require that 
adequate data be submitted to EPA if, upon subsequent review, EPA 
finds that the original Tier 1 and/or Tier 2 submittal is not 
consistent with the requirements of this subpart. If EPA does 
not notify the manufacturer of the adequacy of the Tier 1 and/or 
Tier 2 data within two years, EPA will not hold the manufacturer 
liable for penalties for violating this rule for the period 
beginning when the data was due until the time EPA notifies the 
manufacturer of the violation. 
(iv) If the manufacturer of a registered fuel or fuel 
additive product is notified (pursuant to  79.54(b)) that Tier 3 
testing is required for its product, then the manufacturer may 
continue to sell, offer for sale, introduce into commerce the 
registered product as permitted by the existing registration for 
the product under  79.4. However, if the manufacturer fails to 
complete the specified Tier 3 requirements within the specified 
time, the registration of the product will be subject to 
cancellation under  79.51(f)(6).

(v) EPA retains the right to require additional Tier 3 
testing pursuant to the procedures in  79.54. 
(2) 

New fuel and fuel additive notification. 

(i) Within six months following its receipt of the Tier 1 
and Tier 2 submittal for a new product (as defined in paragraph 
(c)(3) of this section), EPA shall notify the manufacturer of the 
adequacy of such submittal in compliance with the requirements of 
  79.52, 79.53, and 79.59 (a) through (c). 
(A) If EPA notifies the manufacturer that testing, 
retesting, or additional information is necessary to bring the 
Tier 1 and Tier 2 submittal into compliance, the manufacturer 
shall remedy all inadequacies and provide Tier 3 data, if 
required, before EPA shall consider the requirements for 
registration to have been met for the product in question. 
(B) If EPA does not notify the manufacturer of the adequacy 
of the Tier 1 and Tier 2 submittal within six months following 
the submittal, the manufacturer shall be deemed to have 
satisfactorily completed Tiers 1 and 2. 
(ii) Within six months of the date on which EPA notifies 
the manufacturer of satisfactory completion of Tiers 1 and 2 for 
a new product, or within one year of the submittal of the Tier 1 
and Tier 2 data (whichever is earlier), EPA shall determine 
whether additional testing is currently needed under the 
provisions of Tier 3 and, pursuant to  79.54(b), shall notify 
the manufacturer of its determination. 
(A) If the manufacturer of a new fuel or fuel additive 
product is notified that Tier 3 testing is required for such 
product, then EPA shall have the authority to withhold 
registration until the specified Tier 3 requirements have been 
satisfactorily completed. EPA shall determine whether the Tier 3 
requirements have been met, and shall notify the manufacturer of 
this determination, within one year of receiving the 
manufacturer's Tier 3 submittal. 
(B) If EPA does not notify the manufacturer of potential 
Tier 3 requirements within the prescribed timeframe, then 
additional testing at the Tier 3 level is deemed currently 
unnecessary and the manufacturer shall be considered to have 
complied with all current registration requirements for the new 
fuel or additive product. 
(iii) Upon completion of all current Tier 1, Tier 2, and 
Tier 3 requirements, and submission of an application for 
registration which includes all of the information and assurances 
required by  79.11 or  79.21, the registration of the new fuel 
or additive shall be granted, and the registrant may then sell, 
offer for sale, or introduce into commerce the registered product 
as permitted by  79.4. 
(iv) Once the new product becomes registered, EPA reserves 
the right to require additional Tier 3 testing pursuant to the 
procedures specified in  79.54. 
(e) 

Inspection of a testing facility. 

(1) A testing facility, emissions analysis or health and/or 
welfare effects, shall permit an authorized employee or duly 
designated representative of EPA, at reasonable times and in a 
reasonable manner, to inspect the facility and to inspect (and in 
the case of records also to copy) all records and specimens 
required to be maintained regarding studies to which this rule 
applies. The records inspection and copying requirements shall 
not apply to quality assurance unit records of findings and 
problems, or to actions recommended and taken, except the EPA may 
seek production of these records in litigation or informal 
hearings. 
(2) EPA will not consider reliable for purposes of showing 
that a test substance does or does not present a risk of injury 
to health or the environment any data developed by a testing 
facility or sponsor that refuses to permit inspection in 
accordance with this section. The determination that a study 
will not be considered reliable does not, however, relieve the 
sponsor of a required test of any obligation under any applicable 
statute or regulation to submit the results of the study to EPA.

(3) Effects of non-compliance. Pursuant to sections 114, 
208, and 211(d) of the CAA, it shall be a violation of this 
section and a violation of 40 CFR part 79, subpart F to deny 
entry to an authorized employee or duly designated representative 
of EPA for the purpose of auditing a testing facility or test 
data. 
(f) 

Penalties and Injunctive Relief. 

(1) Any person who violates these regulations shall be 
subject to a civil penalty of up to $25,000 for each and every 
day of the continuance of the violation and the economic benefit 
or savings resulting from the violation. Action to collect such 
civil penalties shall be commenced in accordance with paragraph 
(b) of section 205 of the Clean Air Act or assessed in accordance 
with paragraph (c) of section 205 of the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. 
7524 (b) and (c). 
(2) Under section 205(b) of the CAA, the Administrator may 
commence a civil action for violation of this subpart in the 
district court of the United States for the district in which the 
violation is alleged to have occurred or in which the defendant 
resides or has a principal place of business. 
(3) Under section 205(c) of the CAA, the Administrator may 
assess a civil penalty of $25,000 for each and every day of the 
continuance of the violation and the economic benefit or savings 
resulting from the violation, except that the maximum penalty 
assessment shall not exceed $200,000, unless the Administrator 
and the Attorney General jointly determine that a matter 
involving a larger penalty amount is appropriate for 
administrative penalty assessment. Any such determination by the 
Administrator and the Attorney General shall not be subject to 
judicial review. 
(4) The Administrator may, upon application by the person 
against whom any such penalty has been assessed, remit or 
mitigate, with or without conditions, any such penalty. 
(5) The district courts of the United States shall have 
jurisdiction to compel the furnishing of information and the 
conduct of tests required by the Administrator under these 
regulations and to award other appropriate relief. Actions to 
compel such actions shall be brought by and in the name of the 
United States. In any such action, subpoenas for witnesses who 
are required to attend a district court in any district may run 
into any other district. 
(6) Cancellation. 
(i) The Administrator of EPA may issue a notice of intent 
to cancel a fuel or fuel additive registration if the 
Administrator determines that the registrant has failed to submit 
in a timely manner any data required to maintain registration 
under this part or under section 211(b) or 211(e) of the Clean 
Air Act.

(ii) Upon issuance of a notice of intent to cancel, EPA will forward a copy of the notice to the registrant by certified
mail, return receipt requested, at the address of record given in the registration, along with an explanation of the
reasons for the proposed cancellation.

(iii) The registrant will be afforded 60 days from the date of receipt of the notice of intent to cancel to submit written
comments concerning the notice, and to demonstrate or achieve compliance with the specific data requirements which
provide the basis for the proposed cancellation. If the registrant does not respond in writing within 60 days from
the date of receipt of the notice of intent to cancel, the cancellation of the registration shall become final by operation
of law and the Administrator shall notify the registrant of such cancellation. If the registrant responds in writing
within 60 days from the date of receipt of the notice of intent to cancel, the Administrator shall review and consider
all comments submitted by the registrant before taking final action concerning the proposed cancellation. The registrants'
communications should be sent to the following address: Director, Field Operations and Support Division, 6406J_Fuel/Additives
Registration, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M Street SW., Washington, DC 20460.

(iv) As part of a written response to a notice of intent to cancel, a registrant may request an informal hearing concerning
the notice. Any such request shall state with specificity the information the registrant wishes to present at such
a hearing. If an informal hearing is requested, EPA shall schedule such a hearing within 60 days from the date of receipt
of the request. If an informal hearing is held, the subject matter of the hearing shall be confined solely to whether
or not the registrant has complied with the specific data requirements which provide the basis for the proposed cancellation.
If an informal hearing is held, the designated presiding officer may be any EPA employee, the hearing procedures shall
be informal, and the hearing shall not be subject to or governed by 40 CFR part 22 or by 5 U.S.C. 554, 556, or 557. A verbatim
transcript of each informal hearing shall be kept and the Administrator shall consider all relevant evidence and
arguments presented at the hearing in making a final decision concerning a proposed cancellation.

(v) If a registrant who has received a notice of intent to cancel submits a timely written response, and the Administrator
decides after reviewing the response and the transcript of any informal hearing to cancel the registration, the Administrator
shall issue a final cancellation order, forward a copy of the cancellation order to the registrant by certified mail,
and promptly publish the cancellation order in the 

Federal Register

. Any cancellation order issued after receipt of a timely written response by the registrant shall become legally
effective five days after it is published in the 

Federal Register

.

(g) 

Modification of Regulation.

 (1) In special circumstances, a manufacturer subject to the registration requirements of this rule may petition
the Administrator to modify the mandatory testing requirements in the test standard for any test required by this
rule by application to Director, Field Operations and Support Division, at the address in paragraph (f)(6)(iii)
of this section.

(i) Such request shall be made as soon as the test sponsor is aware that the modification is necessary, but in no event
shall the request be made after 30 days following the event which precipitated the request.

(ii) Upon such request, the Administrator may, in circumstances which are outside the control of the manufacturer(s)
or his/their agent and which could not have been reasonably foreseen or avoided, modify the mandatory testing requirements
in the rule if such requirements are infeasible.

(iii) If the Administrator determines that such modifications would not significantly alter the scope of the test,
EPA will not ask for public comment before approving the modification. The Administrator will notify the test sponsor
by certified mail of the response to the request. EPA will place copies of each application and EPA response in the public
docket. EPA will publish a notice in the 

Federal Register

 annually describing such changes which have occurred during the previous year. Until such 

Federal Register

 notice is published, any modification approved by EPA shall apply only to the person or group who requested the modification;
EPA shall state the applicability of each modification in such notice.

(iv) Where, in EPA's judgment, the requested modification of a test standard would significantly change the scope
of the test, EPA will publish a notice in the 

Federal Register

 requesting comment on the request and proposed modification. However, EPA may approve a requested modification
of a test standard without first seeking public comment if necessary to preserve the validity of an ongoing test undertaken
in good faith.

(2) [Reserved]

(h) 

Special Requirements for Additives.

 An additive which is a direct test subject, either because it is the chosen representative of a group or because it is
not a member of a group, is subject to the following rules:

(1) All required emission characterization and health effects testing procedures shall be performed on the mixture
which results when the additive is combined with the base fuel for the appropriate fuel family (as specified in  79.55)
at the maximum concentration recommended by the additive manufacturer pursuant to  79.21(d). This combination
shall be known as the additive/base fuel mixture.

(i) The appropriate fuel family to be utilized for the additive/base fuel mixture is the fuel family which contains
the specific type(s) of fuel for which the additive is presently registered or for which the manufacturer of the additive
is seeking registration.

(ii) Fuels and additives belonging to more than one fuel family.

(A) If a fuel or additive product is registered in two or more fuel families as of May 27, 1994, then the manufacturer
of that product is responsible for testing (or participating in group testing of) each formulation in compliance
with the requirements of this subpart for each fuel family in which the manufacturer wishes to maintain a product registration
for its fuel or additive.

(B) If a fuel or additive manufacturer is seeking to register such product in two or more fuel families, then the product
shall be considered, for testing and registration purposes, to be a member of each fuel family in which the manufacturer
is seeking registration. The manufacturer is responsible for testing (or participating in group testing of) each
formulation in compliance with the requirements of this subpart for each fuel family in which the manufacturer wishes
to obtain a product registration for its fuel or additive.

(iii) In the case of the methanol fuel family, which contains two base fuels (M100 and M85 base fuels, pursuant to  
79.55(d)), the applicable base fuel is the one which represents the fuel/additive group (specified in  79.56(e)(4)(i)(C))
containing fuels of which the most gallons are sold annually.

(iv) Aftermarket additives which are intended by the manufacturer to be added to the fuel tank only at infrequent intervals
shall be applied according to the manufacturer's specifications during mileage accumulation, pursuant to  79.57(c).
However, during emission generation and testing, each tankful of fuel used must contain the fuel additive at its maximum
recommended level. If the additive manufacturer believes that this maximum treatment rate will cause adverse effects
to the test engine and/or that the engine's emissions may be subject to artifacts due to overuse of the additive, then
the manufacturer may submit a request to EPA for modification of this requirement and related test procedures. Such
request must include objective evidence that the modification(s) are needed, along with data demonstrating the
maximum concentration of the additive which may actually reach the fuel tanks of vehicles in use.

<TEXT>
 

(v) Additives produced exclusively for use in 

#

1 diesel fuel shall be tested in the diesel base fuel specified in  79.55(c), even though that base fuel is formulated
with 

#

2 diesel fuel. If a manufacturer is concerned that emissions generated from this combination of fuel and additive
are subject to artifacts due to this blending, then that manufacturer may submit a request for a modification in test
procedure requirements to the EPA. Any such request must include supporting test results and suggested test modifications.

(vi) Bulk additives which are used intermittently for the direct purpose of conditioning or treating a fuel during
storage or transport, or for treating or maintaining the storage, pipeline, and/or other components of the fuel distribution
system itself and not the vehicle/engine for which the fuel is ultimately intended, shall, for purposes of this program,
be added to the base fuel at the maximum concentration recommended by the additive manufacturer for treatment of the
fuel or distribution system component. However, if the additive manufacturer believes that this treatment rate
will cause adverse effects to the test engine and/or that the engine's emissions may be subject to artifacts due to
overuse of the additive, then the manufacturer may submit a request to EPA for modification of this requirement and
related test procedures. Such request must include objective evidence that the modification(s) are needed, along
with data demonstrating the maximum concentration of the additive which may actually reach the fuel tanks of vehicles
in use.

(2) EPA shall use emissions speciation and health effects data generated in the analysis of the applicable base fuel
as control data for comparison with data generated for the additive/base fuel mixture.

(i) The base fuel control data may be:

(A) Generated internally as an experimental control in conjunction with testing done in compliance with registration
requirements for a specific additive; or

(B) Generated externally in the course of testing different additive(s) belonging to the same fuel family, or in the
testing of a base fuel serving as representative of the baseline group for the respective fuel family pursuant to  79.56(e)(4)(i).

(ii) Control data generated using test equipment (including vehicle model and/or engine, or Evaporative Emissions
Generator specifications, as appropriate) and protocols identical or nearly identical to those used in emissions
and health effects testing of the subject additive/base fuel mixture would be most relevant for comparison purposes.

(iii) If an additive manufacturer chooses the same vehicle/engine to independently test the base fuel as an experimental
control prior to testing the additive/base fuel mixture, then the test vehicle/engine shall undergo two mileage
accumulation periods, pursuant to  79.57(c). The initial mileage accumulation period shall be performed
using the base fuel alone. After base fuel testing, and prior to testing of the additive/base fuel mixture, a second
mileage accumulation period shall be performed using the additive/base fuel mixture. The procedures outlined in
this paragraph shall not preclude a manufacturer from testing a base fuel and the manufacturer's additive/base fuel
mixture separately in identical, or nearly identical, vehicles/engines.

(i) 

Multiple Test Potential for Non-Baseline Products.

 (1) When the composition information reported in the registration application or basic registration data for a gasoline
or diesel product meets criteria for classification as a non-baseline product (pursuant to  79.56(e)(3)(i)(B)
or  79.56(e)(3)(ii)(B)), then the manufacturer is responsible for testing (or participating in group testing)
of a separate formulation for each reported oxygenating compound, specified class of oxygenating compounds, or
other substance which defines a separate non-baseline fuel/additive group pursuant to  79.56(e)(4)(ii)(A)
or (B). For each such substance, testing shall be performed on a mixture of the relevant substance in the appropriate
base fuel, formulated according to the specifications for the corresponding group representatives in  79.56(e)(4)(ii).

(2) When the composition information reported in the registration application or basic registration data for a non-
baseline gasoline product contains a range of total oxygenate concentration-in-use which encompasses gasoline
formulations with less than 1.5 weight percent oxygen as well as gasoline formulations with 1.5 weight percent oxygen
or more, then the manufacturer is required to test (or participate in applicable group testing of) a baseline gasoline
formulation as well as one or more non-baseline gasoline formulations as described in paragraph (h)(1) of this section.

(3) When the composition information reported in the registration application or basic registration data for a non-
baseline diesel product contains a range of total oxygenate concentration-in-use which encompasses diesel formulations
with less than 1.0 weight percent oxygen as well as diesel formulations with 1.0 weight percent oxygen or more, then
the manufacturer is required to test (or participate in applicable group testing) of a baseline diesel formulation
as well as one or more non-baseline diesel formulations as described in paragraph (h)(1) of this section.

(j) 

Multiple Test Potential for Atypical Fuel Formulations.

 When the composition information reported in the registration application or basic registration data for a fuel
product includes more than one atypical bulk additive product (pursuant to  79.56(e)(2)(iii)), and when these
additives belong to different fuel/additive groups (pursuant to  79.56(e)(4)(iii)), then:

(1) When such disparate additive products are for the same 
purpose-in-use and are not ordinarily used in the fuel 
simultaneously, the fuel manufacturer shall be responsible for 
testing (or participating in the group testing of) a separate 
formulation for each such additive product. Testing related to 
each additive product shall be performed on a mixture of the 
additive in the applicable base fuel, as described in paragraph 
(g)(1) of this section, or by participation in the costs of 
testing the designated representative of the fuel/additive group 
to which each separate atypical additive product belongs. 

(2) When the disparate additive products are not for the 
same purpose-in-use, the fuel manufacturer shall nevertheless be 
responsible for testing a separate formulation for each such 
additive product, as described in paragraph (g)(1) of this 
section, if these additives are not ordinarily blended together 
in the same commercial formulation of the fuel. 
(3) When the disparate additive products are ordinarily 
blended together in the same commercial formulation of the fuel, 
then the fuel manufacturer shall be responsible for the testing 
of a single test formulation containing all such simultaneously 
used atypical additive products. Alternatively, this 
responsibility can be satisfied by enrolling such fuel product in 
a group which includes other fuel or additive products with the 
same total combination of atypical elements as that occurring in 
the fuel product in question. If the basic registration data for 
the subject fuel includes any alternative additives which contain 
atypical elements not represented in the test formulation, then 
the fuel manufacturer is also responsible for testing a separate 
formulation for each such additional disparate additive product. 
(k) 

Emission Control System Testing. 

If any information 
submitted in accordance with this subpart or any other 
information available to EPA shows that a fuel or fuel additive 
may have a deleterious effect on the performance of any emission 
control system or device currently in use or which has been 
developed to a point where in a reasonable time it would be in 
general use were such effect avoided, EPA may, in its judgment, 
require testing to determine whether such effects in fact exist. 
Such testing will be required in accordance with such protocols 
and schedules as the Administrator shall reasonably require and 
shall be paid for by the fuel or fuel additive manufacturer. 


 79.52 


Tier 1. 


(a) 

General Specifications. 

Tier 1 requires manufacturers 
of designated fuels or fuel additives (or groups of manufacturers 
pursuant to  79.56) to supply to the Administrator: the identity 
and concentration of certain emission products of such fuels or 
additives; an analysis of potential emissions exposures; and any 
available information regarding the health and welfare effects of 
the whole and speciated emissions. In addition to any 
information required under  79.59 and in conformance with the 
reporting requirements thereof, manufacturers shall provide, 
pursuant to the timing provisions of  79.51(c), the following 
information. 
(b) 

Emissions Characterization. 

Manufacturers must provide 
a characterization of the emission products which are generated 
by evaporation (if required pursuant to  79.58(b)) and by 
combustion of the fuel or additive/base fuel mixture in a motor 
vehicle. For this purpose, manufacturers may perform the 
characterization procedures described in this section or may rely 
on existing emission characterization data. To be considered 
adequate in lieu of performing new emission characterization 
procedures, the data must be the result of tests using the 
product in question or using a fuel or additive/base fuel mixture 
meeting the same grouping criteria as the product in question. 
In addition, the emissions must be generated in a manner 
reasonably similar to those described in  79.57, and the 
characterization procedures must be adequately performed and 
documented and must give results reasonably comparable to those 
which would be obtained by performing the procedures described 
herein. Reports of previous tests must be sufficiently detailed 
to allow EPA to judge the adequacy of protocols, techniques, and 
conclusions. After the manufacturer's submittal of such data, if 
EPA finds that the manufacturer has relied upon inadequate test 
data, then the manufacturer will not be considered to be in 
compliance until the corresponding tests have been conducted and 
the results submitted to EPA. 
(1) 

General Provisions. 
(i) The emissions to be characterized shall be generated, 
collected, and stored according to the processes described in  79.57. Characterization of combustion and
evaporative emissions 
shall be performed separately on each emission sample collected 
during the applicable emission generation procedure. 
(ii) As provided in  79.57(d), if the emission generation 
vehicle/engine is ordinarily equipped with an emission 
aftertreatment device, then all requirements in this section for 
the characterization of combustion emissions must be completed 
both with and without the aftertreatment device in a functional 
state. The emissions shall be generated three times (on three 
different days) without a functional aftertreatment device and, 
if applicable, three times (on three different days) with a 
functional aftertreatment device, and each such time shall be 
analyzed according to the remaining provisions in this paragraph 
(b) of this section. 

(iii) Measurement of background emissions. It is required 
that ambient/dilution air be analyzed for levels of background 
chemical species present at the time of emission sampling (for 
both combustion and evaporative emissions) and that background 
chemical species profiles be reported with emissions speciation 
data. Background chemical species measurement/analysis during 
the FTP is specified in   86.109-94(c)(5) and 86.135-94 of this 
chapter.

(iv) Concentrations of emission products shall be reported 
in units of grams (g) per mile and in units of weight percent of 
measured total hydrocarbons. 
(v) Laboratory practice must be of high quality and must be 
consistent with state-of-the-art methods as presented in current 
environmental and analytical chemistry literature. Examples of 
analytical procedures which may be used in conducting the 
emission characterization/speciation requirements of this section 
can be found among the references in paragraph (b)(5) of this 
section. 
(2) Characterization of the combustion emissions shall 
include, for products in all fuel families (except when expressly 
noted in this section): 
(i) Determination of the concentration of the basic 
emissions as follows: total hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, oxides 
of nitrogen, and particulates. Manufacturers are referred to the 
vehicle certification procedures in 40 CFR part 86, subparts B 
and D (  86.101 through 86.145 and   86.301 through 86.348) for 
guidance on the measurement of the basic emissions of interest to 
this subpart. 
(ii) Characterization of the vapor phase of combustion 
emissions, as follows: 
(A) Determination of the identity and concentration of 
individual species of hydrocarbon compounds containing 12 or 
fewer carbon atoms. Such characterization shall begin within 30 
minutes after emission collection is completed. 
(B) Determination of the identity and concentration of 
individual species of aldehyde and ketone compounds containing 
eight or fewer carbon atoms. Characterization of these emissions 
captured in cartridges shall be performed within two weeks if the 
cartridge is stored at room temperature, and one month if the 
cartridge is stored at 0 
 C or less. If the emissions are sampled 
using the impinger method, the sample must be stored in a capped 
sample vial at 0 
 C or less and characterized within one week. 
(C) Determination of the identity and concentration of 
individual species of alcohol and ether compounds containing six 
or fewer carbon atoms, for those fuels and additive/base fuel 
mixtures which contain alcohol and/or ether compounds containing 
from one to six carbon atoms in the uncombusted state. For fuel 
and additive formulations containing alcohols or ethers with more 
than six carbon atoms in the uncombusted state, alcohol and ether 
species with that higher number of carbon atoms or less must be 
identified and measured in the emissions. Such characterization 
shall begin within four hours after emission collection is 
completed. 
(iii) Characterization of the semi-volatile and particulate 
phases of combustion emissions to identify and measure polycyclic 
aromatic compounds, as follows: 
(A) Analysis for polycyclic aromatic compounds shall not 
be conducted at or soon after the start of a recommended engine 
lubricant change interval. 
(B) Analysis for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) 
and nitrated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (NPAHs), specified 
in paragraph (b)(2)(iii)(D) of this section, need not be done for 
any fuels and additives in the methane or propane fuel families, 
nor for fuels and additives in the atypical categories of any 
other fuel families, pursuant to the definitions of such families 
and categories in  79.56. 
(C) Analysis for poly-chlorinated dibenzodioxins and 
dibenzofurans (PCDD/PCDFs), specified in paragraph (b)(2)(iii)(E) 
of this section, is required only for fuels and additives which 
contain chlorine as an atypical element, pursuant to paragraph 
(b)(2)(iv) of this section, which requires all individual 
emission products containing atypical elements to be determined 
for atypical fuels and additives. However, manufacturers of 
baseline and nonbaseline fuels and fuel additives in all fuel 
families, except those in the methane and propane fuel families, 
are strongly encouraged to conduct these analyses on a voluntary 
basis.

specified in this section shall conduct calibration testing of 
their emissions characterization equipment before each new 
fuel/additive product test start-up. Known samples 
representative of the compounds potentially to be found in 
emissions from the product to be characterized shall be used to 
calibrate such equipment. 
(ii) Laboratories performing the procedures specified in 
this section shall agree to permit quality control inspections by 
EPA, and for this purpose shall admit any EPA Enforcement 
Officer, upon proper presentation of credentials, to any facility 
where vehicles are conditioned or where emissions are generated, 
collected, stored, sampled, or characterized in meeting the 
requirements of this section. Such laboratory audits may include 
EPA distribution of ``blind'' samples for analysis by participating 
laboratories.

Exposure Analysis. 

Using annual and projected 
production volume, marketing, and distribution data submitted as 
part of the basic registration data, specified in  79.59(b), 
manufacturers shall provide a qualitative discussion of the 
potential public health exposure(s) of the general population and 
any special at-risk populations to the emission products of their 
fuel or additive product(s). The analysis accompanying a group 
submission shall address the characteristics of the cumulative 
exposure resulting from the use of all fuel or additive products 
in the group. Modeling and other quantitative approaches to the 
analysis are encouraged when the appropriate data is available. 
(d) 

Literature Search. 

(1) Manufacturers of fuels and fuel additives shall conduct 
a literature search and compilation of information on the 
potential toxicologic, environmental, and other public welfare 
effects of the emissions of such fuels and additives. The 
literature search shall include all available relevant 
information from in-house, industry, government, and public 
sources pertaining to the emissions of the subject fuel or fuel 
additive or the emissions of similar fuels or additives, with 
such similarity determined according to the provisions of  79.56. 
 
(2) The literature search shall address the potential 
adverse effects of whole combustion emissions, evaporative 
emissions, relevant emission fractions, and individual emission 
products of the subject fuel or fuel additive except as specified 
in the following paragraph. The individual emission products to 
be included are those identified pursuant to the emission 
characterization procedures specified in paragraph (b) of this 
section, other than carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, nitrogen 
oxides, benzene, 1,3-butadiene, acetaldehyde, and formaldehyde. 
(3) In the case of the individual emission products of non-baseline or atypical fuels and additives (pursuant to  79.56(e)(2)),
the literature data need not be submitted for those 
emission products which are the same as the combustion emission 
products of the respective base fuel for the product's fuel 
family (pursuant to  79.55). For this purpose, data on the base 
fuel emission products for the product's fuel family: 
(i) May be found in the literature of previously-conducted, 
adequate emission speciation studies for the base fuel, or for a 
fuel or additive/fuel mixture capable of grouping with the base 
fuel (see, for example, the references in paragraph (b)(5) of 
this section).

(ii) May be compiled while gathering internal control data 
during emissions characterization studies on the manufacturer's 
non-baseline or atypical product; or 

(iii) May be obtained from various manufacturers in the 
course of their testing different additive(s) belonging to the 
same fuel family, or in the testing of a base fuel serving as 
representative of the baseline group for the respective fuel 
family. 

(e) 

Data bases. 

The literature search must include the 
results of searching appropriate commercially available chemical, 
toxicologic, and environmental databases. The databases shall be 
searched using, at a minimum, CAS numbers (when applicable), 
chemical names, and common synonyms. 

(f) 

Search period. 

The literature search shall cover a 
time period beginning at least thirty years prior to the date of 
submission of the reports specified in   79.59(b) through (c) and 
ending no earlier than six months prior to the date on which 
testing is commenced or reports are submitted in compliance with 
this subpart.

Tier 2. 



(a) 

Generally. 

Subject to the provisions of  79.53(b) 
through (d), the combustion emissions of each fuel or fuel 
additive subject to testing under this subpart must be tested in 
accordance with each of the testing guidelines in   79.60 
through 79.68, except that fuels and additives in the methane and 
propane fuel families (pursuant to  79.56(e)(1)(v) and (vi)) 
need not undergo the Salmonella mutagenicity assay in  79.68). 
Similarly, subject to the provisions of  79.53(b) through (d), 
the evaporative emissions of each designated evaporative fuel and 
each designated evaporative fuel additive subject to testing 
under this subpart must be tested according to each of the 
testing guidelines in   79.60 through 79.67 (excluding  79.68, 


Salmonella typhimurium

 Reverse Mutation Assay).

(b) 

Manufacturer Determination. 

Manufacturers shall 
determine whether the information gathered pursuant to the 
literature search in  79.52(d) contains the results of 
adequately performed and adequately documented previous testing 
which provides information reasonably comparable to that supplied 
by the health tests described in   79.62 through 79.68 regarding 
the carcinogenicity, mutagenicity, neurotoxicity, teratogenicity, 
reproductive/fertility measures, and general toxicity effects of 
the emissions of the fuel or additive. When manufacturers make 
an affirmative determination, they need submit only the 
information gathered pursuant to  79.52(d) for such tests. EPA 
maintains final authority in judging whether the information is 
an adequate substitution in lieu of conducting the associated 
tests. EPA's determination of the adequacy of existing 
information shall be guided by the considerations described in 
paragraph (d) of this section. If EPA finds that the 
manufacturer has relied upon inadequate test data, then the 
manufacturer will not be considered to be in compliance until the 
corresponding tests have been conducted and the results submitted 
to EPA. 

(c) 

Testing. 

(1) All testing required pursuant to this section must be done in accordance with the procedures, equipment, and facility

requirements described in   79.57, 79.60, and 79.61 regarding 
emissions generation, good laboratory practices, and inhalation 
exposure testing, respectively, as well as any other requirements 
described in this subpart. The laboratory conducting the animal 
studies shall be registered and in good standing with the United 
States Department of Agriculture and regularly inspected by 
United States Department of Agriculture veterinarians. In 
addition, the facility must be accredited by a generally 
recognized independent organization which sets laboratory animal 
care standards. Use of inadequate test protocols or substandard 
laboratory techniques in performing any testing required by this 
subpart may result in cancellation of all affected registrations. 

(2) Carcinogenic or mutagenic effects in animals from 
emissions exposures shall be determined pursuant to  79.64 

In 
vivo

 Micronucleus Assay,  79.65 

In vivo

 Sister Chromatid 
Exchange Assay, and  79.68 

Salmonella typhimurium

 Reverse 
Mutation Assay. Teratogenic effects and reproductive toxicity 
shall be examined pursuant to  79.63 Fertility 
Assessment/Teratology. General toxicity and pulmonary effects 
shall be determined pursuant to  79.62 Subchronic Toxicity Study 
with Specific Health Effect Assessments. Neurotoxic effects 
shall be determined pursuant to  79.66 Neuropathology Assessment 
and  79.67 Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein Assay. 

(d) 

EPA Determination.

 (1) After submission of all information and testing, EPA in its judgment shall determine whether previously conducted
tests relied upon in the registration submission are adequately 
performed and documented and provide information reasonably 
comparable to that which would be provided by the tests described 
herein. Manufacturers' submissions shall be sufficiently 
detailed to allow EPA to judge the adequacy of protocols, 
techniques, experimental design, statistical analyses, and 
conclusions. Studies shall be performed using generally accepted 
scientific principles, good laboratory techniques, and the 
testing guidelines specified in these regulations. 

(2) EPA shall give appropriate weight when making this 
determination to the following factors: 

(i) The age of the data; 

(ii) The adequacy of documentation of procedures, findings, 
and conclusions; 

(iii) The extent to which the testing conforms to generally 
accepted scientific principles and practices; 

(iv) The type and number of test subjects; 

(v) The number and adequacy of exposure concentrations, 


i.e.

, emission dilutions; 

(vi) The degree to which the tested emissions were 
generated by procedures and under conditions reasonably 
comparable to those set forth in  79.57; and

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940627-0-00193 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940627-0-00019 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(vii) The degree to which the test procedures conform to the testing guidelines set forth in   79.60 through
79.68 and/or furnish information comparable to that provided by such testing. 

(3) The test animals shall be rodents, preferably a strain of rat, and testing shall include all of the endpoints covered
in   79.62 through 79.68. All studies shall be properly executed, with appropriate documentation, and
in accord with the individual health testing guidelines (  79.60 through 79.68) of this part, e.g., 90-day,
6-hour per day exposure, minimum. 

(4) In general, the data in a manufacturer's registration submittal shall be adequate if the duration of a test's exposure
period is at least as long, in days and hours, as the inhalation exposure specified in the related health test guideline(s).
Data from tests with shorter exposure durations than those specified in the guidelines may be acceptable if the test
results are positive (

i.e.

, exhibit adverse effects) and/or include a demonstrable concentration-response relationship. 

(5) Data in support of a manufacturer's registration submittal shall directly address the effects of inhalation
exposure to the whole evaporative and exhaust emissions of the respective fuel or additive or to the whole evaporative
and exhaust emissions of other fuels or additives which satisfy the criteria in  79.56 for classification into
the same group as the subject fuel or fuel additive. Data obtained in the testing of a raw liquid fuel or additive/base
fuel mixture or a raw, aerosolized fuel or additive/base fuel mixture shall not be adequate to support a manufacturer's
registration submittal. Data from testing of evaporative emissions cannot substitute for 
test data on combustion emissions. Data from testing of combustion emissions cannot substitute for test data on evaporative
emissions. 



 79.54 

Tier 3. 



(a) 

General Criteria for Requiring Tier 3 Testing.

 (1) Tier 3 testing shall be required of a manufacturer or group of manufacturers at EPA's discretion when remaining
uncertainties as to the significance of observed health effects, welfare effects, and/or emissions exposures from
a fuel or 
fuel/additive mixture interfere with EPA's ability to make reasonable estimates of the potential risks posed by
emissions from the fuel or additive products. Tier 3 testing may be conducted either on an individual basis or a group
basis. If performed on a group basis, EPA may require either the same 
representative to be used in Tier 3 testing as was used in Tier 2 testing or may select a different member or members of
the group to represent the group in the Tier 3 tests. 

(2) In addition to the criteria specific to particular tests as summarized and detailed in the testing guidelines
(  79.62 through 79.68), EPA may consider a number of factors (including, but not limited to): 

(i) The number of positive and negative outcomes related to each endpoint; 

(ii) The identification of concentration-effect relationships; 

(iii) The statistical sensitivity and significance of such studies; 

(iv) The severity of the observed effects (e.g., whether the effects would be likely to lead to incapacitating or irreversible
conditions); 

(v) The type and number of species included in the reported tests; 

(vi) The consistency and clarity of apparent mechanisms, target organs, and outcomes; 

(vii) The presence or absence of effective health test control data for base-fuel-only versus additive/base fuel
mixture comparisons; 

(viii) The nature and amount of known toxic agents in the emissions stream; and 

(ix) The observation of lesions which specifically implicate inhalation as an important exposure route.

(3) 

Consideration of exposure.

 EPA retains discretion to consider, in addition to available toxicity data, any Tier 1 data on potential exposures
to emissions from a particular fuel or fuel additive (or group of fuels and/or fuel additives) in determining whether
to require Tier 3 testing. EPA may consider, but is not limited to, the following factors: 

(i) Types and emission rates of speciated emission components; 

(ii) Types and emission rates of combinations of compounds or elements of concern; 

(iii) Historical and/or projected production volumes and market distributions; and 

(iv) Estimated population and/or environmental exposures obtained through extrapolation, modeling, or literature
search findings on ambient, occupational, or epidemiological exposures. 

(b) 

Notice.

 (1) EPA will determine whether Tier 3 testing is necessary upon receipt of a manufacturer's (or group's) submittal
as 
prescribed under  79.51(d). If EPA determines on the basis of the Tier 1 and 2 data submission and any other available
information that further testing is necessary, EPA will require the responsible manufacturer(s) to conduct testing
as described elsewhere in this section. EPA will notify the manufacturer (or 
group) by certified letter of the purpose and nature of any proposed testing and of the proposed deadline for completing
the testing. A copy of the letter will be placed in the public record. EPA will provide the manufacturer a 60-day comment
period after the manufacturer's receipt of such notice. EPA may 
extend the comment period if it appears from the nature of the issues raised that further discussion is warranted.
In the event that no comment is received by EPA from the manufacturer (or group) within the comment period, the manufacturer
(or group) shall be deemed to have consented to the adoption by EPA of the proposed Tier 3 requirements. 

(2) EPA will issue a notice in the 

Federal Register

 of its intent to require testing under Tier 3 for a particular fuel or additive manufacturer and that a copy of the letter
to the manufacturer outlining the Tier 3 testing for that manufacturer is available in the public record for review
and comment. The public shall have a minimum of thirty (30) days after the 
publication of this notice to comment on the proposed Tier 3 testing. 

(3) EPA will include in the public record a copy of any timely comments concerning the proposed Tier 3 testing requirements
received from the affected manufacturer or group or from the public, and the responses of EPA to such comments. After
reviewing all such comments received, EPA will adopt final 
Tier 3 requirements by sending a certified letter describing such final requirements to the manufacturer or group.
EPA will also issue a notice in the 

Federal Register

 announcing that it has adopted such final Tier 3 requirements and that a copy of the letter adopting the requirements
has been included in the public record. 

(4) Prior to beginning any required Tier 3 testing, the manufacturer shall submit detailed test protocols to EPA for
approval. Once EPA has determined the Tier 3 testing requirements and approves the test protocols, any modification
to the requirements shall be governed by  79.51(f). 

(c) 

Carcinogenicity and Mutagenicity Testing.

 (1) A potential need for Tier 3 carcinogenicity and/or mutagenicity testing may be indicated if the results of the


In vivo

 Micronucleus Assay, required under  79.64, the 

In vivo

 Sister Chromatid Exchange Assay, required under  79.65, the Salmonella mutagenicity assay required under
 79.68, or relevant pathologic 
findings under  79.62 demonstrate a statistically significant dose-related positive response as compared
with appropriate controls. Alternatively, Tier 3 carcinogenicity testing and/or mutagenicity testing may be required
if there are positive outcomes for at least one concentration in two or more of the 
tests required under   79.64, 79.65, and 79.68. 

(2) The testing for carcinogenicity required under this paragraph may, at EPA's discretion, be conducted in accordance
with 40 CFR 798.3300 or 798.3320, or their equivalents (see suggested references following each health effects testing
guideline). The testing for mutagenicity required under this paragraph may likewise be conducted in accordance
with 40 CFR 798.5195, 798.5500, 798.5955, 798.7100, and/or other suitable equivalent testing (see suggested references
following each health effects testing guideline). EPA may supplement or modify guidelines as required to ensure
that the prescribed testing addresses the identified areas of concern.
 
(d) 

Reproductive and Teratological Effects Testing.

 (1) A potential need for Tier 3 testing may be indicated if the results of the Fertility Assessment/Teratology study
required under  79.63 or relevant findings under  79.62 demonstrate, in comparison with appropriate
controls, a statistically significant dose-related positive response in one or more of the possible 
test outcomes. Similarly, Tier 3 testing may be indicated if statistically significant positive results are confined
to either sex, or to the fetus as opposed to the pregnant adult. 

(2) The testing for reproductive and teratological effects required under this paragraph may, at EPA's discretion,
be conducted in accordance with 40 CFR 798.4700 and/or by performance of a reproductive assay by continuous breeding.
These guidelines may be modified or supplemented by EPA as 
required to ensure that the prescribed testing addresses the identified areas of concern.

(e) 

Neurotoxicity Testing.

 (1) A potential need for Tier 3 neurotoxicity testing may be indicated if either the results of the Neuropathology
Assessment required under  79.67 shows concentration-related effects in exposed animals or the Glial Fibrillary
Acidic Protein Assay required under  79.66 demonstrates a statistically significant concentration-related
positive response as compared with appropriate controls. Similarly, Tier 3 neurotoxicity testing may be indicated
if relevant results under  79.62 demonstrate a statistically significant positive response in comparison
to appropriate controls. 

(2) The testing for neurotoxicity required under this paragraph may, at EPA's discretion, be conducted in accordance
with 40 CFR 798.3260 and 40 CFR part 798 subpart G. These guidelines may be modified or supplemented by EPA as required
to ensure that the prescribed testing addresses the identified areas 
of concern. 

(f) 

General and Pulmonary Toxicity Testing.

 (1) A potential need for Tier 3 general and/or pulmonary toxicity testing may be indicated if, in comparison with appropriate
controls, the results of the Subchronic Toxicity Study, pursuant to  79.62, demonstrate abnormal gross analysis
or 
histopathological findings (especially as relates to lung pathology from whole-body preserved test animals) or
persistence or delayed occurrence of toxic effects beyond the exposure period. 

(2) A potential need for Tier 3 testing with respect to other organ systems or endpoints not addressed by specific Tier
2 tests, e.g., hepatic, renal, or endocrine toxicity, may be demonstrated by findings in the Tier 2 Subchronic Toxicity
Study (pursuant to  79.62) or by findings in the Tier 1 literature search of adverse functional, physiologic,
metabolic, or 
histopathologic effects of fuel or additive emissions to such other organ systems or any other information available
to EPA. In addition, findings in the Tier 1 emission characterization of significant levels of a known toxicant to
such other organ systems and endpoints may also indicate a need for relevant health effects testing. The testing required
under this paragraph may include tests conducted in accordance with 40 CFR 798.3260 or 798.3320. These guidelines
may be modified or supplemented by EPA as necessary to ensure that the prescribed testing addresses the identified
areas of concern. 

(3) The testing for general/pulmonary toxicity required under this paragraph may, at EPA's discretion, be conducted
in accordance with 40 CFR 798.2450 or 798.3260. These guidelines may be modified or supplemented by EPA as necessary
to ensure that the prescribed testing addresses the identified areas of concern. Pulmonary function measurements,
host defense assays, immunotoxicity tests, cell morphology/morphometry, and/or enzyme assays of lung lavage cells
and fluids may be specifically required. 

(g) 

Other Tier 3 Testing.

 (1) A manufacturer or group may be required to use up-to-date modeling, sampling, monitoring, and/or analytic approaches
at the Tier 3 level to provide: 

(i) Estimates of exposures to the emission products of a fuel or fuel additive or group of products; 

(ii) The expected atmospheric transformation products of such emissions; and 

(iii) The environmental partitioning of such emissions to the air, soil, water, and biota. 

(2) Additional emission characterization may be required if uncertainty over the identity of chemical species or
rate of their emission interferes with reasonable judgments as to the presence and/or concentration of potentially
toxic substances in the emissions of a fuel or fuel additive. The required tests may include characterization of additional
classes of emissions, the characterization of emissions generated by additional vehicles/engines of various technology
mixes (e.g., catalyzed versus non-catalyzed emissions), and/or other more precise analytic procedures for identification
or quantification of emissions compounds. Additional emissions testing may also be required to evaluate concerns
which may arise regarding the potential effects of a fuel or fuel additive on the performance 
of emission control equipment.

(3) A manufacturer or group may be required to conduct biological and/or exposure studies at the Tier 3 level to evaluate
directly the potential public welfare or environmental effects of the emissions of a fuel or additive, if significant
concerns about such effects arise as a result of EPA's review of 
the literature search or emission characterization findings in Tier 1 or the results of the toxicological tests in
Tier 2. 

(4) With regard to group submittals, Tier 3 studies on a fuel or additive product(s) other than the originally specified
group representative may be required if specific differences in the product's composition indicate that its emissions
may have different toxicologic properties from those of the original group representative. 

(5) Additional emission characterization and/or toxicologic tests may be required to evaluate the impact of different
vehicle, engine, or emission control technologies on the observed composition or health or welfare effects of the
emissions of a fuel or additive. 

(6) Toxicological tests on individual emission products may be required. 

(7) Upon review of information submitted for an aerosol product under  79.58(e), emissions characterization,
exposure, and/or toxicologic testing at a Tier 3 level may be required. 

(8) A manufacturer which qualifies for and has elected to use the special provisions for the products of small businesses
(pursuant to  79.58(d)) may be required to conduct emission characterization, exposure, and /or toxicologic
studies at the Tier 3 level for such products, as specified in  79.58(d)(4). 

(9) The examples of potential Tier 3 tests described in this section do not in any way limit EPA's broad discretion and
authority under Tier 3. 



 79.55 

Base fuel specifications. 



(a) 

General Characteristics.

 (1) The base fuel(s) in each fuel family shall serve as the group representative(s) for the baseline group(s) in each
fuel family pursuant to  79.56. Also, as specified in  79.51(h)(1), for fuel additives undergoing testing,
the designated base fuel for the respective fuel family shall serve as the substrate in which the additive shall be
mixed 
prior to the generation of emissions. 
 
(2) Base fuels shall contain a limited complement of the additives which are essential for the fuel's production or
distribution and/or for the successful operation of the test vehicle/engine throughout the mileage accumulation
and emission generation periods. Such additives shall be used at the minimum effective concentration-in-use for
the base fuel in question.

(3) Unless otherwise restricted, the presence of trace contaminants does not preclude the use of a fuel or fuel additive
as a component of a base fuel formulation.

(4) When an additive is the test subject, any additive normally contained in the base fuel which serves the same function
as the subject additive shall be removed from the base fuel formulation. For example, if a corrosion inhibitor were
the subject of testing and if this additive were to be tested in a base fuel which normally contained a corrosion inhibitor,
this test additive would replace the corrosion inhibitor normally included as a component of the base fuel.

(5) Additive components of the methanol, ethanol, methane, and propane base fuels in addition to any such additives
included below shall be limited to those recommended by the manufacturers of the vehicles and/or engines used in testing
such fuels. For this purpose, EPA will review requests from manufacturers (or their agents) to modify the additive
specifications for the alternative fuels and, if necessary, EPA shall change these specifications based on consistency
of those changes with the associated vehicle manufacturer's recommendations for the operation of the vehicle. EPA
shall publish notice of any such changes to a base fuel and/or its base additive package specifications in the 

Federal Register

.

 79.56 

Fuel and fuel additive grouping system. 



(a) Manufacturers of fuels and fuel additives are allowed to 
satisfy the testing requirements in   79.52, 79.53, and 79.54 
and the associated reporting requirements in  79.59 on an 
individual or group basis, provided that such products meet the 
criteria in this section for enrollment in the same fuel/additive 
group. However, each manufacturer of a fuel or fuel additive 
must individually comply with the notification requirements of  
79.59(b). Further, if a manufacturer elects to comply by 
participation in a group, each manufacturer continues to be 
individually subject to the information requirements of this 
subpart. 

(1) The use of the grouping provision to comply with Tier 1 and 
Tier 2 testing requirements is voluntary. No manufacturer is 
prohibited from testing and submitting its own data for its own 
product registration, despite its qualification for membership in 
a particular group.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940627-0-00202 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940627-0-00019 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(2) The only groups permitted are those established in this 
section. 
(b) Each manufacturer who chooses to enroll a fuel or fuel 
additive in a group of similar fuels and fuel additives as 
designated in this section may satisfy the registration 
requirements through a group submission of jointly-sponsored 
testing and analysis conducted on a product which is 
representative of all products in that group, provided that the 
group representative is chosen according to the specifications in 
this section. 
(1) The health effects information submitted by a group shall be 
considered applicable to all fuels and fuel additives in the 
group. A fuel or fuel additive manufacturer who has chosen to 
participate in a group may subsequently choose to perform testing 
of such fuel or fuel additive on an individual basis; however, 
until such independent registration information has been received 
and reviewed by EPA, the information initially submitted by the 
group on behalf of the manufacturer's fuel or fuel additive shall 
be considered applicable and valid for that fuel or fuel 
additive. It could therefore be used to support requirements for 
further testing under the provisions of Tier 3 or to support 
regulatory decisions affecting that fuel or fuel additive. 
(2) Manufacturers are responsible for determining the 
appropriate groups for their products according to the criteria 
in this section and for enrolling their products into those 
groups under industry-sponsored or other independent brokering 
arrangements. 
(3) Manufacturers who enroll a fuel or fuel additive into a 
group shall share the applicable costs according to appropriate 
arrangements established by the group. The organization and 
administration of group functions and the development of cost-sharing arrangements are the responsibility of the
participating 
manufacturers. If manufacturers are unable to agree on fair and 
equitable cost sharing arrangements and if such dispute is 
referred by one or more manufacturers to EPA for resolution, then 
the provisions in  79.56(c) (1) and (2) shall apply. 
(c) In complying with the registration requirements for a given 
fuel or fuel additive, notwithstanding the enrollment of such 
fuel or additive in a group, a manufacturer may make use of 
available information for any product which conforms to the same 
grouping criteria as the given product. If, for this purpose, a 
manufacturer wishes to rely upon the information previously 
submitted by another manufacturer (or group of manufacturers) for 
registration of a similar product (or group of products), then 
the previous submitter is entitled to reimbursement by the 
manufacturer for an appropriate portion of the applicable costs 
incurred to obtain and report such information. Such entitlement 
shall remain in effect for a period of fifteen years following 
the date on which the original information was submitted. 
Pursuant to  79.59(b)(4)(ii), the manufacturer who relies on 
previously-submitted registration data shall certify to EPA that 
the original submitter has been notified and that appropriate 
reimbursement arrangements have been made. 
(1) When private efforts have failed to resolve a dispute about a 
fair amount or method of cost-sharing or reimbursement for 
testing costs incurred under this subpart, then any party 
involved in that dispute may initiate a hearing by filing two 
signed copies of a request for a hearing with a regional office 
of the American Arbitration Association and mailing a copy of the 
request to EPA. A copy must also be sent to each person from 
whom the filing party seeks reimbursement or who seeks 
reimbursement from that party. The information and fees to be 
included in the request for hearing are specified in 40 CFR 
791.20(b) and (c). 
(2) Additional procedures and requirements governing the hearing 
process are those specified in 40 CFR 791.22 through 791.50, 
791.60, 791.85, and 791.105, excluding 40 CFR 791.39(a)(3) and 
791.48(d). 
(d) 

Basis for Classification. 

(1) Rather than segregating fuels and fuel additives into 
separate groups, the grouping system applies the same grouping 
criteria and creates a single set of groups applicable both to 
fuels and fuel additives.

(2) Fuels shall be classified pursuant to  79.56(e) into 
categories and groups of similar fuels and fuel additives 
according to the components and characteristics of such fuels in 
their uncombusted state. The classification of a fuel product 
must take into account the components of all bulk fuel additives 
which are listed in the registration application or basic 
registration data submitted for the fuel product. 
(3) Fuel additives shall be classified pursuant to  79.56(e) 
into categories and groups of similar fuels and fuel additives 
according to the components and characteristics of the respective 
uncombusted additive/base fuel mixture pursuant to  79.51(h)(1). 
(4) In determining the category and group to which a fuel or 
fuel additive belongs, impurities present in trace amounts shall 
be ignored unless otherwise noted. Impurities are those 
substances which are present through contamination or which 
remain in the fuel or additive naturally after processing is 
completed. 
(5) 

Reference Standards. 

(i) American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) standard D 4814-93a, ``Standard Specification for Automotive
Spark-Ignition Engine Fuel'', used to define the general characteristics of 
gasoline fuels (paragraph (e)(3)(i)(A)(3) of this section) and 
ASTM standard D 975-93, ``Standard Specification for Diesel Fuel 
Oils'', used to define the general characteristics of diesel fuels 
(paragraph (e)(3)(ii)(A)(3) of this section) have been 
incorporated by reference. 
(ii) This incorporation by reference was approved by the 
Director of the Federal Register in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 
552(a) and 1 CFR part 51. Copies may be obtained from the 
American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM), 1916 Race 
Street, Philadelphia, PA 19103. Copies may be inspected at U.S. 
EPA, OAR, 401 M Street SW., Washington, DC, 20460 or at the 
Office of the Federal Register, 800 North




 Capitol Street NW., suite 700, Washington, DC. 
 


(e) 

Grouping Criteria.

 The grouping system is represented by a 
matrix of three fuel/additive categories within six specified 
fuel families (see Table F94-7, Grouping System for Fuels and 
Fuel Additives). Each category may include one or more groups. 
Within each group, a representative may be designated based on 
the criteria in this section and joint registration information 
may be developed and submitted for member fuels and fuel 
additives.

additives. The base fuel for this family is specified in  79.55(b). 

(ii) The Diesel Family includes fuels composed of more than 50 percent diesel fuel by volume and their associated fuel
additives. The Diesel fuel family includes both Diesel 

#

1 and Diesel 

#

2 formulations. The base fuel for this family is specified in  79.55(c). 

(iii) The Methanol Family includes fuels composed of at least 50 percent methanol by volume and their associated fuel
additives. The M100 and M85 base fuels are specified in  79.55(d). 

(iv) The Ethanol Family includes fuels composed of at least 50 percent ethanol by volume and their associated fuel
additives. The base fuel for this family is E85 as specified in  79.55(e).

(vi) The Propane Family includes propane fuels containing at least 50 percent propane by volume and their associated
fuel additives. The base fuel for this family is a liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) as specified in  79.55(g). 

(vii) A manufacturer seeking registration for formulation(s) which do not fit the criteria for inclusion in any of
the fuel families described in this section shall contact EPA at the address in  79.59(a)(1) for further guidance
in classifying and testing such formulation(s). 

(2) 

Fuel/Additive Categories.

 Fuel/additive categories (Table F94-7, rows 1-3) are subdivisions of fuel families which represent
the degree to which fuels and fuel additives in the family resemble the base fuel(s) designated for the family. Three
general category types are defined in this section. When applied to fuel additives, the criteria in these descriptions

refer to the associated additive/base fuel mixture, pursuant to  79.51(h)(1). 

(i) Baseline categories consist of fuels and fuel additives which contain no elements other than those permitted
in the base fuel for the respective fuel family and conform to specified limitations on the amounts of certain components
or characteristics applicable to that fuel family. 

(ii) Non-Baseline Categories consist of fuels and fuel additives which contain no elements other than those permitted
in the base fuel for the respective fuel family, but which exceed one or more of the limitations for certain specified
components or characteristics applicable to baseline formulations in that fuel family. 

(iii) Atypical Categories consist of fuels and fuel additives which contain elements or classes of compounds other
than those permitted in the base fuel for the respective fuel family or which otherwise do not meet the criteria for
either baseline or non-baseline formulations in that fuel family. A fuel or fuel additive product having both non-baseline
and atypical characteristics pursuant to  79.56(e)(3), shall be considered to be an atypical product. 

(3) This section defines the specific categories applicable to each fuel family. When applied to fuel additives,
the criteria in these descriptions refer to the associated additive/base fuel mixture, pursuant to  79.51(h)(1).

(ii) 

Non-Baseline Groups

_ (A) 

Non-Baseline Gasoline.

 The Non-Baseline gasoline fuels and associated additives shall sort into groups according to the following criteria:


(

1

) For gasoline fuel and additive products which contain 1.5 percent oxygen by weight or more, a separate non-baseline
gasoline group shall be defined by each oxygenate compound or methanol/co-solvent blend listed as a component in
the registration application or basic registration data of any such fuel or additive. 

(

i

) Examples of oxygenates occurring in non-baseline gasoline formulations include ethanol, methyl tertiary butyl
ether (MTBE), ethyl tertiary butyl ether (ETBE), tertiary amyl methyl ether (TAME), diisopropyl ether (DIPE), dimethyl
ether (DME), tertiary amyl ethyl ether (TAEE), and any other compound(s) which increase the oxygen content of the
gasoline formulation. A separate non-baseline gasoline group is defined for each such oxygenating compound. 

(

ii

) Each unique methanol and co-solvent combination (whether one, two, or more additional oxygenate compounds) used
in a non-baseline fuel shall also define a separate group. An oxygenate compound used as a co-solvent for methanol
in a non-baseline gasoline formulation must be identified as such in its registration. If the oxygenate is not identified
as a methanol co-solvent, then the compound shall be regarded by EPA as defining a separate non-baseline gasoline
group. Examples of methanol/co-solvent combinations occurring in non-baseline gasoline formulations include
methanol/isopropyl alcohol, methanol/butanol, and methanol with alcohols up to C8/octanol (Octamix). 

(

iii

) For each such group, the representative to be used in testing shall be a formulation consisting of the gasoline base
fuel blended with the relevant oxygenate compound (or methanol/co-solvent combination) in an amount equivalent
to the highest actual or recommended concentration-in-use of the 
oxygenate (or methanol/co-solvent combination) recorded in the basic registration data of any member fuel or additive
product. In the event that two or more products in the same group contain the same and highest amount of the oxygenate
or methanol/co-solvent blend, then the representative shall be chosen at random for such candidate products. 

(

2

) An oxygenate compound or methanol/co-solvent combination to be blended with the gasoline base fuel for testing
purposes shall be chemical-grade quality, at a minimum, and shall not contain a significant amount of other contaminating
oxygenate compounds.

(

3

) Separate non-baseline gasoline groups shall also be defined for gasoline formulations derived from each particular
non-conventional petroleum source or process. 

(

i

) Such groups may include, but are not limited to, the following: coal-derived gasoline formulations; chemically-synthesized
gasoline formulations (including those using recycled chemical/petrochemical products); tar sand-derived gasoline
formulations; shale-derived gasoline formulations; and other types of soil-recovered products used in formulating
gasolines. 

(

ii

) In any such group, the first product to be registered or to apply for EPA registration shall be the representative
of that group. If two or more such products are registered or apply for first registration simultaneously, then the
representative shall be chosen by a random method from among such candidate products. 

(

4

) Pursuant to  79.51(i), non-baseline gasoline products may belong to more than one fuel/additive group. 

(B) 

Non-Baseline Diesel

. The Non-Baseline diesel fuels and associated additives shall sort into groups according to the following criteria:


(

1

) For diesel fuel and additive products which contain 1.0 percent oxygen by weight or more, a separate non-baseline
diesel group shall be defined by each individual alcohol or ether listed as a component in the registration application
or basic registration data of any such fuel or additive. For each such group, the representative to be used in testing
shall be a formulation consisting of the diesel base fuel blended with the relevant alcohol or ether in an amount equivalent
to the highest actual or recommended concentration-in-use of the alcohol or ether recorded in the basic registration
data of any member fuel or additive product. 

(

2

) A separate non-baseline diesel group is also defined for each of the following classes of oxygenating compounds:
mixed nitroso- compounds; mixed nitro- compounds; mixed alkyl nitrates; mixed alkyl nitrites; peroxides; furans;
mixed alkyl esters of plant origin; and mixed alkyl esters of animal origin. For each such group, the representative
to be used in testing shall be formulated as follows: 

(

i

) From the class of compounds which defines the group, a particular oxygenate compound shall be chosen from among all
such compounds recorded in the registration application or basic registration data of any fuel or additive in the
group. 

(

ii

) The selected compound shall be the one recorded in any member product's registration application with the highest
actual or recommended maximum concentration-in-use. This compound, when mixed into the diesel base fuel at the indicated
maximum concentration, shall serve as the group representative. 

(

iii

) In the event that two or more oxygenate compounds in the relevant class have the highest recorded concentration-in-use,
then the oxygenate compound to be used in the group representative shall be chosen at random from the qualifying candidate
compounds. 

(

3

) A separate non-baseline diesel group shall also be defined for each diesel fuel derived from a particular synthetic
petroleum source or process. 

(

i

) Such groups include, but shall not be limited to, the following: coal-derived diesel formulations; chemically-synthesized
diesel formulations (including those using recycled chemical/petrochemical products); tar sand-derived diesel
formulations; shale-derived diesel formulations; and other types of soil-recovered products used in formulating
diesel fuel(s). 

(

ii

) In any such group, the first product to be registered or to apply for EPA registration shall be the representative
of that group. If two or more products are registered or apply for first registration simultaneously, then the representative
shall be chosen by a random method from among such candidate products. 

(

4

) Pursuant to  79.51(i), non-baseline diesel products may belong to more than one fuel/additive group. 

(C) 

Non-Baseline Methanol

. The Non-Baseline methanol formulations are sorted into groups based on the non-methanol, non-gasoline component(s)
of the blended fuel. Each such component occurring separately and each unique combination of such components shall
define a separate group. 

(

1

) The representative of each such non-baseline methanol group shall be the group member with the highest percent by
volume of non-methanol, non-gasoline component(s). 

(

2

) In case two or more such members have the same and highest concentration of non-methanol, non-gasoline component(s),
the representative of the group shall be chosen at random from among such equivalent member products. 

(D) 

Non-Baseline Ethanol

. The Non-Baseline ethanol formulations are sorted into groups based on the non-ethanol, non-gasoline component(s)
of the blended fuel. Each such component occurring separately and each unique combination of such components shall
define a separate group. 

(

1

) The representative of each such non-baseline ethanol group shall be the group member with the highest percent by
volume of non-ethanol, non-gasoline component(s). 

(

2

) In case two or more such members have the same and highest concentration of non-ethanol, non-gasoline component(s),
the representative of the group shall be chosen at random from among such equivalent member products.

(E) 

Non-Baseline Methane

. The Non-Baseline methane category consists of one group. The group representative shall be the member fuel or fuel/additive
formulation containing the highest concentration-in-use of non-methane hydrocarbons. If two or more member products

(F) 

Non-Baseline Propane

. The Non-Baseline propane category consists of one group. The group representative shall be the member fuel or fuel/additive
formulation containing the highest concentration-in-use of butane and higher hydrocarbons. If two or more products
have the same and the highest concentration-in-use, then the representative shall be chosen at random from such products.


(iii) 

Atypical groups

. 

(A) As defined for each individual fuel family in  
79.56(e)(3), fuels and additives meeting any one of the following criteria are considered atypical. 

(

1

) Gasoline Atypical fuels and additives contain one or more elements in addition to carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen,
and sulfur. 

(

2

) Diesel Atypical fuels and additives contain one or more element in addition to carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen,
and sulfur. 

(

3

) Methanol Atypical fuels and additives contain: 

(

i

) one or more element in addition to carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur, and chlorine, and/or 

(

ii

) sulfur in excess of 0.004 percent by weight, and/or 

(

iii

) chlorine in excess of 0.0001 percent by weight. 

(

4

) Ethanol Atypical fuels and additives contain: 

(

i

) one or more element in addition to carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur, chlorine, and copper, and/or 

(

ii

) sulfur in excess of 0.004 percent by weight, and/or 

(

iii

) contain chlorine (as chloride) in excess of 0.0004 percent by weight, and/or 

(

iv

) contain copper in excess of 0.07 mg/L. 

(

5

) Methane Atypical fuels and additives contain: 

(

i

) one or more element in addition to carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and sulfur, and/or 

(

ii

) sulfur in excess of 16 ppm by volume. 

(

6

) Propane Atypical fuels and additives contain: 

(

i

) one or more element in addition to carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and sulfur, and/or 

(

ii

) sulfur in excess of 123 ppm by weight. 

(B) General rules for sorting these atypical fuels and additives into separate groups are as follows: 

(

1

) Pursuant to  79.51(j), a given atypical product may belong to more than one atypical group. 

(

2

) Fuels and additives in different fuel families may not be grouped together, even if they contain the same atypical
element(s) or other atypical characteristic(s). 

(

3

) A fuel or additive containing one or more atypical elements attached to a polymer compound must be sorted into a separate
group from atypical fuels or fuel additives containing the same atypical element(s) in non-polymer form. However,
the occurrence of a polymer compound which does not contain an atypical element does not affect the grouping of a fuel
or additive. 

(C) Specific rules for sorting each family's atypical fuels and additives into separate groups, and for choosing
each such group's representative for testing, are as follows: 

(

1

) A separate group is created for each atypical element (or other atypical characteristic) occurring separately,


i.e.

, in the absence of any other atypical element or characteristic, in one or more fuels and/or additives within a given
fuel family. 

(

i

) Consistent with the basic grouping guidelines provided in  79.56(d), a fuel product which is classified as
atypical because its basic registration data or application lists a bulk additive containing an atypical characteristic,
may be grouped with that additive and/or with other fuels and additives containing the same atypical characteristic.


(

ii

) Within a group of products containing only one atypical element or characteristic, the fuel or additive/base fuel
mixture with the highest concentration-in-use or recommended concentration-in-use of the atypical element or
characteristic shall be the designated representative of that group. In the event that two or more fuels or additive/base
fuel mixtures within the group contain the same and highest concentration of the single atypical element or characteristic,
then the group representative shall be selected by a random method from among such candidate products.

(

2

) A separate group is also created for each unique combination of atypical elements (and/or other specified atypical
characteristics) occurring together in one or more fuels and/or additives within a given fuel family. 

(

i

) Consistent with the basic grouping guidelines provided in  79.56(d), a fuel which is classified as atypical
because its basic registration data lists one bulk additive containing two or more atypical characteristics, may
be grouped with that additive and/or with other fuels and/or additives containing the same combination of atypical
characteristics. Grouping of fuels containing more than one atypical additive shall be guided by provisions of  79.51(j).


(

ii

) Within a group of such products containing a unique combination of two or more atypical elements or characteristics,
the designated representative shall be the product within the group which contains the highest total concentration
of the atypical elements or characteristics. 

(

iii

) In the event that two or more products within a given atypical group contain the same and highest concentration of
the same atypical elements or characteristics then, among such candidate products, the designated representative
shall be the product which, first, has the highest total concentration of metals, followed in order by highest total
concentration of halogens, highest total concentration of other atypical elements (including sulfur concentration,
as applicable), highest total concentration of polymers containing atypical elements, and, lastly, highest total
concentration of oxygen. 

(

iv

) If two or more products have the same and highest concentration of the variable identified in the preceding paragraph,
then, among such products, the one with the greatest concentration of the next highest variable on the list shall be
the group representative. 

(

v

) This decision-making process shall continue until a single product is determined to be the representative. If two
or more products remain tied at the end of this process, then the representative shall be chosen by a random method from
among such remaining products. 



 79.57.



Emission generation. 



This section specifies the equipment and procedures that must be used in generating the emissions which are to be subjected
to the characterization procedures and/or the biological tests specified in   79.52(b) and 79.53 of
these regulations. When applicable, they may also be required in conjunction with testing under   79.54
and 79.58(c). Additional requirements concerning emission generation, delivery, dilution, quality control,
and safety practices are outlined in  79.61. 

(a) 

Vehicle and engine selection criteria

. (1) All vehicles and engines used to generate emissions for testing a fuel or additive/fuel mixture must be new (i.e.,
never before titled) and placed into the program with less than 500 miles on the odometer or 12 hours on the engine chronometer.
The vehicles and engines shall be unaltered from the specifications of the original equipment manufacturer. 

(2) The vehicle/engine type, vehicle/engine class, and vehicle/engine subclass designated to generate emissions
for a given fuel or additive shall be the same type, class, and subclass which, over the previous three years, has consumed
the most gallons of fuel in the fuel family applicable to the given fuel or additive. No distinction shall be made between
light-duty vehicles and light-duty trucks for purposes of this classification. 

(3) Within this vehicle/engine type, class, and subclass, the specific vehicles and engines acceptable for emission
generation are those that represent the most common fuel metering system and the most common of the most important
emission control system devices or characteristics with respect to emission reduction performance for the model
year in which testing begins. These vehicles will be determined through a survey of the previous model year's vehicle/engine
sales within the given subclass. These characteristics shall include, but need not be limited to, aftertreatment
device(s), fuel aspiration, air injection, exhaust gas recirculation, and feedback type.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940627-0-00212 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940627-0-00019 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(4) Within the applicable subclass, the five highest selling vehicle/engine models that contain the most common
such equipment and characteristics shall be determined. Any of these five models of the current model year (at the
time testing begins) may be selected for emission generation. 

(i) If one or more of the five models is not available for the current model year, the choice of model for emission generation
shall be limited to those remaining among the five. 

(ii) If fewer than five models of the given vehicle/engine type are available for the current model year, all such models
shall be eligible. 

(5) When the fuel or fuel additive undergoing testing is not commonly used or intended to be used in the vehicle/engine
types prescribed by this selection procedure, or when rebuilding or alteration is required to obtain a suitable vehicle/engine
for emission generation, the manufacturer may submit a request to EPA for a modification in test procedure requirements.
Any such request must include objective test results which support the claim that a more appropriate vehicle/engine
type is needed as well as a suggested substitute vehicle/engine type. The vehicle/engine selection in this case shall
be approved by EPA prior to the start of testing. 

(6) Once a particular model has been chosen on which to test a fuel or additive product, all mileage accumulation and
generation of emissions for characterization and biological testing of such product shall be conducted on that same
model. 

(i) If the initial test vehicle/engine fails or must be replaced for any reason, emission generation shall continue
with a second vehicle/engine which is identical to, or resembles to the greatest extent possible, the initial test
vehicle/engine. If more than one replacement vehicle/engine is necessary, all such vehicles/engines shall be identical,
or resemble to the greatest extent possible, the initial test vehicle/engine. 

(ii) Manufacturers are encouraged to obtain, at the start of a test program, more than one emission generation vehicle/engine
of the identical model, to ensure the availability of back-up emission generator(s). All backup vehicles/engines
must be conditioned and must have their emissions fully characterized, as done for the initial test vehicle/engine,
prior to their use as emission generators for biological testing. Alternating between such vehicles/engines regularly
during the course of testing is permissible and advisable, particularly to allow regular maintenance on such vehicles/engines
during prolonged health effects testing. 

(b) 

Vehicle/engine operation and maintenance.

 (1) For the purpose of generating combustion emissions from a fuel or additive/base fuel mixture for which the relevant
class is light duty, either a light-duty vehicle shall be operated on a chassis dynamometer or a light-duty engine
shall be operated on an engine dynamometer. When the relevant class is heavy duty, the emissions shall be generated
on a heavy-duty engine operated on an engine dynamometer. In both cases, the vehicle or engine model shall be selected
as described in paragraph (a) of this section and shall have all applicable fuel and emission control systems intact.


(2) Except as provided in  79.51(h)(2)(iii), the fuel or additive/base fuel mixture being tested shall be used
at all times during operation of the test vehicle or engine. No other fuels or additives shall be used in the test vehicle
or engine once mileage accumulation has begun until emission generation for emission characterization and biological
testing purposes is completed. 

(3) Scheduled and unscheduled vehicle/engine maintenance. 

(i) During emission generation, vehicles and engines must be maintained in good condition by following the recommendations
of the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) for scheduled service and parts replacement, with repairs performed
only as necessary. Modifications, adjustments, and maintenance procedures contrary to procedures found in 40 CFR
part 86 for the maintenance of test vehicles/engines or performed solely for the purpose of emissions improvement
are not allowed.

(ii) If unscheduled maintenance becomes necessary, the 
vehicle or engine must be repaired to OEM specifications, using 
OEM or OEM-approved parts. In addition, the tester is required 
to measure the basic emissions pursuant to  79.52(b)(2)(i) after 
the unscheduled maintenance and before resuming testing to ensure 
that the post-maintenance emissions shall be within 20 percent of 
pre-maintenance emissions levels. If the basic emissions cannot 
be brought within 20 percent of their previous levels, then the 
manufacturer shall restart the emissions characterization and 
health testing of its products combustion emissions using a new 
vehicle/engine. 
 
(c) 

Mileage accumulation. 

(1) A vehicle/engine break-in period is required prior to generating emissions for characterization and/or biological

testing under this subpart. The required mileage accumulation 
may be accomplished on a test track, on the street, on a 
dynamometer, or using any other conventionally accepted method. 


(2) Vehicles to be used in the evaluation of baseline and 
non-baseline fuels and fuel additives shall accumulate 4,000 
miles prior to emission testing. Engines to be used in the 
evaluation of baseline and non-baseline fuels and fuel additives 
shall accumulate 125 hours of operation on an engine dynamometer 
prior to emission testing. 
(3) When the test formulation is classified as an atypical 
fuel or fuel additive formulation (pursuant to definitions in  
79.56(e)(4)(iii)), the following additional mileage accumulation 
requirements apply: 
(i) The test vehicle/engine must be operated for a minimum 
of 4,000 vehicle miles or 125 hours of engine operation. 
(ii) Thereafter, at intervals determined by the tester, all 
emission fractions (

i.e., 

vapor, semi-volatile, and particulate) 
shall be sampled and analyzed for the presence and amount of the 
atypical element(s) and/or other atypical constituents. Pursuant 
to paragraph (d) of this section, the sampled emissions must be 
generated in the absence of an intact aftertreatment device. 
Immediately before the samples are taken, a brief warmup period 
(at least ten miles or the engine equivalent) is required. 
(iii) Mileage accumulation shall continue until either 50 
percent or more of the mass of each atypical element (or other 
atypical constituent) entering the engine can be measured in the 
exhaust emissions (all fractions combined), or the vehicle/engine 
has accumulated mileage (or hours) equivalent to 40 percent of 
the average useful life of the applicable vehicle/engine class 
(pursuant to regulations in 40 CFR part 86). For example, the 
maximum mileage required for light-duty vehicles is 40 percent of 
100,000 miles (

i.e., 

40,000 miles), while the maximum time of 
operation for heavy-duty engines is the equivalent of 40 percent 
of 290,000 miles (

i.e.

, the equivalent in engine hours of 116,000 
miles). 
(iv) When either condition in paragraph (c)(3)(iii) of this 
section has been reached, additional emission characterization 
and biological testing of the emissions may begin. 
(d) 

Use of exhaust aftertreatment devices. 

(1) If the selected test vehicle/engine, as certified by 
EPA, does not come equipped with an emissions aftertreatment 
device (such as a catalyst or particulate trap), such device 
shall not be used in the context of this program. 
(2) Except as provided in paragraph (d)(3) of this section 
for certain specialized additives, the following provisions apply 
when the test vehicle/engine, as certified by EPA, comes equipped 
with an emissions aftertreatment device. 
(i) For mileage accumulation: 
(A) When the test formulation does not contain any atypical 
elements (pursuant to definitions in  79.56(e)(4)(iii)), an 
intact aftertreatment device must be used during mileage 
accumulation. 
(B) When the test formulation does contain atypical 
elements, then the manufacturer may choose to accumulate the 
required mileage using a vehicle/engine equipped with either an 
intact aftertreatment device or with a non-functional 
aftertreatment device (e.g., a blank catalyst without its 
catalytic wash coat). In either case, sampling and analysis of 
emissions for measurement of the mass of the atypical element(s) 
(as described in  79.57(c)(3)) must be done on emissions 
generated with a non-functional (blank) aftertreatment device. 
(

1

) If the manufacturer chooses to accumulate mileage 
without a functional aftertreatment device, and if the 
manufacturer wishes to do this outside of a laboratory/test track 
setting, then a memorandum of exemption for product testing must 
be obtained by applying to the Director of the Field Operations 
and Support Division (see  79.59(a)(1)). 
(

2

) [reserved] 
(ii) For Tier 1 ( 79.52), the total set of requirements 
for the characterization of combustion emissions ( 79.52(b)) 
must be completed two times, once using emissions generated with 
the aftertreatment device intact and a second time with the 
aftertreatment device rendered nonfunctional or replaced with a 
non-functional aftertreatment device as described in paragraph 
(d)(2)(i)(B) of this section. 
(iii) For Tier 2 ( 79.53), the standard requirements for 
biological testing of combustion emissions shall be conducted 
using emissions generated with a non-functioning aftertreatment 
device as described in paragraph (d)(2)(i)(B) of this section. 
(iv) For alternative Tier 2 requirements ( 79.58(c)) or 
Tier 3 requirements ( 79.54) which may be prescribed by EPA, the 
use of functional or nonfunctional aftertreatment devices shall 
be specified by EPA as part of the test guidelines. 
(v) In the case where an intact aftertreatment device is 
not in place, all other manufacturer-specified combustion 
characteristics (e.g., back pressure, residence time, and mixing 
characteristics) of the altered vehicle/engine shall be retained 
to the greatest extent possible. 
(3) Notwithstanding paragraphs (d)(1) and (d)(2) of this 
section, when the subject of testing is a fuel additive 
specifically intended to enhance the effectiveness of exhaust 
aftertreatment devices, the related aftertreatment device may be 
used on the emission generation vehicle/engine during all mileage 
accumulation and testing. 
(e) 

Generation of combustion emissions_
(1) Generating combustion emissions for emission 
characterization. 

(i) Combustion emissions shall be generated according to 
the exhaust emission portion of the Federal Test Procedure (FTP) 
for the certification of new motor vehicles, found in 40 CFR part 
86, subpart B for light-duty vehicles/engines, and subparts D, M 
and N for heavy-duty vehicles/engines. The Urban Dynamometer 
Driving Schedule (UDDS), pursuant to 40 CFR part 86, appendix 
I(a), shall apply to light-duty vehicles/engines and the Engine 
Dynamometer Driving Schedule (EDS), pursuant to 40 CFR part 86, 
appendix I(f)(2), shall apply to heavy-duty vehicles/engines. 
The motoring portion of the heavy-duty test cycle may be 
eliminated, at the manufacturer's option, for the generation of 
emissions. 
(A) For light-duty engines operated on an engine 
dynamometer, the tester shall determine the speed-torque 
equivalencies (``trace'') for its test engine from valid FTP 
testing performed on a chassis dynamometer, using a test vehicle 
with an engine identical to that being tested. The test engine 
must then be operated under these speed and torque specifications 
to simulate the FTP cycle. 
(B) Special procedures not included in the FTP may be 
necessary in order to characterize emissions from fuels and fuel 
additives containing atypical elements or to collect some types 
of emissions (e.g., particulate emissions from light-duty 
vehicles/engines, semi-volatile emissions from both light-duty 
and heavy-duty vehicles/engines). Such alterations to the FTP 
are acceptable.

<TEXT>
 

(ii) Pursuant to  79.52(b)(1)(i) and  79.57(d)(2)(ii), 
emission generation and characterization must be repeated three 
times when the selected vehicle/engine is normally operated 
without an emissions aftertreatment device and six times when the 
selected vehicle/engine is normally operated with an emissions 
aftertreatment device. In the latter case, the emission 
generation and characterization process shall be repeated three 
times with the intact aftertreatment device in place and three 
times with a non-functioning (blank) aftertreatment device in 
place. 
(iii) From both light-duty and heavy-duty vehicles/engines, 
samples of vapor phase, semi-volatile phase, and particulate 
phase emissions shall be collected, except that semi-volatile 
phase, and particulate emissions need not be sampled for fuels 
and additives in the methane and propane families (pursuant to  
79.56(e)(1)(v) and (vi)). The number and type of samples to be 
collected and separately analyzed during one emission 
generation/characterization process are as follows: 

(A) In the case of combustion emissions generated from 
light-duty vehicles/engines, the samples consist of three bags of 
vapor emissions (one from each segment of the light-duty exhaust 
emission cycle) plus one sample of particulate-phase emissions 
and one sample of semi-volatile-phase emissions (collected over 
all segments of the exhaust emission cycle). If the mass of 
particulate emissions or semi-volatile emissions obtained during 
one driving cycle is not sufficient for characterization, then 
the driving cycle may be performed again and the extracted 
fractions combined prior to chemical analysis. Particulate-phase 
emissions shall not be combined with semi-volatile-phase 
emissions. 

(B) In the case of combustion emissions generated from 
heavy-duty engines, the samples consist of one sample of each 
emission phase (vapor, particulate, and semi-volatile) collected 
over the entire cold-start cycle and a second sample of each such 
phase collected over the entire hot-start cycle (see 40 CFR 
86.334 through 86.342). 

(iv) 

Emission collection and storage. 

(A) Vapor phase emissions shall be collected and stored in 
Tedlar bags for subsequent chemical analysis. Storage conditions 
are specified in  79.52(b)(2). 

(B) Particulate phase emissions shall be collected on a 
particulate filter (or more than one, if required) using methods 
described in 40 CFR 86.1301 through 86.1344. These methods, 
ordinarily applied only to heavy-duty emissions, are to be 
adapted and used for collection of particulates from light-duty 
vehicles/engines, as well. The particulate matter may be stored 
on the filter in a sealed container, or the soluble organic 
fraction may be extracted and stored in a separate sealed 
container. Both the particulate and the extract shall be 
shielded from ultraviolet light and stored at ^20 
 C or less. 
Particulate emissions shall be tested no later than six months 
from the date they were generated. 

(C) Semi-volatile emissions shall be collected immediately 
downstream from the particulate collection filters using porous 
polymer resin beds, or their equivalent, designed for their 
capture. The soluble organic fraction of semi-volatile 
emissions shall be extracted immediately and tested within six 
months of being generated. The extract shall be stored in a 
sealed container which is shielded from ultraviolet light and 
stored at ^20 
 C or less. 


(D) Particulate and semi-volatile phase emission 
collection, handling and extraction methods shall not alter the 
composition of the collected material, to the extent possible. 

(v) Additional requirements for combustion emission 
sampling, storage, and characterization are specified in  
79.52(b). 

(2) 

Generating whole combustion emissions for biological 
testing. 

(i) Biological tests requiring whole combustion emissions 
shall be conducted using emissions generated from the test 
vehicle or engine operated in general accordance with the FTP 
procedures cited in this section. The emissions shall be 
generated continuously throughout the animal exposure periods, 
diluted by an amount appropriate for the test being performed as 
specified in  79.61(d)(3), passed through a mixing chamber, and 
routed to the biological test chamber. 
 
(ii) Light-duty test vehicles/engines shall be operated 
over the Urban Dynamometer Driving Schedule (or equivalent engine 
dynamometer trace, per paragraph (e)(1)(i)(A) of this section) 
and heavy-duty test engines shall be operated over the Engine 
Dynamometer Schedule (see 40 CFR part 86, appendix I). 
(A) The tolerances of the driving cycle shall be two times 
those of the Federal Test Procedure and must be met 95 percent of 
the time. 
(B) The driving cycle shall be repeated as many times as 
required for the biological test session. 
(C) Light-duty dynamometers shall be calibrated prior to 
the start of a biological test (40 CFR 86.118-78), verified 
weekly (40 CFR 86.118-78), and recalibrated as required. Heavy-duty dynamometers shall be calibrated and
checked prior to the 
start of a biological test (40 CFR 86.1318-84), recalibrated 
every two weeks (40 CFR 86.1318-84(a)) and checked as stated in 
40 CFR 86.1318-84(b) and (c). 
(D) The fuel reservoir for the test vehicle/engine shall be 
large enough to operate the test vehicle/engine throughout the 
daily biological exposure period, avoiding the need for refueling 
during testing. 
(iii) An apparatus to integrate the large concentration 
swings typical of transient-cycle exhaust is to be used between 
the FTP-Constant Volume Sampler (CVS) source of emissions and the 
exposure chamber containing the animal test cage(s). The purpose 
of such apparatus is to decrease the variability of the 
biological exposure atmosphere. 
(A) A large mixing chamber is suggested for this purpose. 
The mixing chamber would be charged from the CVS at a constant 
rate determined by the exposure chamber purge rate. Flow to the 
exposure chamber would begin at the conclusion of the initial 
transient cycle with the associated mixing chamber charge. 
(B) A potential alternative apparatus is a mini-diluter 
(see, for example, AIGER/CRADA, February, 1994 in  79.57(g)). 
(C) The mixing chamber (or any alternative emission 
moderation apparatus) must function such that the average 
concentration of total hydrocarbons leaving the apparatus shall 
be within 10 percent of the average concentration of hydrocarbons 
entering the chamber. 
(iv) 

Emission dilution. 

(A) Dilution air can be pre-dried to lower the relative 
humidity, thus permitting a lower dilution rate and a higher 
concentration of hydrocarbons to be achieved without condensation 
of water vapor. 
(B) With gasoline fuels, a minimum dilution ratio of about 
1:5 raw exhaust (dewpoint about 125 
 F) with dry, clean filtered 
air is required to reduce the water concentration to a dewpoint 
of about 68 
 F. The minimum dilution ratio (maximum exhaust flow 
rate) occurs at about 200 seconds into the UDDS transient driving 
cycle. Larger minimum dilution ratios are required if the 
dilution air includes water vapor. However, the minimum dilution 
ratio will vary with fuel composition. Fuels which generate 
greater engine exhaust water concentrations (e.g., alcohol and 
natural gas fuels) will require greater initial dilutions. 
Heated transfer ducts or tubing can be used to avoid water 
condensation in much of the system, but the mixing chamber 
described in paragraph (e)(2)(iii) of this section will generally 
be at or near laboratory temperature, and CVS dilution will have 
to be adequate to assure that the cumulative dew point in the 
chamber remains below laboratory temperature at all times 
(further guidance on this topic may be found in Black and Snow, 
1994 in  79.57(g)). 
(C) After the initial exhaust dilution to preserve the 
character of the exhaust, the exhaust stream can be further 
diluted in the mixing chamber (and/or after leaving the chamber) 
to achieve the desired biological exposure concentrations.

(v) 

Verification procedures.

 (A) The entire system used to dilute and transport whole combustion emissions (

i.e.

, from exhaust pipe to outlet in the biological testing chamber) shall be verified before any animal exposures begin,
and verified at least weekly during testing. (See procedures at 40 CFR 86.119-90 for light-duty vehicles and
 86.1319-90 for heavy-duty engines.) Verification testing shall be accomplished by introducing a known
sample at the end of the vehicle/engine exhaust pipe into the dilution system and measuring the amount exiting the
system. For example, an injected hydrocarbon sample could be detected with a gas chromatograph (GC) and flame ionization
detector (FID) to determine the recovery factor.

(B) Verification of the integrity of the mixing chamber (or alternative apparatus) shall be determined before animal
exposures begin and at least weekly thereafter. Composite values for weight percent total hydrocarbons shall be
determined for the test vehicle/engine's dilute exhaust stream entering and exiting the mixing chamber apparatus.
These values must be within 10 percent of each other.

(vi) 

Emission exposure quality control.

 (A) The tester shall incorporate the additional quality assurance and safety procedures outlined in  79.61(d)
to control variability of emissions during the generation of exposure emissions during health effect testing.

(B) These procedures include requirements that the mean exposure concentration in the inhalation test chamber shall
be within 10 percent of the target concentration (established in the developmental phase of testing) on 90 percent
or more of exposure days and that daily monitoring of CO, CO

2

, NO

X

, SO

X

, and total hydrocarbons in the exposure chamber shall be required. Analysis of the particle size distribution shall
also be performed to establish the stability and consistency of particle size distribution in the test exposure.

(C) The testing facility shall allow an audit of its premises, the qualifications, e.g., curriculum vitae, of its
staff assigned to testing, and the specimens and records of the testing for registration purposes (as specified in
 79.60).

(vii) In order to allow for unforeseen problems with the emission generation or dilution equipment, emission generation
may be interrupted for up to four hours on a maximum of two occasions in any four-week period of testing. The amount of
time for which emission generation was interrupted shall subsequently be added after the equipment problem is corrected.
If the equipment problem causes more than four consecutive hours of emission generation to be interrupted, or if more
than two such occasions occurs in any four-week period during testing, the interrupted tests shall be void. Testers
shall be aware of concerns for backup vehicles/engines cited in paragraph (a)(7)(ii) of this section.

(3) 

Generating particulate and semi-volatile emissions for biological testing.

 (i) Salmonella mutagenicity testing, pursuant to  79.68, shall be conducted on extracts of the particulate
and semi-volatile emission phases separately. These emissions shall be generated by operating the test vehicle/engine
over the appropriate FTP driving cycle (see paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section) and collected and analyzed according
to methods described in 40 CFR 86.1301 through 1344 (further information on this subject may be found in Perez, 

et al.

 CRC Report No. 551, 1987 listed in  79.57(g)).

(A) Particulate emissions shall be collected on particulate filters and extracted from the collection equipment
for use in biological tests. The particulate emissions from all segments of the FTP or from multiple FTP cycles may
be collected on one or more filters, as necessary. The time spent collecting sufficient quantities of the test substances
in emissions samples will vary, depending on the emission characteristics of the engine and fuel or additive/base
fuel mixture and on the requirements of the biological test protocol.

(B) Semi-volatile emissions shall be collected immediately downstream from the particulate collection filters
using porous polymer resin beds, or their equivalent, designed for their capture. Semi-volatile phase emissions
shall be collected on one apparatus. The time spent collecting sufficient quantities of the test substances in emissions
samples will vary, depending on the emission characteristics of the engine and fuel or additive/base fuel mixture
and on the requirements of the biological test protocol.

(ii) The extraction method shall be determined by the specifications of the biological test for which the emissions
are used.

(iii) Particulate and semi-volatile emission storage requirements are as specified in  79.57(e)(1)(iv).

(iv) Particulate and semi-volatile phase emission collection, handling and extraction methods shall not alter
the composition of the collected material, to the extent possible.

(v) Particulate emissions shall not be combined with semi-volatile phase emissions.

(f) 

Generation of evaporative emissions for characterization and biological testing.

 (1) Except as provided in paragraph (f)(5) of this section, an evaporative emissions generator shall be used to volatilize
samples of a fuel or additive/base fuel mixture for evaporative emissions characterization and biological testing.
Emissions shall be collected and sampled using equipment and methods appropriate for use with the compounds being
characterized and the requirements of the emission characterization analysis. In the case of potentially explosive
test substance concentrations, care must be taken to avoid generating explosive atmospheres. The tester is referred
to  79.61(d)(8) for considerations involving explosivity.

(2) 

Evaporative Emissions Generator (EEG) Description. 

An EEG is a fuel tank or vessel to which heat is applied causing a portion of the fuel to evaporate at a desired rate. The
manufacturer has flexibility in designing an EEG for testing a particular fuel or fuel additive. The sample used to
generate emissions in the EEG shall be renewed at least daily.

(i) The evaporation chamber shall be made from materials compatible with the fuels and additives being tested and
shall be equipped with a drain.

(ii) The chamber shall be filled to 40 

#

5 percent of its interior volume with the fuel or additive/base fuel mixture being tested, with the remainder of the
volume containing air.

(iii) The concentration of the evaporated fuel or additive/base fuel mixture in the vapor space of the evaporation
chamber during the time emissions are being withdrawn for testing shall not vary by more than 10 percent from the equilibrium
concentration in the vapor space of emissions generated from the fresh fuel or additive/base fuel mixture in the chamber.

(A) During the course of a day's emission generation period, the level of fuel in the EEG shall be maintained to within
7 percent of its height at the start of the daily exposure period.

(B) The fuel used in the EEG shall be drained at the end of each daily exposure. The EEG shall be refilled with a fresh supply
of the test formulation before the start of each daily exposure.

(C) The vapor space of the evaporation chamber shall be well mixed throughout the time emissions are being withdrawn
for testing.

(iv) The size of the evaporation chamber shall be determined by the rate at which evaporative emissions shall be needed
in the test animal exposure chambers and the rate at which the fuel or the additive/base fuel mixture evaporates. The
rate of evaporative emissions may be adjusted by altering the size of the EEG or by using one or more additional EEG(s).
Emission rate modifications shall not be adjusted by temperature control or pressure control.

(v) The temperature of the fuel or additive/base fuel mixture in the evaporation chamber shall be 130 
 F

#

5
 F. The vapors shall maintain this temperature up to the point in the system where the vapors are diluted.

(vi) The pressure in the vapor space of the evaporation chamber and the dilution and sampling apparatus shall stay
within 10 percent of ambient atmospheric pressure.

(vii) There shall be no controls or equipment on the evaporation chamber system that change the concentration or composition
of the vapors generated for testing.

(viii) Manufacturers shall perform verification testing of evaporative emissions in a manner analogous to the verification
testing performed for combustion emissions.

(3) For biological testing, vapor shall be withdrawn from the EEG at a constant rate, diluted with air as required for
the particular study, and conducted immediately to the biological testing chamber(s) in a manner similar to the method
used in  79.57(e), excluding the mixing chamber therein. The rate of emission generation shall be high enough
to supply the biological exposure chamber with sufficient emissions to allow for a minimum of fifteen air changes
per exposure chamber per hour. Interruption of evaporative emissions exposures during biological testing for more
than four consecutive hours, or on more than two separate occasions within a four-week period for less than four consecutive
hours, shall cause the affected test(s) to be void.

(4) For characterization of evaporative emissions, samples of equilibrated emissions to the vapor space of the EEG
shall be withdrawn into Tedlar bags, then stored and analyzed as specified in  79.52(b).

(5) A manufacturer (or group of manufacturers) may submit to EPA a request for approval of an alternative method of
generating evaporative emissions for use in emission characterization and biological tests required under this
subpart.

(i) To be approved by EPA, the request must fully explain the rationale for the proposed method as well as the technical
procedures, quality control, and safety precautions to be used, and must demonstrate that the proposed method will
meet the following criteria:

(A) The emission mixture generated by the proposed procedures must be reasonably similar to the equilibrium composition
of the vapor which occurs in the vehicle fuel tank head space when the subject fuel or additive/base fuel mixture is
in use and near-maximum in-use temperatures are encountered.

(B) The emissions mixture generated by the proposed method must be sufficiently concentrated to provide adequate
exposure levels in the context of the required toxicologic tests.

(C) The proposed method must include procedures to ensure that the emissions delivered to the biologic exposure chambers
will provide a reasonably constant exposure atmosphere over time.

(ii) If EPA approves the request, EPA will place in the public record a copy of the request, together with all supporting
procedural descriptions and justifications, and will notify the public of its availability by publishing a notice
in the 

Federal Register

.

 79.58


Special provisions.



(a) 

Relabeled Additives. 

Sellers of relabeled additives (pursuant to  79.50) are not required to comply with the provisions of   79.52,
79.53 or 79.59, except that such sellers are required to comply with  79.59(b).

(b) 

Low Vapor Pressure Fuels and Additives. 

Fuels which are not designated as ``evaporative fuels'' and fuel additives which are not designated as ``evaporative
fuel additives'' pursuant to the definitions in  79.50 need not undergo the emission characterization or health
effects testing specified in   79.52 and 79.53 for evaporative emissions. At EPA's discretion, the evaporative
emissions of such fuels and additives may be required to undergo Tier 3 testing, pursuant to  79.54.

(c) 

Alternative Tier 2 Provisions. 

At EPA's discretion, EPA may modify the standard Tier 2 health effects testing requirements for a fuel or fuel additive
(or group). Such modification may encompass substitution, addition, or deletion of Tier 2 studies or study specifications,
and/or changes in underlying engine or equipment requirements, except that a Tier 2 endpoint will not be deleted in
the absence of existing information deemed adequate by EPA or alternative testing requirements for such endpoint.
If warranted by the particular requirements, EPA will allow additional time for completion of the alternative Tier
2 testing program.

(1) When EPA intends to require testing in lieu of or in addition to standard Tier 2 health testing, EPA will notify the
responsible manufacturer (or group) by certified letter of the specific tests which EPA is proposing to require in
lieu of or in addition to Tier 2, and the proposed schedule for completion and submission of such tests. A copy of the
letter will be placed in the public record. EPA intends to send the notification prior to November 27, 1995, or in the
case of new fuels and additives (as defined in  79.51(c)(3)), within 18 months of EPA's receipt of an intent to
register such product. However, EPA's notification to the manufacturer (or group) may occur at any time up to EPA's
receipt of Tier 2 data for the product(s) in question. EPA will provide the manufacturer with 60 days from the date of
receipt of the notice to comment on the tests which EPA is proposing to require and on the proposed schedule. If the manufacturer
believes that undue costs or hardships will occur as a result of EPA's delay in providing notification of alternative
Tier 2 requirements, then the manufacturer's comments should describe and include evidence of such hardship. In
particular, if the standard Tier 2 toxicology testing for the fuel or additive in question has already begun at the
time the manufacturer receives EPA's notification of proposed alternative Tier 2 requirements, then EPA shall refrain
from requiring alternative Tier 2 tests provided that EPA receives the standard Tier 2 data and report (pursuant to
 79.59(c)) within one year of the date on which the toxicology testing began.

(2) EPA will issue a notice in the 

Federal Register

 announcing its intent to require special testing in lieu of or in addition to the standard Tier 2 testing for a particular
fuel or additive manufacturer or group, and that a copy of the letter to the manufacturer or group describing the proposed
alternative Tier 2 testing for that manufacturer or group is available in the public record for review and comment.
The public shall have a minimum of 30 days after the publication of this notice to comment on the proposed alternative
Tier 2 testing.

(3) EPA will include in the public record a copy of any timely comments concerning the proposed alternative Tier 2 testing
requirements received from the affected manufacturer or group or from the public, and the responses of EPA to such
comments. After reviewing all such comments received, EPA may adopt final alternative Tier 2 requirements by sending
a certified letter describing such final requirements to the manufacturer or group. In that event, EPA will also issue
a notice in the 

Federal Register

 announcing that it has adopted final alternative Tier 2 requirements and that a copy of the letter adopting the requirements
has been included in the public record.

(4) After EPA's receipt of a manufacturer's (or group's) submittals, EPA will notify the responsible manufacturer
(or group) regarding the adequacy of the submittal and potential Tier 3 testing requirements according to the same
relative time intervals and by the same procedures as specified in  79.51 (c) and (d) for routine Tier 1 and Tier
2 submittals.

(d) 

Small Business Provisions. 

(1) For purposes of these provisions, when subsidiary, divisional, or other complex business arrangements exist,


manufacturer

 is defined as the business entity with ultimate ownership of all related parents, subsidiaries, divisions, branches,
or other operating units. 

Total annual sales 

means the average of the manufacturer's total sales revenue in each of the three years prior to such manufacturer's
submittal to EPA of the basic registration information pursuant to  79.59 (b)(2) through (b)(5).

(2) 

Provisions Applicable to Baseline and Non-baseline Products. 

A manufacturer with total annual sales less than $50 million is not required to meet the requirements of Tier 1 and Tier
2 (specified in   79.52 and 79.53) with regard to such manufacturer's fuel and/or additive products which
meet the criteria for inclusion in a Baseline or Non-baseline group pursuant to  79.56. Upon such manufacturer's
satisfactory completion and submittal to EPA of basic registration data specified in  79.59(b), the manufacturer
may request and EPA shall issue a registration for such product, subject to  79.51(c) and paragraphs (d)(4)
and (d)(5) of this section.

(3) 

Provisions Applicable to Atypical Products. 

A 
manufacturer with total annual sales less than $10 million is not 
required to meet the requirements of Tier 2 (specified in  
79.53) in regard to such manufacturer's fuel and/or additive 
products which meet the criteria for inclusion in an Atypical 
group pursuant to  79.56. Upon such manufacturer's satisfactory 
completion and submittal to EPA of basic registration data 
specified in  79.59(b) and Tier 1 information specified in  
79.52 for an Atypical fuel or additive, the manufacturer may 
request and EPA shall issue a registration for such product, 
subject to  79.51(c) and paragraphs (d)(4) and (d)(5) of this 
section. Compliance with Tier 1 requirements under this 
paragraph may be accomplished by the individual manufacturer or 
as a part of a group pursuant to  79.56. 

(4) Any registration granted by EPA under the provisions of 
this section are conditional upon satisfactory completion of any 
Tier 3 requirements which EPA may subsequently impose pursuant to 
 79.54. In such circumstances, the Tier 3 requirements might 
include (but would not necessarily be limited to) information 
which would otherwise have been required under the provisions of 
Tier 1 and/or Tier 2. 

(5) The provisions in paragraphs (d)(2) and (d)(3) of this 
section are voluntary on the part of qualifying small 
manufacturers. Such manufacturers may choose to fulfill the 
standard requirements for their fuels and additives, individually 
or as a part of a group, rather than satisfying only the 
requirements specified in paragraphs (d)(2) and/or (d)(3) of this 
section. If a qualifying small manufacturer elects these special 
provisions rather than the standard requirements for a product, 
then EPA will generally assume that any additional information 
submitted by other manufacturers, for fuels and additives meeting 
the same grouping criteria (under  79.56) as that of the small 
manufacturer's product, is pertinent to further testing and/or 
regulatory decisions that may affect the small manufacturer's 
product. 

(e) 

Aftermarket Aerosol Additives.

 (1) To obtain registration for an aftermarket aerosol fuel 
additive, the manufacturer shall provide existing information in 
the form of a literature search, a discussion of the potential 
exposure(s) to such product, and the basic registration data 
specified in  79.59(b). 

 (2) The literature search shall include existing data on 
potential health and welfare effects due to exposure to the 
aerosol product itself and its raw (uncombusted) components. The 
analysis for potential exposures shall be based on the actual or 
anticipated production volume and market distribution of the 
particular aerosol product, and its estimated frequency of use. 
Other Tier 1 and Tier 2 requirements are not routinely required 
for aerosol products. EPA will review the submitted information 
and, at EPA's discretion, may require from the manufacturer 
further information and/or testing under Tier 3 on a case-by-case 
basis.

(a) 

General Provisions

_(1) 

Scope.

 (i) This section prescribes good laboratory practices (GLPs) for conducting inhalation exposure studies relating
to motor vehicle emissions health effects testing under this part. These directions are intended to ensure the quality
and integrity of health effects data submitted pursuant to registration regulations issued under sections 211(b)
or 211(e) of the Clean Air Act (CAA) (42 U.S.C. 7545). 
(ii) This section applies to any study described by paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section which any person conducts,
initiates, or supports on or after May 27, 1994. 
(iii) It is EPA's policy that all health effects data developed under sections 211(b) and (e) of CAA be in accordance
with provisions of this section. If data are not developed in accordance with the provisions of this section, EPA may
consider such data insufficient to evaluate the health effects of a motor vehicle's fuel or fuel additive emissions,
unless the submitter provides additional information demonstrating that the data are reliable and adequate and
EPA determines that the data are sufficient. 
(2)

i.e.

, actually uses the test substance in a test system. ``Testing facility'' encompasses only those operational units
that are being or have been used to conduct studies. 


TSCA

 means the Toxic Substances Control Act (15 U.S.C. 2601 

et seq.

). 
(3) 

Applicability to studies performed under grants and contracts.

 When a sponsor or other person utilizes the services of a consulting laboratory, contractor, or grantee to perform
all or a part of a study to which this section applies, it shall notify the consulting laboratory, contractor, or grantee
that the service is, or is part of, a study that must be conducted in compliance with the provisions of this section.

(4) 

Statement of compliance or non-compliance.

 Any person who submits to EPA a test in compliance with registration regulations issued under CAA section 211(b) or
section 211(e) shall include in the submission a true and correct statement, signed by the sponsor and the study director,
of one of the following types: 
(i) A statement that the study was conducted in accordance with this section; or 
(ii) A statement describing in detail all differences between the practices used in the study and those required by
this section; or 
(iii) A statement that the person was not a sponsor of the study, did not conduct the study, and does not know whether
the study was conducted in accordance with this section. 
(5) 

Inspection of a testing facility.

 (i) A testing facility shall permit an authorized employee or duly designated representative of EPA, at reasonable
times and in a reasonable manner, to inspect the facility and to inspect (and in the case of records also to copy) all
records and specimens required to be maintained regarding studies to which this section applies. The records inspection
and copying requirements shall not apply to quality assurance unit records of findings and problems, or to actions
recommended and taken, except the EPA may seek production of these records in litigation or formal adjudicatory hearings.

(ii) EPA will not consider reliable for purposes of showing that a test substance does or does not present a risk of injury
to health or the environment any data developed by a testing facility or sponsor that refuses to permit inspection
in accordance with this section. The determination that a study will not be considered reliable does not, however,
relieve the sponsor of a required test of any obligation under any applicable statute or regulation to submit the results
of the study to EPA. 
(6) 

Effects of non-compliance.

 (i) Pursuant to sections 114, 208, and 211(d) of the CAA, it shall be a violation of this section and a violation of this
rule (40 CFR part 79, subpart F) if:

(B) Data or information submitted to EPA under part 79, including the statement required by  79.60(a)(4), include
information or data that are false or misleading, contain significant omissions, or otherwise do not fulfill the
requirements of this part; or 
(C) Entry in accordance with  79.60(a)(5) for the purpose of auditing test data is denied. 
(ii) EPA, at its discretion, may not consider reliable for purposes of showing that a chemical substance or mixture
does not present a risk of injury to health any study which was not conducted in accordance with this part. EPA, at its
discretion, may rely upon such studies for purposes of showing adverse effects. The determination that a study will
not be considered reliable does not, however, relieve the sponsor of a required test of the obligation under any applicable
statute or regulation to submit the results of the study to EPA. 
(iii) If data submitted in compliance with registration regulations issued under CAA section 211(b) or section 211(e)
are not developed in accordance with this section, EPA may determine that the sponsor has not fulfilled its obligations
under 40 CFR part 79 and may require the sponsor to develop data in accordance with the requirements of this section
in order to satisfy such obligations. 
(b) 

Organization and Personnel.

 (1) 

Personnel.

emissions from fuels or fuel/additive mixtures. Where this 
guideline and the other health effects testing guidelines in 40 
CFR 79.62 through 79.68 specify differing values for the same 
test parameter, the specifications in the individual health test 
guideline shall prevail for that health effect endpoint.

Acute inhalation study

 means a short-term toxicity test characterized by a single exposure by inhalation over a short period of time (at least
4 hours and less than 24 hours), followed by at least 14 days of observation. 



Aerodynamic diameter

 means the diameter of a sphere of unit density that has the same settling velocity as the particle of the test substance.
It is used to compare particles of different sizes, densities and shapes, and to predict where in the respiratory tract
such particles may be deposited. It applies to the size of aerosol particles. 



Chronic inhalation study

 means a prolonged and repeated exposure by inhalation for the life span of the test animal; technically, two years
in the rat. 



Concentration

 means an exposure level. Exposure is expressed as weight or volume of test aerosol/substance per volume of air, usually
mg/m

3

 or as parts per million (ppm) over a given time period. Micrograms per cubic meter ( u g/m

3

) or parts per billion may be appropriate, as well. 



Cumulative toxicity

 means the adverse effects of repeated exposures occurring as a result of prolonged action or increased concentration
of the administered test substance or its metabolites in the susceptible tissues. 



Inhalable diameter

 means that aerodynamic diameter of a particle which is considered to be inhalable for the organism. It is used to refer
to particles which are capable of being inhaled and may be deposited anywhere within the respiratory tract from the
trachea to the alveoli. 



Mass median aerodynamic diameter (MMAD)

 means the calculated aerodynamic diameter, which divides the particles of an aerosol in half based on the mass of the
particles. Fifty percent of the particles in mass will be larger than the median diameter, and fifty percent will be
smaller than the median diameter. MMAD describes the particle distribution of any aerosol based on the weight and
size of the particles. MMAD and the geometric standard deviation describe the particle-size distribution. 



Material safety data sheet (MSDS)

 means documentation or information on the physical, chemical, and hazardous characteristics of a given chemical,
usually provided by the product's manufacturer. 



Reynolds number

 means a dimensionless number that is proportional to the ratio of inertial forces to frictional forces acting on a
fluid. It quantitatively provides a measure of whether flow is laminar or turbulent. A fluid traveling through a pipe
is fully developed into a laminar flow for a Reynolds number less than 2000, and fully developed into a turbulent flow
for a Reynolds number greater than 4000. 



Subacute inhalation toxicity

 means the adverse effects occurring as a result of the repeated daily exposure of experimental animals to a chemical
by inhalation for part (less than 10 percent) of a lifespan; generally, less than 90 days. 



Subchronic inhalation study

 means a repeated exposure by inhalation for part (approximately 10 percent) of a life span of the exposed test animal.




Toxic effect

 means an adverse change in the structure or function of an experimental animal as a result of exposure to a chemical
substance. 

(c) 

Principles and design criteria of inhalation exposure systems.

 Proper conduct of inhalation toxicity studies of the emissions of fuels and additive/fuel mixtures requires that
the exposure system be designed to ensure the controlled generation of the exposure atmosphere, the adequate dilution
of the test emissions, delivery of the diluted exposure atmosphere to the test animals, and use of appropriate exposure
chamber systems selected to meet criteria for a given exposure study. 

(1) 

Emissions generation.

 Emissions shall be generated according to the specifications in 40 CFR 79.57. 

(2) 

Dilution and delivery systems.

(i) The delivery system is the means used to transport the emissions from the generation system to the exposure system.
The dilution system is generally a component of the delivery system. 

(ii) Dilution provides control of the emissions concentration delivered to the exposure system, serving the function
of diluting the associated combustion gases, such as carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide
and other noxious gases and vapors, to levels that will ensure that there are no significant or measurable responses
in the test animals as a result of exposure to the combustion gases. The formation of particle species is strongly dependent
on the dilution rate, as well. 

(iii) The engine exhaust system shall connect to the first-stage-dilution section at 90
  to the axis of the dilution section. This is then connected to a right angle elbow on the center line of the dilution
section. Engine emissions are injected through the elbow so that exhaust flow is concurrent to dilution flow. 

(iv) 

Materials.

 In designing the dilution and delivery systems, the use of plastic, e.g., PVC and similar materials, copper, brass,
and aluminum pipe and tubing shall be avoided if there exists a possibility of chemical reaction occurring between
emissions and tubing. Stainless steel pipe and tubing is recommended as the best choice for most emission dilution
and delivery applications, although glass and teflon may be appropriate, as well. 

(v) 

Flow requirements.

 (A) Conduit for dilute raw emissions shall be of such dimensions as to provide residence times for the emissions on
the order of less than one second to several seconds before the emissions are further diluted and introduced to the
test chambers. With the high flow rates in the dilute raw emissions conduit, it will be necessary to sample various
portions of the dilute emissions for delivering differing concentrations to the test chambers. The unused portions
of the emissions stream are normally exhausted to the atmosphere outside of the exposure facility. 

(B) Dimensions of the dilute raw exhaust conduit shall be such that, at a minimum, the flow Reynolds number is 70,000
or greater (see Mokler, 

et al.

, 1984 in paragraph (f)(13) of this section). This will maintain highly turbulent flow conditions so that there is
more complete mixing of the exhaust emissions. 

(C) 

Wall losses.

 The delivery system shall be designed to minimize wall losses. This can be done by sizing the tubing or pipe to maintain
laminar flow of the diluted emissions to the exposure chamber. A flow Reynolds number of 1000-3000 will ensure
minimal wall losses. Also, the length of and number and degree of bends in the delivery lines to the exposure chamber
system shall be minimized. 

(D) Whole-body exposure vs. nose-only exposure delivery systems. Flow rates through whole-body chamber systems
are of the order of 100 liters per minute to 500 liters per minute. Nose-only systems are on the order of less than 50 liters
per minute. To maintain laminar flow conditions, the principles described in paragraph (c)(2)(v)(C) of this section
apply to both systems. 

(vi) 

Dilution requirements.

 (A) To maintain the water vapor, and dissolved organic compounds, in the raw exhaust emissions stream, a manufacturer/tester
will initially dilute one part emissions with a minimum of five parts clean, filtered air (see Hinners, 

et al.

, 1979 in paragraph (f)(11) of this section). Depending on the water vapor content of a particular fuel/additive mixture's
combustion emissions and the humidity of the dilution air, initial exhaust dilutions as high as 1:15 or 1:20 may be
necessary to maintain the general character of the exhaust as it cools, e.g., M100. At this point, it is expected that
the exhaust stream would be further diluted to more appropriate levels for rodent health effects testing. 

(B) A maximum concentration (minimum dilution) of the raw exhaust going into the test animal cages is anticipated
to lie in the range between 1:5 and 1:50 exhaust emissions to clean, filtered air. The minimum concentration (maximum
dilution) of raw exhaust for health effects testing is anticipated to be in range between 1:100 and 1:150. Individual
manufacturers will treat these ranges as approximations only and will determine the optimum range of emission concentrations
to elicit effects in Tier 2 health testing for their particular fuel/fuel additive mixture.

(ii) 

Exposure chambers.

 There are two basic types of dynamic inhalation exposure chambers, whole-body chambers and nose-/head-only exposure
chambers (see Cheng and Moss, 1989 in paragraph (f)(8) of this section). 

(A) 

Whole-body chambers.

 (

1

) The flow rate through a chamber shall be maintained at 15 air changes per hour. 

(

2

) The chambers are usually maintained at a slightly negative pressure (0.5 to 1.5 inch of water) to prevent leakage
of test substance into the exposure room. 

(

3

) The exposure chamber shall be designed in such a way as to provide uniform distribution of exposure concentrations
in all compartments (see Cheng 

et al.

, 1989 in paragraph (f)(7) of this section). 

(

4

) Animals are housed in separate compartments inside the chamber, where the whole surface area of an animal is exposed
to the test material. The spaces required for different animal species shall follow the 

Guide

. In general, the volume of animal bodies occupy less than 5 percent of the chamber volume. 

(B) 

Head/nose-only exposure chambers.

 (

1

) In head/nose-only exposure chambers, only the head (oronasal) portion of the animal is exposed to the test material.


(

2

) The chamber volume and flow rates are much less than in the whole-body exposure chambers because the subjects are
usually restrained in a tube holder where the animal's breathing can be easily monitored. The head/nose-only exposure
chamber is suitable for short-term exposures or when use of a small amount of test material is required. 

(iii) Since whole-body exposure appears to be the least stressful mode of exposure, it is the preferred method. In
general, head/nose only exposure, which is sometimes used to avoid concurrent exposure by the dermal or oral routes,


i.e.

, grooming, is not recommended because of the stress accompanying the restraining of the animals. However, there
may be specific instances where it may be more appropriate than whole-body exposure. The tester shall provide justification
for its selection. 

(d) 

Inhalation exposure procedures

_(1) 

Animal selection.

 (i) The rat is the preferred species for vehicle emission inhalation health effects testing. Commonly used laboratory
strains shall be used. Any rodent species may be used, but the tester shall provide justification for the choice of
that species. 

(ii) Young adult animals, approximately ten weeks of age for the rat, shall be used. At the commencement of the study,
the weight variation of animals used shall not exceed 

#

20 percent of the mean weight for each sex. Animals shall be randomly assigned to treatment and control groups according
to their weight. 

(iii) An equal number of male and female rodents shall be used at each concentration level. Situations may arise where
use of a single sex may be appropriate. Females, in general, shall be nulliparous and nonpregnant. 

(iv) The number of animals used at each concentration level and in the control group(s) depends on the type of study,
number of biological end points used in the toxicity evaluation, the pre-determined sensitivity of detection and
power of significance of the study, and the animal species. For an acute study, at least five animals of each sex shall
be used in each test group. For both the subacute and subchronic studies, at least 10 rodents of each sex shall be used
in each test group. For a chronic study, at least 20 male and 20 female rodents shall be used in each test group.

<TEXT>
 

(A) If interim sacrifices are planned, the number of animals shall be increased by the number of animals scheduled
to be sacrificed during the course of the study. 

(B) For a chronic study, the number of animals at the termination of the study must be adequate for a meaningful and valid
statistical evaluation of chronic effects. 

(v) A concurrent control group is required. This group shall be exposed to clean, filtered air under conditions identical
to those used for the group exposed to the test atmosphere. 

(vi) The same species/strain shall be used to make comparisons between fuel-only and fuel/additive mixture studies.
If another species/strain is used, the tester shall provide justification for its selection. 

(2) 

Animal handling and care.

 (i) A key element in the conduct of inhalation exposure studies is the proper handling and care of the test animal population.
Therefore, the exposure conditions must conform strictly with the conditions for housing and animal care and use
set forth in the 

Guide

. 

(ii) In whole-body exposure chambers, animals shall be housed in individual caging. The minimum cage size per animal
will be in accordance with instructions set forth in the 

Guide. 

(iii) Chambers shall be cleaned and maintained in accordance with recommendations and schedules set forth in the
Guide

. 

(A) Observations shall be made daily with appropriate actions taken to minimize loss of animals to the study (e.g.,
necropsy or refrigeration of animals found dead and isolation or sacrifice of weak or moribund animals). Exposure
systems using head/nose-only exposure chambers require no special daily chamber maintenance. Chambers shall be
inspected to ensure that they are clean, and that there are no obstructions in the chamber which would restrict air
flow to the animals. Whole-body exposure chambers will be inspected on a minimum of twice daily, once before exposures
and once after exposures. 

(B) Signs of toxicity shall be recorded as they are observed, including the time of onset, degree, and duration. 

(C) Cage-side observations shall include, but are not limited to: changes in skin, fur, eye and mucous membranes,
respiratory, autonomic, and central nervous systems, somatomotor activity, and behavioral patterns. Particular
attention shall be directed to observation of tremors, convulsions, salivation, diarrhea, lethargy, sleep, and
coma.

<TEXT>
 

(iv) Food and water will be withheld from animals for 
head/nose-only exposure systems. For whole-body-exposure 
systems, water only may be provided. When the exposure 
generation system is not operating, food will be available 

ad 
libitum

. During operation of the generation system, food will be 
withheld to avoid possible contamination by emissions. 
 
(v) At the end of the study period, all survivors in the 
main study population shall be sacrificed. Moribund animals shall 
be removed and sacrificed when observed. 
 
(3) 

Concentration levels and selection.

 (i) In acute and subacute toxicity tests, at least three exposure concentrations and a control group shall be used
and spaced appropriately to produce test groups with a range of toxic effects and mortality rates. The data shall be
sufficient to 
produce a concentration-response curve and permit an acceptable 
estimation of the median lethal concentration. 
 
(ii) In subchronic and chronic toxicity tests, testers 
shall use at least three different concentration levels, with a 
control exposure group, to determine a concentration-response 
relationship. Concentrations shall be spaced appropriately to 
produce test groups with a range of toxic effects. The 
concentration-response data may also be sufficient to determine a 
NOAEL, unless the result of a limit test precludes such findings. 
The criteria for selecting concentration levels has been 
published (40 CFR 798.2450 and 798.3260). 
 
(A) The highest concentration shall result in toxic effects 
but not produce an incidence of fatalities which would prevent a 
meaningful evaluation of the study. 
 
(B) The lowest concentration shall not produce toxic 
effects which are directly attributable to the test exposure. 
Where there is a useful estimation of human exposure, the lowest 
concentration shall exceed this. 
 
(C) The intermediate concentration level(s) shall produce 
minimal observable toxic effects. If more than one intermediate 
concentration level is used, the concentrations shall be spaced 
to produce a gradation of toxic effects. 
 
(D) In the low, intermediate, and control exposure groups, 
the incidence of fatalities shall be low to absent, so as not to 
preclude a meaningful evaluation of the results. 
 
(4) Exposure chamber environmental conditions. The 
following environmental conditions in the exposure chamber are 
critical to the maintenance of the test animals: flow; 
temperature; relative humidity; lighting; and noise. 
 
(i) Filtered and conditioned air shall be used during 
exposure, to dilute the exhaust emissions, and during non- 
exposure periods to maintain environmental conditions that are 
free of trace gases, dusts, and microorganisms on the test 
animals. Twelve to fifteen air changes per hour will be provided 
at all times to whole-body-exposure chambers. The minimum air 
flow rate for head/nose-only exposure chambers will be a function 
of the number of animals and the average minute volume of the 
animals: 


 

Q

minimum

(L/min)=2  x  number of animals  x  average minute volume 


 

(see Cheng and Moss, 1989 in paragraph (f)(8) of this section). 
 


(ii) Recommended ranges of temperature for various species 
are given in the 

Guide.

 The recommended temperature ranges will 
be used for establishing temperature conditions of whole-body- 
exposure chambers. For rodents in whole-body-exposure chambers, 
the recommended temperature is 22 
 C +/^ 2 
 C and for rabbits, it 
is 20 
 C +/^ 3 
 C. Temperature ranges have not been established 
for head/nose-only tubes; however, recommended maximum 
temperature limits have been established at the Inhalation 
Toxicology Research Institute (see Barr, 1988 in paragraph (f)(1) 
of this section). Maximum temperature for rats and mice in 
head/nose-only tubes is 23 
 C. 
 
(iii) 

Relative humidity.

 The relative humidity in the 
chamber air is important for heat balance and shall be maintained 
between 40 percent and 60 percent, but in certain instances, this 
may not be practicable. Testers shall follow 

Guide

 recommends 
for a 30 percent to 70 percent relative humidity range for 
rodents in exposure chambers. 
 
(iv) 

Lighting.

 Light intensity of 30 foot candles at 3 ft. 
from the floor of the exposure facility is recommended (see Rao, 
1986 in paragraph (f)(16) of this section). 
 
(5) 

Exposure Conditions.

 Study animals shall be exposed to 
the test atmosphere on a repeated basis for at least 6 hours per 
day on a 7-day per week basis for the exposure period. However, 
based primarily on practical considerations, exposure on a 5-day-
per-week basis for a minimum of 6 hours per day is the minimum 
acceptable exposure period. 
 
(6) 

Exposure atmosphere.

 (i) The exposure atmosphere shall be held as constant as is practicable and must be monitored continuously or intermittently,
depending on the method of analysis, to ensure that exposure 
levels are at the target values or within stated limits during 
the exposure period. Sampling methodology will be determined 
based on the type of generation system and the type of exposure 
chamber system specified for the exposure study. 
 
(A) Integrated samples of test atmosphere aerosol shall be 
taken daily during the exposure period from a single 
representative sample port in the chamber near the breathing zone 
of the animals. Gas samples shall be taken daily to determine 
concentrations (ppm) of the major vapor components of the test 
atmosphere including CO, CO

2

, NO

X

, SO

2

, and total hydrocarbons. 
 
(B) To ensure that animals in different locations of the 
chamber receive a similar exposure atmosphere, distribution of an 
aerosol or vapor concentration in exposure chambers can be 
determined without animals during the developmental phase of the 
study, or it can be determined with animals early in the study. 
For head/nose-only exposure chambers, it may not be possible to 
monitor the chamber distribution during the exposure, because the 
exposure port contains the animal. 
 
(C) During the development of the emissions generation 
system, particle size analysis shall be performed to establish 
the stability of an aerosol concentration with respect to 
particle size. Over the course of the exposure, analysis shall 
be conducted as often as is necessary to determine the 
consistency of particle size distribution. 
 
(D) 

Chamber rise and fall times.

 The rise time required 
for the exposure concentration to reach 90 percent of the stable 
concentration after the generator is turned on, and the fall time 
when the chamber concentration decreases to 10 percent of the 
stable concentration after the generation system is stopped shall 
be determined in the developmental phase of the study. Time-
integrated samples collected for calculating exposure 
concentrations shall be taken after the rise time. The daily 
exposure time is exclusive of the rise or the fall time.

(ii) Instrumentation used for a given study will be 
determined based on the type of generation system and the type of 
exposure chamber system specified for the exposure study. 

(A) For exhaust studies, combustion gases shall be sampled 
by collecting exposure air in bags and then analyzing the 
collected air sample to determine major components of the 
combustion gas using gas analyzers. Exposure chambers can also 
be connected to gas analyzers directly by using sampling lines 
and switching valves. Samples can be taken more frequently using 
the latter method. Aerosol instruments, such as photometers, or 
time-integrated gravimetric determination may be used to 
determine the stability of any aerosol concentration in the 
chamber. 
 
(B) For evaporative emission studies, concentration of fuel 
vapors can usually be determined by using a gas chromatograph 
(GC) and/or infrared (IR) spectrometry. Grab samples for 
intermittent sampling can be taken from the chamber by using 
bubble samplers with the appropriate solvent to collect the 
vapors, or by collecting a small volume of air in a syringe. 
Intermediate or continuous monitoring of the chamber 
concentration is also possible by connecting the chamber with a 
GC or IR detector. 
 
(7) Monitoring chamber environmental conditions may be 
performed by a computer system or by exposure system operating 
personnel. 
 
(i) The flow-metering device used for the exposure chambers 
must be a continuous monitoring device, and actual flow 
measurements must be recorded at least every 30 minutes. 
Accuracy must be 

#

5 percent of full scale range. Measurement of 
air flow through the exposure chamber may be accomplished using 
any device that has sufficient range to accurately measure the 
air flow for the given chamber. Types of flow metering devices 
include rotameters, orifice meters, venturi meters, critical 
orifices, and turbinemeters (see Benedict, 1984 in paragraph 
(f)(4) and Spitzer, 1984 in paragraph (f)(17) of this section). 
 
(ii) 

Pressure.

 Pressure measurement may be accomplished 
using manometers, electronic pressure transducers, magnehelics, 
or similar devices (see Gillum, 1982 in paragraph (f)(10) of this 
section). Accuracy of the pressure device must be 

#

5 percent 
of full scale range. Pressure measurements must be continuous 
and recorded at least every 30 minutes. 
 
(iii) 

Temperature.

 The temperature of exposure chambers 
must be monitored continuously and recorded at least every 30 
minutes. Temperature may be measured using thermometers, RTD's, 
thermocouples, thermistors, or other devices (see Benedict, 1984 
in paragraph (f)(4) of this section). It is necessary to 
incorporate an alarm system into the temperature monitoring 
system. The exposure operators must be notified by the alarm 
system when the chamber temperature exceeds 26.7 
 C (80 
 F). The 
exposure must be discontinued and emergency procedures enacted to 
immediately reduce temperatures or remove test animals from high 
temperature environment when chamber temperatures exceed 29 
 C. 
Accuracy of the temperature monitoring device will be 

#

1 
 C for 
the temperature range of 20-30 
 C. 
 
(iv) 

Relative humidity.

 The relative humidity of exposure 
chambers must be monitored continuously and recorded at least 
every 30 minutes. Relative humidity may be measured using 
various devices (see Chaddock, 1985 in paragraph (f)(6) of this 
section). 
 
(v) Lighting shall be measured quarterly, or once at the 
beginning, middle, and end of the study for shorter studies. 
 
(vi) Noise level in the exposure chamber(s) shall be 
measured quarterly, or once at the beginning, middle, and end of 
the study for shorter studies. 
 
(vii) Oxygen content is critical, especially in nose-only 
chamber systems, and shall be greater than or equal to 19 percent 
in the test cages. An oxygen sensor shall be located at a single 
position in the test chamber and a lower alarm limit of 18 
percent shall be used to activate an alarm system.

Safety procedures and requirements. 

In the case of 
potentially explosive test substance concentrations, care shall 
be taken to avoid generating explosive atmospheres. 

(i) It is mandatory that the upper explosive limit (UEL) 
and lower explosive limit (LEL) for the fuel and/or fuel 
additive(s) that are being tested be determined. These limits 
can be found in the material safety data sheets (MSDS) for each 
substance and in various reference texts. The air concentration 
of the fuel or additive-base fuel mixture in the generation 
system, dilution/delivery system, and the exposure chamber system 
shall be calculated to ensure that explosive limits are not 
present. 

(ii) Storage, handling, and use of fuels or fuel/additive 
mixtures shall follow guidelines given in 29 CFR 1910.106. 

(iii) Monitoring for carbon monoxide (CO) levels is 
mandatory for combustion systems. CO shall be continuously 
monitored in the immediate area of the engine/vehicle system and 
in the exposure chamber(s). 

(iv) Air samples shall be taken quarterly in the immediate 
area of the vapor generation system and the exposure chamber 
system, or once at the beginning, middle, and end of the study 
for shorter studies. These samples shall be analyzed by methods 
described in paragraph (d)(6)(ii)(B) of this section. 

(v) With the presence of fuels and/or fuel additives, all 
electrical and electronic equipment must be grounded. Also, the 
dilution/delivery system and chamber exposure system must be 
grounded. Guidelines for grounding are given in 29 CFR 1910.304. 

(9) 

Quality control and quality assurance procedures

_(i) 

Standard operating procedures (SOPs).

 SOPs for 
exposure operations, sampling instruments, animal handling, and 
analytical methods shall be written during the developmental 
phase of the study. 

(ii) Technicians/operators shall be trained in exposure 
operation, maintenance, and documentation, as appropriate, and 
their training shall be documented. 

(iii) Flow meters, sampling instruments, and balances used 
in the inhalation experiments shall be calibrated with standards 
during the developmental phase to determine their sensitivity, 
detection limits, and linearity. During the exposure period, 
instruments shall be checked for calibration and documented to 
ensure that each instrument still functions properly. 

(iv) The mean exposure concentration shall be within 10 
percent of the target concentration on 90 percent or more of 
exposure days. The coefficient of variation shall be within 25 
percent of target on 90 percent or more of exposure days. For 
example, a manufacturer might determine a mean exposure 
concentration of its product's exposure emissions by identifying 
``marker'' compound(s) typical of the emissions of the fuel or 
fuel/additive mixture under study as a surrogate for the total of 
individual compounds in those exposure emissions. The 
manufacturer would note any concentration changes in the level of 
the ``marker'' compound(s) in the sample's daily emissions for 
biological testing. 

(v) The spatial variation of the chamber concentration 
shall be 10 percent, or less. If a higher spatial variation is 
observed during the developmental phase, then air mixing in the 
chamber shall be increased. In any case, animals shall be rotated 
among the various cages in the exposure chamber(s) to insure each 
animal's uniform exposure during the study. 

(e) 

Data and reporting. 

Data shall be summarized in 
tabular form, showing for each group the number of animals at the 
start of the test, the number of animals showing lesions, the 
types of lesions, and the percentage of animals displaying each 
type of lesion. 

(1) 

Treatment of results. 

All observed results, 
quantitative and incidental, shall be evaluated by an appropriate 
statistical method. Any generally accepted statistical method 
may be used; the statistical methods shall be selected during the 
design of the study.

(2) 

Evaluation of results. 

The findings of an inhalation 
toxicity study should be evaluated in conjunction with the 
findings of preceding studies and considered in terms of the

 79.62

Subchronic toxicity study with specific health effect assessments. 
 


(a) 

Purpose

_(1) 

General toxicity. 

This subchronic inhalation study is 
designed to determine a concentration-response relationship for 
potential toxic effects in rats resulting from continuous or 
repeated inhalation exposure to vehicle/engine emissions over a 
period of 90 days. A subgroup of perfusion-fixed animals is 
required, in addition to the main study population, for more 
exacting organ and tissue histology. This test will provide 
screening information on target organ toxicities and on 
concentration levels useful for running chronic studies and 
establishing exposure criteria. Initial information on effective 
concentrations/exposures of the test atmosphere may be determined 
from the literature of previous studies or through concentration 
range-finding trials prior to starting this study. This health 
effects screening test is not capable of directly determining 
those effects which have a long latency period for development 
(e.g., carcinogenicity and life-shortening), though it may permit 
the detremination of a no-observed-adverse-effect level, or 
NOAEL. 
 
(2) 

Specific health effects assessments (HEAs). 

These 
supplemental studies are designed to determine the potential for 
reproductive/teratologic, carcinogenic, mutagenic, and neurotoxic 
health effect outcomes from vehicle/engine emission exposures. 
They are done in combination with the subchronic toxicity study 
and paragraph (c) of this section or may be done separately as 
outlined by the appropriate test guideline.

(i) 

Fertility assessment/teratology. 

The fertility 
assessment is an 

in vivo 

study designed to provide information on 
potential health hazards to the fetus arising from the mother's 
repeated exposure to vehicle/engine emissions before and during 
her pregnancy. By including a mating of test animals, the study 
provides preliminary data on the effects of repeated 
vehicle/engine emissions exposure on gonadal function, 
conception, and fertility. The fertility assessment/teratology 
guideline is found in  79.63. 
 
(ii) 

Micronucleus (MN) Assay. 

The MN assay is an 

in vivo

 
cytogenetic test which gives information on potential 
carcinogenic and/or mutagenic effects of exposure to vehicle/
engine emissions. The MN assay detects damage to the chromosomes 
or mitotic apparatus of cells in the tissues of a test subject 
exposed repeatedly to vehicle/engine emissions. The assay is 
based on an increase in the frequency of micronucleated 
erythrocytes found in bone marrow from treated animals compared 
to that of control animals. The guideline for the MN assay is 
found in  79.64. 
 
(iii) 

Sister Chromatid Exchange (SCE) Assay. 

The SCE assay 
is an 

in vivo

 analysis which gives information on potential 
mutagenic and/or carcinogenic effects of exposure to 
vehicle/engine emissions. The assay detects the ability of a 
chemical to enhance the exchange of DNA between two sister 
chromatids of a duplicating chromosome. This assay uses 
peripheral blood lymphocytes isolated from an exposed rodent test 
species and grown to confluence in cell culture. The guideline 
for the SCE assay is found in  79.65. 
 
 
(iv) 

Neurotoxicity (NTX) measures. 

NTX measures include 
(A) histopathology of specified central and peripheral nervous 
system tissues taken from emission-exposed rodents, and (B) an 
assay of brain tissue levels of glial fibrillary acidic protein 
(GFAP), a major filament protein of astrocytes, from emission-
exposed rodents. The guidelines for the neurohistopathology and 
GFAP studies are found in  79.66 and  79.67, respectively. 
 
(b) 

Definitions. 

For the purposes of this section, the 
following definitions apply: 
 


No-observed-adverse-effect-level (NOAEL) 

means the maximum 
concentration used in a test which produces no observed adverse 
effects. A NOAEL is expressed in terms of weight or volume of 
test substance given daily per unit volume of air ( u g/L or ppm). 
 


Subchronic inhalation toxicity 

means the adverse effects 
occurring as a result of the continuous or repeated daily 
exposure of experimental animals to a chemical by inhalation for 
part (approximately 10 percent) of a life span. 
 
(c) 

Principle of the test method. 

As long as none of the 
requirements of any study are violated by the combination, one or 
more HEAs may be combined with the general toxicity study through 
concurrent exposures of their study populations and/or by sharing 
the analysis of the same animal subjects. Requirements 
duplicated in combined studies need not be repeated. Guidelines 
for combining HEAs with the general toxicity study are as 
follows. 
 
(1) 

Fertility assessment. 

(i) The number of study animals in the test population is 
increased when the fertility assessment is run concurrently with 
the 90-day toxicity study. A minimum of 40 females per test 
group shall undergo vaginal lavage daily for two weeks before the 
start of the exposure period. The resulting wet smears are 
examined to cull those animals which are acyclic. Twenty-five 
females shall be randomly assigned to a for-breeding group with 
the balance of females assigned to a group for histopathologic 
examination. 
 
(ii) All test groups are exposed over a period of 90 days 
to various concentrations of the test atmosphere for a minimum of 
six hours per day. After seven weeks of exposures, analysis of 
vaginal cell smears shall resume on a daily basis for the 25 for-
breeding females and shall continue for a period of four weeks or 
until each female in the group is confirmed pregnant. Following 
the ninth week of exposures, each for-breeding female is housed 
overnight with a single study male. Matings shall continue for 
as long as two weeks, or until pregnancy is confirmed (pregnancy 
day 0). Pregnant females are only exposed through day 15 of 
their pregnancy while daily exposures continue throughout the 
course of the study for non-pregnant females and study males. 
 
(iii) On pregnancy day 20, pregnant females are sacrificed 
and their uteri are examined. Pregnancy status and fetal effects 
are recorded as described in  79.63. At the end of the exposure 
period, all males and non-pregnant females are sacrificed and 
necropsied. Testes and epididymal tissue samples are taken from 
five perfusion-fixed test subjects and histopathological 
examinations are carried out on the remainder of the non-pregnant 
females and study males. 
 
(2) 

Carcinogenicity/mutagenicity


(C/M) assessment. 

When 
combined with the subchronic toxicity study, the main study 
population is used to perform both the 

in vivo

 MN and SCE assays. 
Because of the constant turnover of the cells to be analyzed in 
these assays, a separate study population may be used for this 
assessment. A study population needs only to be exposed a 
minimum of four weeks. At exposure's end, ten animals per 
exposure and control groups are anaesthetized and heart punctures 
are performed on all members. After separating blood components, 
individual lymphocyte cell cultures are set up for SCE analysis. 
One femur from each study subject is also removed and the marrow 
extracted. The marrow is smeared onto a glass slide, and stained 
for analysis of micronuclei in erythrocytes. 
 


(3) 

Neurotoxicity (NTX) measures. 

(i) When combined with this subchronic toxicity study, test 
animals designated for whole-body perfusion fixation/lung 
histology and exposed as part of the main animal population are 
used to perform the neurohistology portion of these measures. 
After the last exposure period, a minimum of ten animals from 
each exposure group shall be preserved 

in situ

 with fixative. 
Sections of brain, spinal cord, and proximal sciatic or tibial 
nerve are then cut, processed further in formalin, and mounted 
for viewing under a light microscope. Fibers from the sciatic or 
tibial nerve sample are teased apart for further analysis under 
the microscope. 
 
(ii) 

GFAP assay. 

After the last exposure period, a minimum 
of ten rodents from each exposure group shall be sacrificed, and 
their brains excised and divided into regions. The tissue 
samples are then applied to filter paper, washed with anti-GFAP 
antibody, and visualized with a radio-labelled Protein A. The 
filters are quantified for degree of immunoreactivity between the 
antibody and GFAP in the tissue samples. A non-radioactive ELISA 
format is also referenced in the GFAP guideline cited in 
paragraph (a)(2)(iv) of this section. Note: Because the GFAP 
assay requires fresh, 

i.e., 

non-preserved, brain tissue, the 
number of test animals may need to be increased to provide an 
adequate number of test subjects to complete the histopathology 
requirements of both the GFAP and the general toxicity portion of 
the 90-day inhalation study.

(iii) The start of the exposure period for the NTX measures 
study population may be staggered from that of the main study 
group to more evenly distribute the analytical work required in 
both study populations. The exposures would remain the same in 
all other respects. 
 
(d) 

Test procedures_

(1) 

Animal selection_

(i) 

Species and sex. 

The rat is the recommended species. 
If another rodent species is used, the tester shall provide 
justification for its selection. Both sexes shall be used in any 
assessment unless it is demonstrated that one sex is refractory 
to the effects of exposure. 
 
(ii) 

Age and number. 

Rats shall be at least ten weeks of 
age at the beginning of the study exposure. The number of animals 
necessary for individual health effect outcomes is as follows: 
 
(A) Thirty rodents per concentration level/group, fifteen 
of each sex, shall be used to satisfy the reporting requirements 
of the 90-day toxicity study. Ten animals per concentration 
level/group shall be designated for whole body perfusion with 
fixative (by gravity) for lung studies, and neurohistology and 
testes studies, as appropriate. 
 
(B) Forty rodents, 25 females and ten males shall be added 
for each test concentration or control group when combining a 90-day toxicity study with a fertility assessment.

 
(C) The tester shall provide a group of 10 animals (five 
animals per sex per experimental/control groups) in addition to 
the main test population when performing the GFAP neurotoxicity 
HEA. 
 
(2) 

Recovery group. 

The manufacturer shall include an 
group of 20 animals (10 animals per sex) in the test population, 
exposing them to the highest concentration level for the entire 
length of the study's exposure period. This group shall then be 
observed for reversibility, persistence, or delayed occurrence of 
toxic effects during a post-exposure period of not less than 28 
days. 
 
(3) 

Inhalation exposure. 

(i) All data developed within this study shall be in 
accordance with good laboratory practice provisions under  
79.60. 
 
(ii) The general conduct of this study shall be in 
accordance with the vehicle emissions inhalation exposure 
guideline in  79.61. 
 
(4) 

Observation of animals.

 (i) All toxicological (e.g., weight loss) and neurological 
signs (e.g., motor disturbance) shall be recorded frequently 
enough to observe any abnormality, and not less than weekly for 
all study animals. Animals shall be weighed weekly. 
 
(ii) The following is a minimal list of measures that shall 
be noted: 
 
(A) Body weight; 
 
(B) Subject's reactivity to general stimuli such as removal 
from the cage or handling; 
 
(C) Description, incidence, and severity of any 
convulsions, tremors, or abnormal motor movements in the home 
cage; 
 
(D) Descriptions and incidence of posture and gait 
abnormalities observed in the home cage; 
 
(E) Description and incidence of any unusual or abnormal 
behaviors, excessive or repetitive actions (stereotypies), 
emaciation, dehydration, hypotonia or hypertonia, altered fur 
appearance, red or crusty deposits around the eyes, nose, or 
mouth, and any other observations that may facilitate 
interpretation of the data.

(iii) Any animal which dies during the test is necropsied 
as soon as possible after discovery. 
 
(5) 

Clinical examinations.

 (i) The following examinations shall be performed on the 
twenty animals designated as the 90-day study population, 
exclusive of pregnant dams and those study animals targeted for 
perfusion by gravity: 
 
(A) The following hematology determinations shall be 
carried out at least two times during the test period (after 30 
days of exposure and just prior to terminal sacrifice at the end 
of the exposure period): hematocrit, hemoglobin concentration, 
erythrocyte count, total and differential leukocyte count, and a 
measure of clotting potential such as prothrombin time, 
thromboplastin time, or platelet count. 
 
(B) Clinical biochemistry determinations on blood shall be 
carried out at least two times during the test period, after 30 
days of exposure and just prior to terminal sacrifice at the end 
of the exposure period, on all groups of animals including 
concurrent controls. Clinical biochemical testing shall include 
assessment of electrolyte balance, carbohydrate metabolism, and 
liver and kidney function. The selection of specific tests will 
be influenced by observations on the mode of action of the 
substance. In the absence of more specific tests, the following 
determinations may be made: calcium, phosphorus, chloride, 
sodium, potassium, fasting glucose (with period of fasting 
appropriate to the species), serum alanine aminotransferase, 
serum aspartate aminotransferase, sorbitol dehydrogenase, gamma 
glutamyl transpeptidase, urea nitrogen, albumen, blood 
creatinine, methemoglobin, bile acids, total bilirubin, and total 
serum protein measurements. Additional clinical biochemistry 
shall be employed, where necessary, to extend the investigation 
of observed effects, e.g., analyses of lipids, hormones, acid/base 
balance, and cholinesterase activity. 
 
(ii) The following examinations shall initially be 
performed on the high concentration and control groups only: 
 
(A) Ophthalmological examination, using an ophthalmoscope 
or equivalent suitable equipment, shall be made prior to exposure 
to the test substance and at the termination of the study. If 
changes in the eyes are detected, all animals shall be examined. 
 
(B) Urinalysis is not required on a routine basis, but 
shall be done when there is an indication based on expected 
and/or observed toxicity. 
 
(iii) Preservation by whole-body perfusion of fixative into 
the anaesthetized animal for lung histology of ten animals from 
the 90-day study population for each experimental and control 
group. 
 
(6) 

Gross pathology. 

With the exception of the whole body 
perfusion-fixed test animals cited in paragraph (d)(1)(ii)(A) of 
this section, all rodents shall be subjected to a full gross 
necropsy which includes examination of the external surface of 
the body, all orifices and the cranial, thoracic, and abdominal 
cavities and their contents. Gross pathology shall be performed 
on the following organs and tissues: 
 
(i) The liver, kidneys, lungs, adrenals, brain, and gonads, 
including uterus, ovaries, testes, epididymides, seminal vesicles 
(with coagulating glands), and prostate, constitute the group of 
target organs for histology and shall be weighed as soon as 
possible after dissection to avoid drying. In addition, for 
other than rodent test species, the thyroid with parathyroids, 
when present, shall also be weighed as soon as possible after 
dissection to avoid drying. 
 
(ii) The following organs and tissues, or representative 
samples thereof, shall be preserved in a suitable medium for 
possible future histopathological examination: All gross lesions; 
lungs_which shall be removed intact, weighed, and treated with 
a suitable fixative to ensure that lung structure is maintained 
(perfusion with the fixative is considered to be an effective 
procedure); nasopharyngeal tissues; brain_including sections of 
medulla/pons, cerebellar cortex, and cerebral cortex; pituitary; 
thyroid/parathyroid; thymus; trachea; heart; sternum with bone 
marrow; salivary glands; liver; spleen; kidneys; adrenals;

 79.63 

Fertility assessment/teratology. 
 
 

(a) 

Purpose.

 Fertility assessment/teratology is an 

in vivo

 
study designed to provide information on potential health hazards 
to the fetus arising from the mother's repeated inhalation 
exposure to vehicle/engine emissions before and during her 
pregnancy. By including a mating of test animals, the study 
provides preliminary data on the effects of repeated 
vehicle/engine emissions exposure on gonadal function, 
conception, and fertility. Since this is a one-generation test 
that ends with examination of full-term fetuses, but not of live 
pups, it is not capable of determining effects on reproductive 
development which would only be detected in viable offspring of 
treated parents. 
 
 (b) 

Definitions.

 For the purposes of this section, the 
following definitions apply: 
 


Developmental toxicity

 means the ability of an agent to induce 

in 
utero

 death, structural or functional abnormalities, or growth 
retardation after contact with the pregnant animal. 
 


Estrous cycle

 means the periodic recurrence of the biological 
phases of the female reproductive system which prepare the animal 
for conception and the development of offspring. The phases of 
the estrous cycle for a particular animal can be characterized by 
the general condition of the cells present in the vagina and the 
presence or absence of various cell types.

Vaginal cytology evaluation

 means the use of wet vaginal cell 
smears to determine the phase of a test animal's estrous cycle 
and the potential for adverse exposure effects on the regularity 
of the animal's cycle. In the rat, common cell types found in 
the smears correlate well with the various stages of the estrous 
cycle and to changes occurring in the reproductive tract.

Principle of the test method.

 (1) For a two week period before exposures start, daily vaginal cell smears are examined from a surplus of female test
animals to identify and cull those females which are acyclic. 
After culling, testers shall randomly assign at each exposure 
concentration (including unexposed) a minimum of twenty-five 
females for breeding and fifteen non-bred females for later 
histologic evaluation. Test animals shall be exposed by 
inhalation to graduated concentrations of the test atmosphere for 
a minimum of six hours per day over the next 13 weeks. Males and 
females in both test and control groups are mated after nine 
weeks of exposure. Exposures for pregnant females continue 
through gestation day 15, while exposures for males and all non- 
pregnant females shall continue for the full exposure period. 
 
 (2) Beginning two weeks before the start of the mating 
period, daily vaginal smears resume for all to-be-bred females to 
characterize their estrous cycles. This will continue for four 
weeks or until a rat's pregnancy is confirmed, 

i.e.

, day 0, by 
the presence of sperm in the cell smear. On pregnancy day 20, 
shortly before the expected date of delivery, each pregnant 
female is sacrificed, her uterus removed, and the contents 
examined for embryonic or fetal deaths, and live fetuses. At the 
end of the exposure period, males and all non-pregnant females 
shall be weighed, and various organs and tissues, as appropriate, 
shall be removed and weighed, fixed with stain, and sectioned for 
viewing under a light microscope. 
 
 (3) This assay may be done separately or in combination 
with the subchronic toxicity study, pursuant to the provisions in 
 79.62. 
 
 (d) 

Limit test.

 If a test at one dose level of the highest 
concentration that can be achieved while maintaining a particle 
size distribution with a mass median aerodynamic diameter (MMAD) 
of 4 micrometers ( u m) or less, using the procedures described in 
section 79.60 of this part produces no observable toxic effects 
and if toxicity would not be expected based upon data of 
structurally related compounds, then a full study using three 
dose levels might not be necessary. Expected human exposure 
though may indicate the need for a higher dose level. 
 
 (e) 

Test procedures

_(1) 

Animal selection

_(i) 

Species and strain.

 The rat is the preferred species. Strains with low fecundity shall not be used and the candidate species shall be characterized
for its sensitivity to developmental toxins. If another rodent species is used, the tester shall provide justification
for its selection. 
 
 (ii) Animals shall be a minimum of 10 weeks old at the 
start of the exposure period. 
 
 (iii) 

Number and sex.

 Each test and control group shall 
have a minimum of 25 males and 40 females. In order to ensure 
that sufficient pups are produced to permit meaningful evaluation 
of the potential developmental toxicity of the test substance, 
twenty pregnant test animals are required for each exposure and 
control level. 
 
 (2) 

Observation period.

 The observation period shall be 13 
weeks, at a minimum. 
 
 (3) 

Concentration levels and concentration selection.

 (i) To select the appropriate concentration levels, a pilot or trial study may be advisable. Since pregnant animals
have an increased minute ventilation as compared to non-pregnant animals, it is recommended that the trial study
be conducted in pregnant animals. Similarly, since presumably the minute ventilation will vary with progression
of pregnancy, the animals should be exposed during the same period of gestation as in the main study. It is not always
necessary, though, to carry out a trial study in pregnant animals. Comparisons between the results of a trial study
in non-pregnant animals, and the main study in pregnant animals will demonstrate whether or not the test substance
is more toxic in pregnant animals. In the trial study, the concentration producing embryonic or fetal lethalities
or maternal toxicity should be determined. 
 
 (ii) The highest concentration level shall induce some 
overt maternal toxicity such as reduced body weight or body 
weight gain, but not more than 10 percent maternal deaths. 
 
 (iii) The lowest concentration level shall not produce any 
grossly observable evidence of either maternal or developmental 
toxicity. 
 
 (4) 

Inhalation exposure.

 (i) All data developed within this study shall be in accordance with good laboratory practice provisions under  79.60.

 
 (ii) The general conduct of this study shall be in 
accordance with the vehicle emissions inhalation exposure 
guideline in  79.61. 
 
 (f) 

Test performance

_(1) 

Study conduct.

 Directions specific to this study are:

<TEXT>
 

(i) The duration of exposure shall be at least six hours 
daily, allowing appropriate additional time for chamber 
equilibrium. 
 
 (ii) Where an exposure chamber is used, its design shall 
minimize crowding of the test animals. This is best accomplished 
by individual caging. 
 
 (iii) Pregnant animals shall not be subjected to beyond the 
minimum amount of stress. Since whole-body exposure appears to be 
the least stressful mode of exposure, it is the preferred method. 
In general oronasal or head-only exposure, which is sometimes 
used to avoid concurrent exposure by the dermal or oral routes, 
is not recommended because of the associated stress accompanying 
the restraining of the animals. However, there may be specific 
instances where it may be more appropriate than whole-body 
exposure. The tester shall provide justification/reasoning for 
its selection. 
 
 (iv) Measurements shall be made at least every other day of 
food consumption for all animals in the study. Males and females 
shall be weighed on the first day of exposure and 2-3 times per 
week thereafter, except for pregnant dams. 
 
 (v) The test animal housing, mating, and exposure chambers 
shall be operated on a twenty-four hour lighting schedule, with 
twelve hours of light and twelve hours of darkness. Test animal 
exposure shall only occur during the light portion of the cycle. 
 (vi) Signs of toxicity shall be recorded as they are 
observed including the time of onset, degree, and duration. 
 
 (vii) Females showing signs of abortion or premature 
delivery shall be sacrificed and subjected to a thorough 
macroscopic examination. 
 
 (viii) Animals that die or are euthanized because of 
morbidity will be necropsied promptly. 
 
 (2) 

Vaginal cytology.

 (i) For a two week period before the mating period starts, each female in the to-be-bred population shall undergo a
daily saline vaginal lavage. Two wet cell smears from this lavage shall be examined daily for each subject to determine
a baseline pattern of estrus. Testers shall avoid excessive handling and roughness in obtaining the vaginal cell
samples, as this may induce a condition of pseudo-pregnancy in the test animals. 
 
 (ii) This will continue for four weeks or until day 0 of a 
rat's pregnancy is confirmed by the presence of sperm in the cell 
smear. 
 
 (3) 

Mating and fertility assessment.

 (i) Beginning nine weeks after the start of exposure, each exposed and control group female (exclusive of the histology
group females) shall be paired during non-exposure hours with a male from the same exposure concentration group.
Matings shall continue for a period of two weeks, or until all mated females are determined to be pregnant. Mating pairs
shall be clearly identified. 
 
 (ii) Each morning, including weekends, cages shall be 
examined for the presence of a sperm plug. When found, this 
shall mark gestation day 0 and pregnancy shall be confirmed by 
the presence of sperm in the day's wet vaginal cell smears. 
 
 (iii) Two weeks after mating is begun, or as females are 
determined to be pregnant, bred animals are returned to pre-mating housing. Daily exposures continues through gestation
day 
15 for all pregnant females or through the balance of the 
exposure period for non-pregnant females and all males. 
 
 (iv) Those pairs which fail to mate shall be evaluated in 
the course of the study to determine the cause of the apparent 
infertility. This may involve such procedures as additional 
opportunities to mate with a proven fertile partner, histological 
examination of the reproductive organs, and, in males, 
examination of the spermatogenic cycles. The stage of estrus for 
each non-pregnant female in the breeding group will be determined 
at the end of the exposure period. 
 
 (4) All animals in the histology group shall be subject to 
histopathologic examination at the end of the study's exposure 
period. 
 
 (g) 

Treatment of results.

 (1) All observed results, quantitative and incidental, shall be evaluated by an appropriate statistical method.
The specific methods, including consideration of statistical power, shall be selected during the design of the study.

 
 (2) Data and reporting. In addition to the reporting 
requirements specified under   79.60 and 79.61, the final test 
report must include the following information: 
 
 (i) 

Gross necropsy.

 (A) All animals shall be subjected to a full necropsy which includes examination of the external surface of the body,
all orifices, and the cranial, thoracic, and abdominal cavities and their contents. Special attention shall be directed
to the organs of the reproductive system. 
 
 (B) The liver, kidneys, adrenals, pituitary, uterus, 
vagina, ovaries, testes, epididymides and seminal vesicles (with 
coagulating glands), and prostate shall be weighed wet, as soon 
as possible after dissection, to avoid drying.

(

i

) At the time of sacrifice on gestation day 20 or at 
death during the study, each dam shall be examined 
macroscopically for any structural abnormalities or pathological 
changes which may have influenced the pregnancy. 
 
 (

ii

) The contents of the uterus shall be examined for 
embryonic or fetal deaths and the number of viable fetuses. 
Gravid uterine weights need not be obtained from dead animals 
where decomposition has occurred. The degree of resorption shall 
be described in order to help estimate the relative time of 
death. 
 
 (

iii

) The number of corpora lutea shall be determined in 
each pregnant dam. 
 
 (

iv

) Each fetus shall be weighed, all weights recorded, and 
mean fetal weights determined. 
 
 (

v

) Each fetus shall be examined externally and the sex 
determined. 
 
 (

vi

) One-half of the rat fetuses in each litter shall be 
examined for skeletal anomalies, and the remaining half shall be 
examined for soft tissue anomalies, using appropriate methods. 
 
 (ii) 

Histopathology.

 (A) Histopathology on vagina, uterus, ovaries, testes, epididymides, seminal vesicles, and prostate as appropriate
for all males and histology group females in the control and high concentration groups and for all animals that died
or were euthanized during the study. If abnormalities or equivocal results are seen in any of these organs/tissues,
the same organ/tissue from test animals in lower concentration groups shall be examined.






Note: 

Testes, seminal vesicles, epididymides, and ovaries, at a minimum, shall be examined in perfusion-fixed (pressure
or gravity method) test subjects, when available. 
 


 
(B) All gross lesions in all study animals shall be 
examined. 
 
 (C) As noted under mating procedures, reproductive organs 
of animals suspected of infertility shall be subject to 
microscopic examination. 
 
 (D) The following organs and tissues, or representative 
samples thereof, shall be preserved in a suitable medium for 
future histopathological examination: all gross lesions; vagina; 
uterus; ovaries; testes; epididymides; seminal vesicles; 
prostate; liver; and kidneys/adrenals. 
 
 (3) 

Evaluation of results.

 (i) The findings of a developmental toxicity study shall be evaluated in terms of the observed effects and the exposure
levels producing effects. It is necessary to consider the historical developmental toxicity data on the species/strain
tested. 
 
 (ii) There are several criteria for determining a positive 
result for reproductive/teratologic effects; a statistically 
significant dose-related decrease in the weight of the testes for 
treated subjects over control subjects, a decrease in neonatal 
viability, a significant change in the presence of soft tissue or 
skeletal abnormalities, or an increased rate of embryonic or 
fetal resorption or death. Other criteria, e.g., lengthening of 
the estrous cycle or the time spent in any one stage of estrus, 
changes in the proportion of viable male vs female fetuses or 
offspring, the number and type of cells in vaginal smears, or 
pathologic changes found during gross or microscopic examination 
of male or female reproductive organs may be based upon detection 
of a reproducible and statistically significant positive response 
for that evaluation parameter. A positive result indicates that, 
under the test conditions, the test substance does induce 
reproductive organ or fetal toxicity in the test species. 
 
 (iii) A test substance which does not produce either a 
statistically significant dose-related change in the reproductive 
organs or cycle or a statistically significant and reproducible 
positive response at any one of the test points may not induce 
reproductive organ toxicity in this test species, but further 
investigation , e.g., to establish absorption and bioavailability 
of the test substance, should be considered. 
 
 (h) 

Test report.

 In addition to the reporting requirements 
as specified under 40 CFR 79.60 and the vehicle emissions 
inhalation toxicity guideline as published in 40 CFR 79.61, the 
following specific information shall be reported:

 79.64

 In vivo micronucleus assay.



(a) 

Purpose.

 The micronucleus assay is an 

in vivo

 cytogenetic test which uses erythrocytes in the bone marrow of rodents to detect chemical damage to the chromosomes
or mitotic apparatus of mammalian cells. As the erythroblast develops into an erythrocyte (red blood cell), its main
nucleus is extruded and may leave a micronucleus in the cell body; a few micronuclei form under normal conditions in
blood elements. This assay is based on an increase in the frequency of micronucleated erythrocytes found in bone marrow
from treated animals compared to that of control animals. The visualization of micronuclei is facilitated in these
cells because they lack a main nucleus.

(b) 

Definitions.

 For the purposes of this section the following definitions apply:



Micronuclei

 mean small particles consisting of acentric fragments of chromosomes or entire chromosomes, which lag behind at
anaphase of cell division. After telophase, these fragments may not be included in the nuclei of daughter cells and
form single or multiple micronuclei in the cytoplasm.



Polychromatic erythrocyte

 (PCE) means an immature red blood cell that, because it contains RNA, can be differentiated by appropriate staining
techniques from a normochromatic erythrocyte (NCE), which lacks RNA. In one to two days, a PCE matures into a NCE.

(c) 

Test method

_(1) 

Principle of the test method.

 (i) Groups of rodents are exposed by the inhalation route for a minimum of 6 hours/day over a period of not less than 28
days to three or more concentrations of a test substance in air. Groups of animals are sacrificed at the end of the exposure
period and femoral bone marrow is extracted. The bone marrow is then smeared onto glass slides, stained, and PCEs are
scored for micronuclei. Researchers may need to run a trial at the highest tolerated concentration of the test atmosphere
to optimize the sample collection time for micronucleated cells.

(ii) This assay may be done separately or in combination with the subchronic toxicity study, pursuant to the provisions
in  79.62.

(2) 

Species and strain.

 (i) The rat is the recommended test animal. Other rodent species may be used in this assay, but use of that species will
be justified by the tester.

(ii) If a strain of mouse is used in this assay, the tester shall sample peripheral blood from an appropriate site on
the test animal, e.g., the tail vein, as a source of normochromatic erythrocytes. Results shall be reported as outlined
later in this guideline with ``normochromatic'' interchanged for ``polychromatic'', where specified.

(3) 

Animal number and sex.

 At least five female and five male animals per experimental/sample and control group shall be used. The use of a single
sex or a smaller number of animals shall be justified.

(4) 

Positive control group.

 A single concentration of a compound known to produce micronuclei 

in vivo

 is adequate as a positive control if it shows a significant response at any one time point; additional concentration
levels may be used. To select an appropriate concentration level, a pilot or trial study may be advisable. Initially,
one concentration of the test substance may be used, the maximum tolerated dose or that producing some indication
of toxicity, e.g., a drop in the ratio of polychromatic to normochromatic erythrocytes. Intraperitoneal injection
of 1,2-dimethyl-benz-anthracene or benzene are examples of positive control exposures. A concentration of 50-80
percent of an LD50 may be a suitable guide.

(d) 

Test performance

_(1) 

Inhalation exposure.

 (i) All data developed within this study shall be in accordance with good laboratory practice provisions under  79.60.

(ii) The general conduct of this study shall be in accordance with the vehicle emissions inhalation exposure guideline
in  79.61.

(2) 

Preparation of slides and sampling times.

 Within twenty-four hours of the last exposure, test animals will be sacrificed. One femur from each test animal will
be removed and placed in fetal bovine serum. The bone marrow is removed, cells processed, and two bone marrow smears
are made for each animal on glass microscope slides. The slides are stained with acridine- orange (AO) or another appropriate
stain (Giemsa + Wright's, etc.) and examined under a microscope.

(3) 

Analysis. 

Slides shall be coded for study before 
microscopic analysis. At least 1,000 first-division erythrocytes 
per animal shall be scored for the incidence of micronuclei. 
Sexes will be analyzed separately. 

(e) 

Data and report_

(1) 

Treatment of results. 

In addition to the reporting 
requirements specified under   79.60 and 79.61, the final test 
report must include the criteria for scoring micronuclei. 
Individual data shall be presented in a tabular form including 
both positive and negative controls and experimental groups. The 
number of polychromatic erythrocytes scored, the number of 
micronucleated erythrocytes, the percentage of micronucleated 
cells, and, where applicable, the percentage of micronucleated 
erythrocytes shall be listed separately for each experimental and 
control animal. Absolute numbers shall be included if 
percentages are reported. 
 
(2) 

Interpretation of data. 

(i) There are several criteria for determining a positive 
response, one of which is a statistically significant 
dose-related increase in the number of micronucleated 
polychromatic erythrocytes. Another criterion may be based upon 
detection of a reproducible and statistically significant 
positive response for at least one of the test substance 
concentrations. 

 (ii) A test substance which does not produce either a 
statistically significant dose-related increase in the number of 
micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes or a statistically 
significant and reproducible positive response at any one of the 
test points is considered nonmutagenic in this system. 
 
 (3) 

Test evaluation. 

(i) Positive results in the micronucleus test provide 
information on the ability of a chemical to induce micronuclei in 
erythrocytes of the test species under the conditions of the 
test. This damage may have been the result of chromosomal damage 
or damage to the mitotic apparatus. 
 
 
(ii) Negative results indicate that under the test 
conditions the test substance does not produce micronuclei in the 
bone marrow of the test species. 
 
 (f) 

Test report. 

In addition to the reporting 
recommendations as specified under  79.60, the following 
specific information shall be reported: 
 
 (1) Test atmosphere concentration(s) used and rationale for 
concentration selection. 
 
 (2) Rationale for and description of treatment and sampling 
schedules, toxicity data, negative and positive controls. 
 
 (3) Historical control data (negative and positive), if 
available. 
 
 (4) Details of the protocol used for slide preparation. 
 
 (5) Criteria for identifying micronucleated erythrocytes. 
 
 (6) Micronucleus analysis by animal and by group for each 
concentration (sexes analyzed separately). 
 
 (i) Ratio of polychromatic to normochromatic erythrocytes. 
 
 (ii) Number of polychromatic erythrocytes with micronuclei. 
 
 (iii) Number of polychromatic erythrocytes scored. 
 
 (7) Statistical methodology chosen for test analysis.

 79.65 

In vivo sister chromatid exchange assay. 
 
 

(a) 

Purpose. 

The 

in vivo 

sister chromatid exchange (SCE) 
assay detects the ability of a chemical to enhance the exchange 
of DNA between two sister chromatids of a duplicating chromosome. 
The most commonly used assays employ mammalian bone marrow cells 
or peripheral blood lymphocytes, often from rodent species. 
 
 (b) 

Definitions. 

For the purposes of this section, the 
following definitions apply: 
 


C-metaphase 

means a state of arrested cell growth typically seen 
after treatment with a spindle inhibitor, 

i.e., 

colchicine. 
 


Sister chromatid exchange 

means a reciprocal interchange of the 
two chromatid arms within a single chromosome. This exchange is 
visualized during the metaphase portion of the cell cycle and 
presumably requires the enzymatic incision, translocation and 
ligation of at least two DNA helices. 
 
(c) 

Test method_

(1) 

Principle of the test method. 

(i) Groups of rodents are exposed by the inhalation route 
for a minimum of 6 hours/day over a period of not less than 28 
days to three or more concentrations of a test substance in air. 
Groups of animals are sacrificed at the end of the exposure 
period and blood lymphocyte cell cultures are prepared from study 
animals. Cell growth is suspended after a time and cells are 
harvested, fixed and stained before scoring for SCEs. 
Researchers may need to run a trial at the highest tolerated 
concentration of the test atmosphere to optimize the sample 
collection time for second division metaphase cells. 
 
 (ii) This assay may be done separately or in combination 
with the subchronic toxicity study, pursuant to the provisions in 
 79.62. 
 
 (2) 

Description. 

(i) The method described here employs peripheral blood 
lymphocytes (PBL) of laboratory rodents exposed to the test 
atmosphere. 
 
 (ii) Within twenty-four hours of the last exposure, test 
animal lymphocytes are obtained by heart puncture and duplicate 
cell cultures are started for each animal. Cultures are grown in 
bromo-deoxyuridine (BrdU), and then a spindle inhibitor (e.g., 
colchicine) is added to arrest cell growth. Cells are harvested, 
fixed, and stained and their chromosomes are scored for SCEs. 
 
 (3) 

Species and strain. 

The rat is the recommended test 
animal. Other rodent species may be used in this assay, but use 
of that species will be justified by the tester. 
 
 (4) 

Animal number and sex. 

At least five female and five 
male animals per experimental and control group shall be used. 
The use of a single sex or different number of animals shall be 
justified.

(5) 

Positive control group.

 A single concentration of a 
compound known to produce SCEs 

in vivo

 is adequate as a positive 
control if it shows a significant response at any one time point; 
additional concentration levels may be used. To select an 
appropriate concentration level, a pilot or trial study may be 
advisable. Initially, one concentration of the test substance 
may be used, the maximum tolerated dose or that producing some 
indication of toxicity as evidenced by animal morbidity 
(including death) or target cell toxicity. Intraperitoneal 
injection of 1,2-dimethyl-benz-anthracene or benzene are examples 
of positive control exposures. A concentration of 50-80 percent 
of an LD50 would also be a suitable guide. 
 
(6) 

Inhalation exposure.

 (i) All data developed within this study shall be in 
accordance with good laboratory practice provisions under  
79.60. 

(ii) The general conduct of this study shall be in 
accordance with the vehicle emissions inhalation exposure 
guideline in  79.61. 
 
(d) 

Test performance_

(1) 

Treatment.

 At the conclusion of the exposure period, 
all test animals are anaesthetized and heart punctures are 
performed. Lymphocytes are isolated over a Ficoll gradient and 
replicate cell cultures are started for each animal. After some 
21 hours, the cells are treated with BrdU and returned to 
incubation. The following day, a spindle inhibitor (e.g., 
colchicine) is added to arrest cell growth in c-metaphase. Cells 
are harvested 4 hours later and second-division metaphase cells 
are washed and fixed in methanol:acetic acid, stained, and 
chromosome preparations are scored for SCEs. 
 
(2) 

Staining method.

 Staining of slides to reveal SCEs can 
be performed according to any of several protocols. However, the 
fluorescence plus Giemsa method is recommended. 
 
(3) 

Number of cells scored.

 (i) A minimum of 25 well-stained, second-division metaphase 
cells shall be scored for each animal for each cell type. 
 
(ii) At least 100 consecutive metaphase cells shall be 
scored for the number of first, second, and third division 
metaphases for each animal for each cell type. 
 
(iii) At least 1000 consecutive PBL's shall be scored for 
the number of metaphase cells present. 
 
(iv) The number of cells to be analyzed per animal shall be 
based upon the number of animals used, the negative control 
frequency, the pre-determined sensitivity and the power chosen 
for the test. Slides shall be coded before microscopic analysis. 

(e) 

Data and report_

(1) 

Treatment of results.

 In addition to the reporting 
requirements specified under   79.60 and 61, data shall be 
presented in tabular form, providing scores for both the number 
of SCE for each metaphase. Differences among animals within each 
group shall be considered before making comparisons between 
treated and control groups. 
 
(2) 

Statistical evaluation.

 Data shall be evaluated by 
appropriate statistical methods. 
 
 (3) 

Interpretation of results.

 (i) There are several criteria for determining a positive 
result, one of which is a statistically significant dose-related 
increase in the number of SCE. Another criterion may be based 
upon detection of a reproducible and statistically significant 
positive response for at least one of the test concentrations. 
 
(ii) A test substance which does not produce either a 
statistically significant dose-related increase in the number of 
SCE or a statistically significant and reproducible positive 
response at any one of the test concentrations is considered not 
to induce rearrangements of DNA segments in this system. 
 
(iii) Both biological and statistical significance shall be 
considered together in the evaluation.

Test evaluation.

 (i) A positive result in the 

in vivo

 SCE assay for either, 
or both, the lung or lymphocyte cultures indicates that under the 
test conditions the test substance induces reciprocal 
interchanges of DNA in duplicating chromosomes from lung or

(ii) Negative results indicate that under the test 
conditions the test substance does not induce reciprocal 
interchanges in lung or lymphocyte cells of the test species.

Neuropathology assessment. 
 


(a) 

Purpose.

 (1) The histopathological and biochemical techniques in 
this guideline are designed to develop data in animals on 
morphologic changes in the nervous system associated with 
repeated inhalation exposures to motor vehicle emissions. These 
tests are not intended to provide a detailed evaluation of 
neurotoxicity. Neuropathological evaluation should be 
complemented by other neurotoxicity studies, e.g. behavioral and 
neurophysiological studies and/or general toxicity testing, to 
more completely assess the neurotoxic potential of an exposure. 
 
(2) [Reserved]

(b) 

Definition.

 Neurotoxicity (NTX) or a neurotoxic effect 
is an adverse change in the structure or function of the nervous 
system following exposure to a chemical substance.

(c) 

Principle of the test method. 

(1) Laboratory rodents are exposed to one of several 
concentration levels of a test atmosphere for at least six hours 
daily over a period of 90 days. At the end of the exposure 
period, the animals are anaesthetized, perfused 

in situ

 with 
fixative, and tissues in the nervous system are examined grossly 
and prepared for microscopic examination. Starting with the 
highest dosage level, tissues are examined under the light 
microscope for morphologic changes, until a no-observed-adverse-
effect level is determined. In cases where light microscopy has 
revealed neuropathology, the NOAEL may be confirmed by electron 
microscopy. 
 
 (2) The tests described herein may be combined with any 
other toxicity study, as long as none of the requirements of 
either are violated by the combination. Specifically, this assay 
may be combined with a subchronic toxicity study, pursuant to 
provisions in  79.62. 
 
 (d) 

Limit test. 

If a test at one dose level of the highest 
concentration that can be achieved while maintaining a particle 
size distribution with a mass median aerodynamic diameter (MMAD) 
of 4 micrometers ( u m) or less, using the procedures described in 
paragraph (a) of this section, produces no observable toxic 
effects and if toxicity would not be expected based upon data of 
structurally related compounds, then a full study using three 
dose levels might not be necessary. Expected human exposure 
though may indicate the need for a higher dose level. 
 
 (e) 

Test procedures

_(1) 

Animal selection_

(i) 

Species and strain. 

Testing shall be performed in the 
species being used in other NTX tests. A standard strain of 
laboratory rat is recommended. The choice of species shall take 
into consideration such factors as the comparative metabolism of 
the chemical and species sensitivity to the toxic effects of the 
test substance, as evidenced by the results of other studies, the 
potential for combined studies, and the availability of other 
toxicity data for the species. 
 
 (ii) 

Age. 

Animals shall be at least ten weeks of age at 
the start of exposure. 
 
 (iii) 

Sex. 

Both sexes shall be used unless it is 
demonstrated that one sex is refractory to the effects of 
exposure. 
 
 (2) 

Number of Animals. 

A minimum of ten animals per group 
shall be used. The tissues from each animal shall be examined 
separately. 
 
 (3) 

Control Groups.

 (i) A concurrent control group, exposed to clean, filtered 
air only, is required. 
 
 (ii) The laboratory performing the testing shall provide 
positive control data, e.g., results from repeated acrylamide 
exposure, as evidence of the ability of their histology 
procedures to detect neurotoxic endpoints. Positive control data 
shall be collected at the time of the test study unless the 
laboratory can demonstrate the adequacy of historical data for 
the planned study. 
 
 (iii) A satellite group of 10 female and 10 male test 
subjects shall be treated with the highest concentration level 
for the duration of the exposure and observed thereafter for 
reversibility, persistence, or delayed occurrence of toxic 
effects during a post-treatment period of not less than 28 days. 
 
 (4) 

Inhalation exposure.

 (i) All data developed within this study shall be in accordance with good laboratory practice provisions under  
79.60. 
 
 (ii) The general conduct of this study shall be in 
accordance with the vehicle emissions inhalation exposure 
guideline in  79.61. 
 
 (5) 

Study conduct

_(i) 

Observation of animals. 

All toxicological (e.g., 
weight loss) and neurological signs (e.g., motor disturbance) 
shall be recorded frequently enough to observe any abnormality, 
and not less than weekly. 
 
 (ii) The following is a minimal list of measures that shall 
be noted: 
 
 (A) Body weight; 
 
 (B) Subject's reactivity to general stimuli such as removal 
from the cage or handling; 
 
 (C) Description, incidence, and severity of any 
convulsions, tremors, or abnormal motor movements in the home 
cage; 
 
 (D) Descriptions and incidence of posture and gait 
abnormalities observed in the home cage; and 
 
 (E) Description and incidence of any unusual or abnormal 
behaviors, excessive or repetitive actions (stereotypies), 
emaciation, dehydration, hypotonia or hypertonia, altered fur 
appearance, red or crusty deposits around the eyes, nose, or 
mouth, and any other observations that may facilitate 
interpretation of the data. 
 
 (iii) 

Sacrifice of animals

_(A) 

General. 

The goal of the techniques outlined for 
sacrifice of animals and preparation of tissues is preservation 
of tissue morphology to simulate the living state of the cell. 
 
 (B) 

Perfusion technique. 

Animals shall be perfused 

in situ

 
by a generally recognized technique. For fixation suitable for 
light or electronic microscopy, saline solution followed by 
buffered 2.5 percent glutaraldehyde or buffered 4.0 percent 
paraformaldehyde, is recommended. While some minor modifications 
or variations in procedures are used in different laboratories, a 
detailed and standard procedure for vascular perfusion may be 
found in the text by Zeman and Innes (1963), Hayat (1970), and 
Spencer and Schaumburg (1980) under paragraph (g) of this 
section. A more sophisticated technique is described by Palay and 
Chan-Palay (1974) under paragraph (g) of this section. 
 
 (C) 

Removal of brain and cord. 

After perfusion, the bony 
structure (cranium and vertebral column) shall be exposed. 
Animals shall then be stored in fixative-filled bags at 4 
 C for 
8-12 hours. The cranium and vertebral column shall be removed 
carefully by trained technicians without physical damage of the 
brain and cord. Detailed dissection procedures may be found in 
the text by Palay and Chan-Palay (1974) under paragraph (g) of 
this section. After removal, simple measurement of the size 
(length and width) and weight of the whole brain (cerebrum, 
cerebellum, pons-medulla) shall be made. Any abnormal coloration 
or discoloration of the brain and cord shall also be noted and 
recorded.

(D) 

Sampling. 

Cross-sections of the following areas shall 
be examined: The forebrain, the center of the cerebrum, the 
midbrain, the cerebellum, and the medulla oblongata; the spinal 
cord at the cervical swelling (C

3

-C

6

), and proximal sciatic nerve 
(mid-thigh and sciatic notch) or tibial nerve (at knee). Other 
sites and tissue elements (e.g., gastrocnemius muscle) shall be 
examined if deemed necessary. Any observable gross changes shall 
be recorded. 
 
(iv) 

Specimen storage. 

Tissue samples from both the 
central and peripheral nervous system shall be further immersion 
fixed and stored in appropriate fixative (e.g., 10 percent 
buffered formalin for light microscopy; 2.5 percent buffered 
gluteraldehyde or 4.0 percent buffered paraformaldehyde for 
electron microscopy) for future examination. The volume of 
fixative versus the volume of tissues in a specimen jar shall be 
no less than 25:1. All stored tissues shall be washed with buffer 
for at least 2 hours prior to further tissue processing. 
 
 (v) 

Histopathology examination_

(A) 

Fixation. 

Tissue specimens stored in 10 percent 
buffered formalin may be used for this purpose. All tissues must 
be immersion fixed in fixative for at least 48 hours prior to 
further tissue processing. 
 
 (B) 

Dehydration. 

All tissue specimens shall be washed for 
at least 1 hour with water or buffer, prior to dehydration. (A 
longer washing time is needed if the specimens have been stored 
in fixative for a prolonged period of time.) Dehydration can be 
performed with increasing concentration of graded ethanols up to 
absolute alcohol. 
 
 (C) 

Clearing and embedding. 

After dehydration, tissue 
specimens shall be cleared with xylene and embedded in paraffin 
or paraplast. Multiple tissue specimens (e.g. brain, cord, 
ganglia) may be embedded together in one single block for 
sectioning. All tissue blocks shall be labelled showing at least 
the experiment number, animal number, and specimens embedded. 
 
 (D) 

Sectioning. 

Tissue sections, 5 to 6 microns in 
thickness, shall be prepared from the tissue blocks and mounted 
on standard glass slides. It is recommended that several 
additional sections be made from each block at this time for 
possible future needs for special stainings. All tissue blocks 
and slides shall be filed and stored in properly labeled files or 
boxes. 
 
 (E) 

Histopathological techniques. 

The following general 
testing sequence is proposed for gathering histopathological 
data: 
 
 (

1

) 

General staining. 

A general staining procedure shall be 
performed on all tissue specimens in the highest treatment group. 
Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) shall be used for this purpose. The 
staining shall be differentiated properly to achieve bluish 
nuclei with pinkish background. 
 
 (

2

) 

Peripheral nerve teasing. 

Peripheral nerve fiber 
teasing shall be used. Detailed staining methodology is available 
in standard histotechnological manuals such as AFIP (1968), Ralis 


et al. 

(1973), and Chang (1979) under paragraph (g) of this 
section. The nerve fiber teasing technique is discussed in 
Spencer and Schaumberg (1980) under paragraph (g) of this 
section. A section of normal tissue shall be included in each 
staining to assure that adequate staining has occurred. Any 
changes shall be noted and representative photographs shall be 
taken. If a lesion(s) is observed, the special techniques shall 
be repeated in the next lower treatment group until no further 
lesion is detectable. 
 
 (F) 

Examination. 

All stained microscopic slides shall be 
examined with a standard research microscope. Examples of 
cellular alterations (e.g., neuronal vacuolation, degeneration, 
and necrosis) and tissue changes (e.g., gliosis, leukocytic 
infiltration, and cystic formation) shall be recorded and 
photographed. 
 
 (f) Data collection, reporting, and evaluation. In 
addition to information meeting the requirements stated under 40 
CFR 79.60 and 79.61, the following specific information shall be 
reported:

Results. 

All observations shall be recorded and 
arranged by test groups. This data may be presented in the 
following recommended format: 
 
(i) 

Description of signs and lesions for each animal. 

For 
each animal, data must be submitted showing its identification 
(animal number, treatment, dose, duration), neurologic signs, 
location(s) nature of, frequency, and severity of lesion(s). A 
commonly-used scale such as 1+, 2+, 3+, and 4+ for degree of 
severity ranging from very slight to extensive may be used. Any 
diagnoses derived from neurologic signs and lesions including 
naturally occurring diseases or conditions, shall also be 
recorded; 
 
(ii) 

Counts and incidence of lesions, by test group. 

Data 
shall be tabulated to show: 
(A) The number of animals used in each group, the number of 
animals displaying specific neurologic signs, and the number of 
animals in which any lesion was found; and 
 
(B) The number of animals affected by each different type 
of lesion, the average grade of each type of lesion, and the 
frequency of each different type and/or location of lesion. 
 
(iii) 

Evaluation of data. 

(A) An evaluation of the data based on gross necropsy 
findings and microscopic pathology observations shall be made and 
supplied. The evaluation shall include the relationship, if any, 
between the animal's exposure to the test atmosphere and the 
frequency and severity of any lesions observed; and 
 
(B) The evaluation of dose-response, if existent, for 
various groups shall be given, and a description of statistical 
method must be presented. The evaluation of neuropathology data 
shall include, where applicable, an assessment in conjunction 
with any other neurotoxicity studies, electrophysiological, 
behavioral, or neurochemical, which may be relevant to this 
study.

Glial fibrillary acidic protein assay. 
 


(a) 

Purpose. 

Chemical-induced injury of the nervous 
system, 

i.e., 

the brain, is associated with astrocytic 
hypertrophy at the site of damage (see O'Callaghan, 1988 in 
paragraph (e)(3) in this section). Assays of glial fibrillary 
acidic protein (GFAP), the major intermediate filament protein of 
astrocytes, can be used to document this response. To date, a 
diverse variety of chemical insults known to be injurious to the 
central nervous system have been shown to increase GFAP. 
Moreover, increases in GFAP can be seen at concentrations below 
those necessary to produce cytopathology as determined by routine 
Nissl stains (standard neuropathology). Thus it appears that 
assays of GFAP represent a sensitive approach for documenting the 
existence and location of chemical-induced injury of the central 
nervous system. Additional functional, histopathological, and 
biochemical tests are necessary to assess completely the 
neurotoxic potential of any chemical. This biochemical test is 
intended to be used in conjunction with neurohistopathological 
studies. 
 
(b) 

Principle of the test method. 

(1) This guideline describes the conduct of a radioimmunoassay for measurement of the amount of GFAP in the 
brain of vehicle emission-exposed and unexposed control animals. It is based on modifications (O'Callaghan &
Miller 1985 in paragraph (e)(5), O'Callaghan 1987 in paragraph (e)(1) of this section) of the dot-immunobinding
procedure described by Jahn 

et al.

 (1984) in paragraph (e)(2) of this section. Briefly, brain tissue samples from study animals are assayed for total
protein, 
diluted in dot-immunobinding buffer, and applied to nitrocellulose sheets. The spotted sheets are then fixed, blocked,
washed and incubated in anti-GFAP antibody and [I

125

] Protein A. Bound protein A is then quantified by gamma 
spectrometry. In lieu of purified protein standards, standard curves are constructed from dilution of a single control
sample. By comparing the immunoreactivity of individual samples (both control and exposed groups) with that of the
sample used to generate the standard curve, the relative immunoreactivity of each sample is obtained. The immunoreactivity
of the control groups is normalized to 100 percent and all data are expressed as 
a percentage of control. A variation on this radioimmunoassay procedure has been proposed (O'Callaghan 1991 in paragraph
(e)(4) of this section) which uses a ``sandwich'' of GFAP, anti-GFAP, and a chromophore in a microtiter plate format
enzyme-link immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The use of this variation shall be justified. 
 
(2) This assay may be done separately or in combination 
with the subchronic toxicity study, pursuant to the provisions of 
 79.62. 
 
(c) 

Test procedure_

(1) 

Animal selection_

(i) 

Species and strain. 

Test shall be performed on the species being used in concurrent testing for neurotoxic or other health effect endpoints.
This will generally be a species of laboratory rat. The use of other rodent or non-rodent species 
shall be justified. 
 
(ii) 

Age. 

Based on other concurrent testing, young adult 
rats shall be used. Study rodents shall not be older than ten 
weeks at the start of exposures. 
 
(iii) 

Number of animals. 

A minimum of ten animals per 
group shall be used. The tissues from each animal shall be 
examined separately. 
 
(iv) 

Sex. 

Both sexes shall be used unless it is 
demonstrated that one sex is refractory to the effects. 
 
(2) 

Materials. 

The materials necessary to perform this 
study are [I

125

] Protein A (2-10  u Ci/ u g), Anti-sera to GFAP, 
nitrocellulose paper (0.1 or 0.2  u m pore size), sample 
application template (optional; e.g., ``Minifold II'', Schleicher & 
Schuell, Keene, NH), plastic sheet incubation trays. 
 
(3) 

Study conduct. 

(i) All data developed within this study shall be in accordance with good laboratory practice provisions under  
79.60. 
 
(ii) 

Tissue Preparation. 

Animals are euthanized 24 hours 
after the last exposure and the brain is excised from the skull. 
On a cold dissecting platform, the following six regions are 
dissected freehand: cerebellum; cerebral cortex; hippocampus; 
striatum; thalamus/hypothalamus; and the rest of the brain. Each 
region is then weighed and homogenized in 10 volumes of hot (70-
90 
 C) 1 percent (w/v) sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). 
Homogenization is best achieved through sonic disruption. A 
motor driven pestle inserted into a tissue grinding vessel is a 
suitable alternative. The homogenized samples can then be stored 
frozen at ^70 
 C for at least 4 years without loss of GFAP 
content. 
 
(iii) 

Total Protein Assay. 

Aliquots of the tissue samples 
are assayed for total protein using the method of Smith 

et al. 


(1985) in paragraph (e)(7) of this section. This assay may be 
purchased in kit form (e.g., Pierce Chemical Company, Rockford, 
IL). 
 
(iv) 

Sample Preparation. 

Dilute tissue samples in sample 
buffer (120 mM KCl, 20 mM NaCl, 2 mM MgCl

2

), 5 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 
0.7 percent Triton X-100) to a final concentration of 0.25 mg 
total protein per ml (5  u g/20  u l).

<TEXT>
 

(v) 

Preparation of Standard Curve. 

Dilute a single control sample in sample buffer to give at least five standards, between 1 and 10  u g total protein
per 20  u l. The suggested values of total protein per 20  u l sample buffer are 1.25, 2.50, 3.25, 5.0, 6.25, 7.5,
8.75, and 10.0  u g. 
 
(vi) 

Preparation of Nitrocellulose Sheets. 

Nitrocellulose sheets of 0.1 or 0.2 micron pore size are rinsed by immersion in distilled water for 5 minutes and then
air dried. 
 
(vii) 

Sample Application. 

Samples can be spotted onto the nitrocellulose sheets free-hand or with the aid of a template. For free-hand application,
draw a grid of squares approximately 2 centimeters by 2 centimeters (cm) on the nitrocellulose sheets using a soft
pencil. Spot 5-10  u l portions to the center of each square for a total sample volume of 20  u l. For template
aided sample application a washerless microliter capacity sample application manifold is used. Position the nitrocellulose
sheet in the sample application device as recommended by the manufacturer and spot a 20  u l sample in one application.
Do not wet the nitrocellulose or any support elements prior to sample application. Do not apply vacuum during or after
sample application. After spotting samples (using either method), let the sheets air dry. The sheets can be stored
at room temperature for several days after sample application. 
 
(viii) 

Standard Incubation Conditions. 

These conditions have been described by Jahn 

et al

. (1984) in paragraph (e)(2) of this section. All steps are carried out at room temperature on a flat shaking platform
(one complete excursion every 2-3 seconds). For best results, do not use rocking or orbital shakers. Perform
the following steps in enough solution to cover the nitrocellulose sheets to a depth of 1 cm. 
 
(A) Incubate 20 minutes in fixer (25 percent (v/v) isopropanol, 10 percent (v/v) acetic acid). 
 
(B) Discard fixer, wash several times in deionized water to eliminate the fixer, and then incubate for 5 minutes in
Tris-buffered saline (TBS): 200 mM NaCL, 60 mM Tris-HCl to pH 7.4. 
 
(C) Discard TBS and incubate 1 hour in blocking solution (0.5 percent gelatin (w/v)) in TBS. 
 
(D) Discard blocking solution and incubate for 2 hours in antibody solution (anti-GFAP antiserum diluted to the desired
dilution in blocking solution containing 0.1 percent Triton X-100). Serum anti-bovine GFAP, which cross reacts
with GFAP from rodents and humans, can be obtained commercially (e.g., Dako Corp.) and used at a dilution of 1:500.

 
(E) Discard antibody solution, and wash in 4 changes of TBS for 5 minutes each time. Then wash in TBS for 10 minutes. 
 
(F) Discard TBS and incubate in blocking solution for 30 minutes. 
(G) Discard blocking solution and incubate for 1 hour in Protein A solution ([I125]-labeled Protein A diluted in blocking
solution containing 0.1 percent Triton X-100, sufficient to produce 2000 counts per minute (cpm) per 10  u l
of Protein A solution). 
 
(H) Remove Protein A solution (it may be reused once). Wash in 0.1 percent Triton X-100 in TBS (TBSTX) for 5 minutes,
4 times. Then wash in TBSTX for 2-3 hours for 4 additional times. An overnight wash in a larger volume can be used
to replace the last 4 washes. 
 
(I) Hang sheets to air-dry. Cut out squares or spots and count radioactivity in a gamma counter. 
 
(ix) 

Expression of data. 

Compare radioactivity counts for samples obtained from control and treated animals with counts obtained from the
standard curve. By comparing the immunoreactivity (counts) of each sample with that of the standard curve, the relative
amount of GFAP in each sample can be determined and expressed as a percent of control.

Salmonella typhimurium reverse mutation assay. 
 


(a) 

Purpose. 

The 

Salmonella typhimurium 

histidine (his) reversion system is a microbial assay which measures his

^



c

 his

+

 reversion induced by chemicals which cause base changes or frameshift mutations in the genome of the microorganism


Salmonella typhimurium. 
 
(b) Definitions. 

For the purposes of this section, the following definitions apply: 






Base pair mutagen 

means an agent which causes a base change in DNA. In a reversion assay, this change may occur at the site of the original
mutation or at a second site in the chromosome. 
 


Frameshift mutagen 

is an agent which causes the addition or deletion of single or multiple base pairs in the DNA molecule. 
 


Salmonella typhimurium reverse mutation assay 

detects mutation in a gene of a histidine-requiring strain to produce a histidine independent strain of this organism.

<TEXT>
 

(c) 

Reference substances. 

These may include, but need not 
be limited to, sodium azide, 2-nitrofluorene, 9-aminoacridine, 
2-aminoanthracene, congo red, benzopurpurin 4B, trypan blue or 
direct blue 1. 
 
(d) Test method._(1) 

Principle. 

Motor vehicle combustion emissions from 
fuel or additive/base fuel mixtures are, first, filtered to trap 
particulate matter and, then, passed through a sorbent resin to 
trap semi-volatile gases. Bacteria are separately exposed to the 
extract from both the filtered particulates and the resin-trapped 
organics. Assays are conducted using both test mixtures with and 
without a metabolic activation system and exposed cells are 
plated onto minimal medium. After a suitable period of 
incubation, revertant colonies are counted in test cultures and 
compared to the number of spontaneous revertants in unexposed 
control cultures. 
 
(2) 

Description. 

Several methods for performing the test 
have been described. The procedures described here are for the 
direct plate incorporation method and the azo-reduction method. 
Among those used are: 
 
 (i) Direct plate incorporation method; 
 
 (ii) Preincubation method; 
 
 (iii) Azo-reduction method; 
 
 (iv) Microsuspension method; and 
 
 (v) Spiral assay. 
 
 
 (3) 

Strain selection

_(i)

Designation. 

Five tester strains shall be used in the 
assay. At the present time, TA1535, TA1537, TA98, and TA100 are 
designated as tester strains. The fifth strain will be chosen 
from the pool of Salmonella strains commonly used to determine 
the degree to which nitrated organic compounds, 

i.e.

, 
nitroarenes, contribute to the overall mutagenic activity of a 
test substance. TA98/1,8-DNP

6

 or other suitable Rosenkranz 
nitro-reductase resistant strains will be considered acceptable. 
The choice of the particular strain is left to the discretion of 
the researcher. However, the researcher shall justify the use of 
the selected bacterial tester strains. 
 
(ii) 

Preparation and storage of bacterial tester strains.

 
Recognized methods of stock culture preparation and storage shall 
be used. The requirement of histidine for growth shall be 
demonstrated for each strain. Other phenotypic characteristics 
shall be checked using such methods as crystal violet sensitivity 
and resistance to ampicillin. Spontaneous reversion frequency 
shall be in the range expected as reported in the literature and 
as established in the laboratory by historical control values. 
 
(iii) 

Bacterial growth. 

Fresh cultures of bacteria shall 
be grown up to the late exponential or early stationary phase of 
growth (approximately 108-109 cells per ml). 
 
(4) 

Exogenous metabolic activation. 

Bacteria shall be 
exposed to the test substance both in the presence and absence of 
an appropriate exogenous metabolic activation system. For the 
direct plate incorporation method, the most commonly used system 
is a cofactor-supplemented postmitochondrial fraction prepared 
from the livers of rodents treated with enzyme-inducing agents, 
such as Aroclor 1254. For the azo-reduction method, a cofactor- 
supplemented postmitochondrial fraction (S-9) prepared from the 
livers of untreated hamsters is preferred. For this method, the 
cofactor supplement shall contain flavin mononucleotide, 
exogenous glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase, NADH and excess of 
glucose-6-phosphate. 
 
(5) 

Control groups

_(i) 

Concurrent controls. 

Concurrent positive and negative (untreated) controls shall be included in each experiment. Positive controls
shall ensure both strain responsiveness and 
efficacy of the metabolic activation system.

(ii) Strain specific positive controls shall be included in 
the assay. Examples of strain specific positive controls are as 
follows:

 


(A) Strain TA1535, TA100: sodium azide; 
 
 
(B) TA98: 2-nitrofluorene (without activation), 2-
anthramine (with activation); 
 
 
(C) TA1537: 9-aminoacridine; and 
 
 
(D) TA98/1,8-DNP

6

: benzo(a)pyrene (with activation). 
 


The papers by Claxton 

et al.

, 1991 and 1992 in paragraph (g) in 
this section will provide helpful information for the selection 
of positive controls. 
 
 (iii) 

Positive controls to ensure the efficacy of the 
activation system. 

The positive control reference substances for 
tests including a metabolic activation system shall be selected 
on the basis of the type of activation system used in the test. 
2-Aminoanthracene is an example of a positive control compound in 
plate-incorporation tests using postmitochondrial fractions from 
the livers of rodents treated with enzyme-inducing agents such as 
Aroclor-1254. Congo red is an example of a positive control 
compound in the azo-reduction method. Other positive control 
reference substances may be used. 
 
 
(iv) 

Class-specific positive controls. 

The azo-reduction 
method shall include positive controls from the same class of 
compounds as the test agent wherever possible. 
 
 (6) 

Sampling the test atmosphere.

_(i) Extracts of test emissions are collected on Teflon

 

-coated glass fiber filters using an exhaust dilution setup. The particulates are extracted with dichloromethane
(DCM) using 
Soxhlet extraction techniques. Extracts in DCM can be stored at 
dry ice temperatures until use. 
 
 (ii) Gaseous hydrocarbons passing through the filter are 
trapped by a porous, polymer resin, like XAD-2/styrene-
divinylbenzene, or an equivalent product. Methylene chloride is 
used to extract the resin and the sample is evaporated to dryness 
before storage or use. 
 
 (iii) Samples taken from this material are then used to 
expose the cells in this assay. Final concentration of extracts 
in solvent/vehicle, or after solvent exchange, shall not 
interfere with cell viability or growth rate. The paper by Stump 
(1982) in paragraph (g) of this section is useful for preparing 
extracts of particulate and semi-volatile organic compounds from 
diesel and gasoline exhaust stream. 
 
 (iv) Exposure concentrations. (A) The test should initially be performed over a broad 
range of concentrations. Among the criteria to be taken into 
consideration for determining the upper limits of test substance 
concentration are cytotoxicity and solubility. Cytotoxicity of 
the test chemical may be altered in the presence of metabolic 
activation systems. Toxicity may be evidenced by a reduction in 
the number of spontaneous revertants, a clearing of the 
background lawn or by the degree of survival of treated cultures. 
Relatively insoluble samples shall be tested up to the limits of 
solubility. The upper test chemical concentration shall be 
determined on a case by case basis. 
 
(B) Generally, a maximum of 5 mg/plate for pure substances 
is considered acceptable. At least 5 different concentrations of 
test substance shall be used with adequate intervals between test 
points. 
 
(C) When appropriate, a single positive response shall be 
confirmed by testing over a narrow range of concentrations. 
 
(e) 

Test performance. 

All data developed within this study 
shall be in accordance with good laboratory practice provisions 
under  79.60. 
 
(1) Direct plate incorporation method. When testing with 
metabolic activation, test solution, bacteria, and 0.5 ml of 
activation mixture containing an adequate amount of 
postmitochondrial fraction shall be added to the liquid overlay 
agar and mixed. This mixture is poured over the surface of a 
selective agar plate. Overlay agar shall be allowed to solidify 
before incubation. At the end of the incubation period, 
revertant colonies per plate shall be counted. When testing 
without metabolic activation, the test sample and 0.1 ml of a 
fresh bacterial culture shall be added to 2.0 ml of overlay agar. 
 
 
 (2) Azo-reduction method. When testing with metabolic 
activation, 0.5 ml of activation mixture containing 150  u l of 
postmitochondrial fraction and 0.1 ml of bacterial culture shall 
be added to a test tube kept on ice. 0.1 ml of test solution 
shall be added, and the tubes shall be incubated with shaking at 
30 
 C for 30 minutes. At the end of the incubation period, 2.0 
ml of agar shall be added to each tube, the contents mixed and 
poured over the surface of a selective agar plate. Overlay agar 
shall be allowed to solidify before incubation. At the end of the 
incubation period, revertant colonies per plate shall be counted. 
For tests without metabolic activation, 0.5 ml of buffer shall be 
used in place of the 0.5 ml of activation mixture. All other 
procedures shall be the same as those used for the test with 
metabolic activation. 
 
 
(3) Other methods/modifications may also be appropriate. 
 
 (4) Media. An appropriate selective medium with an adequate 
overlay agar shall be used.

(5) Incubation conditions. All plates within a given experiment shall be incubated for the same time period. This
incubation period shall be for 48-72 hours at 37 
 C. 

(6) Number of cultures. All plating shall be done at least in triplicate. 

(f) 

Data and report

_(1) 

Treatment of results

. Data shall be presented as number of revertant colonies per plate, revertants per kilogram (or liter) of fuel, and
as revertants per kilometer (or mile) for each replicate and dose. These same measures shall be recorded on both the
negative and positive control plates. The mean number of revertant colonies per plate, revertants per kilogram (or
liter) of fuel, and revertants per kilometer (or mile), as well as individual plate counts and standard deviations
shall be presented for the test substance, positive control, and negative control plates. 

(2) 

Statistical evaluation.

 Data shall be evaluated by appropriate statistical methods. Those methods shall include, at a minimum, means and
standard deviations of the reversion data. 

(3) 

Interpretation of results.

 (i) There are several criteria for determining a positive result, one of which is a statistically significant dose-related
increase in the number of revertants. Another criterion may be based upon detection of a reproducible and statistically
significant positive response for at least one of the test substance concentrations. 

(ii) A test substance which does not produce either a statistically significant dose-related increase in the number
of revertants or a statistically significant and reproducible positive response at any one of the test points is considered
nonmutagenic in this system. 

(iii) Both biological and statistical significance shall be considered together in the evaluation. 

(4) 

Test evaluation.

 (i) Positive results from the 

Salmonella typhimurium

 reverse mutation assay indicate that, under the test conditions, the test substance induces point mutations by base
changes or frameshifts in the genome of this organism. 

(ii) Negative results indicate that under the test conditions the test substance is not mutagenic in Salmonella typhimurium.

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document announces EPA's decision to stay the Multi-Substance Rule for the Testing of Neurotoxicity at 40 CFR
799.5050, promulgated under section 4 of the Toxic Substances Control Act (``TSCA''), pending final action on a proposed
revocation of the final test rule, which is published elsewhere in this 

Federal Register

. The final test rule was published on July 27, 1993 (58 FR 40262), and requires manufacturers and processors of 10 substances
to conduct testing for neurotoxicity. On October 8, 1993, the Chemical Manufacturers Association (CMA) and the manufacturers
and processors of these substances filed suit seeking review of the rule in the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals. EPA is
announcing a stay of this rule as part of a settlement agreement reached with the manufacturers of these chemicals,
who have agreed to perform certain neurotoxicity and pharmacokinetics testing on 7 of the 10 chemicals subject to
the final test rule, subject to execution of enforceable consent agreements (``ECA'') containing these studies.

 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 This document announces EPA's decision to stay the Multi-Substance Rule for the Testing of Neurotoxicity at 40 CFR
799.5050, promulgated under section 4 of the Toxic Substances Control Act (``TSCA''), pending final action on a proposed
revocation of the final test rule, which is published elsewhere in this 

Federal Register

. The manufacturers of 7 of the 10 chemicals subject to the final test rule have agreed, subject to certain conditions
set forth in the settlement agreement (Ref. 3), to conduct a set of neurotoxicity and pharmacokinetics testing under
enforceable consent agreements (``ECA''). If ECA negotiations are successful, EPA believes that the previously
issued final test rule would no longer be needed. EPA believes that, under a negotiated ECA, neurotoxicity and pharmacokinetics
testing would be conducted and results made publicly available more quickly, and EPA resources used more effectively,
than if EPA continued to litigate the merits of the final test rule. It is anticipated that the following seven substances
would be tested pursuant to ECAs: acetone (CAS No. 67-64-1), technical grade 

n

-amyl acetate (CAS No. 628-63-7), 

n

-butyl acetate (CAS No. 123-86-4), ethyl acetate (CAS No. 141-78-6), isobutyl alcohol (CAS
No. 78-83-1), methyl isobutyl ketone (CAS No. 108-10-1), and tetrahydrofuran (CAS No. 109-99-9).
Testing is currently underway for 

n

-butyl acetate and isobutyl alcohol. EPA does not anticipate entering into an ECA for 1-butanol (CAS No. 71-36-3),
diethyl ether (CAS No. 60-29-7), and 2-ethoxyethanol (CAS No. 110-80-5), three other substances
for which testing is required under the final test rule. 



Elsewhere in this 

Federal Register

, EPA is soliciting interested parties for participation in or monitoring of ECA negotiations. The settlement agreement
signed by EPA and the parties to the lawsuit in April 1994 will be the starting point for the ECA negotiations (Ref. 3).



I. Background 



On July 27, 1993 (58 FR 40262) EPA issued a test rule under TSCA section 4 that required manufacturers and processors
of 10 substances to conduct testing for neurotoxicity (Ref. 1). The required testing was the same for all 10 substances
and included acute and subchronic functional observational battery and motor activity, and subchronic neuropathology
and schedu
