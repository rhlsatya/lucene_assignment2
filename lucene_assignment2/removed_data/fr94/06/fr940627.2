DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE 




Office of the Secretary

Price Undercutting of Domestic Swiss Cheese by Imported Swiss Cheese From Austria, Denmark, and Germany 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Department of Agriculture (USDA).



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice.








On May 18, 1994, the U.S. Department of Agriculture receive a complaint alleging price undercutting of domestic Swiss
cheese in the United States by imported subsidized quota Swiss cheese produced in Austria, Denmark, and Germany.
Under section 702 of the Trade Agreements Act of 1979 (Pub. L. 96-39), the Secretary of Agriculture must conduct
an investigation and make a determination as to the validity of the allegations no later than 30 days after receiving
a complaint. 

Based on the investigation of the Director of the Dairy, Livestock and Poultry Division, Foreign Agricultural Service,
conducted pursuant to the regulations at 7 CFR 6.40-.44, I have determined that the duty-paid wholesale price
during the period December 1993 through April 1994 in the New York-New Jersey market area was $1.55 per pound, $1.56
per pound, and $1.12 per pound for Swiss cheese blocks imported from Austria, Denmark, and Germany, respectively.
I have also determined that during the same period in the same market area, the duty-paid wholesale price was $1.80
per pound and $1.69 per pound for cuts, slices, loaves, etc., of Swiss cheese imported from Denmark and Germany, respectively.
During the same period in the same market area, I have determined that the price for Swiss cheese trims and end pieces
imported from Austria was $1.37 per pound. In addition, I have determined that the domestic wholesale market price
during the period December 1993 through April 1994 for U.S. produced Swiss cheese in the New York-New Jersey market
area was $1.76 for blocks, $1.85 cuts, slices, loaves, etc., and $1.54 for trims and end pieces. 

Susan G. Esserman, Assistant Secretary for Import Administration, Department of Commerce, has determined that
the average daily export restitution payment provided by the European Union during the investigation period was
$0.74 per pound for Swiss cheese imported from Denmark and $0.73 per pound for Swiss cheese imported from Germany.
In the case of subsidies provided by the Government of Austria export restitution payments ranged from $1.847 per
pound to $2.261 per pound during the investigation period. 

I have, therefore, determined that price undercutting of U.S. produced Swiss cheese in the United States by imported
subsidized quota Swiss cheese from Austria, Denmark, and Germany is taking place, and I have notified the United States
Trade Representative accordingly. 





Done at Washington, D.C. this 21st day of June, 1994.

In the course of this investigation, parties will have the opportunity to provide relevant information related to
the issues of the PRC's NME status and granting of separates rates to individual exporters. 

See Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Silicon Carbide from the PRC

 (59 FR 22585, May 2, 1994). 

Petitioners based the factors of production on the production process used by PRC producers of the subject merchandise
and valued these factors, where possible, on publicly available published information from the surrogate country,
India. Where certain values were not available from Indian sources, petitioner has used values from Pakistan and
Indonesia. These countries have been determined to be appropriate surrogates for the PRC. 

See 

November 29, 1993, memorandum from Rob Straw, Office of Policy to the File, 

Antidumping Investigation of Paper Clips from the PRC,

 A-570-826. For purposes of these initiations, we have accepted, pursuant to section 773 (c)(4) of the
Act, petitioner's view that India, Pakistan, and Indonesia are appropriate surrogate countries. 

Pursuant to section 773(c)(1) of the Act, petitioner determined FMV on the basis of the value of factors of production
specified in section 773(c)(3) of the Act. These factors included materials, energy, labor costs and a percentage
for factory overhead based on information from India. Petitioner then added the statutory minimum of ten percent
for general expenses and eight percent for profit, as well as an amount for packing. 

We disregarded certain factor values where the inputs were based on prices in the United States because (1) petitioner
failed to follow the Department's established hierarchy regarding selection of surrogate countries for the PRC,
with respect to factor valuation, and (2) petitioner provided no basis for determining that United States values
are representative of the appropriate surrogate country values. 

Based on a comparison of USP to FMV, the recalculated dumping margins ranged from 225.42 percent to 320.69 percent.




South Africa 



Petitioner based USP for South Africa on IM-145 data. Petitioner adjusted for foreign inland freight, ocean
freight and marine insurance charges. Ocean freight and marine insurance charges were estimated by comparing per-unit
U.S. IM-145 customs value import statistics to per-unit U.S. IM-145 CIF import statistics. 

Petitioner based FMV on a domestic price quote from a producer of the subject merchandise in South Africa to a home market
customer. An adjustment was made for foreign inland freight to arrive at an ex-factory price. Petitioner then added
VAT to both the FMV and USP. 

Based on a comparison of USP to FMV, the dumping margin alleged by petitioner is 68 percent. 



Thailand 



Petitioner based USP for Thailand on U.S. IM-145 Customs data. Petitioner adjusted for foreign inland freight,
ocean freight and marine insurance charges. Petitioner calculated inland freight charges based on the distance
from the Thai producer's plant to the port of export. Ocean freight and marine insurance charges were estimated by
comparing per-unit U.S. IM-145 customs value import statistics to per-unit U.S. IM-145 CIF import statistics.


Petitioner based FMV on constructed value (CV) because it claimed that the Thai market was not viable and that home
market and third country prices provided in the petition represented sales that were made below the cost of production
(COP) and therefore were not appropriate bases for calculating FMV. 

Petitioner provided a sales price from a Thai producer to a home market customer, and third country prices to Germany
and the Netherlands, based on 1993 Thai export statistics to these countries. We did not use the Thai sales price to
the home market customer because the source of the information could not be substantiated. Petitioner's claim that
the home market is not viable is moot because they have been unable to obtain a substantiated home market sales price
in Thailand. We rejected prices to third countries because these prices were found to be below COP, as described below.

Allegations of Home Market and Third Country Sales Below Cost of Production: Thailand



Petitioner alleged that a Thai producer is selling the subject merchandise in the home market at prices below its COP.
This allegation is based on a comparison of a domestic price obtained in Thailand with the Thai producer's COP for the
subject merchandise. Because the domestic sales price from Thailand is unsubstantiated, there is no need to address
petitioner's home market COP allegation. 

See 

``Review of Estimated COP and Constructed Value for Furfuryl Alcohol Memorandum,'' dated June 17, 1994, which is
on file in the Central Records Unit, at the Department of Commerce.

Petitioner also alleged that the Thai producer's sales prices to Germany and the Netherlands were also made at prices
below COP. This allegation is based on a comparison of the third country prices to Germany and to the Netherlands (based
on 1993 Thai export statistics to these countries) to the Thai producer's calculated COP. A comparison of prices to
Germany and the Netherlands to the Thai producer's COP for the subject merchandise indicates sales below cost. If
the Department determines after these initiations that the home market is not viable and the Department uses third
country prices in Germany or the Netherlands for purposes of comparison to USP, we will initiate separate cost investigations
at that time.

Therefore, for purposes of this initiation, in accordance with 773(e)(1) of the Act, we are accepting petitioner's
estimate of CV as the only appropriate basis for FMV. Petitioners based CV on costs incurred by a Thai producer, and
its own manufacturing experience adjusted for differences in costs between the United States and Thailand. An amount
for selling, general and administrative expenses and the statutory minimum for profit were added to the cost of manufacturer.
Petitioner added an amount for export packing to arrive a total CV.

Based on a comparison of USP to FMV, the recalculated dumping margin is 72.35 percent.



Fair Value Comparisons



Based on the data provided by the petitioner, there is reason to believe that imports to furfuryl alcohol from the PRC,
the Republic of South Africa, and Thailand are being, or likely to be, sold at less than fair value. If it becomes necessary
at a later date to consider the petition as a source of best information available, we may review the calculations used
to derive the allegations.



Initiation of Investigations



We have examined the petitions on furfuryl alcohol and have found that they meet the requirements of section 732(b)
of the Act and 19 CFR 353.13(a). Therefore, we are initiating antidumping duty investigations to determine whether
imports of furfuryl alcohol from the PRC, the Republic of South Africa, and Thailand are being, or are likely to be,
sold in the United States at less than fair value. If these investigations proceed normally, we will make our preliminary
determinations by November 7, 1994.



ITC Notification



Section 732(d) of the Act requires us to notify the ITC of these actions, and we have done so.



Preliminary Determination by the ITC 



The ITC will determine by July 15, 1994, whether there is a reasonable indication that imports to furfuryl alcohol
from the PRC, Thailand, and the Republic of South Africa are causing material injury, or threaten to cause material
injury, to a U.S. industry. A negative ITC determination will result in the investigations being terminated; otherwise,
these investigations will proceed according to statutory and regulatory time limits. 

This notice is published pursuant to section 732(c)(2) of the Act and 19 CFR 353.13(b).

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

Notice is hereby given of the availability of the final evaluation findings for Alabama, California, Connecticut,
Mississippi, Maine, and New Hampshire Coastal Management Programs, and Narragansett Bay (Rhode Island), Rookery
Bay (Florida), Chesapeake Bay (Maryland), and North Carolina National Estuarine Research Reserves (NERR). Section
312 of the Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972 (CZMA), as amended, requires a continuing review of the performance
of coastal states with respect to coastal management and the operation and management of NERRs.




The states of Alabama, California, Connecticut, Maine and New Hampshire were found to be implementing and enforcing
their Federally approved coastal management program, addressing the national coastal management objective identified
in CZMA section 303(2)(A)-(K), and adhering to the programmatic terms of their financial assistance awards.
The State of Mississippi was found not fully adhering to its approved coastal management program. Implementation
of several recommendations listed in the findings will bring Mississippi's program back into satisfactory adherence.
North Carolina, Narragansett Bay, Rookery Bay, and Chesapeake Bay, MD NERRs were found to be satisfactorily adhering
to programmatic requirement of the NERR system.

Copies of these final evaluation findings may be obtained upon request from: Vickie Allin, Chief, Policy Coordination
Division, Office of Ocean and Coastal Resource Management, NOS/NOAA, 1305 East-West Highway, 11th Floor, Silver

Intent To Prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for a Land Exchange Between the City of Columbus, GA and
Fort Benning



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Department of the Army, U.S. Infantry Center, DOD.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of intent.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

Public Law 101-510, November 5, 1990, authorized a land exchange between the City of Columbus, Georgia and the
Department of the Army (Fort Benning). In this agreement, the City receives approximately 3,125 acres of land from
Fort Benning, and in exchange, the City will convey to Fort Benning approximately 3,225 acres located on the southern
boundary of the military reservation, land currently owned by a third party, Mead Coated Board, Inc. The City intends
to use the land to expand its existing sanitary landfill, to develop tracts for economic development, and to provide
land for passive recreation. Fort Benning will use the land it receives to augment training areas in the southern part
of the military reservation.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Alternatives



The purpose of the EIS is to document surveys and studies necessary to fully satisfy the requirements of the National
Environmental Policy Act of 1969, the Endangered Species Act of 1973, the National Historical Act, and the Clean Water
Act, thus allowing the Secretary of the Army to approve the land transfer. It is further intended to provide the necessary
information which will allow the City to properly plan the development of its parcel in harmony with the environment.

As required by NEPA, the ``no-action'' alternative will be analyzed as a baseline for gauging the impact of the proposed
land swap.



Public Involvement

In accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's
regulations, 18 CFR part 380 (order No. 486, 52 F.R. 47910), the Office of Hydropower Licensing has reviewed the licensee's
amendment application that proposes modifications to the Rocky Reach Project facilities and operation. Staff's
initial evaluation of the proposed modifications was issued on October 15, 1993, in a draft environmental assessment.

A draft Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) will be issued and circulated for review by all interested parties.
All comments filed on the draft EIS will be analyzed by staff and considered in the final EIS. Staff's conclusions and
recommendations will then be presented for the consideration of the Commission in reaching its final decision.


Scoping Meeting


A public scoping meeting will be held Thursday July 28, 1994, beginning at 7:00 p.m. at the Grant County Auditorium,
400 Douglas Street, Wenatchee, Washington. An agency scoping meeting will be held on Monday, July 25, 1994, from 8:00

individuals and organizations are invited to attend and assist staff in identifying the scope of environmental issues
that should be analyzed in the EIS. 
The environmental assessment will be considered the initial scoping document. Copies of the environmental assessment

available in the Commission's Reference and Information Center, Room 3308, of the Commission's offices at 941 North
Capital Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426 and will be available at the scoping meeting. We encourage all interested
parties to read the environmental assessment prior to the scoping meeting. 


Objectives 


At the scoping meeting the staff will: (1) describe the range of issues being considered in this amendment application
proceeding; (2) review the conclusions and recommendations in the environmental assessment; (4) identify any additional
issues that should be included in the EIS; and (5) obtain any additional information that any entity feels should be
considered during preparation of the EIS. 


Procedures


The scoping meeting will be recorded by a stenographer and all statements (oral and written) will become part of the
Commission's public record for this proceeding that was noticed on October 22, 1991. Interested persons who are unable
to attend, or do not choose to speak at the scoping meeting, may submit written statements for inclusion in the public
record. All written comments must be filed with the Secretary, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol

<DOCTITLE>Granite State Gas Transmission, Inc.; Proposed Changes in FERC Gas Tariff</DOCTITLE>



June 21, 1994.




Take notice that on June 15, 1994, Granite State Gas Transmission, Inc. (Granite State) tendered for filing with the
Commission the original and revised tariff sheets listed below in its FERC Gas Tariff, Second Revised Volume No. 1,
containing changes in rates and other tariff provisions for effectiveness on July 1, 1994:




Third Revised Sheet No. 20
Original Sheet No. 35
Original Sheet Nos. 36-99





According to Granite State, its filing is a limited Section 4 filing to direct bill its former bundled sales customers,
Bay State Gas Company (Bay State) and Northern Utilities, Inc. (Northern Utilities) for unreimbursed transportation
charges paid to upstream pipeline transporters prior to the effectiveness of its restructured operations on November
1, 1993. Granite State further states that, prior to restructuring, it had assembled a system supply of natural gas
to provide its sales services which included purchases of Canadian gas from Boundary Gas, Inc. (Boundary Gas) and
Shell Canada, Limited, (Shell). It is further stated that Granite State purchased these supplies at the U.S.-Canadian
border and arranged for transportation services on upstream transporters for the delivery of these supplies to its
market area.

According to Granite State it was authorized to pass through the upstream transportation charges in a Transportation
Cost Adjustment added to its sales rates during the period prior to the commencement of its restructured operations.
The Transportation Cost Adjustment was approved by the Commission in Boundary Gas, Inc., et al., 26 FERC  61,114
(1984) and initially reflected only the transportation charges incurred under Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company's
Rate Schedule CGT-NE for the transportation of Granite State's Boundary Gas purchases to its market area. Later,
according to Granite State, the transportation charges incurred for the delivery of its Shell purchases over the
combined facilities of Iroquois Gas Transmission System (Rate Schedule RTS-1), Tennessee (Rate Schedule
NET-NE) and Algonquin Gas Transmission Company (Rate Schedule AFT-2) were included in the derivation
of the Transportation Cost Adjustment.

According to Granite State, the Transportation Cost Adjustment was essentially a tracking mechanism; however,
revisions in the Adjustment often lagged changes in the upstream transporters rates. Granite State further states
that it has made a complete review of the transportation charges incurred under the upstream pipelines transportation
rate schedules compared with the reimbursement through the Transportation Cost Adjustment for the period from July,
1989, through October 31, 1993. According to Granite State, during this period it incurred $505,080 of unreimbursed
demand and commodity transportation charges which it proposes to direct bill to Bay State and Northern Utilities,
as shown on Original Sheet No. 35 in the instant filing.


Granite State further states that Third Revised Sheet No. 20, an Index, and Original Sheet Nos. 36-99, Reserved
Sheets, are included for the editorial revisions in the tariff necessitated by the addition of Original Sheet No.
35.

According to Granite State, copies of its filing were served upon its customers, Bay State and Northern Utilities,
and the regulatory commissions of the States of Maine, Massachusetts and New Hampshire.

Any person desiring to be heard or to make any protest with reference to said filing should file a motion to intervene
or protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426 in
accordance with Rules 211 and 214 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.211 and 385.214).
All such motions or protests should be filed on or before June 28, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission
in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding.
Any person wishing to become a party to the proceeding or to participate as a party in any hearing therein must file a
motion to intervene in accordance with the Commission's Rules. Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission
and are available for public inspection.

Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with Rules 211

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Announcement of the availability of financial assistance and request for applications to carry out cooperative
agreements under programs in the Children's Bureau, Administration on Children, Youth and Families. 






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Administration on Children, Youth and Families (ACYF) announces the availability of fiscal year 1994 funds for
new discretionary cooperative agreements in the following program areas: (1) National Resource Centers for Child
Welfare Services Programs; and (2) National Resource Center for Programs Serving Abandoned Infants and Infants
At Risk of Abandonment and Their Families. Funding for ACYF cooperative agreements under this announcement is authorized
by legislation governing ACF programs in the Administration on Children, Youth and Families. 



This announcement contains all of the necessary application material to apply for these cooperative agreements.




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Administration on Children, Youth and Families (ACYF) administers national programs for children, youth and
families, works with States and local communities to develop services which support and strengthen family life,
seeks out joint ventures with the private sector to enhance the lives of children and their families, and provides
information and other assistance to parents. 



The concerns of ACYF extend to all children from birth through adolescence. Many of the programs administered by the
agency focus on children from low-income families; children and youth in need of foster care, adoption or other child
welfare services; preschool children and preschool children with disabilities; abused and neglected children;
runaway and homeless youth; youth gangs; and children from American Indian, Alaskan Native, and migrant families.


ACYF funds research, demonstration, dissemination, utilization and technical assistance in four basic areas:
child welfare, child care, youth development, and child and family services. The resources budgeted for these four
areas address the needs and problems confronting some of the most vulnerable children and families in the country.

Within ACYF, the Children's Bureau's Division of Child Welfare plans, manages, coordinates and supports child welfare
services programs. It administers the Foster Care and Adoption Assistance Program, the Child Welfare Services Program,
the Independent Living Program, the Child Welfare Research, Demonstration and Training Program, the Adoption Opportunities
Program, the Temporary Child Care and Crisis Nurseries Program, the Abandoned Infants Assistance Program and the
recently enacted Family Preservation and Family Support program.

The Children's Bureau's programs are designed to promote the welfare of all children, including those disabled,
homeless, dependent, abused or neglected children and their families. The programs aid in preventing and remedying
the neglect, abuse and exploitation of children. The programs also encourage the strengthening of the family unit
to help prevent the unnecessary separation of children from their families, and reunify families, where possible,
when separation has occurred.



Part I_General Information



A. Background



Federally funded child welfare resource centers have been in existence for over a decade. In 1982 the Children's Bureau
supported ten Regional Child Welfare Resource Centers as well as several national specialized centers to operate
three year projects. In 1985 the Children's Bureau funded six National Resource Centers for a three year period to
provide leadership to the field through the identification, collection, development and utilization of models
and promising practices, systems improvements, training programs, and other resource materials on effective methods
of addressing child welfare service program needs. Each Resource Center focused on a priority area of child welfare
services: family-based services, foster care, adoption, youth services, legal resources, and management and administration.

These Centers were directed by the Federal government to move towards self-sufficiency. Although this criterion
of self-sufficiency was met, certain critical core functions which proved vital to the States_short-term consultation,
information dissemination, and the development of programs, practices, and resource materials on emerging issues_could
not be provided without ongoing Federal support.

In 1988 and 1989 the six Resource Centers received continuation funding to insure the ongoing availability of these
core services. In 1990, the Children's Bureau employed a competitive process to again fund National Centers in the
same six priority areas to make sure resources in key areas would continue to be available to the field. In 1993, a National
Adoption Resource Center was funded for a five year project period.

This announcement is soliciting applications for project periods up to five years. Awards, on a competitive basis,
will be for a one-year budget period, although project periods may be five years. Applications for continuation grants
funded under these awards beyond the one-year budget period but within the five year project period will be entertained
in subsequent years on a non-competitive basis, subject to availability of funds, timely and successful completion
of the project, and determination that continued funding would be in the best interest of the Government.

The Children's Bureau plans to make this determination, in part, by convening a panel of experts, including customers,
to review the progress of the five National Resource Centers for Child Welfare Services Programs and the National
Resource Center for Programs Serving Abandoned Infants and Infants at Risk of Abandonment and Their Families during
the third budget period and to make recommendations regarding continued funding on a non-competitive basis.

Successful completion of the review during the third budget period will result in the five National Resource Centers
for Child Welfare Services Programs being able to submit non-competitive applications for two additional budget
periods and the National Resource Center for Programs Serving Abandoned Infants and Infants at Risk of Abandonment
and Their Families being able to submit a non-competitive application for one additional budget period subject to
the availability of funds.

Minimum Requirements for Project Design

: This section presents the basic set of issues that must be addressed in the application. Typically, they relate to
project design, evaluation, and community involvement. This section also asks for specific information on the proposed
project. Inclusion and discussion of these items in the applicant's application is important since they will be used
by the reviewers in evaluating the proposal against the evaluation criteria. Project products, continuation of
the project effort after the Federal support ceases, and dissemination/utilization activities, if applicable,
should also be addressed. 
 

Project Duration

: This section specifies the maximum length of time for the project period; it refers to the amount of time for which
Federal funding is available. 
 

Federal Share of Project Cost

: This section specifies the amount of Federal support for the project. 
The term ``budget period'' refers to the interval of time (usually 12 months) into which a multi-year period of assistance
(project period) is divided for budgetary and funding purposes. The term ``project period'' refers to the total time
a project is approved for support, including any extensions. 
 

Matching Requirement

: This section specifies the minimum non-Federal contribution, either through cash or in-kind match, that is required.
Applicants are encouraged to meet their match requirements through cash contributions. Grantees must provide at
least 10 percent of the total approved cost of the project. The total approved cost of the project is the sum of the ACYF
share and the non-Federal share. Therefore, if the required match is 10 percent, a project requesting $90,000 in Federal
funds must include a match of at least $10,000 (10 percent of the total project cost of $100,000). 
 

Anticipated Number of Projects To Be Funded

: This section specifies the number of projects that ACYF anticipates it will fund in the priority area.

2. Purpose

: To build the capacity of State, local, Tribal, and other publicly administered or publicly supported child welfare
agencies in the development, expansion, strengthening and/or improvement of the quality and effectiveness of child
welfare services to children, youth and families in a number of critical areas. The National Resource Centers for
Child Welfare Services Programs will strengthen agencies' capacity to integrate policy and practice as well as develop
and implement policy frameworks which support quality practice. The National Resource Centers for Child Welfare
Services Programs will build capacity primarily through delivering on-site training, technical assistance, and
consultation to publicly administered or publicly supported child welfare agencies. They will also engage in ancillary
activities which support the delivery of training and technical assistance. Training and technical assistance
needs will be identified in collaboration with ACYF Central and Regional Office personnel and State agency staff.




3. Background

: A period of great promise and significant opportunity has emerged for child welfare. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation
Act of 1993 established a new Subpart 2 of Title IV-B of the Social Security Act, entitled Family Preservation
and Support Services, which is capable of stimulating meaningful change in child welfare systems and fostering more
effective working relationships among Federal, State and local governments, other direct service providers, foundations
and advocacy groups around child welfare matters. 

The Federal government is in the process of redefining its relationship with State and other child welfare agencies.
A new partnership is being forged based upon a vision wherein all concerned agencies will collaborate and cooperate
to provide a continuum of services to meet the needs of vulnerable children, youth and families. 

Even though the capped entitlement funding to States from the Family Preservation and Support Program is relatively
modest, there is widespread agreement within the child and family policy community that the funds can be used best
in a creative and strategic fashion to stimulate and encourage broader system reform which is already underway in
many States and communities. Because the multiple needs of vulnerable children and families cannot be adequately
addressed through categorical programs and fragmented service delivery systems, States are being encouraged to
use the new funds to help establish a continuum of coordinated and integrated, culturally relevant, family-centered
services for children and families. Specifically, States are being asked to conduct a broad-based and inclusive
planning process with their FY 1994 Family Preservation and Family Support allocation leading to the development
of a five-year State Plan for child welfare, including family preservation and support services, beginning in FY
1995.

Additional Federal child welfare initiatives are being implemented that have enormous potential for the field.
The publication of the final rule for the Adoption and Foster Care Analysis and Reporting System (AFCARS), and interim
final rules for the Statewide Automated Child Welfare Information Systems (SACWIS), in the 

Federal Register

 on December 22, 1993, paves the way for the collection, aggregation and analysis of child welfare data to inform and
improve policies, programs, and practices at the Federal, State and local levels. 
Private philanthropy continues to make a major investment in responding to the needs of the child welfare system.
Numerous foundations are underwriting the costs of major reform efforts at the State and local levels and funding
more targeted demonstration grants on specific topics to governmental units and private agencies. 
This period of promise and opportunity for child welfare comes at a time when a mix of social, cultural and economic
forces are placing pressures on children and families as well as on child welfare professionals and agencies. Sweeping
transformations in the domestic labor market, rising rates of child and family poverty, numerous health care crises,
greater numbers of teen pregnancies, the AIDS and substance abuse epidemics, and increasing levels of interpersonal
and community violence are cumulatively taking a toll on child and family well-being. Steadily rising caseloads,
consisting of much more complex cases involving more severe presenting problems, are confronting service programs
for children and families at the State and local level. 
Throughout the country child welfare agency administrators, practitioners, and university-based personnel are
demonstrating resiliency and creativity in response to these circumstances. Skilled and knowledgeable child welfare
professionals are devising innovative and exemplary solutions to these numerous challenges, more often than not,
in the face of insufficient human, material and financial resources. 
In order to more fully meet the promise and potential the current period offers, and more fully compensate for and overcome
existing resource deficiencies, State and other publicly supported child welfare agencies are in need of capacity-building.

National Resource Centers for Child Welfare Services Programs are vital to making the most of this opportunity for
progress and accomplishment by providing States and other publicly administered or publicly supported child welfare
agencies the quality training, technical assistance and consultation they need. 
In light of the current opportunity to revitalize child welfare, the role and responsibilities of National Resource
Centers assume strategic importance. The Children's Bureau seeks to fund five National Resource Centers for Child
Welfare Services Programs which individually and collectively can make a meaningful contribution to the revitalization
effort. 
These National Resource Centers are expected to build collaborative working relationships with relevant programs
and other training and technical assistance providers funded by Federal agencies and foundations. They are to establish
effective linkages and appropriate coordination with the Community-Based Family Resource Program, the National
Center on Child Abuse and Neglect's (NCCAN) Emergency Services Technical Services Contractor, and with three statewide
Family Resource and Support model projects funded by the Family and Youth Services Bureau (FYSB). They will also play
major roles in support of the Training and Technical Assistance Resource Coordination Contract to be funded by the
Children's Bureau in FY 94. 
This network of National Resource Centers possessing the expertise, knowledge and skills to provide quality resources,
training, technical assistance, consultation, and related services is to have a central role in improving and strengthening
child welfare. Support for this network of National Resource Centers reflects a commitment by the Children's Bureau
to enhance the policy environment and the continuum of services for the benefit of children, families and agencies.



4. Minimum Requirements for Project Design

5. Priority Area 1.01A National Resource Center for Family-Centered Practice.

 As increasing social, economic and personal stresses place greater numbers of families and children potentially
at-risk and as the numbers of actual at-risk children and families have continued to expand, many State, local and
Tribal governments have implemented or are actively planning to initiate family preservation and support programs
as a way to strengthen vulnerable families. There is also widespread hope that these family-centered services will
reduce foster care caseloads and out-of-home care costs. 

Family-centered services are responsive to certain legislative mandates of Public Law 96-272, the Adoption

Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980, and are central to the legislative intent of the new Subpart 2 of title IV-B
of the Social Security Act, Family Preservation and Support Services. 

The term ``family-centered'' encompasses both family preservation and family support activities. Family support
entails community-based preventive services designed to: alleviate stress and promote parental competencies
and behaviors that will increase the ability of families to successfully nurture their children; enable families
to use other resources and opportunities available in the community; create supportive networks to enhance child-rearing
abilities of parents; and help compensate for the increased social isolation, economic deficiencies and vulnerability
of families. 

Family preservation involves helping families maintain the safety of children in their own homes; alleviate crises
that might lead to the out-of-home care of children; avoid the unnecessary out-of-home placement of children; reunify
with their children and youth already in out-of-home care; deal with issues that arise in both pre and post-adoption
periods; and obtain services and other supports responsive to their multiple needs in a culturally appropriate manner.


Child welfare agencies need to develop and/or enhance their capacity to plan, manage, operate and monitor family-centered
services, and build collaborative working relationships with community-based organizations providing family
support programs. The National Resource Center for Family-Centered Practice will help child and family service
agencies develop expertise in all phases and aspects of administering family-centered services by providing training
and technical assistance itself or by providing a referral to an appropriate alternative resource. The National
Resource Center for Family-Centered Practice will focus most of its activity on the preventive end (i.e., prevention
of family dysfunction/foster care) of the continuum of services for children and families. In addition to meeting
the minimum requirements detailed previously, applicants need to: 

 Demonstrate the capacity to articulate a family-centered approach, encompassing family preservation and
family support, and integrate family-centered concepts into the field of child welfare. 

 Describe a plan for collecting, reviewing and disseminating analyses of existing research and other appropriate
information on the relative merits of different program approaches. 

 Describe a plan for providing techniques and strategies that will assist child welfare decisionmakers in
assessing numerous options for the development and implementation of family-centered programs and services. This
plan should also consider the planning and developmental needs for post-legal adoption family support and family
preservation program services. 

 Demonstrate knowledge of community-based family support programs and describe a plan for fostering effective
linkages between these family support programs and public child welfare agencies.

6. Priority Area 1.01B National Resource Center for Permanency Planning

. During a brief period of time in the late 1970's and early 1980's the number of children placed in foster care was decreasing.
Many child welfare experts attribute this decline to attention and activities addressing permanency planning which
occurred in the period around the passage of Public Law 96-272, the Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act
of 1980. Since the mid-1980's, the number of children in foster care has shown continuous growth. These children and
their biological and foster families constitute a large and costly segment of the population served by child welfare
agencies. 
Agencies are faced with the challenge of responding to the increasing demand for services with quality and cost-effective
programs. They are expected to plan and achieve permanence for children in foster care and conform to the procedures
and safeguards spelled out in both State and Federal statutes. 
At the same time, the emergence of new and more severe child and family problems has put additional pressure on agencies
to develop and deliver more complex services and has made the planning for and attainment of permanency more complicated.
Agencies are often hard pressed to offer the specialized and therapeutic foster family environments more children
entering foster care appear to need. Providing services to the families of children in care and attending to the legal
and service issues related to permanency planning have been especially problematic. Finally, the declassification
of many public child welfare positions and the loosening of strong ties between public agencies and social work education
is believed to have contributed to an erosion of practice quality and compromised achieving permanency. 
While there is an emphasis on providing familial settings for children and youth, large numbers of young people still
are placed in residential care facilities. Although quality residential care can be a useful temporary resource
for certain children and youth, a lack of suitable alternatives means that far too often a residential placement is
used to care for young people when it may not be appropriate. Establishing permanence for this segment of the foster
care population is often more challenging than with children in family foster care. 
The National Resource Center for Permanency Planning will help children and family services agencies improve their
capacity to accomplish permanence through the development and implementation of high quality foster family and
residential care for children who must be removed from their homes. In addition to addressing the minimum requirements
detailed previously, applicants need to:

 Describe a strategy for promoting agencies' reconceptualizing foster care as a family-focused, community-based
service incorporating policies and practices consistent with a family-centered orientation. Present a plan for
helping agencies become more effective in planning for permanency by being responsive to the individualized needs
of families who have their children in placement, and operating from the perspective of family strengths. 
 Describe a strategy for assisting agencies with critical issues such as improving ongoing services to birth
parents; analyzing the use of relative foster care; developing and implementing plans for returning children home;
improving after-care; establishing day treatment programs; facilitating termination of parental rights; improving
group homes and family shelter care programs with particular emphasis on case assessment; improving care provided
in residential facilities with particular emphasis on permanency planning; utilizing family shelter for infants
and young children; and reducing the time actually spent in shelter care. 
 Describe a plan for assisting agencies with relevant facets of cultural competence including the ability
of workers to serve all families effectively, making culturally appropriate placements, recruiting minority adoptive
and foster families, delivering culturally relevant respite care, assessing the factors contributing to the overrepresentation
of minority children in the foster care system, and developing strategies to improve outcomes for minority families
and children. 

 Describe a plan for analyzing existing training materials on key topics such as case assessment, permanency
planning and cultural diversity emphasizing who will be doing the analysis and detailing analytic procedures. 
 Describe a strategy for conveying how model approaches to recruiting, providing pre-service and in-service
training for, and retaining foster parents will be collected and communicated. 
 Describe a plan for conveying how effective program approaches that serve the medical, dental, mental health,
special educational and vocational needs of children in foster care and their families will be identified and disseminated
for replication. 
 Describe a plan for linking with the National Resource Center for Organizational Improvement in the area of
licensing, and the National Resource Center on Legal and Court Issues on safeguards to permanency and termination
of parental rights.

7. Priority Area 1.01C National Resource Center for Organizational Improvement.

 Child welfare agencies confront demanding management and human resource development issues. In regard to management
issues, agencies are faced with the formidable task of developing, implementing and evaluating an expanding range
of programs and services for more varied and challenging families and children. These programs and services are often
funded under broad and complex legislation and accompanying regulations which delineate appropriate agency practices
and behaviors. Often embedded in child welfare statutes and regulations are criteria to which agencies are held accountable.
Agencies find it challenging to simultaneously establish a broader repertoire of service programs and meet mounting
accountability and regulatory requirements. Agencies' ability to blend funding streams and link programs to provide
more holistic services to families and children is daunting but doable. 

In regard to human resources, the idiosyncracies of State civil service systems, pressures for professional licensure
of social service agency staff, the inherent rigidity of bureaucratic systems, and high turnover rates at all levels
complicate and often compromise the ability of agencies to attend and respond to staffing needs. This subsequently
impairs the ability of staff to meet the needs of families and children.

A number of efforts are responding to human resource deficiencies with the intent of increasing the professionalization
of child welfare staff. The rebuilding of partnerships between social work education programs and public agencies,
and States' increasing access to Federal financial participation in the form of title IV-E training reimbursements
are examples. 

The National Resource Center for Organizational Improvement will help develop the capacity of child and family service
agencies to design, implement and evaluate management improvement and human resource development practices to
improve outcomes for families and children. In addition to meeting the minimum requirements detailed previously,
applicants need to: 
 Describe how the Resource Center will employ an Organizational Development perspective in rendering services.
Organizational Development is comprised of behavioral science and system based procedures and practices supporting
organizational renewal. Organizational Development fosters agencies' capacity to gain insight regarding their
own operational processes as well as develop and implement organizational change strategies. 
 Describe a plan for dealing with management improvement issues emphasizing administrative strategies and
operational procedures such as managing systems change, redesigning case flow procedures to overcome fragmentation
and revitalize case management, streamlining record-keeping practices, formulating strategic and operational
planning processes, and monitoring purchase-of-service agreements. 

 Describe a plan for dealing with human resource development issues emphasizing effective staffing and workplace
improvement initiatives such as, modifying decision-making practices to overcome staff isolation and promote
their meaningful participation in issues affecting their work; developing career ladders and promotional opportunities;
designing responses to worker safety; strengthening supervisory in-service training; and promoting methods for
minimizing stress and burnout. 
 Describe a plan for addressing licensing issues related to child placement and child care services, emphasizing
the collection and analysis of licensing related data for the purposes of identifying and responding to the needs
of States, and conducting meetings and/or conferences on licensing. 

 Describe a plan for promoting interagency and intersystem collaboration and exchange of information around
blending funding streams, planning practices, and policy and program innovations, making sure to link with the Child
and Adolescent Service System Program (CAASP) Training and Technical Assistance Center funded by the Center for
Mental Health Services, the Maternal and Child Health Bureau and the Children's Bureau. 

 Describe strategies for helping States, local and Tribal agencies become adept at using information system
technology for strategic and operational decision-making. 
 Describe a plan for helping States and other publicly administered or publicly supported agencies develop
outcome measures at the child, family and system levels.

8. Priority Area 1.01D National Resource Center for Youth Development. The pressures on and dissolution
of greater numbers of families coupled with negative social forces and peer pressure has resulted in higher levels
of family conflict and increasing numbers of youth struggling with the problems of maintaining effective school
performance, homelessness, substance abuse/addiction, prostitution, delinquency, pregnancy and suicide. 
Continuing difficulties in attaining permanency means many youth remain in foster care without returning to their
biological family or becoming and remaining part of an adoptive family. This sizeable population of youth needs to
be prepared for self-sufficiency, independence, and effective community living. These youth need assistance in
seeking additional education or training, and help in securing employment, finding housing/living arrangements,
learning about parenting as they form their own families, and linking with family/social/community supports.

There is also growing societal concern regarding the problem of anti-social violent youth. While the juvenile justice
and adult correctional systems are dealing with the most severe adolescent actions, the child welfare foster care
system is also having to respond to the needs of youth whose behavior makes it impossible for them to remain with their
families or in their communities. 
Youth in the child welfare system are too often only marginally served by existing agencies and the service delivery
system. Most child welfare agencies are hard pressed to develop quality programs and services for this growing population
of older adolescents who have more complex challenges, and who are not as likely to be in residential care due to the
deinstitutionalization movement, the decriminalization of status offenders, and budgetary cutbacks targeting
group care institutions. 

The National Resource Center for Youth Development will help agencies develop the capacity to effectively meet the
needs of youth. This category of youth includes primarily individuals from the age of puberty through age 21. However,
this definition does not exclude consideration of the service needs of individuals who may be slightly younger or
older than the primary target population. In addition to meeting the minimum requirements detailed previously,
applicants need to: 
 Describe a plan for collecting and disseminating educational and occupational related resource materials
and information on issues including, but not limited to, special education, post-secondary education including
vocational and two and four-year academic programs, school drop-out prevention, establishing and maintaining
family connections, illiteracy, job readiness, and effective parenting. 
 Describe a plan for addressing adolescent access to health care, including substance abuse treatment and
prevention issues, specialized services for seriously emotionally disturbed (SED) youths, and related mental
health initiatives with particular attention paid to the psychological trauma related to witnessing and experiencing
violence. 

 Describe strategies for dealing with youth sexuality issues with an emphasis on teen pregnancy and AIDS, and
propose how those techniques will be communicated to adolescents and to the staff of agencies serving youth. 
 Describe a plan for showcasing innovative and successful transitional and independent living programs and
practices dealing with issues such as effective parenting and adolescent input into the design of such programs through
the sponsorship of national conferences. Describe how the Resource Center will go about communicating information
about exemplary transitional and independent living programs to public and private providers with an emphasis on
adaptation and replication.

9. 

Priority Area 1.01E National Resource Center on Legal and Court Issues.

 Child welfare agencies administer child welfare programs within a framework of law. The passage of major pieces of
child welfare legislation has prompted continuous reassessment and redefinition of the relationship between State
child welfare agencies and the judiciary. Appropriate responses to confirmed cases of abuse and neglect, termination
of parental rights, and adoption proceedings are eventually settled in the courts. Periodic judicial review of foster
care cases is a Federal statutory requirement. It is not unheard of for judges in some jurisdictions to actually develop
case plans for individual clients, and give casework directives to agency staff. 

Legislatively mandated judicial involvement in the details of case practice has often forced agencies to analyze
and interpret legal issues, court decisions, and judicial pronouncements; determine their implications for programs
and practices; and review and revise their policies and procedures accordingly. Faced with an expanding statutory
and regulatory base, the legal staff of public child welfare agencies have gradually assumed a greater responsibility
for maintaining legal and regulatory compliance and consequently have acquired greater influence in shaping agency
activity. In addition, liability concerns are substantially influencing agency practice.

The courts have become increasingly involved in the operations of public child welfare agencies as a result of class
action suits intended to promote system reform. The courts have demonstrated a willingness to oversee system change
through court orders and consent decrees. 
The recognition of how intertwined courts and child welfare are is reflected in a set-aside component of the Family
Preservation and Support Services program providing grants to State courts to assess and improve their proceedings
relating to foster care and adoption beginning in FY 1995. 
The National Resource Center on Legal and Court Issues will help build the capacity of children and family service
agencies to deal with a range of legal and court related concerns. In addition to meeting the minimum requirements
detailed previously, applicants need to: 
 Describe a plan highlighting methods and techniques that can be employed to improve coordination and communication
between the judicial system and the public child welfare system. 
 Describe a plan for assisting agencies to become more adept at understanding and more efficient at responding
to law-related concerns. 
 Describe a plan for maintaining legal research and analysis capabilities and ongoing information dissemination
functions on complex issues such as HIV/AIDS, custodial issues for medically fragile children, rights of addicted
parents, parental rights to treatment, confidentiality, and others that may emerge. 
 Describe strategies for designing, delivering and/or collaborating with others on the training of judges
and other significant court personnel to implement key provisions and requirements of federal child welfare legislation.

 Describe a plan for reviewing and analyzing class action suits, court orders and consent decrees, and maintaining
a database 
on litigation within the child welfare system. 
 Describe a plan for working with State court systems and/or with other organizations on assisting States regarding
the grants for State court assessment and improvement from the Family Preservation and Support Services legislation.

D. Discussion of Priority Area 
2.01 National Resource Center for Programs Serving Abandoned Infants and Infants at Risk of Abandonment
and Their Families 




1. Eligible Applicants:

 Any State, local, public or private nonprofit agency or organization, including accredited colleges and universities.



2. Purpose:

 To assist in the coordination of services, exchange of information and the continuing development, expansion and
strengthening and improvement in the quality and effectiveness of programs described in Public Law 102-236,
the Abandoned Infants Assistance Act of 1988, as amended (Act) whether or not the service providers receive funds
authorized under the Act. The Act provides financial support for demonstration projects to prevent the abandonment
of infants and young children, particularly those with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or who have been perinatally
exposed to the virus or who have been perinatally exposed to a dangerous drug; to identify and address the needs of those
infants and young children who are, or are at risk of being abandoned; to develop a program of comprehensive services
for those children and their families which will strengthen family functioning and prevent abandonment, including
family foster care, case management, family support, respite care and crisis intervention, counseling and group
residential care services; and to recruit and train health and social services personnel, foster care families and
residential providers to meet the needs of infants and young children who are at risk of abandonment. 


3. Background Information:

 Since 1990, ACYF has awarded a total of 42 grants under the Abandoned Infants Assistance Program (AIA) to a variety
of agencies, including State and local departments of social and health services; hospitals; universities; and
private, nonprofit, child-serving agencies. These projects include comprehensive service demonstration programs,
training projects and resource coordination efforts. Currently, there are 32 comprehensive service demonstration
programs in operation. In addition, the Maternal and Child Health Bureau and the Center for Substance Abuse Programs
fund related activities. These programs are designed to meet the immediate social service and health care needs of
infants and young children and their families impacted by HIV infection and drug exposure; to address issues of community
coordination; to improve utilization of scarce resources; and to develop systems which will meet the long-term needs
of the children and their families. Also, many local jurisdictions nationwide are implementing programs, with or
without federal assistance, that provide services to the same target populations. 
The current National Abandoned Infant Assistance Resource Center for Drug-, HIV, and Medically Involved Children,
funded from September, 1991 through September, 1994, provides training, technical assistance and consultation
to the AIA programs and related activities in order to improve service delivery to drug and HIV-exposed infants, young
children and their families; provides training to social service, health and other workers in order to educate them
about program and services for families who are at risk of abandoning their children. 
Although a substantial number of abandoned infants and related projects have been established, knowledge about
effective strategies and services continues to evolve and develop. Existing programs vary considerably in terms
of quality, experience and intervention strategies. However, the demand for such services is increasing as substance
abuse and HIV infection impact on greater number of infants and young children and their families. ACF intends to continue
to support a National Resource Center to assist in identifying, developing and utilizing effective program practices,
information and materials in order to meet this service demand; and to continue to provide training and technical
assistance as needed. 


4. Minimum Requirements for Project Design:

 The National Resource Center should provide State and local private nonprofit agencies and organizations with broad
access to information, methods, techniques and strategies for developing, expanding, improving social and health
care services to infants and young children and their families impacted by substance abuse and/or HIV infection.
Applicants must describe their capabilities and plans for assisting these organizations. The application should:

 Demonstrate knowledge about the problems and issues involved in planning and providing services for infants
and young children who are drug- and/or HIV-exposed and are at risk of abandonment and their families. 
 Provide documentation of the commitment to improve the quality of programs and services for infants and young
children who are abandoned or in danger of abandonment and their families. 
 Describe a plan for continually identifying emerging issues from the fields of child welfare, developmental
disabilities, maternal and child health, and substance abuse/addiction, particularly as they relate to perinatal
drug exposure and pediatric HIV-infection and the impact these issues have on family functioning and stability.

Before applications are reviewed, each application will be screened to determine that the applicant organization
is an eligible applicant as specified under the selected priority area. Applications from organizations which do
not meet the eligibility requirements for the priority area will not be considered or reviewed in the competition,
and the applicant will be so informed. 


B. Review Process and Funding Decisions 



Timely applications from eligible applicants will be reviewed and scored competitively. Experts in the field, generally
persons from outside of the Federal government, will use the evaluation criteria listed in Section C, Evaluation
Criteria, to review and score the applications. The results of this review are a primary factor in making funding decisions.

ACYF reserves the option of discussing applications with, or referring them to, other Federal or non-Federal funding
sources when this is determined to be in the best interest of the Federal government or the applicant. It may also solicit
comments from ACYF Regional Office staff, other Federal agencies, interested foundations, national organizations,
specialists, experts, States and the general public. These comments, along with those of the expert reviewers, will
be considered by ACYF in making funding decisions. 
In making decisions on awards, ACYF may give preference to applications which demonstrate or feature: Experience
in providing complex training and technical assistance in child welfare and/or related fields; an eclectic approach
to the substantive content of each topical area; a favorable balance between Federal and non-Federal funds available
for the proposed project; and the potential for high benefit for the level of Federal investment. 
To the greatest extent possible, efforts will be made to ensure that funding decisions reflect an equitable distribution
of assistance across geographic regions of the country.

C. Evaluation Criteria 


A panel of at least three reviewers (primarily experts from outside the Federal government) will review the applications.
Applicants should ensure that they address each minimum requirement in the priority area description under the appropriate
section of the Program Narrative Statement. 
Reviewers will determine the strengths and weaknesses of each application in terms of the evaluation criteria listed
below, provide comments and assign numerical scores. The point value following each criterion heading indicates
the maximum numerical weight that each section may be given in the review process. 
Applications under all priority areas will be evaluated against the following criteria. 
1. 

Objective and Need for Assistance 

(20 points) 
The extent to which the application pinpoints any relevant physical, economic, social, financial, institutional
or other problems requiring a solution; demonstrates the need for the assistance; states the principal and subordinate
objectives of the project; provides supporting documentation or other testimonies from concerned interests other
than the applicant; and includes and/or references relevant data. 
2.

they are consistent with the objectives of the proposal, and the extent to which the application indicates the anticipated
contributions to policy, practice, theory and/or research. The extent to which the proposed project costs are reasonable
in view of the expected results. 
3. 

Approach 

(35 points). The extent to which the application outlines a sound and workable plan of action pertaining to the scope

the work, giving acceptable reasons for taking the proposed approach as opposed to others; describes and supports
any unusual features of the project, such as design or technological innovations, reductions in cost or time, or extraordinary
social and community involvements; provides for projections of the accomplishments to be achieved; and lists the
activities to be carried out in chronological order, showing a reasonable schedule of accomplishments and target
dates. 
The extent to which, when applicable, the application identifies the kinds of data to be collected and maintained,
and discusses the criteria to be used to evaluate the results and successes of the project. The extent to which the application
describes the evaluation methodology that will be used to determine if the needs identified and discussed are being
met and if the results and benefits identified are being achieved. The extent to which the application identifies

Part IV_Instructions for the Development and Submission of 
Applications 


This Part contains information and instructions for submitting applications in response to this announcement.
Application forms are provided along with a checklist for assembling an application package. Please copy and use
these forms in submitting an application. 

Potential applicants should read this section carefully in conjunction with the information contained within the
specific priority area under which the application is to be submitted. The priority area descriptions are in Part
II.

The Abandoned Infants Program is covered under Executive Order 12372, Intergovernmental Review of Federal Programs,
and 45 CFR Part 100, Intergovernmental Review of Department of Health and Human Services Program and Activities.
Under the Order, States may design their own processes for reviewing and commenting on proposed Federal assistance
under covered programs. 
All States and territories, except Alabama, Alaska, Connecticut, Hawaii, Idaho, Kansas, Louisiana, Minnesota,
Montana, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Virginia, Washington, American Samoa and Palau,
have elected to participate in the Executive Order process and have established State Single Point of Contact (SPOCs).
Applicants from these 18 jurisdictions need take no action regarding E.O. 12372. Applicants for projects to be administered
by Federally-recognized Indian Tribes are also exempt from the requirements of E.O. 12372. Otherwise, applicants
should contact their SPOCs as soon as possible to alert them of the prospective applications and receive any necessary
instructions. Applicants must submit any required material to the SPOCs as soon as possible so that the program office
can obtain and review SPOC comments as part of the award process. It is imperative that the applicant submit all required
materials, if any, to the SPOC and indicate the date of this submittal (or the date of contact if no submittal is required)
on the Standard Form 424, item 16a. 
Under 45 CFR 100.8(a)(2), a SPOC has 60 days from the application deadline to comment on proposed new or competing continuation
awards. For this particular announcement a waiver of the 60 day period has been approved and SPOC's are asked to provide
comments within 30 days of the application deadline. The 30 day SPOC comment period provides all potential applicants
with a full 60 days for application preparation and submission. This will allow for the greatest number of applicants,
and also not give an advantage to applicants who have received similar awards in the past. The 30 day SPOC comment period
ensures that all applications can be thoroughly developed and reviewed, and that awards can be made in FY 1994. 
SPOCs are encouraged to eliminate the submission of routine endorsements as official recommendations. 
Additionally, SPOCs are requested to clearly differentiate between mere advisory comments and those official State
process recommendations which may trigger the accommodate or explain rule. 
When comments are submitted directly to ACF, they should be addressed to: 
Department of Health and Human Services, 
Administration for Children and Families, 
Division of Discretionary Grants, 
370 L'Enfant Promenade SW. 
6th Floor East, OFM/DDG, 
Washington, D.C. 20047. 
A list of the Single Points of Contact for each State and Territory is included as Appendix B of this announcement.

Project Summary Description.

 Clearly mark this separate page with the applicant name as shown in item 5 of the SF 424, the priority area number as shown
at the top of the SF 424, and the title of the project as shown in item 11 of the SF 424. The summary description should not
exceed 300 words. These 300 words become part of the computer database on each project. 

Care should be taken to produce a summary description which accurately and concisely reflects the application. It
should describe the objectives of the project, the approaches to be used and the outcomes expected. The description
should also include a list of major products that will result from the proposed project, such as software packages,
materials, management procedures, data collection instruments, training packages, or videos (please note that
audiovisuals should be closed captioned). The project summary description, together with the information on the

At the bottom of the page, following the summary description, type up to 10 key words which best describe the proposed
project, the service(s) involved and the target population(s) to be covered. These key words will be used for computerized
information retrieval for specific types of funded projects. 

4. 

Program Narrative Statement.

 The Program Narrative Statement is a very important part of an application. It should be clear, concise, and address
the specific requirements mentioned under the priority area description in Part II. 

The narrative should provide information concerning how the application meets the evaluation criteria (see Section
C, Part III), using the following headings: 




(a) 

Objectives and Need for Assistance; 
(b) Results and Benefits Expected; 
(c) Approach; and 
(d) Staff Background and Organization's Experience. 





The specific information to be included under each of these headings is described in Section C of Part III, Evaluation
Criteria. 

The narrative should be typed double-spaced on a single-side of an 81/2
'
' x 11
'
' plain white paper, with 1
'
' margins on all sides. All pages of the narrative (including charts, references/footnotes, tables, maps,
exhibits, etc.) must be sequentially numbered, beginning with Objectives and Need for Assistance as page number
one. Applicants should not submit reproductions of larger size paper, reduced to meet the size requirement. 

The length of the application, including the application forms and all attachments, should meet criteria set forth
in each Priority Area. A page is a single side of an 81/2 x 11
'
' sheet of paper. Applicants are requested not to send pamphlets, brochures or other printed material along
with their application as these pose xeroxing difficulties. These materials, if submitted, will not be included
in the review process if they exceed the page limit criteria. Each page of the application will be counted to determine
the total length.

5. Organizational Capability Statement.

 The Organizational Capability Statement should consist of a brief (two to three pages) background description of
how the applicant organization (or the unit within the organization that will have responsibility for the project)
is organized, the types and quantity of services it provides, and/or the research and management capabilities it
possesses. This description should cover capabilities not included in the Program Narrative Statement. It may include
descriptions of any current or previous relevant experience, or describe the competence of the project team and its
demonstrated ability to produce a final product that is readily comprehensible and usable. An organization chart
showing the relationship of the project to the current organization should be included. 
6. 

Part IV_Assurances/Certifications.

 Applicants are required to file an SF 424B, Assurances_Non-Construction Programs and the Certification Regarding
Lobbying. Both must be signed and returned with the application. In addition, applicants must certify their compliance
with: (1) Drug-Free Workplace Requirements; and (2) Debarment and Other Responsibilities. Copies of these assurances/certifications
are reprinted at the end of this announcement in Appendix A and should be reproduced, as necessary. A duly authorized
representative of the applicant organization must certify that the applicant is in compliance with these assurances/certifications.
A signature on the SF 424 indicates compliance with the Drug Free Workplace Requirements, and Debarment and Other
Responsibilities certifications. 
A signature on the application constitutes an assurance that the applicant will comply with the pertinent Departmental
regulations contained in 45 CFR Part 74.

Instructions for the SF-424A



General Instructions



This form is designed so that application can be made for funds from one or more grant programs. In preparing the budget,
adhere to any existing Federal grantor agency guidelines which prescribe how and whether budgeted amounts should
be separately shown for different functions or activities within the program. For some programs, grantor agencies
may require budgets to be separately shown by function or activity. For other programs, grantor agencies may require
a breakdown by function or activity. Sections A, B, C, and D should include budget estimates for the whole project except
when applying for assistance which requires Federal authorization in annual or other funding period increments.
In the latter case, Sections A, B, C, and D should provide the budget for the first budget period (usually a year) and
Section E should present the need for Federal assistance in the subsequent budget periods. All applications should
contain a breakdown by the object class categories shown in Lines a-k of Section B.



Section A. Budget Summary

Lines 1-4, Columns (a) and (b)



For applications pertaining to a 

single

 Federal grant program (Federal Domestic Assistance Catalog number) and 

not requiring

 a functional or activity breakdown, enter on Line 1 under Column (a) the catalog program title and the catalog number
in Column (b).

For applications pertaining to a 

single

 program 

requiring

 budget amounts by multiple functions or activities, enter the name of each activity or function on each line in Column
(a), and enter the catalog number in Column (b). For applications pertaining to multiple programs where none of the
programs require a breakdown by function or activity, enter the catalog program title on each line in 

Column

 (a) and the respective catalog number on each line in Column (b).

For applications pertaining to 

multiple

 programs where one or more programs 

require

 a breakdown by function or activity, prepare a separate sheet for each program requiring the breakdown. Additional
sheets should be used when one form does not provide adequate space for all breakdown of data required. However, when
more than one sheet is used, the first page should provide the summary totals by programs.



Lines 1-4, Columns (c) through (g)



For 

new applications,

 leave Columns (c) and (d) blank. For each line entry in Columns (a) and (b), enter in Columns (e), (f), and (g) the appropriate
amounts of funds needed to support the project for the first funding period (usually a year).

For 

continuing grant program applications,

 submit these forms before the end of each funding period as required by the grantor agency. Enter in Columns (c) and
(d) the estimated amounts of funds which will remain unobligated at the end of the grant funding period only if the Federal
grantor agency instructions provide for this. Otherwise, leave these columns blank. Enter in Columns (e) and (f)
the amounts of funds needed for the upcoming period. The amount(s) in Column (g) should be the sum of amounts in Columns
(e) and (f).



For supplemental grants and changes

 to existing grants, do not use Columns (c) and (d). Enter in Column (e) the amount of the increase or decrease of Federal
funds and enter in Column (f) the amount of the increase or decrease of non-Federal funds. In Column (g) enter the new
total budgeted amount (Federal and non-Federal) which includes the total previous authorized budgeted amounts
plus or minus, as appropriate, the amounts shown in Columns (e) and (f). The amount(s) in Column (g) should not equal
the sum of amounts in Columns (e) and (f).

Line 5_Show the totals for all columns used.



Section B. Budget Categories



In the column headings (1) through (4), enter the titles of the same programs, functions, and activities shown on Lines
1-4, Column (a), Section A. When additional sheets are prepared for Section A, provide similar column headings
on each sheet. For each program, function or activity, fill in the total requirements for funds (both Federal and non-Federal)
by object class categories.

Lines 6a-i_Show the totals of Lines 6a to 6h in each column.

Line 6j_Show the amount of indirect cost.

Line 6k_Enter the total of amounts on Lines 6i and 6j. For all applications for new grants and continuation grants the
total amount in column (5), Line 6k, should be the same as the total amount shown in Section A, Column (g), Line 5. For
supplemental grants and changes to grants, the total amount of the increase or decrease as shown in Columns (1)-(4),
Line 6k should be the same as the sum of the amounts in Section A, Columns (e) and (f) on Line 5.

Violence Against Women; Multifaceted Community-Based Demonstration Projects; Notice of Availability of Funds
For Fiscal Year 1994 



Introduction 



The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announce the availability of fiscal year (FY) 1994 funds for
cooperative agreements to create multifaceted community-based Violence Against Women (VAW) prevention demonstration
projects. 

The Public Health Service (PHS) is committed to achieving the health promotion and disease prevention objectives
described in ``Healthy People 2000,'' a PHS-led national activity to reduce morbidity and mortality and improve
the quality of life. This announcement is related to the priority area of Violent and Abusive Behavior. (For ordering
a copy of ``Healthy People 2000,'' see the section, ``Where to Obtain Additional Information.'') 




Authority 



This program announcement is authorized under sections 301, 317, 391, 392 and 393, of the Public Health Service Act
(42 U.S.C. 241, 247b, 280b, 280b-1 and 280b-2), as amended. 



Smoke-Free Workplace 



The Public Health Service strongly encourages all grant recipients to provide a smoke-free workplace and promote
the non-use of all tobacco products. This is consistent with the PHS mission to protect and advance the physical and
mental health of the American people. 



Eligible Applicants 



Applications may be submitted by public and private, nonprofit and for-profit organizations, and governments and
their agencies. Thus, universities, colleges, research institutions, hospitals, other public and private organizations,
State and local governments or their bona fide agents, federally recognized Indian tribal governments, Indian tribes
or Indian tribal organizations, and small, minority- and/or women-owned businesses are eligible to apply. 



Availability of Funds 



Approximately $1,375,000 is available in FY 1994 to fund up to five demonstration projects. Awards are expected to
range from $250,000 to $300,000 with an average award of $275,000, and are expected to begin on or about September 30,
1994. Awards will be made for a 12-month budget period within a project period up to 5 years. Funding estimates may vary
and are subject to change. Non-competing continuation awards for new budget periods within the approved project
period will be made on the basis of satisfactory progress as evidenced by required reports and site visits. 






Note: 

At the request of the applicant, Federal personnel may be assigned to a project area in lieu of a portion of the financial
assistance. 



Definitions 



Violence Against Women (VAW) is defined as threatened or actual use of physical force against a woman that either results
or has the potential to result in injury or death. This type of violence includes the physical, sexual, or psychological
assault of women by partners, intimates, family members, and acquaintances. Commonly referenced types of behavior
that fit within this definition include family and intimate violence, spouse abuse, partner abuse (including same
sex relationships), women battering, courtship violence, sexual assault, and date rape. Public health approaches
violence as a health issue and consequently, uses injuries, both fatal and nonfatal, psychological and physical,
to quantify the impact of violence. 

For the purposes of this announcement, the area of attention is in primary prevention of violence against adolescent
(12+ years of age) and adult women by persons known to the victim (family members, partners, and intimates) rather
than by strangers. 

Interventions for VAW may encompass training/education, legal (e.g., mandatory arrest policies), behavioral,
or environmental change strategies. 
Multifaceted programs are programs which incorporate multiple interventions aimed at reducing the incidence of
VAW and that results in injury or death. Since beliefs and behaviors are difficult to change, effective prevention
models require a combination of interventions that provide specific strategies for establishing a coordinated
program. For multifaceted programs to be effective, interventions must be complementary. For example, the benefits
of referral protocols are potentiated by expanding emergency shelter and support services for victims. 

No single solution has been effective in the prevention of VAW. To maximize effectiveness, primary prevention programs
should be based on multiple complementary interventions in multiple settings. These programs should be community-based
and tailored to meet the specific needs of the community, including the most effective strategies and personnel.
Supporting and empowering communities to develop effective prevention programs will represent an essential model
for delivering interventions for those in need. The community-based model has been successful in dealing with other
public health prevention efforts such as HIV prevention.

Local Planning Group (LPG) is defined as a team of individuals drawn from community-based organizations, State and
local health departments, and a local college or university. The LPG would collaborate in the design, implementation,
and evaluation of the proposed VAW prevention program. A female victim of intimate violence should be included as
an additional team member. The LPG team participants will serve as advisors and consultants on the practical and scientific
aspects of the proposed intervention and evaluation activities. Each member or group represented on the LPG must
have its proposed activities, responsibilities, and contributions to the success of the project clearly defined
in the ``Application Content'' section of the application. Applicants should also see the ``Program Requirements''
section. 

Full working partners are defined as any of the organizations or institutions that are collaborating in the VAW prevention
project either through participation on the local planning group or in some other substantive way. It is essential
that full working partners' duties, responsibilities, and contributions to the success of the project are clearly
defined in the ``Application Content'' section of the application. Applicants should also see the ``Program Requirements''
section. For example, a full working partner may have access to the community (target population) that the applicant
does not possess. Because the full working partner is substantially involved in the project, the applicant can state
that the project as a whole has community access. 

Primary prevention is defined as the reduction or control of causative factors for a health problem and includes reducing
risk factors and environmental exposures, and includes health-service interventions. 



Purpose 



The purposes of this program are to: 

1. Identify or develop potentially effective intervention strategies for delivering VAW primary prevention at
the community level. 

2. Design and implement multifaceted community-based VAW primary prevention programs based on these interventions.


3. Evaluate the extent to which the multifaceted community programs reduce rates of violent behavior, injury, and
death among intimates. 

4. Develop formal replication guidelines from successful programs for disseminating model VAW prevention programs.


Although a number of existing interventions and/or programs to prevent VAW are perceived as useful, little is actually
known about their effectiveness, their impact on women, and their ability to be replicated in a variety of settings.
Evaluation will help identify those programs that demonstrate the greatest promise for primary prevention. Model
programs should be able to address a particularly important type of VAW or address violence in special settings. Comprehensive,
multifaceted, and innovative efforts to address VAW may include, but are not limited to, the following strategies:


1. Public awareness campaigns to dispel misconceptions about VAW as well as change knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs
pertaining to VAW. This could include school-based curricula, college- and university-based efforts, and work-site
education programs (non-Federal); 

2. Coordination among the criminal justice system, family and intimate violence programs, substance abuse programs,
mental health centers, and the medical community for referral, intervention, shelter, and case management. This
could include: (a) Victim identification and referral protocols in hospital emergency rooms, community clinics,
and other health care settings, (b) expansion of emergency shelter and support services for victims, and (c) worksite
programs (non-Federal) including identification and referral for victims through employee assistance programs
and worksite (non-Federal) promotional campaigns; 

3. Expansion of court-ordered treatment programs for abusers which would include intensive counseling and behavior
modification treatment; or 

4. Training and education programs for professionals in health care, legal, and social service fields who deal with
potential victims and abusers or who are involved in the planning and implementation of prevention programs.

Each public advisory committee meeting listed above may have as many as four separable portions: (1) An open public
hearing, (2) an open committee discussion, (3) a closed presentation of data, and (4) a closed committee deliberation.
Every advisory committee meeting shall have an open public hearing portion. Whether or not it also includes any of
the other three portions will depend upon the specific meeting involved. The dates and times reserved for the separate
portions of each committee meeting are listed above.
The open public hearing portion of each meeting shall be at least 1 hour long unless public participation does not last
that long. It is emphasized, however, that the 1 hour time limit for an open public hearing represents a minimum rather
than a maximum time for public participation, and an open public hearing may last for whatever longer period the committee
chairperson determines will facilitate the committee's work.
Public hearings are subject to FDA's guideline (subpart C of 21 CFR part 10) concerning the policy and procedures for
electronic media coverage of FDA's public administrative proceedings, including hearings before public advisory
committees under 21 CFR part 14. Under 21 CFR 10.205, representatives of the electronic media may be permitted, subject
to certain limitations, to videotape, film, or otherwise record FDA's public administrative proceedings, including
presentations by participants.
Meetings of advisory committees shall be conducted, insofar as is practical, in accordance with the agenda published
in this 

Federal Register

 notice. Changes in the agenda will be announced at the beginning of the open portion of a meeting.
Any interested person who wishes to be assured of the right to make an oral presentation at the open public hearing portion
of a meeting shall inform the contact person listed above, either orally or in writing, prior to the meeting. Any person
attending the hearing who does not in advance of the meeting request an opportunity to speak will be allowed to make
an oral presentation at the hearing's conclusion, if time permits, at the chairperson's discretion.
The agenda, the questions to be addressed by the committee, and a current list of committee members will be available
at the meeting location on the day of the meeting.
Transcripts of the open portion of the meeting may be requested in writing from the Freedom of Information Office (HFI-35),
Food and Drug Administration, rm. 12A-16, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857, approximately 15 working
days after the meeting, at a cost of 10 cents per page. The transcript may be viewed at the Dockets Management Branch
(HFA-305), Food and Drug Administration, rm. 1-23, 12420 Parklawn Dr., Rockville, MD 20857, approximately
15 working days after the meeting, between the hours of 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday. Summary minutes of
the open portion of the meeting may be requested in writing from the Freedom of Information Office (address above)
beginning approximately 90 days after the meeting. 
The Commissioner has determined for the reasons stated that those portions of the advisory committee meetings so
designated in this notice shall be closed. The Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA) (5 U.S.C. app. 2, 10(d)), permits
such closed advisory committee meetings in certain circumstances. Those portions of a meeting designated as closed,
however, shall be closed for the shortest possible time, consistent with the intent of the cited statutes.
The FACA, as amended, provides that a portion of a meeting may be closed where the matter for discussion involves a trade
secret; commercial or financial information that is privileged or confidential; information of a personal nature,
disclosure of which would be a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy; investigatory files compiled for
law enforcement purposes; information the premature disclosure of which would be likely to significantly frustrate
implementation of a proposed agency action; and information in certain other instances not generally relevant to
FDA matters.
Examples of portions of FDA advisory committee meetings that ordinarily may be closed, where necessary and in accordance
with FACA criteria, include the review, discussion, and evaluation of drafts of regulations or guidelines or similar
preexisting internal agency documents, but only if their premature disclosure is likely to significantly frustrate
implementation of proposed agency action; review of trade secrets and confidential commercial or financial information
submitted to the agency; consideration of matters involving investigatory files compiled for law enforcement purposes;
and review of matters, such as personnel records or individual patient records, where disclosure would constitute
a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.
Examples of portions of FDA advisory committee meetings that ordinarily shall not be closed include the review, discussion,
and evaluation of general preclinical and clinical test protocols and procedures for a class of drugs or devices;
consideration of labeling requirements for a class of marketed drugs or devices; review of data and information on
specific investigational or marketed drugs and devices that have previously been made public; presentation of any
other data or information that is not exempt from public disclosure pursuant to the FACA, as amended; and, deliberation
to formulate advice and recommendations to the agency on matters that do not independently justify closing.
This notice is issued under section 10(a)(1) and (2) of the Federal Advisory Committee Act (5 U.S.C. app. 2), and FDA's
regulations (21 CFR part 14) on advisory committees.

<DOCTITLE>Final Funding Priorities for Cooperative Agreements for Area Health Education Centers Program for Fiscal Year 1994
</DOCTITLE>



The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) announces the final funding priorities for fiscal year
1994, Cooperative Agreements for the Area Health Education Centers (AHEC) Program authorized under the authority
of section 746 (a)(l), title VII of the Public Health Service (PHS) Act, as amended by the Health Professions Education
Extension Amendments of 1992, dated October 13, 1992. 



Purpose 



Section 746(a)(1) of the PHS Act authorizes Federal assistance to schools of medicine and osteopathic medicine which
have cooperative arrangements with one or more public or nonprofit private area health education centers for the
planning, development and operation of area health education center programs. 



Final Funding Priorities for FY 1994 



Proposed funding priorities were published in the 

Federal Register

 on February 17, 1994, at 59 FR 8000, for public comment. Several comments were received from one respondent. Comments
on aspects of the proposed notice which were not specifically proposed for public comment are not addressed in this
notice. 

The respondent suggested a change in the funding priority proposed for applicants which demonstrate an increase
in the percentage of graduates who have entered a Primary Care Residency for the most recent 3-year period. The respondent
suggested that this priority be expanded to include awarding of the priority to applicants who have, during the most
recent 3-year period, maintained a percentage of graduates entering a Primary Care Residency which substantially
exceeds the average for all U.S. medical schools. This addition to the proposed funding priority would aid medical
schools which may be maintaining a high percentage, i.e., 50-60 percent, compared to medical schools which
may show a significant increase but start at a lower percentage, i.e., increase from 15 to 25 percent. It should be noted
that an average percentage for all U.S. medical schools (osteopathic and allopathic) would most likely be lower than
the 50-60 percent, example cited, and would not encourage schools to focus their efforts on increasing their
percentage of graduates entering a Primary Care Residency. The second comment was related to the funding priority
proposed for applicants which demonstrate an increase in the percentage of underrepresented minorities for the
most recent 3-year period. The respondent suggested that for this priority the term ``minority'' should be used rather
than underrepresented minority. The intent of this funding priority is to reward those applicants who show progress
in reaching underrepresented minority populations. It is understood that data necessary to establish that specific
populations or subpopulations are underrepresented in a specific discipline may not be readily accessible, or may
differ in terms of data reported to medical school associations. Efforts were made in the application materials to
assist applicants by allowing data to be presented in two ways, in a manner similar to that provided to their medical
school association, or to present student applicant data related to the number and percent of minority population
in the State where the applicant is based. All of the data on minorities presented by the applicants will be reviewed,
recognizing that ``underrepresented minorities'' is defined for all applicants to this program in the 

Federal Register

 notice. 

Therefore, the final funding priorities will be retained as follows: 

A funding priority be given to: 

1. Applicants which demonstrate an increase in the percentage of graduates who have entered a Primary Care (Family
Medicine, General Internal Medicine, General Pediatrics) Residency, for the most recent 3-year period. 

2. Applicants which demonstrate an increase in the percentage of underrepresented minority graduates for the most
recent 3-year period.

FAX: (301) 443-8890. 



This program is listed at 93.824 in the 

Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance

. It is not subject to the provisions of Executive Order 12372, Intergovernmental Review of Federal Programs (as implemented
through 45 CFR part 100). 

This program is not subject to the Public Health System Reporting Requirements.

Developing Sponsored Research Agreements 

Considerations for Recipients of NIH Research Grants and Contracts 

Introduction 



The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is the principal biomedical and behavioral research agency within the Federal
Government. Its mission is to improve human health by increasing scientific knowledge related to health and disease
through the conduct and support of biomedical and behavioral research. The NIH advances its mission through intramural
research activity and the award of research grants and contracts to institutions of higher education, research institutes
and foundations, and other non-profit and for-profit organizations. Entities funded through NIH research grants,
contracts, and cooperative agreements (hereafter collectively referred to as Grantees) are required to maximize
the use of their research findings by making them available to the research community and the public at large and through
their timely and effective transfer to industry for development. 

In general, interactions between Grantees and industry take many forms, including industrial liaison programs,
spinoff companies, consortia, commercial licenses, material transfers, consultations, and clinical trial agreements.
This document addresses one form of Grantee/industry interaction, sponsored research agreements, on which the
NIH has focused a substantial amount of its recent attention. Sponsored research agreements are agreements between
Grantees and commercial entities in which Grantees receive funding or other consideration to support their research
in return for preferential access and/or rights to intellectual property deriving from their research results.


In developing sponsored research agreements, Grantees must consider the Bayh-Dole Act of 1980

1

 (hereafter referred to as ``Bayh-Dole'' or ``the Act'') and NIH funding agreements and refrain from engaging in activities
which undermine a Grantee's ability to fulfill its responsibilities and obligations to the Federal government.
Although Grantees are primarily responsible for the implementation of the Act, NIH, as a steward of Federal funds,
has a responsibility to provide guidance on issues regarding sponsored research agreements which may put Grantees
at odds with the Act or NIH funding requirements. 





Purpose 



The purpose of this document is to provide Grantees with issues and points to consider in developing sponsored research
agreements with commercial entities. The intent is to assist Grantees in ensuring that those agreements comply with
the requirements of the Act and NIH funding agreements while upholding basic principles of academic freedom. 

This document represents the culmination of various activities, under the aegis of the NIH Task Force on Commercialization
of Intellectual Property Rights from NIH Supported Extramural Research, which included the review and analysis
of 375 sponsored research agreements from 100 Grantees, meetings with industry, academia, and other Government
agencies, and a specially convened public forum involving subject matter experts from outside of the NIH. 

The NIH recognizes that sponsored research agreements are unique, creative devices which reflect the needs and interests
of the parties involved and require a delicate balance of risks and benefits to all of the parties. Although this document
identifies a number of points to consider, with some necessitating more scrutiny than others, no single point or issue
is so dominant that it is likely to be fatal to an agreement. Rather, the juxtaposition of multiple factors or clauses
in an agreement and their synergy needs to be assessed. Therefore, Grantees should review the provisions of proposed
sponsored research agreements both individually and in their totality. 



Background 



While NIH policies on the use of research results have been in effect for some time, commercial development of research
results took a major step forward with the passage of the Bayh-Dole Act. Congress passed the Act in response to significant
concerns about the United States' competitiveness and data indicating that rights to many inventions developed
under Federal grants and contracts and assigned to the Federal government were not being commercialized. In general,
the Act authorizes Grantees to retain title to inventions resulting from their Federally funded research and to license
such inventions to commercial entities for development. 

Specifically, the policy and objective of the Bayh-Dole are to: 

 Promote collaboration between commercial concerns and nonprofit organizations, including universities;


 Promote the utilization of inventions arising from Federally supported research or development; 

 Encourage maximum participation of small business firms in Federally sponsored research and development
efforts; 

 Ensure that inventions made by nonprofit organizations and small business firms are used to promote free competition
and enterprise; 

 Promote the commercialization and public availability of inventions made in the United States by United States
industry and labor; 

 Ensure that the Government obtains sufficient rights in Federally sponsored inventions to meet the needs
of the Government and protect the public against nonuse or unreasonable use of inventions; and 

 Minimize the costs of administering policies in this area.

The provisions of the Act have been implemented through regulations issued by the Department of Commerce and adopted
by the Department of Health and Human Services

2

. 





The Act serves the public not only by encouraging the development of useful commercial products such as drugs and clinical
diagnostic materials, but also by providing economic benefits, and enhancing U.S. competitiveness in the global
market place. 

Since its passage, the Bayh-Dole Act has been effective in promoting the transfer of technology from Grantees to industry
as evidenced by the aggressive pursuit of patenting and licensing and the proliferation of university/industry
collaborations.

3

 In addition, the development of many new and important drugs and devices have been facilitated by increased industrial
support for academic research

4

 and the explosion in the licensing of university owned inventions.

5

 Furthermore, statistics indicate that the Act has provided significant economic benefits which are projected as
increasing between 25 to 30 percent per year.

6

 








Grantee Responsibilities 



In keeping with the objectives and policy of Bayh-Dole, it is incumbent upon Grantees to effectively and efficiently
transfer technology to industry for commercial development. However, in doing so Grantees must also comply with
the specific terms of the Act, its implementing regulations, and the terms and conditions of each NIH award and ensure
that such compliance is reflected in their agreements with commercial entities. 

In carrying out that responsibility, at a minimum, Grantees need to concern themselves with issues involving maintenance
of academic freedom for institutions and investigators, fair access to information, timeliness of notification
and other requirements, rational licensing to commercial entities, and adherence to the specific requirements
of the Act and NIH funding agreements.

<TEXT>
 

While sponsored research agreements frequently are used where basic research is involved and no invention exists
to disclose nor intellectual property to license at the time the agreement is executed, Grantees should anticipate
such issues to arise and use the following points for consideration in developing a sponsored research agreement.


The first section, Universal Points for Consideration, highlights several requirements and issues that Grantees
should consider in all proposed sponsored research agreements. The second section, Points for Special Consideration,
delineates circumstances which suggest heightened scrutiny. The third section, Other Points for Consideration
by Non Profit Grantees, contains additional considerations which apply only to non profit Grantees. 



Universal Points for Consideration 



Academic Freedom 



Academic research freedom based upon social collaboration within the scientific community and the scrutiny of claims
and beliefs by its members is at the heart of scientific advancement within the United States. Primarily through Federal
funding, academic institutions have contributed to fundamental knowledge and techniques upon which current and
future scientific discoveries and technological innovations depend. Therefore, the preservation of academic
freedom for Grantee institutions and researchers is of considerable concern to the NIH. 

Grantees should be aware that their interest in the scientific endeavor covered by a sponsored research agreement
and the interest of the industrial sponsor may not be totally consonant. As a result, in general, Grantees should ensure
that sponsored research agreements preserve the freedom for academic researchers to select projects, collaborate
with other scientists, determine the types of sponsored research activities in which they wish to participate, and
communicate their research findings at meetings, and by publication and through other means.

7

 Academic researchers also should be made aware of any agreements executed by their institutions which may restrict
their ability to pursue research activities and publish research results. Grantees also should maintain their independence
to pursue their own mission without undue influence or restraint by their industrial sponsors. For example, an agreement
which gives an industrial sponsor the ability to direct the research mission of a Grantee would be inappropriate.






Dissemination of Research Results 



Grantees must ensure that the timely dissemination of research findings is not adversely affected by the conditions
of a sponsored research agreement. For example, the PHS Grants Policy Statement, incorporated as a condition of each
NIH research grant, details policies on publication of research results, responsibilities to disseminate information
on unique research resources, and standards of conduct for Grantee employees. Although an industrial sponsor's
consideration of the commercial applicability of specific research findings and/or the filing of a patent application
to secure intellectual property rights may justify a need to delay disclosure of research findings, a delay of up to
thirty (30) days is generally viewed as a reasonable period for such activity. Depending upon the individual circumstances,
Grantees could consider a shorter or longer period of time, as they deem appropriate. In addition to the timing, a sponsored
research agreement which requires the disclosure of inventions and research findings developed with NIH funds to
an industrial sponsor prior to submission of the invention disclosure to the NIH, may be inconsistent with the terms
and conditions of the NIH grant or contract. 



Utilization 



The NIH also has a concern that Federally funded technology be developed and commercialized in an expedited and efficient
manner. In deciding to enter into an agreement with an commercial entity, Grantees should consider whether the organization
has the experience, capability, and commitment to bring its likely inventions to commercial status. 

Additionally, Grantees should not enter into sponsored research agreements that permit a sponsor to tie up the development
of a technology by acquiring exclusive licensing rights to the product of given research results before deciding
whether or not it will actively develop and commercialize that product. Grantees should provide a sponsor with an
option to pursue licensing rights. It is reasonable for such options to be limited to no more than six (6) months. However,
individual circumstances may dictate a shorter or longer period of time. After the option period expires, the technology
should become available for licensing to other entities. Moreover, once a sponsor decides not to exercise its option,
it should not be given a second opportunity to obtain licensing rights by matching other parties' offers for the rights.
Such requirements enable Grantees to license to companies presenting a bona fide commercialization plan, thus expediting
the availability of products to the public. 

In order to ensure that technology is developed rapidly and is not being subjected to delays, Grantees should also
establish, maintain, and actively administer policies and procedures which ensure that licenses arising from sponsored
research agreements contain due diligence requirements and benchmarks to monitor performance. When future rights
to as yet undiscovered inventions are included in a sponsored research agreement, benchmarks for development of
each such invention should be established as it becomes available for commercial development. In addition, Grantees
should actively monitor licensees in accordance with those requirements and benchmarks to assure compliance with
Grantee obligations under the Act. 



U.S. Manufacture 



The Bayh-Dole Act requires that products developed with Federal funds and used and sold in the United States, be substantially
manufactured here. In granting exclusive rights to use or sell any subject invention in the United States, Grantees
must ensure that each agreement requires that any products embodying the subject invention or produced through the
use of the subject invention will be manufactured substantially in the United States. In individual cases, a request
for waiver may be considered by the NIH. A determination will be made based upon a showing by the Grantee that reasonable
but unsuccessful efforts have been made to grant licenses on similar terms to potential licensees that would be likely
to manufacture substantially in the United States or that under the circumstances domestic manufacture is not commercially
feasible. In granting a waiver of the U.S. manufacture requirement, the NIH may consider other benefits conferred
on the United States by the potential license including the rapid availability of a product of benefit to the health
of the American people. 



Notification Requirements and Records 



In sponsored research agreements, as in other contexts, Grantees must also ensure that invention, patent and license
notification requirements are adhered to in a timely manner. Timeliness considerations include prompt (1) employee
notification to Grantee administrators of an invention made under NIH funding, (2) written disclosure to NIH of an
invention and the intent to retain or convey to the Government title to the invention, (3) adherence to time frames
for initial filing of patent applications in the United States and the filing of foreign patent applications, (4)
execution and confirmation throughout the world of NIH license rights in the results of the research, and (5) notification
to the NIH of any decision not to continue patent prosecution, pay fees, or defend the patent in reexamination.

Specifically, as conditions of NIH grants and cooperative agreements, Grantees must fully notify the NIH in a timely
manner when an invention has been developed. In any event, disclosure to the NIH must be prior to the publication of
any description of the invention. When applying for continued funding in each subsequent funding period, the institution
must also provide either a listing of all inventions made during the preceding budget period or a certification that
no inventions were made during the applicable period. A final invention statement and certification listing all
inventions that were conceived or first actually reduced to practice during the course of work under the funding agreement
is required within ninety (90) days following the expiration or termination of support on an applicable project.
Additionally, Grantees need to adhere to the specific requirements contained in the patent clauses of their contracts
as well as the general provisions of the Federal Acquisition Regulations. 

Furthermore, Grantees must also document their compliance with the requirements of the Act, regulations, and terms
and conditions of NIH awards, generally and as related to sponsored research agreements. Such Grantee records must
be available for review by authorized Federal officials in accordance with the terms and conditions of the award.
For example, concerning access and retention of records under NIH grants and cooperative agreements, regulations
require grantees to retain financial and programmatic records, supporting documents, statistical records, and
all other grantee records which may reasonably be considered pertinent to a grant or subgrant.

Points for Special Consideration 



The NIH has identified several situations, outlined below, in which Grantees should exercise heightened sensitivity
and scrutiny in the development of sponsored research agreements. Such an exercise should confirm that a sponsored
research agreement does not adversely impact NIH funded activities and Grantee concerns such as academic freedom,
or shift control of the Grantee's scientific activities, management, and independence into the hands of the sponsor.
While there is no requirement that Grantees submit proposed sponsored research agreements to the NIH for review,
at the discretion of the Grantee, the NIH may be consulted for additional clarification in instances where special
considerations warrant. 

First, Grantees should subject their sponsored research agreements to heightened scrutiny when one or more of the
following threshold criteria apply: 

(a) the amount of financial support from the sponsor meets or exceeds $5 million in any one year, or, $50 million total
over the total period of funding under the agreement; 
(b) the proportion of funding by the sponsor exceeds 20 per cent of the Grantee's total research funding; 
(c) the sponsor's prospective licensing rights cover all technologies developed by a major group or component of
the Grantee organization, such as a large laboratory, department or center, or the technologies in question represent
a substantial proportion of the anticipated intellectual output of the Grantee's research staff; or 

(d) the duration of the agreement is for 5 or more years. 

If one or more of these criteria apply, it is more likely that the proposed sponsored research agreement will adversely
affect open commercial access, especially for small businesses, to a Grantee's Federally funded research activities
and may delay or impede the rapid development and commercialization of technology. 

Second, Grantees should be concerned if the scope of the sponsored research agreement is so broad that the subsequent
exclusive licensing of technology under the agreement provides a single sponsor with access to a wide array of Grantee
research findings and technologies that effectively exclude other organizations from reasonable access to a Grantee's
technology. This type of arrangement can also delay commercialization if the sponsor does not have the interest or
the capability to develop the technology. 

Third, if the sponsor contributes funds to support a Grantee's general operations rather than specifically defined
research projects, the Grantee should consider the amount of the sponsor's general funding in relation to funds contributed
from other sources when determining what prospective intellectual property rights the (sponsor will receive in
the results of the Grantee's entire research portfolio. There should be a reasonable relationship between the amount
of money contributed by the sponsor and the rights that it is granted both to review and license resulting technology
or inventions. As an extreme example, a sponsor should not be able to provide 5 percent of the Grantee's total support,
review 100 percent of the Grantee's inventions, and receive rights or a first option to 50 percent of the research results
generated by the Grantee. Where general funding is involved, a Grantee should consider establishing some mechanism
to limit the review and licensing rights of the sponsor to a particular segment or percentage of the inventions and
for a set period of time. For example, the Grantee may require the sponsor to select those research areas or projects
to which its general funding rights would attach in advance, thereby freeing up research areas that may be of interest
to other commercial entities. Because, by its nature, general funding is less directed and its results more imprecise,
Grantees should carefully monitor the impact on open competition and fair access by small business of the sponsor's
licensing practices for technology supported by general funding. 

Fourth, Grantees should avoid any other unusual practice or stipulation that might generate public concern or undermine
rather than serve the public interest.

Other Points for Consideration by Non-Profit Grantees 



The following points are to aid non-profit Grantees in administering the Act and in complying with the requirements
of NIH funding agreements. 

First, Grantees must ensure that the rights to inventions resulting from Federal funding are not assigned without
NIH approval. An exception to this is when the assignment is made to an organization which has as one of its primary functions
the management of inventions, in which case, the assignee will be subject to the same provisions as the Grantee. 

Second, Grantees must share royalties collected on NIH supported inventions with the inventors and the balance of
any royalties or income earned, after payment of expenses, including payment to inventors and incidental expenses
to the administration of subject inventions, must be utilized for the support of scientific research or education.


Third, Grantees must employ reasonable efforts to attract licensees of subject inventions that are small business
firms. Additionally, Grantees must provide a preference to small business firms when licensing a subject invention
if Grantees determine that small business firms have plans or proposals for marketing the invention which, if executed,
are equally as likely to bring the invention to practical application as any plans or proposals from applicants that
are not small business firms. However, Grantees must be satisfied that the small business firms have the capability
and resources to carry out plans or proposals. The decision whether to give a preference in any specific case is at the
discretion of the Grantee. However, since sponsored research agreements typically provide exclusive licenses
or options to such rights to the sponsor, Grantees should seriously consider and provide for these issues when negotiating
such agreements. 



Conclusion 




Technology transfer is a vehicle through which the fruits of NIH funded research are transferred to industry to be
ultimately developed into preventive, diagnostic and therapeutic products to advance human health. In a dynamic
and multinational marketplace, if the United States is to remain a world leader in technological and scientific innovation,
both the public and private sectors must work together to foster rapid development and commercialization of useful
products to benefit human health, stimulate the economy, and enhance our international competitiveness, while
at the same time protecting taxpayers' investment and safeguarding the principles of scientific integrity and academic
freedom. 

It is in this spirit that the NIH encourages Grantees to address the issues and apply the points for consideration identified
in this document when developing sponsored research agreements with commercial entities.

 Notice of Social Security Acquiescence Ruling.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 In accordance with 20 CFR 422.406(b)(2), the Commissioner of Social Security gives notice of Social Security Acquiescence
Ruling 94-1(10).



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Although not required to do so pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(1) and (a)(2), we are publishing this Social Security Acquiescence
Ruling in accordance with 20 CFR 422.406(b)(2).


A Social Security Acquiescence Ruling explains how we will apply a holding in a decision of a United States Court of
Appeals that we determine conflicts with our interpretation of a provision of the Social Security Act (the Act) or
regulations when the Government has decided not to seek further review of that decision or is unsuccessful on further
review.
We will apply the holding of the Court of Appeals decision as explained in this Social Security Acquiescence Ruling
to claims at all levels of administrative adjudication within the Tenth Circuit. This Social Security Acquiescence
Ruling will apply to all determinations and decisions made on or after June 27, 1994. If we made a determination or decision
on your application for benefits between March 12, 1993, the date of the Court of Appeals decision, and June 27, 1994,
the effective date of this Social Security Acquiescence Ruling, you may request application of the Ruling to your
claim if you first demonstrate, pursuant to 20 CFR 404.985(b), that application of the Ruling could change our prior
determination or decision.
If this Social Security Acquiescence Ruling is later rescinded as obsolete, we will publish a notice in the 

Federal Register

 to that effect as provided for in 20 CFR 404.985(e). If we decide to relitigate the issue covered by this Social Security
Acquiescence Ruling as provided for by 20 CFR 404.985(c), we will publish a notice in the 

Federal Register

 stating that we will apply our interpretation of the Act or regulations involved and explaining why we have decided
to relitigate the issue.

Wolfe 

v.

 Sullivan

, 988 F.2d 1025 (10th Cir. 1993)_Contributions To Support re: Posthumous Illegitimate Child_Title II of the Social
Security Act.


Issue:

 Whether the contributions for support by the father of an unborn child commensurate with the needs of the unborn child
at the time of the father's death establish support of the child in order to entitle the child to survivor's benefits
as a deemed child, even though the contributions to the child or the child's mother were not regular and substantial.
Further, whether the Secretary in determining if the worker was ``contributing to the support'' of the unborn child
must consider such contributions in relation to the worker's economic circumstances.


Statute/Regulation/Ruling/Citation:

 Section 216(h)(3)(C)(ii) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 416(h)(3)(C)(ii)); 20 CFR 404.366(a)(2); Social
Security Ruling (SSR) 68-22.


Circuit:

 Tenth (Colorado, Kansas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Utah, Wyoming).


Wolfe 

v.

 Sullivan

, 988 F.2d 1025 (10th Cir. 1993).


Applicability of Ruling:

 This Ruling applies to determinations or decisions at all administrative levels (i.e., initial, reconsideration,
Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) hearing and Appeals Council). To the extent indicated, this ruling expands the tests
for dependency status, as set forth in SSR 

68-22, in the Tenth Circuit.




Description of Case:

 Della Wolfe and Earl Bialczyk began living together in May 1988, although they maintained separate residences. During
the time they lived together, Bialczyk purchased groceries so Wolfe could fix his favorite breakfast, purchased
cigarettes for Wolfe, paid for her expenses when they went on dates, and installed an alternator in her car. In late
August 1988, Wolfe learned that she was pregnant and informed Bialczyk of the pregnancy two days later. The couple
separated in early September 1988. Bialczyk died on October 5, 1988. David Weyburn was born to Wolfe on April 26, 1989.
Weyburn's application for child's benefits on Bialczyk's earnings record was denied by initial and reconsideration
determinations. Pursuant to section 216(h)(3)(C)(ii) of the Social Security Act (the Act), an ALJ found that Bialczyk
was not Weyburn's biological father and, at the time of his death, he was not living with or contributing to Weyburn's
or Wolfe's support. In concluding that the evidence did not establish that Bialczyk contributed to Weyburn's or Wolfe's
support, the ALJ decided that the contributions were not regular and substantial, in cash or kind. The Appeals Council
denied Weyburn's request for review of the ALJ's decision.
The plaintiff sought judicial review alleging that the regular and substantial test was inappropriate with respect
to contributions to a posthumous illegitimate child. The district court affirmed the Secretary's decision and found
that the evidence did not prove that Bialczyk had contributed to Wolfe's support under either the regular and substantial
test or the more liberal criteria for evaluating contributions to a posthumous illegitimate child utilized by the
Ninth Circuit in 

Doran 

v.

 Schweiker

, 681 F.2d 605 (9th Cir. 1982). Weyburn appealed and the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit affirmed
the judgment of the district court.


Holding:

 The Court of Appeals agreed with the 

Doran

 court that the proper test for determining whether the father was ``contributing to the support'' of his posthumous
illegitimate child is whether the father's support was commensurate with the needs of the unborn child at the time
of the father's death. The court also agreed with 

Doran

 that the economic circumstances of the worker must be taken into account when making such a determination. The court
stated that support may be shown by proof that contributions were made to either the unborn child (e.g., baby clothes
or a crib) or the mother (e.g., food, shelter or medical care). The court further indicated that the contributions
to the mother must have been made with knowledge of the pregnancy and that expenditures intended for courtship of the
mother did not constitute contributions for support of the unborn child. 
Although the unborn child needed only minimal support when Bialczyk died, the court ruled that the evidence did not
show that Bialczyk had contributed anything to Weyburn's or Wolfe's support after he learned of the pregnancy. Moreover,
the court found that the controlling date for evaluating contributions under section 216(h)(3)(C)(ii) of the Act
was at the time of Bialczyk's death in October 1988. By that date, Wolfe and Bialczyk had ended their relationship and
the worker was no longer making any of the alleged contributions. The court concluded that, based on the record, the
evidence failed both to satisfy the Secretary's test or prove under the 

Doran

 criteria that Bialczyk had contributed to the child's support according to his ability. Because of this holding,
the court of appeals did not rule on the issue of the child's paternity.




Statement As To How Wolfe Differs From Social Security Policy


According to the Social Security Administration's (SSA's) regulations implementing section 216(h)(3)(C)(ii)
of the Act 
(20 CFR 404.366(a)), ``contributions for support'' of the claimant must be made regularly and must be substantial.
To be substantial, contributions must be large enough to meet an important part of the ordinary living costs of the
claimant. A consistent pattern of contributions is sufficient to show regularity. Under SSR 

68-22, and SSA's operating instructions, the ``living with'' or ``contributing to the support'' requirements are
established for the posthumous child of a worker if the worker was living with, or contributing to the support of, the
child's mother at the time of the worker's death. 


In adopting the Doran

 criteria, the 

Wolfe

 court stated that the proper test for contributions is whether the father's support was commensurate with the needs
of the unborn child at the time of the father's death, taking into account the father's economic circumstances at the
time of his death. 




Explanation of How SSA Will Apply The Wolfe Decision In The Circuit




This Ruling applies only to cases involving an applicant for child's benefits as a deemed child under section 216(h)(3)(C)(ii)
of the Act who resides in Colorado, Kansas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Utah or Wyoming at the time of the determination or
decision at any administrative level, i.e., initial, reconsideration, ALJ hearing or Appeals Council, and who was
born after the worker died.
Such an applicant will be deemed to be the worker's child when satisfactory evidence establishes that the worker is
the father of the child and the worker's contributions to his unborn child, at the time of his death, were commensurate
with the needs of the unborn child, even though the contributions were not regular and substantial. The economic circumstances
of the worker (i.e., ability to contribute) will also be taken into account in determining whether the worker was contributing
to the claimant's support. Support may be shown by proof that the worker made contributions to either the unborn child
(e.g., baby clothes or a crib) or the mother (e.g., food, shelter or medical care). The worker's contributions must
have been made with knowledge of the pregnancy. Expenditures intended for courtship of the mother will not be considered
contributions to the unborn child.

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

Pursuant to 40 CFR 1501.7 and 43 CFR 1610.2, a draft Resource Management Plan Draft Environmental Impact Statement
(RMP/DEIS) has been prepared for the Caliente Resource Area. The draft RMP/DEIS describes and analyzes alternative
management scenarios for about 570,000 acres of public lands and an additional 450,000 acres of federal mineral estate
located in Kings, San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara, Tulare, Ventura, and western Kern counties in central California.


Decisions relating to management of the Caliente Resource Area generated by this planning process will supersede
those currently in the Coast Valley RMP and the South Sierra Foothills Management Framework Plan. Copies of the draft
RMP/DEIS can be obtained from the Caliente Resource Area Office, 3801 Pegasus Drive, Bakersfield, California 93308.
Copies are also available for review at public libraries in Avenal, Bakersfield, Hanford, Oxnard, Paso Robles, San
Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara, Santa Maria, Ventura, and Visalia; and at the following BLM locations:

Background information and maps used in developing the draft RMP/DEIS can be reviewed at the Caliente Resource Area
Office.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The draft RMP/DEIS analyzes five alternatives to address the following issues: oil and gas development, land tenure
adjustment, endangered and other special status plants and animals, and livestock grazing. The alternatives have
been developed to incorporate the issues and are summarized as follows: Alt. 

#

1_No action or the continuation of existing management, Alt. 

#

2_Resource Protection, Alt. 

#

3_Administrative Adjustment (land exchanges, disposals, and acquisitions), Alt. 

#

4_Development Emphasis (especially oil and gas, and grazing), and Alt. 

#

5_Preferred Alternative.


Public participation has occurred throughout the RMP process. A Notice of Intent was filed in the 

Federal Register

 in March 1989. Since that time there have been mailings and public meetings to solicit comments and ideas. All comments
received have been considered.

<DOCTITLE>Record of Decision; Black-Footed Ferret Reintroduction Conata Basin/Badlands, SD</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Fish and Wildlife Service.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

Pursuant to regulations promulgated by the Council on Environmental Quality (40 CFR 1505.2) and the implementing
procedures of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service for the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (40 U.S.C. 1501
et seq.), the Department of Interior has prepared this record of decision on the 

Final Environmental Impact Statement, Black-Footed Ferret Reintroduction, Conata Basin/Badlands, South Dakota.

 The record of decision is a concise statement of what decisions were made, what alternatives were considered, and
acceptable mitigation measures developed in order to avoid or minimize environmental impacts.



This reintroduction effort is an interagency program involving the Fish and Wildlife Service, National Park Service,
and the Forest Service. Each Agency has the responsibility under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended, to
recover threatened and endangered species. Each Agency will prepare a separate record of decision to cover its respective
responsibilities under the reintroduction program.


The Selected Alternative



The preferred alternative, Alternative C, releases black-footed ferrets (

Mustela nigripes

) as a nonessential experimental population into a reintroduction area of approximately 42,000 acres (16,997 ha)
on the Badlands National Park (BNP) and the Buffalo Gap National Grassland (BGNG). The initial reintroductions will
occur on the BNP. This area contains approximately 8,000 acres (3,238 ha) of black-tailed prairie dog colonies. A
nonessential experimental population area of approximately 1,182,200 acres is delineated within which the legal
status of the black-footed ferret is changed from endangered to nonessential experimental to allow for greater management
flexibility. All of the proposed reintroduction area is public land administered by either the National Park Service
or the Forest Service.
The purpose of the proposed action is to use experimental techniques to reintroduce and establish a free ranging,
cooperatively managed wild population of black-footed ferrets in the Conata Basin/Badlands experimental population
area near Wall, South Dakota. The released black-footed ferrets and their progeny will be classified as a nonessential
experimental population under Federal rulemaking requirements.


Other Alternatives Considered


Five alternatives, including the preferred alternative, were analyzed in the final environmental impact statement.
All action alternatives propose to reintroduce black-footed ferrets as a nonessential experimental population.
The alternatives included:
Alternative A_Black-footed ferrets would not be reintroduced into BNP or BGNG (No Action).
Alternative B_Black-footed ferrets would be released only in BNP in a reintroduction area of approximately 25,000
acres which contains about 3,200 acres of prairie dog colonies.
Alternative D_Reintroduce black-footed ferrets into a 42,000 acre reintroduction area on BNP and BGNG with initial
releases in BGNG. The reintroduction area is similar to that of Alternative C and contains approximately 8,000 acres
of prairie dog colonies.
Alternative E_Release black-footed ferrets into a 172,000 acre reintroduction area on BNP and BGNG consisting of
the entire north unit of the BNP and the BGNG in the Conata Basin. No priority release site is identified in this alternative.
The initial black-footed ferret releases would occur in the most biologically suitable habitat within the reintroduction
area.


Environmentally Preferable Alternative


The Fish and Wildlife Service consider Alternative E to be the most environmentally preferred alternative. The levels
of active prairie dog habitat would not increase over Alternatives C and D. Alternative E provides the least potential
risks to the black-footed ferret due to expanded protection measures through the expansion of off-road travel and
trapping restriction and possible long-term shooting restrictions to an expanded reintroduction area. Alternative
C was selected because it prescribes a reintroduction program that is more compatible with the existing recreational
and agricultural land uses in the area thereby garnishing additional support. It is the Fish and Wildlife Service's
assessment that the benefits of additional support outweigh the possible benefits of extending land use restrictions
associated with the expanded reintroduction area of Alternative E.


Minimization of Impacts


Public concerns, potential impacts, and methods to mitigate those impacts are addressed in the final environmental
impact statement. The Fish and Wildlife Service considers that all practicable means to avoid or minimize environmental
impacts that could result from implementation of the preferred plan have been identified and are considered acceptable.


Decision


The Fish and Wildlife Service will accept the proposed action to release captive reared black-footed ferrets into
the Conata Basin/Badlands area near Wall, South Dakota as described in Alternative C in the 

Final Environmental Impact Statement, Black-Footed Ferret Reintroduction, Conata Basin/Badlands, South Dakota.
After careful evaluation of each alternative and considering the issues of public response; legislative intent;
management objectives; and cost, socioeconomic, and environmental effects, the Fish and Wildlife Service believes
that the proposed action represents the most balanced course of action for the future management of the black-footed
ferret.

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This notice advises the public that a decision on the proposed South Tongue Point Land Exchange and Marine Industrial
Part Development Project has been made and that the Record of Decision Document is available.





</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 







A. Background



In 1979, the U.S. Government declared the property known as South Tongue Point near Astoria, Oregon, to be excess to
the Federal inventory. In 1981, the State of Oregon contacted the Federal Government regarding a possible exchange
of property involving South Tongue Point and State-owned islands in the Columbia River.

In May 1989, the U.S. Navy contacted the Oregon Division of State Lands (Division) in regard to the possibility of homeporting
mine hunter coastal vessels at South Tongue Point. At the time, the Division was studying the feasibility of acquiring
South Tongue Point and developing the site as a marine industrial part in conjunction with the Federal Government's
proposal to exchange property with the State of Oregon. The Navy's interest led to the development of a master plan
for the marine industrial part at South Tongue Point, with the Navy as the first proposed tenant.

The GSA is proposing to convey approximately 130 acres of land at South Tongue Point near Astoria, Oregon (Section
12, T.8N., R.9W.), administered by the Corps to the State of Oregon. In exchange for the Federal land, the Division
is proposing to convey approximately 3,930 acres of State-owned land within the administrative boundary of Lewis
and Clark National Wildlife Refuge (Refuge), to GSA which will in turn transfer those lands to the Service. An additional
950 acres of State-owned land within the Refuge is proposed for Service management under a long-term cooperative
agreement.

The State is proposing to develop a multitenant shallow draft marine industrial park moorage facility for a variety
of water-dependent and general industrial uses. Water-dependent uses would have water access by means of pile-supported
piers. General industrial uses would be located in upland areas without water access.

This development activity is intended to create real property assets and associated income for the Common School
Fund of the State of Oregon, encourage new industrial employment within the area, and contribute to the economic stability
and employment diversification of Clatsop County and the State of Oregon. Under the proposed action, the Service
would gain fee title to lands within the administrative boundary of the Refuge. This would provide the Service with
the needed management flexibility to control future expected incompatible uses and enhance wildlife populations
and their habitats.
Scoping activities were undertaken preparatory to developing an EIS with a variety of Federal, State, and local entities.
A Notice of Intent to prepare the EIS was published in the 

Federal Register

 on November 4, 1991. A Draft EIS was issued in June 1992. A Notice of Availability for the Draft EIS was published in the


Federal Register

 on July 2, 1993. A Notice of Availability for the Final EIS was published in the 

Federal Register

 on May 20, 1994.


B. Key Issues


Through public scoping and with input from various agencies and publics, key issues were identified. These focused
on the following subject areas: (1) Certain aspects of the physical environment, especially the potential for hazardous
materials to be released from local sediments; (2) certain aspects of the biological environment, especially wetlands
and threatened and endangered species; and (3) certain aspects of the cultural and social environment, especially
the local and regional economy. These factors were also examined for the State-owned islands proposed as additions
to the Refuge. These issues were thoroughly examined in the Draft and Final EIS.


C. Alternatives


More than 20 alternatives were considered before limiting the alternatives to be advanced for further study. Alternatives
considered but not advanced for detailed analysis included alternative development concepts, alternative sites,
and single versus multi-tenant developments. Alternatives advanced for detailed analysis include (A) the proposed
land exchange and development of a multi-tenant marine industrial development; (B) the proposed land exchange and
multi-tenant marine industrial development with connecting road to North Tongue Point; and (C) a No Action Alternative.
Adverse and beneficial impacts of each alternative are considered.


Alternative A


Alternative A comprises two elements: (1) the land exchange, and (2) the multi-tenant marine industrial development.
(1) Approximately 3,930 acres of State-owned land within the administrative boundary of the Lewis and Clark National
Wildlife Refuge would be exchanged through GSA to the Service for the 130 acres on South Tongue Point. The remaining
950 acres would be managed under a long-term cooperative agreement between the Division and the Service.
(2) Development of the multi-tenant marine industrial site would occur in two phases. Phase 1 would involve site infrastructure
developments and construction of marine industrial facilities. Construction would begin in 1994 and occur at a rate
supported by market conditions.


Alternative B


Alternative B comprises the same two elements as Alternative A with the addition, in Phase 2, of a road connecting South
Tongue Point to North Tongue Point. Construction of the connecting road would be dependent upon the need for additional
land to support marine industrial development and increased port activities at North Tongue Point.


Alternative C


With the No Action Alternative, South Tongue Point would remain in its present undeveloped condition except for the
existing Corps Field Station. There would be no land exchange. The No Action Alternative would not have direct adverse
impacts to the physical and biological environment. However, the No Action Alternative would not have direct economic
benefits from job creation and tax revenues.

<DOCTITLE>Lodging a Consent Decree Pursuant to the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act </DOCTITLE>


In accordance with Departmental Policy and 28 CFR 50.7, notice is hereby given that on June 21, 1994, a proposed consent
decree in 

United States 

v. 

Roy L. Merritt, et al., 

Civil Action No. 94CV026, was lodged with the United States District Court for the District of Wyoming. 
The first amended complaint filed by the United States seeks injunctive relief and civil penalties pursuant to Sections
1414(b) and 1431 of the Safe Drinking Water Act, 42 U.S.C. 300g-3(b), and 300i, against Roy L. and Frances G. Merritt,
George Harold Parker, Jr., Linda K. Parker, and the trustee for debtor Roy L. Merritt for repeated and continuing violations
of national primary drinking water regulations, 40 CFR Part 141. The complaint alleges that drinking water supplied
to residents through the public drinking water system owned by Merritt's Mobile Manor exceeds maximum contamination
limitations for nitrate and 

E. Coli, 

that sampling and reporting of the system was not conducted in accordance with applicable sections of 40 CFR part 141,
that neither the public or the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) was informed by the system operators of exceedances
of maximum contaminate limitations, and that the owners and operators of the public water system at Merritt's Mobile
Manor continued to operate the system in violation of administrative and emergency administrative orders issued
by EPA. The complaint seeks injunctive relief to compel defendants to operate the public water system in compliance
with the Act and its implementing regulations and civil penalties for violations of 40 CFR part 141 and administrative
orders issued by EPA. 
Under this consent decree, four of the five named defendants agree to abide by the injunctive relief ordered by the
Court, provide safe alternative drinking water to residents of Merritt's Mobile Manor until municipal water and
sewer hookups can be installed, maintain septic systems in a manner so as to preclude further contamination to the
aquifer from sewage disposed by Merritt's Mobile Manor, and make payments in satisfaction of civil penalties for
violations of 40 CFR part 141 and administrative orders issued by EPA. 
The Department of Justice will receive, for a period of thirty (30) days from the date of this publication, comments
relating to the proposed consent decree. Comments should be addressed to the Assistant Attorney General of the Environment
and Natural Resources Division, Department of Justice, P.O. Box 7611, Ben Franklin Station, Washington, DC 20044,

<DOCTITLE>Proposed Final Judgment and Competitive Impact Statement United States v. MCI Communications Corporation and BT
Forty-Eight Company ``(NewCo'')</DOCTITLE>



Notice is hereby given pursuant to the Antitrust Procedures and Penalties Act, 15 U.S.C. 16(b)-(h) that a proposed
Final Judgment, Stipulation and Competitive Impact Statement have been filed with the United States District Court
for the District of Columbia in 

United States 

v. 

MCI Communications Corporation and BT Forty-Eight Company (``NewCo''), 

Civil Action No. 94 1317(TFH). The proposed Final Judgment is subject to approval by the Court after the expiration
of the statutory 60-day public comment period and compliance with the Antitrust Procedures and Penalties Act, 15
U.S.C. 16(b)-(h).
The Complaint alleges that the proposed sale of 20% of the voting shares of MCI Communications Corporation (``MCI'')
to British Telecommunications plc (``BT''), and the proposed formation of a joint venture, presently known as BT
Forty-Eight Company (``NewCo''), between MCI and BT to provide certain international telecommunications services,
would violate Section 7 of the Clayton Act, as amended, 15 U.S.C. 18, in the markets for international telecommunications
services between the United States and the United Kingdom and for global seamless telecommunications services.
The proposed Final Judgment includes three categories of substantive obligations and restrictions. First, it requires
the defendants, MCI and NewCo, to disclose certain information about the telecommunications services that MCI and
NewCo receive from BT or provide together with BT. This ongoing disclosure is a precondition for MCI and NewCo to provide
international telecommunications services, including enhanced telecommunications and global seamless telecommunications
services.
Second, the proposed Final Judgment prohibits MCI and NewCo from receiving from BT certain non-public and confidential
information provided to BT by other United States telecommunications service providers in connection with the arrangements
between such United States providers and BT to provide telecommunications services, including both international
correspondent relationships and interconnection with BT in the United Kingdom.
Finally, the proposed Final Judgment prohibits MCI and NewCo from providing telecommunications services or facilities
to BT to enable it to engage in the practice known as ``international simple resale'' from the United Kingdom to the
United States, which would involve bypassing existing correspondent relationships to send BT's traffic to the United
States, until two conditions are met. First, all qualified United States telecommunications services providers
that had applied for licenses in the United Kingdom to engage in international simple resale on or before December
1, 1993 must have been granted such licenses. Second, all such licensed providers must be afforded the opportunity
to interconnect with BT on standard, published and nondiscriminatory terms.
Public comment is invited within the statutory 60-day comment period. Such comments, and the responses thereto,
will be published in the 

Federal Register

 and filed with the Court. Comments should be directed to Richard L. Rosen, Chief, Communications & Finance Section,

United States District Court for the District of Columbia





United States of America, Plaintiff, v. MCI Communications Corporation and BT Forty-Eight Company (``NewCo''),

 Defendants.




Civil Action No.




Filed:



Stipulation



It is stipulated and agreed by and between the undersigned parties, by their respective attorneys, that:

1. The Court has jurisdiction over the subject matter of this action and over each of the parties hereto and venue of
this action is proper in the District of Columbia. Defendants are hereby estopped from contesting the entry or enforceability
of the Final Judgment on the ground that the Court lacks venue or jurisdiction over the subject matter of the action
or over any defendant. For purposes of this stipulation defendant BT Forty-Eight Company, known as ``NewCo,'' and
any reference to NewCo herein, shall be understood to have the same meaning as the term ``NewCo'' in the attached proposed
Final Judgment.

2. The parties consent that a Final Judgment in the form hereto attached may be filed and entered by the Court, upon the
motion of any party or upon the Court's own motion, at any time after compliance with the requirements of the Antitrust
Procedures and Penalties Act (15 U.S.C. 16), and without further notice to any party or other proceedings, provided
that plaintiff has not withdrawn its consent. Plaintiff may withdraw its consent to entry of the Final Judgment at
any time before it is entered, by serving notice on the defendants and by filing that notice with the Court.

3. Pending entry of the Final Judgment, defendants shall abide by and comply with the provisions of the Final Judgment
following consummation of the Amended and Restated Investment Agreement dated January 31, 1994 (and related agreements)
or any similar arrangement between any defendant and British Telecommunications plc (``BT''). This obligation
shall not be affected by the timing of execution of any agreements between defendants and BT requiring BT to provide
to MCI and NewCo information needed for compliance with the requirements of Sections II.A.1-6. Such agreements,
which shall be executed prior to the entry of the Final Judgment, shall be consistent with Sections II.B-D of
the Final Judgment and shall be provided to the Department of Justice upon execution.

4. The agreements governing disclosure to United States corporations, referred to in Section IV.E of the Final Judgment,
will provide that: (1) Non-public information received from the Department of Justice is intended for use to complain
or provide information to any government authorities in the United States or the United Kingdom, and to identify and
evaluate internally any conduct that may be made the subject of such a complaint or provision of information, but may
not be used for the sale or marketing of the corporation's services; (2) such information may not be disclosed to persons
other than officers, directors, employees, agents, or contractors of the corporation and to government authorities
in the United States or the United Kingdom (including, but not limited to, the Federal Communications Commission
and OFTEL); (3) all persons to whom the information is disclosed will be advised of the limitations on use and disclosure
of the information; and (4) if unauthorized use or disclosure occurs, the Department of Justice can revoke or otherwise
limit the corporation's further access to such information, unless the Department decides, in its sole discretion,
that revocation of access is inappropriate. Plaintiff, in its discretion, may add further conditions to such agreements.
Any actions taken by the Department to redress unauthorized use or disclosure will not diminish or create any ability
in NewCo or MCI to pursue separately against persons receiving such information from the Department any legal remedies
for unauthorized use or disclosure.

5. Plaintiff and defendants are presently aware that the entities listed in Attachment A to this Stipulation are,
or based upon the best available information appear to be, qualified United States international telecommunications
providers as defined in Section II.E of the Final Judgment. Any other persons (including corporations or other legal
entities) that make known to the Department of Justice before the entry of the Final Judgment that they meet the standards
for qualification under Section II.E of the Final Judgment shall be added to Attachment A of this Stipulation if the
Department concludes that such persons are qualified United States international telecommunications providers
within the meaning of Section II.E. The Department shall publish the names of such persons in its response to public
comments under the Antitrust Procedures and Penalties Act.

6. Six months prior to the expiration of the Final Judgment, defendants shall inform the Department of Justice in writing
whether they will continue or discontinue the operation of NewCo beyond the term of the Final Judgment.

7. In the event plaintiff withdraws its consent to entry of the proposed Final Judgment or if the proposed Final Judgment
is not entered pursuant to this Stipulation, this Stipulation shall be of no effect whatsoever and its making shall
be without prejudice to any party in this or any other proceeding, except that if the Court decides not to enter the Final
Judgment, and the defendants and British Telecommunications plc have consummated pursuant to paragraph 3 of this
Stipulation, defendants shall abide by and comply with the terms of the Final Judgment until the conclusion of this
action, unless the parties otherwise agree or the Court otherwise orders.

8. The Stipulation and the Final Judgment to which it relates are for settlement purposes only and do not constitute
an admission by defendants in this or any other proceedings that Section 7 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C.  18, as
amended, or any other provision of law, has been violated.

UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, Plaintiff, v. MCI COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION and BT FORTY-EIGHT COMPANY (``NewCo''),
Defendants.




Civil Action No. 




Filed:




Final Judgment



Whereas, plaintiff United States of America, filed its Complaint on June 15, 1994,

And whereas, plaintiff and defendants, by their respective attorneys, have consented to the entry of this Final Judgment
without trial or adjudication on any issue of fact or law,

And whereas, defendants have further consented after any consummation as defined in the Stipulation entered into
by defendants and the United States on June 10, 1994, to be bound by the provisions of this Final Judgment pending its
approval by the Court,

And whereas, plaintiff the United States believes that entry of this Final Judgment is necessary to protect competition
in United States telecommunications and enhanced telecommunications markets,

Therefore, it is hereby ordered,

 adjudged, and decreed:



I

Jurisdiction



This Court has jurisdiction of the subject matter of this action and of each of the parties consenting to this Final
Judgment. The Complaint states a claim upon which relief may be granted against the defendants under Section 7 of the
Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. 18, as amended.



II

Substantive Restrictions and Obligations

providers do not have or receive data sufficient to determine whether they are receiving their appropriate share
of return traffic in each accounting rate category (e.g., the total volumes of United States traffic to BT, and total
volumes of BT traffic to the United States, for each type of traffic with a different accounting rate), MCI's minutes
of traffic to and from BT in each accounting rate category;

4. By NewCo, on a semiannual basis_Schedules of telecommunications services provided by BT to NewCo in the United

separately the number of outages and actual average time intervals to restoration of service in each such area; and

(iii) on a semiannual basis, for circuits used to provide international switched telecommunications services or

operators, provided that if MCI receives any such information from BT separately from NewCo, MCI shall similarly
be required to disclose such information in the same manner as NewCo.

The obligations of this Section II.A shall not extend to the disclosure of intellectual property or other proprietary
information of the defendants or BT that has maintained as confidential by its owner, except to the extent that it is
of a type expressly required to be disclosed herein, or is necessary for licensed operators to interconnect with BT's
United Kingdom public telecommunications system operated pursuant to its license or for United States international
telecommunications providers to use BT's international telecommunications or enhanced telecommunications correspondent
services.

B. MCI and NewCo, and any person who may be designated by MCI to sit on the Board of Directors of BT, shall not receive from
BT, or from any persons designated by BT to sit on the Board of Directors of MCI, any information that is identified as
proprietary by United States telecommunications or enhanced telecommunications service providers (and maintained
as confidential by them) and is obtained by BT from such providers as the result of BT's provision of interconnection
or other telecommunications services to them in the United Kingdom.

C. MCI and NewCo, and any person who may be designated by MCI to sit on the Board of Directors of BT, shall not receive from
BT, or from any persons designated by BT to sit on the Board of Directors of MCI, any confidential, non-public information

or enhanced telecommunications service providers, except to the extent necessary for MCI to comply with its obligations
under Section II.A.3(ii) concerning disclosure of the total volume of traffic (but not the individual traffic volumes
for other providers) received by BT from the United States and sent by BT to the United States that is subject to proportionate
return, or under Section II.A.5 (but not including individual information on other providers).

future prices or pricing plans of any provider of international telecommunications services between the United
States and the United Kingdom with which MCI competes in the provision of such services.

E. Neither MCI nor NewCo shall provide to BT any telecommunications facilities or services to be used by BT for international
simple resale between the United Kingdom and the United States, until the following conditions have occurred or unless
such conditions are expressly waived in whole or part by plaintiff through written notice to defendants and the Court:

or affiliates) that have applied for licenses in the United Kingdom that would include the ability to provide international
simple resale between the United States and the United Kingdom on or before December 1, 1993 have been granted licenses
to provide international simple resale by the responsible governmental authorities in the United Kingdom; and

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940627-2-00101 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940627-2-00045 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

2. All such United States international telecommunications providers licensed to provide international simple
resale in the United Kingdom have been offered the opportunity to interconnect with BT's telecommunications network
in the United Kingdom operated pursuant to its license, on standard, nondiscriminatory and published terms (including
the locations where interconnection is offered) and with reasonable arrangements for any other necessary technical
aspects of interconnection, enabling them to engage in international simple resale without limitation on the amount
of traffic carried.



``Qualified United States international telecommunications providers,'' for purposes of this Section II.E, shall
mean all United States international telecommunications providers as of December 1, 1993, except for any provider
that (a) has withdrawn its license application to provide international simple resale, (b) has been found by United
Kingdom government authorities to have failed to pursue effectively its license application or to have failed to
meet the requirements for a license to provide international simple resale, so long as such requirements are applicable
to all persons that seek to provide international simple resale between the United Kingdom and the United States,
(c) has, in the judgment of the plaintiff, absent any finding by United Kingdom government authorities, failed to
pursue effectively its license application, (d) has voluntarily modified its license application after December
1, 1993 (other than to make modifications requested by United Kingdom government authorities) to such a substantial
extent that it is subject to additional publication and can no longer be pursued on its original schedule; (e) has been
offered a license that would allow it to commence providing international simple resale between the United States
and the United Kingdom and has not accepted such license; or (f) has failed, after the grant of a license, to supply promptly
an adequate statement of the necessary information required for interconnection. A list of the entities that plaintiff
the United States and defendants presently understand to be qualified under this Section II.E is included in the Stipulation
entered into by defendants and plaintiff on June 10, 1994.


III
Applicability and Effect


The provisions of this Final Judgment shall be binding upon defendants, their affiliates, subsidiaries, successors
and assigns, officers, agents, servants, employees, and attorneys, and upon those persons in active concert or participation
with them who receive actual notice of this Final Judgment by personal service or otherwise. Defendants shall cooperate
with the United States Department of Justice in ensuring that the provisions of this Final Judgment are carried out.
Neither this Final Judgment nor any of its terms or provisions shall constitute any evidence against, an admission
by, or an estoppel against the defendants. The effective date of this Final Judgment shall be the date upon which it
is entered.


IV
Definitions


For the purposes of this Final Judgment:
A. ``Affiliate'' and ``subsidiary'' when used in connection with MCI, do not include NewCo and BT, when used in connection
with BT do not include NewCo and MCI, and when used in connection with NewCo do not include BT or MCI (but do include all
entities in which NewCo has an ownership interest or which are subject to its control, or are jointly owned and controlled
by BT and MCI). Nor shall BT be deemed to be a person in active concert or participation with NewCo or MCI for purposes
of this Final Judgment.
B. ``BT'' means British Telecommunications plc, and any entity owned or controlled by BT, apart from NewCo and MCI.
BT does not include any MCI employees who may serve on BTs Board of Directors.
C. ``Correspondent'' means a bilaterally negotiated arrangement between a provider of telecommunications services
in the US or the UK and a provider of telecommunications services in the other of the US or the UK for provision of an international
telecommunications or enhanced telecommunications service, by which each party undertakes to terminate in its
country traffic originated by the other party. A service managed by NewCo, and provided without correspondent relationships
with any other provider, shall not be deemed to constitute a correspondent service.
D. ``Defendant'' or ``defendants'' means MCI and NewCo.

<DOCNO> FR940627-2-00102 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940627-2-00045 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

E. ``Disclose,'' for purposes of   II.A.1-6, means disclosure to the United States Department
of Justice Antitrust Division, which may further disclose such information to any United States corporation that
directly or through a subsidiary or affiliate holds or has applied for a license from either the United States Federal
Communications Commission or the United Kingdom Department of Trade and Industry to provide international telecommunications
services between the United States and the United Kingdom. Disclosure by the Department of Justice to any corporation
described above shall be made only upon agreement by such corporation, in the form prescribed in the Stipulation entered
into by defendants and the United States on June 10, 1994, not to disclose any non-public information to any other person,
apart from governmental authorities in the United States or United Kingdom. Where NewCo is required to disclose,
in Section II.A, particular telecommunications services provided, this shall include disclosure of the identity
of each of the services, and reasonable detail about each of the services to the extent not already published elsewhere,
but shall not require disclosure of underlying facilities used to provide a particular service that is offered on
a unitary basis, except to the extent necessary to identify the service and the means of interconnection with the service.

F. ``Enhanced telecommunications service'' means any telecommunications service that involves as an integral
part of the service the provision of features or capabilities that are additional to the conveyance (including switching)
of the information transmitted. Although enhanced telecommunications services use telecommunications services
for conveyance, their additional features or capabilities do not lose their enhanced status as a result.

G. ``Facility'' means: (i) any line, trunk, wire, cable, tube, pipe, satellite, earth station, antenna or other means
that is directly used or designed or adapted for use in the conveyance, transmission, origination or reception of
a telecommunications or enhanced telecommunications service; (ii) any switch, multiplexer, or other equipment
or apparatus that is directly used or designed or adapted for use in connection with the conveyance, transmission,
origination, reception, switching, signaling, modulation, amplification, routing, collection, storage, forwarding,
transformation, translation, conversion, delivery or other provision of any telecommunications or enhanced telecommunications
service, and (iii) any structure, conduit, pole, or other thing in, on, by, or from which any facility as described
in (i) or (ii) is or may be installed, supported, carried or suspended.

H. ``Interconnection,'' ``interconnect'' and ``interconnection agreement'' mean interconnection under Condition
13 of BT's License (or any subsequent or other condition governing interconnection that may be imposed by United Kingdom
government authorities).

I. ``International simple resale'' means the transmission through international private or leased telecommunications
facilities, or by any other means of telecommunications in which international usage is not measured, of international
voice or data telecommunications traffic (excluding capabilities in addition to conveyance and such switching,
processing, data storage or protocol conversion as is necessary for the conveyance of information in real time) that
is carried over the public switched telecommunications network in both the country where it originates and the country
where it terminates.

J. ``MCI'' means MCI Communications Corporation, and any entity owned or controlled by MCI, apart from NewCo. MCI
does not include any BT employees who may serve on MCI's Board of Directors.

K. ``NewCo'' means BT Forty-Eight Company, the joint venture of MCI and BT to be created pursuant to the terms of the
Joint Venture Agreement entered into by MCI and BT as of August 4, 1993 (including any subsequent modifications or
amendments to such agreement), regardless of the name under which it may subsequently do business, and any subsidiary,
affiliate, predecessor (whether the predecessor is jointly owned by MCI and BT or separately owned by either of them),
successor, or assign of such joint venture, or any other entity jointly owned by MCI and BT and having among its purposes
substantially the same purposes as described for NewCo in the Joint Venture Agreement. NewCo shall not be deemed to
include BT or any of its affiliates in which NewCo does not have an ownership interest.

L. ``Telecommunications service'' means the conveyance, by electrical, magnetic, electromagnetic, electromechanical
or electrochemical means (including fiber-optics), of information consisting of:




_Speech, music and other sounds;


</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940627-2-00103 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940627-2-00045 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

_Visual images;
_Signals serving for the impartation (whether as between persons and persons, things and things or persons and things)
of any matter, including but not limited to data, otherwise than in the form of sounds or visual images;
_Signals serving for the actuation or control of machinery or apparatus; or
_Translation or conversion that does not alter the form or content of information as received from that which is originally
sent.



``Convey'' and ``conveyance'' include transmission, switching, and receiving, and cognate expressions shall
be construed accordingly. A telecommunications service includes all facilities used in providing such service,
and the installation, maintenance, repair, adjustment, replacement and removal of any such facilities. A service
that is considered a ``telecommunications service'' under this definition retains that status when it is used to
provide an enhanced telecommunications service, or when used in combination with equipment, facilities or other
services.


M. ``United Kingdom'' and ``UK'' mean England, Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland and all territories, dependencies,
or possessions of the United Kingdom (excluding the Isle of Man) for which international telecommunications traffic
is not normally separately reported to the United States Federal Communications Commission by United States telecommunications
carriers.
N. ``United States'' and ``US'' mean the fifty states, the District of Columbia, and all territories, dependencies,
or possessions of the United States.
O. ``United States international telecommunications provider'' means any person or entity actually providing
international telecommunications services or enhanced telecommunications services to users in the United States,
and that is incorporated in the United States, or that is ultimately controlled by United States persons within the
meaning of 16 CFR 801.1.


V
Visitorial and Compliance Provisions


A. MCI and NewCo each agree to maintain sufficient records and documents to demonstrate compliance with the requirements
of this Final Judgment.
B. For the purposes of determining or securing compliance of defendants with this Final Judgment, duly authorized
representatives of the plaintiff, upon written request of the Attorney General or the Assistant Attorney General
in charge of the Antitrust Division, and on a reasonable notice to the relevant defendant, shall have access without
restraint or interference to MCI and to NewCo in the United States:
1. during their office hours to inspect and copy all records and documents in their possession or control relating
to any matters contained in this Final Judgment; and
2. to interview or take sworn testimony from their officers, directors, employees, trustees, or agents, who may have
counsel present, relating to any matter contained in this Final Judgment. Provided, however, that NewCo officers
and directors who are employees of BT shall be required to produce only NewCo documents and to provide information
only concerning NewCo.
C. NewCo consents to make available to duly authorized representatives of the plaintiff, for the purposes of determining
whether defendants have complied with the requirements of this Final Judgment and to secure their compliance:

United States District Court for the District of Columbia




United States of America, Plaintiff, v. MCI Communications Corporation and BT Forty-Eight Company (``NewCo''),
Defendants.



Civil Action No.



Filed:


Competitive Impact Statement


The United States, pursuant to section 2(b) of the Antitrust Procedures and Penalties Act (``APPA'' or ``Tunney Act''),
15 U.S.C. 16(b)-(h), files this Competitive Impact Statement relating to the proposed Final Judgment submitted
for entry in this civil antitrust proceeding.


I
Nature and Purpose of the Proceeding


On June 15, 1994, the United States filed a civil antitrust complaint under Section 15 of the Clayton Act, as amended,
15 U.S.C. 25, alleging that the proposed acquisition of a 20% equity interest in MCI Communications Corporation (``MCI'')
by British Telecommunications plc (``BT''), and the proposed formation of a joint venture between MCI and BT to provide
international enhanced telecommunications services, would violate Section 7 of the Clayton Act, as amended, 15
U.S.C. 18, by lessening competition in the markets for international telecommunications services between the United
States and the United Kingdom and for global seamless telecommunications services, thereby depriving United States
consumers of the benefits of competition_lower prices and higher quality services. Defendants are MCI and BT Forty-Eight
Company, also known as NewCo, which at present is a wholly owned subsidiary of BT and which will become the joint venture
of MCI and BT upon consummation of the agreements between them. The Complaint seeks injunctive and other relief.
The United States and the defendants have stipulated to the entry of a proposed Final Judgment, after compliance with
the Antitrust Procedures and Penalties Act, 15 U.S.C. 16(b)-(h). Entry of the proposed Final Judgment would
terminate this action, except that the Court would retain jurisdiction to construe, modify, and enforce the proposed
Final Judgment and to punish violations of the Judgment. The United States and the defendants also have stipulated
that the defendants will abide by the terms of the proposed Final Judgment after consummation of the transactions
between them, pending entry of the Final Judgment by the Court, permitting the transactions to go forward prior to
completion of the Tunney Act procedures. Should the Court decline to enter the Final Judgment, defendants have also
committed in the stipulation to abide by its terms until the conclusion of this action.

II

Events Giving Rise to the Alleged Violation

A. The Proposed Transactions



On August 4, 1993, MCI and BT entered into an Investment Agreement by which BT would acquire a 20% equity stake in MCI
for approximately $4.3 billion. MCI and BT entered into an amended and restated version of this Investment Agreement
on January 31, 1994. With consummation of this Investment Agreement and related agreements, BT would become the single
largest shareholder in MCI. In addition, BT would receive a number of special shareholder rights, including the need
for BT's consent to various actions by MCI, access to internal MCI information, and proportionate board representation
consisting of three of the fifteen seats on MCI's Board of Directors. MCI would gain certain special rights with respect
to BT as well, including a seat on the BT Board of Directors.

MCI and BT have agreed that if either party competes with the other in its ``core'' business (defined to include any
telecommunications services or equipment, with specific limited exceptions) in its assigned territory (the ``Americas''
for MCI, and the rest of the world for BT), it will lose all special rights, including board membership.
 While the agreement does not formally prohibit BT and MCI from competing with each other in their domestic and international
telecommunications businesses, as a practical matter it ensures that BT will only enter the United States telecommunications
markets through its investment in MCI so long as their relationship continues. BT's operations in the United States
principally consist of Syncordia, a wholly owned subsidiary engaged in ``global outsourcing.'' This is the provision
of various integrated international telecommunications services and enhanced services to large users through
a single source, allowing customers to transfer responsibility for owning and managing their corporate telecommunications
networks.







While they entered into the Investment Agreement, MCI and BT also entered into a Joint Venture Agreement and other
related agreements committing them to form a joint venture, to be owned 75.1% by BT and 24.9% of MCI. This joint venture,
NewCo, is incorporated in the United Kingdom, and will have its principal place of business and most of its employees
in the United States. BT and MCI both will contribute international telecommunications facilities to the joint venture,
including BT's Syncordia business. The stated purpose of the joint venture is to provide international enhanced
telecommunications services to large international users, such as multinational corporations. These services
will be available from a single source and will be consistent in quality, features and capabilities wherever purchased.
These services may include various types of data services, messaging and video conferencing, global calling card
services, intelligent network services, certain types of satellite services and global outsourcing such as Syncordia
already offers in the United States and other countries. Under certain circumstances, and if permitted by regulatory
authorities, the role of the joint venture may be expanded to include other telecommunications services in addition
to enhanced ones. The venture may also expand its business operations to other types of customers.

MCI will be the exclusive distributor of the joint venture's services in North and South America and the Caribbean
(``the Americas''), and BT will be the joint venture's exclusive distributor in the rest of the world. MCI and BT also
have agreed to supply the necessary services and facilities in their respective distribution regions to enable the
joint venture to operate. In addition, MCI and BT have agreed not to compete with the joint venture anywhere in the world.
Therefore, BT and MCI will have to realize all gains from the areas of business in which the joint venture is engaged
through their ownership interests in the joint venture and their sales of its services, and BT generally will only
be able to participate in this market in the United States through its investments in MCI and the joint venture.

B. The Parties to the Transaction and the Relevant Markets



MCI is the second largest long distance telecommunications carrier in the United States, and in terms of traffic,
the fifth largest telecommunications carrier in the world. Its principal long distance domestic and international
competitors in the United States are AT&T Corporation, the largest carrier, and Sprint Corporation, the third
largest carrier. BT, formerly a government-owned monopoly, is now privately held. It is by far the largest telecommunications
carrier in the United Kingdom, and is the fourth largest telecommunications carrier in the world in terms of traffic.
BT is the dominant telecommunications carrier in the United Kingdom, as it provides almost all local services and
had high market shares in long distance domestic and international services. Indeed, BT has over ten times the total
sales revenues of Mercury Communications Ltd., its only substantial competitor in long distance services. Thus,
the transactions between MCI and BT will result in vertical affiliation between the dominant telecommunications
carrier in the United Kingdom and the second largest long distance provider in the United States.

Both MCI and BT provide international telecommunications and enhanced telecommunications services between the
United States and the United Kingdom to individuals and businesses for the exchange of voice, video, and data messages.
MCI carries about 20% of the international switched telecommunications traffic originating and terminating in
the United States and BT carries about 75% of the international switched telecommunications traffic originating
and terminating in the United Kingdom. Mercury is the only other company the United Kingdom currently permitted to
provide international telecommunications services between the United States and United Kingdom using its own telecommunications
facilities (there is also some limited resale of the services of BT and Mercury). No other companies have been licensed
in the United Kingdom to provide international telecommunications systems.

BT has substantial market power in the provision of telecommunications services in and to the United Kingdom, in large
part because access to its local network is necessary for all other telephone companies that seek to provide long distance
domestic and international services. About 97% of all telecommunications traffic in the United Kingdom terminates
through BT's local network, and the great majority of traffic also originates on BT's network. Although cable television
companies provide local telecommunications services in some areas of the United Kingdom, today they account for
an insignificant proportion of such services, in the range of 1%, and their activities are unlikely to diminish BT's
market power during the term of the proposed decree.
 Substantial replication of BT's local telecommunications network in the United Kingdom would be prohibitively
expensive for any new entrant or existing long distance provider.





BT also controls the largest and most comprehensive long distance domestic and international telecommunications
network in the United Kingdom, and carries about 84% of domestic switched long distance traffic in the United Kingdom.
(Mercury carries virtually all of the rest.) Since 1991, the United Kingdom government has granted additional licenses
for domestic telecommunications systems. Those new domestic licensees either have not yet begun commercial long
distance operations using their own facilities (some firms operate on a limited scale as resellers using the facilities
of BT or Mercury), or have not yet achieved any substantial share of the United Kingdom market.

BT has been able to retain a dominant position in the provision of long distance domestic and international telecommunications
services in the United Kingdom for several reasons, including its control of the local network. BT does not provide
Mercury or other competitors either equal access or number portability. Both of these features are generally offered
to all long distance carriers by operators of the monopoly local exchange networks in the United States, and have been
important factors in the development of domestic and international long distance competition. Equal access would
allow customers to gain access to the long distance networks of Mercury and other competitors through BT's network
without dailing additional numbers or obtaining special equipment that is not needed to use BT's long distanced services.
Number portability would allow customers switching from BT to Mercury or other competitors to retain their original
telephone number. The lack of equal access and number portability places Mercury and any other competitors who may
offer long distance service at a competitive disadvantage to BT, contributing to BT's ability to sustain its substantial
market power in the provision of long distance domestic and international telecommunications services in the United
Kingdom. These long distance services are necessary to deliver enhanced telecommunications and seamless global
telecommunications services internationally.

In addition, Mercury must pay BT Access Deficit Charges (``ADCs'') in order to have traffic delivered through BT's
network. ADCs are payments made by competing carriers to BT for each minute of traffic those carriers send through
BT's network. ADCs are intended by United Kingdom regulatory authorities to compensate BT for providing its other
local exchange services subject to price controls. These charges, especially for international traffic, greatly
exceed BT's cost of providing interconnection to Mercury. ADCs may be imposed on new entrants that compete with BT
and interconnect with its network. The total cost for Mercury, or any other United Kingdom competitor of BT that is
required to pay ADCs, to send international traffic through BT's local network is several times greater than the comparable
costs paid by international long distance carriers in the United States for interconnection with local networks.

C. The Competitive Effect of the Acquisition



The Complaint alleges that the acquisition of MCI shares by BT may substantially lessen competition in the provision
of international telecommunications services between the United States and the United Kingdom. BT will have increased
incentives and the ability, using its dominant position in the United Kingdom, to favor MCI and to disfavor its United
States competitors in international telecommunications services in various ways, making competitors' offerings
less attractive in quality and price than those of MCI, and so lessening the ability of MCI's rivals to compete effectively
in these services. As a result of this anticompetitive conduct, the price of international telecommunications services
to the United Kingdom available to United States consumers could be increased, and the quality lessened, relative
to what United States consumers would pay and receive in a competitive market.

International telecommunications services are generally provided today on a ``correspondent'' basis, meaning
that providers in different countries enter into commercially negotiated bilateral agreements with one another
to complete each other's traffic. International correspondent telecommunications services primarily consist
of the basic switched voice telephone call, which is known either as International Direct Dial (``IDD'') or International
Message Telephone Service (``IMTS''), and International Private Line Service (``IPLS''). They also include certain
other switched telecommunications and enhanced telecommunications services.

``Switched'' traffic makes use of switching facilities and common lines. Consumers typically obtain switched correspondent
services from the provider in the country where a call originates, and calls are handed off to the provider in the other
country without direct customer involvement. IPLS consists of circuits dedicated to the use of a single customer,
and the providers of IPLS in each country typically sell their ``half'' of the circuit to the user separately. Switched
services constitute the great majority of international telecommunications services in terms of both traffic and
revenues.

The Complaint alleges that acquiring a 20% ownership interest in MCI will increase BT's incentive to discriminate
in favor of MCI and against other United States international carriers in the market or markets for international
telecommunications services between the United States and the United Kingdom. BT's incentive to favor MCI is reinforced
by the provision in the Investment Agreement that subjects BT to loss of its special rights if it competes in the Americas
in the provision of telecommunications services and equipment.

MCI could receive various forms of favorable treatment from BT with respect to its international correspondent services
between the United States and the United Kingdom. For example, BT could favor MCI or disfavor its competitors with
respect to the prices, terms and conditions on which international services are provided, as well as the quality of
provisioning of those services, and could provide to MCI advance information about planned changes to its network.
Such discrimination could place other United States international carriers at a competitive disadvantage to MCI,
enabling MCI to charge more for its services or to provide a lower quality of service than it would otherwise be able
to do without losing customers.

In addition, the Complaint alleges that BT's ownership interest in MCI would increase BT's incentive to provide MCI
confidential, competitively sensitive information that BT obtains from other United States carriers through their
correspondent relationships with BT. In order to use BT's correspondent switched and private line services and to
negotiate terms of use, United States international telecommunications providers must provide BT various types
of competitively sensitive information, including private line customer identities, service requirements, plans
for the introduction of new services, changes in existing services, and future traffic projections. If BT were to
share this information with MCI, then MCI could gain an anticompetitive advantage over its United States competitors.
Allowing MCI access to such competitively valuable information about its competitors would also increase the risk
of collusion.

Finally, the Complaint alleges that the agreements will give BT the increased incentive and ability to send its international
switched traffic to the United States exclusively or largely to MCI. Such diversion of traffic could harm competition
among international telecommunications service providers in the United States, and United States consumers, by
increasing the net settlement payments that other United States carriers must make to BT.
 If BT diverted all or most of its traffic to MCI, unaffiliated United States international carriers would lose offsetting
return traffic from BT and would have to make larger settlement payments to BT, putting them at a competitive disadvantage
in the market for United States-United Kingdom telecommunications, and this could result in MCI charging higher
prices. The ability to divert the bulk of its traffic to an affiliated United States carrier could also give BT an increased
incentive to keep international accounting rates above costs.

D. The Competitive Effect of the Joint Venture



The Complaint also alleges that the formation of the BT-MCI joint venture may substantially lessen competition
in the market or markets for seamless global telecommunications services provided in the United States. BT will have
increased incentives and the ability, using its dominant position in the United Kingdom, to favor NewCo and MCI and
to disfavor their United States competitors in seamless global telecommunications services in various ways, lessening
the ability of the competitors of MCI and NewCo to develop and offer new seamless global services and compete effectively
in these services. As a result of this anticompetitive conduct, the quality of seamless global telecommunications
services available to United States consumers could be lessened, and the price increased, relative to what United
States consumers would pay and receive in a competitive market.

Seamless global telecommunications services would be made available by a single provider using an integrated international
network of owned or leased facilities, and would have the same quality, features, characteristics, and capabilities
wherever they are provided, making them significantly superior to ordinary correspondent telecommunications
services for many customers, particularly multinational corporations and other large users of international telecommunications.
Seamless services would permit one-stop shopping, so that users could avoid negotiation with telecommunications
network operators in different countries, and would overcome the inadequacies and differences in standards in various
national telecommunications systems. They could offer scale economies by comparison with private networks individually
organized by users. However, creating seamless global networks will require a major commitment of resources and
expertise that few firms can supply.

Seamless global telecommunications services represent an emerging market, but an important one for the evolution
of international telecommunications. Other entrants or potential entrants in this market, in addition to BT and
MCI, include AT&T's Worldsource (a non-exclusive partnership with several foreign providers including Japan's
KDD), Unisource (an alliance of the national or principal telecommunications providers in Switzerland, Sweden
and the Netherlands), Eunetcom (an alliance of the German and French national telecommunications providers), Sprint,
and Cable & Wireless plc (the parent of Mercury).

By their nature, seamless global telecommunications services must be offered on a consistent basis in all the major
countries where customers are located. Thus, nondiscriminatory access to the telecommunications networks in these
countries is essential for any provider of these services. The United Kingdom has a crucial role in seamless global
telecommunications services because about ten percent of all likely potential customers have their headquarters
there, and most potential customers of these services need telecommunications services in the United Kingdom.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940627-2-00110 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940627-2-00045 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

BT's role in the joint venture would increase its incentive to favor the joint venture and MCI over other United States
providers of seamless global telecommunications services. Since BT could not compete with the joint venture and
only MCI could solicit customers for the joint venture's services in the United States, where about 40 percent of all
potential customers have their headquarters, BT would depend on MCI and NewCo for revenues from such services in the
United States. It would not have the opportunity to earn additional revenues in non-exclusive arrangements to provide
similar services with other providers, so its incentive to use its dominant position in the United Kingdom to place
MCI and NewCo in the strongest possible position in the United States, at the expense of competitors, would be reinforced.

BT could discriminate in favor of NewCo and MCI using its vertically integrated position in the United Kingdom, with
a virtual monopoly in local services and a dominant position in long distance domestic and international services,
as these services will be needed by competing providers of seamless global services to complete traffic. Discrimination
could occur in interconnection to the BT network, provision of information about the network, and provision of the
international private circuits NewCo and its competitors would need for their seamless global service ``platforms.''
BT could also provide NewCo and MCI with competitively sensitive information it obtains from seamless global service
competitors who interconnect with BT's United Kingdom network. Finally, BT could favor MCI and NewCo by sending them
on a non-correspondent basis traffic from the United Kingdom that would otherwise be allocated proportionately.
The agreements between BT and MCI specifically provide for such use of NewCo facilities.



III._Explanation of the Proposed Final Judgment

A. Prohibitions and Obligations



Under the provisions of the Antitrust Procedures and Penalties Act, the proposed Final Judgment may only be entered
if the Court finds that it is in the public interest. The United States has tentatively concluded that the proposed
Final Judgment affords an adequate remedy for the alleged violations and is in the public interest.

Section II contains the substantive restrictions and obligations. They include transparency requirements (Section
II.A), confidentiality requirements (Sections II.B, II.C and II.D), and requirements related to international
simple resale (Section II.E). These various requirements, in combination, will substantially diminish the risk
of abuse of BT's market power to discriminate or otherwise afford anticompetitive advantages to MCI and NewCo.
 They will do so by making discrimination easier to detect, by precluding the misuse of confidential information obtained
by BT from MCI's competitors, and by increasing the likelihood that United States competitors of MCI and NewCo, if
licensed, will be interconnected with BT in the United Kingdom, so that they can respond effectively to international
discrimination and diversion of BT's traffic to MCI. The object of these substantive terms is to ensure that MCI, as
the result of its direct affiliation with BT or its position as the exclusive distributor of NewCo services in the United
States, is not advantaged over its competitors in the United States to the detriment of competition or consumers.






1. Transparency Requirements



Section II.A forbids MCI and NewCo from offering, supplying distributing or otherwise providing any telecommunications
or enhanced telecommunications service that makes use of telecommunications services provided by BT in the United
Kingdom or between the United States and the United Kingdom, unless MCI and NewCo disclose certain types of information.
Because these transparency requirements may be affected by changes in regulation or other circumstances, Section
II.A provides the United States with the ability to waive these requirements in whole or in part.

Pursuant to Section IV.E., MCI and NewCo will provide the information to the Department of Justice, which may then
disclose the information to any United States corporation that holds or has applied for a license, from either United
States or United Kingdom authorities, to provide international telecommunications services between the United
States and the United Kingdom. This will enable the principal competitors of MCI and NewCo to monitor whether either
of these companies is receiving discriminatory treatment in their favor from BT, and provide them with evidence that
could be used to make a complaint to any governmental authorities in the United States or the United Kingdom. The term
``governmental authorities'' is used broadly and includes independent agencies. Corporations receiving this
information from the Department of Justice would be required to sign a confidentiality agreement with the Department,
obligating them not to disclose non-public information to any persons other than governmental authorities. The
stipulation between the defendants and the United States describes the form of a confidentiality agreement in more
detail. This confidentiality provision was adopted to prevent to wider dissemination of defendants' non-public
business information than is necessary to detect and prevent anticompetitive conduct.

Defendants also have stipulated to enter into agreements with BT, prior to entry of the Final Judgment, that will ensure
that they are provided with sufficient information to comply with Section II.A. Such agreements with BT must also
be consistent with the separate obligations on defendants, under Sections II.B-D, precluding receipt from
BT of various types of information about their competitors.

The terms ``Telecommunications services'' and ``enhanced telecommunications services'' are employed throughout
the transparency requirements as well as elsewhere in the Final Judgment.
 ``Telecommunications services,'' as defined in the Final Judgment (see Section IV.L), include ordinary switched
voice telephony and private circuits as well as conveyance (including transmission, switching and receiving) of
data and video information, and signaling, translation and conversion in the network. These basic telecommunications
services are the bulk of existing telecommunications, and are licensed and regulated to some degree in both the United
States and the United Kingdom. There are relatively few significant providers. In contrast, ``enhanced telecommunications
services'' (as defined in Section IV.F), which use telecommunications services as a foundation to provide various
advanced and intelligent applications of additional value to users, are subject to little or no regulation in the
United States and the United Kingdom. The number of providers is often greater than for basic telecommunications,
although all such providers must have access to the basic telecommunications services in order to do business.

<TEXT>
 

NewCo will interconnect directly with BT's United Kingdom network, and will obtain other telecommunications services
from BT, such as international circuits, to use in the provision of seamless global network services. NewCo's services
may be distributed by BT either alone or together with BT's own domestic services in the United Kingdom. NewCo may have
access to valuable information concerning changes to BT's United Kingdom network that has not yet been disclosed
to other competitors.

Accordingly, NewCo is subject to four categories of disclosure requirements. Section II.A.1 obligates it to disclose
the prices, terms and conditions, including any discounts, on which telecommunications services are provided to
NewCo pursuant to interconnection agreements. Interconnection agreements are specific arrangements (see Section
IV.H) by which other licensed operators in the United Kingdom receive rights to connect their systems to BT's network
and have BT complete delivery of traffic, on terms that may differ from those available to retail customers. Although
BT began to publish new interconnection agreements last year, BT's license allows it the option to publish pricing
methodologies instead of actual prices. Section II.A.1 will compel NewCo to disclose the actual prices BT charges
it for interconnection.

Section II.A.2 imposes similar disclosure obligations on NewCo for prices, terms and conditions, including any
discounts, of any other telecommunications services it obtains from BT. These services could include international
private circuits obtained at retail or otherwise from BT. The disclosure requirements under this provision also
apply to the terms on which BT provides U.K. telecommunications services to customers together with NewCo services,
thus facilitating detection of discrimination in bundling of services. To some extent these types of information
are already disclosed by BT in its retail tariffs pursuant to United Kingdom regulation, but Section II.A.2 ensures
comprehensive transparency to prevent discrimination.

Section II.A.4 requires NewCo to provide additional information about the specific telecommunications services
that it receives from BT to supply telecommunications or enhanced telecommunications services between the United
States and the United Kingdom, as well as the services BT provides directly to customers in the United Kingdom as the
distributor for NewCo. NewCo is required to disclose the types of circuits, including their capacity, and other telecommunications
services provided. NewCo also is required to disclose information concerning the actual average times between order
and delivery of circuits and the number of outages and actual average times between fault report and restoration for
various categories of circuits. These types of information are not otherwise disclosed under existing regulations,
and are important to the detection of various types of discrimination. Where NewCo has to disclose particular telecommunications
services provided by BT under II.A., it is required to identify the services and provide reasonable detail about them
(if not already published). However, if a service is sold as a unit, separate underlying facilities need only be disclosed
to the extent necessary to identify the service and the means of interconnection. NewCo is not required to identify
individual customers or the locations of circuits and services dedicated to particular customers.

Finally, under Section II.A.6 NewCo is required to disclose information it or MCI receives from BT about planned and
authorized changes in BT's United Kingdom network that would affect interconnection arrangements with any licensed
operators. Should MCI receive information separately from NewCo, it has the same disclosure obligation. Disclosure
of information of this nature is important to ensure that NewCo, through its affiliation with BT, is not given commercial
advantages through advance notice.

MCI's relationship with BT in the provision of international services will be less complex than NewCo's, owing to
MCI's agreements not to compete with NewCo and to suffer loss of its special rights if it competes with BT outside the
Americas for a period of five years from closing. MCI will continue to provide international correspondent switched
and private line services together with BT. To ensure greater transparency in MCI's dealings with BT, Section II.A
contains two sets of disclosure obligations specifically applicable to MCI.

Section II.A.3 applies to any international switched telecommunications or enhanced telecommunications services
provided by MCI and BT on a correspondent basis between the United States and the United Kingdom. It requires MCI to
disclose both the accounting and settlement rates, and other terms and conditions, applicable to any of these services.
When there is no specific agreement between MCI and BT setting forth this information, MCI must state the rates, terms
and conditions on which the service is actually provided. If BT combines types of traffic subject to different accounting
rates to determine the proportionate allocation of switched traffic to United States providers, MCI must disclose
its own minutes of traffic in each separate accounting rate category so that the other United States providers can
determine whether they are being sent the appropriate shares of traffic from BT, if they do not already receive data
(such as total traffic volumes in each rate category) that is sufficient to enable them to do so. This latter obligation
addresses a particular type of possible discrimination in international services, known as ``grooming,'' by which
a foreign carrier can favor particular United States correspondents with traffic of superior value while appearing
to allocate minutes of traffic on a proportionate basis. Today some types of information covered by Section II.A.3,
such as agreed-upon accounting rates, are supplied to the Federal Communications Commission (``FCC'') and are published,
or are provided to competitors. Where information has already been made available in these ways, Section II.A.3 of
the Final Judgment does not require MCI to provide it to the Department of Justice.

Section II.A.5 requires MCI to provide information about the United States-United Kingdom international private
circuits it provides jointly with BT. MCI must disclose the actual average times between order and delivery by BT,
and the actual average time intervals between fault report and restoration in specific areas of the international
facility and the overseas network. This information is similar to types of information NewCo provides under Section
II.A.4 and serves similar purposes. MCI is also required, for circuits used to provide international switched services
on a correspondent basis between the United States and the United Kingdom, to identify average numbers of circuit
equivalents available during the busy hour. The great majority of these circuits would be with BT. None of the information
disclosed under Section II.A.5 is made public today.

Under Section II.A., MCI and NewCo are required to disclose intellectual property or proprietary information only
if it is one of the types of information expressly required to be disclosed by any of these transparency obligations,
or if it is necessary for licensed operators to interconnect with BT's United Kingdom network or for United States
international providers to use BT's international facilities to complete their services. MCI and NewCo, as well
as BT indirectly, are thus protected against overly broad disclosure of such valuable commercial information.



2. Confidentiality Requirements



Three provisions of the proposed Final Judgment, Sections II.B, II.C and II.D, constrain the ability of MCI (including
the director it appoints to the BT board) and NewCo to receive from BT (including BT-appointed directors on the board
of MCI), various types of confidential information that BT obtains from MCI's and NewCo's United States competitors.
Existing regulatory requirements do not adequately protect any of this information from disclosure.

<TEXT>
 

Under Section II.B MCI and NewCo will not receive information from BT that other United States competitors identify
as proprietary and maintain as confidential, but that has been obtained by BT as the result of its provision of interconnection
or other telecommunications services to the competitors in the United Kingdom. In order to obtain interconnection,
other licensed operators are commonly required to provide BT with a statement of requirements containing detailed
information about their planned services and interconnection needs. As interconnection needs change over time,
BT will receive more confidential information. BT may also learn the identities and service needs of particular customers
of its competitors who need to have private circuits interconnected with BT. Of course, there is no alternative to
interconnection with BT because of its local monopoly bottleneck and overall market power in the United Kingdom.
Section II.C similarly forbids MCI and NewCo from receiving confidential, non-public information from BT that BT
may obtain from other United States competitors of MCI and NewCo through its correspondent relationships with them.
United States international telecommunications providers have no reasonable alternative at present to using BT
for at least some of their correspondent traffic to and from the United Kingdom. A limited exception is provided to
allow MCI to obtain certain types of aggregate information it may need to comply with its transparency obligations
under Sections II.A.3(ii) and II.A.5, but in no circumstances may MCI use this exception to receive individual information
about other providers that is otherwise prohibited by this section.
Finally, Section II.D. addresses a specific competitive risk in the context of international correspondent relationships,
by prohibiting MCI from seeking or accepting from BT any non-public information about the future prices or pricing
plans of any competitor of MCI in the provision of international telecommunications services between the United
States and United Kingdom. BT and its United States correspondents, in the course of accounting rate negotiations,
exchange considerable information including business plans and traffic projections. Section II.D addresses the
substantial risk of violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act that would arise if BT were to obtain non-public pricing
information from MCI's competitors once BT becomes MCI's single largest owner, by precluding any sharing of price
information through BT. Risks of price collusion, tacit or explicit, are considerable in an industry with a small
number of large providers offering similar types of services.


3. International Simple Resale Requirements


The international simple resale provision of the proposed Final Judgment, Section II.E, is directed at actions by
BT, using its dominant position in the United Kingdom, that would discriminate in favor of MCI, including the diversion
of most or all of BT's traffic from the United Kingdom through MCI and NewCo. Such conduct could raise prices to United
States consumers or otherwise harm competition in the United States, unless United States carriers are licensed
to operate in the United Kingdom and interconnected with BT so that they can respond effectively to BT's conduct.
International simple resale (``ISR'') (see Section IV.I) is the transmission through private or leased international
telecommunications facilities (or by any other international means where usage is not measured) of voice or data
traffic (excluding certain enhanced capabilities), if that traffic is carried over the public switched telecommunications
network in both the country where it originates and the country where it terminates. ISR avoids the correspondent
system, and traffic sent by ISR would be exempt from proportionate allocation policies. When all providers on an international
route are equally capable of using ISR, it can lessen the risk of discriminatory practices in switched correspondent
services, and can enable United States providers to retaliate against attempts by a foreign carrier to use its market
power to increase the settlement liabilities of unaffiliated carriers relative to those of its United States affiliate.
ISR between the United States and the United Kingdom can lawfully occur only when the telecommunications regulatory
authorities of both countries find generally that equivalency exists between them in policies relating to open entry
and non-discrimination. However, that equivalency finding will not be sufficient for all United States providers
to begin offering ISR to the United Kingdom, because in the United Kingdom each provider of international simple resale
services must also be individually licensed. To provide ISR, a firm must have the ability to use international facilities
and interconnections to the domestic networks at both ends of the international route.

Section II.E prohibits MCI and NewCo from providing any telecommunications facilities or services to be used by BT
for international simple resale between the United Kingdom and the United States, until (1) All qualified United
States international telecommunications providers that applied by December 1, 1993 for United Kingdom licenses
that would allow them to provide ISR have been granted ISR licenses,
 and (2) all such licensed United States providers have been offered the opportunity to interconnect with BT's United
Kingdom network on standard, nondiscriminatory and published terms, with reasonable arrangements for any other
necessary technical aspects of interconnection. This provision does not compel or direct the grant of any licenses,
which is the prerogative of the United Kingdom government. It ensures, however, that any delays in licensing competing
United States providers, or delays on BT's part in interconnecting such licensed providers in the United Kingdom,
will not be used to anticompetitive effect by MCI, NewCo and BT.







The December 1, 1993 cutoff date for qualified providers included all qualified United States applicants who sought
to provide international simple resale service before NewCo's own license application was filed in the United Kingdom.
Plaintiff and defendants have sought to identify, by stipulation, the United States international telecommunications
providers that they presently understand to be qualified under Section II.E.
 Any other persons, however, may notify the Department before entry of the Final Judgment that they believe they are
also qualified within the meaning of Section II.E. If plaintiff concludes that any such additional persons are qualified
they will be added to the stipulated list.





Section II.E. does not affect the ability of the FCC, and United Kingdom authorities, to determine when general conditions
warrant authorizing international simple resale or other forms of resale between the United States and the United
Kingdom.



4. Modifications



Section VII, the modifications provision, affords the means of expanding, altering or reducing the substantive
terms of the Final Judgment, and is essential to the protection of competition. Modifications that are not contested
by any party to the Final Judgment are reviewed under a ``public interest'' test. See, e.g, United States

 v. 

Western Electric Co.,

 993 F.2d 1572, 1576-77 (D.C. Cir. 983).

<TEXT>
 

Where a proposed modification is contested by any party to the Final Judgment, the Court must determine both whether
modification is required, and whether the particular modification proposed is appropriate. The United States is
able to seek changes to the substantive terms and obligations of the Final Judgment from the Court, including additional
requirements to prevent receipt of discriminatory treatment by defendants, in order to avoid substantial harm to
competition or consumers in the United States. The defendants are able to seek modifications removing obligations
of the Final Judgment in order to avoid substantial hardship to themselves. In either case, the party seeking modifications
must make a clear showing that modification is required, based on a significant change in circumstances or a significant
new event subsequent to the entry of the Final Judgment. Such a change in circumstances or an event subsequent to the
entry of judgment need not have been unforeseen, nor need it have been referred to in the Final Judgment. The parties
recognize that discrimination of a significant nature involving BT and defendants, subsequent to the entry of the
Final Judgment, could constitute such a new event. Before concluding that discrimination against any particular
competitor of MCI or NewCo required seeking a modification of the Final Judgment to protect competition or consumers,
the Department of Justice would ordinarily inquire at the outset whether the injured competitor had availed itself
of existing regulatory remedies, if any, in the United Kingdom as well as the United States, and what relief had been
provided or action taken, if any, by the telecommunications regulatory agencies.

If the Court concludes that any party has met its burden of showing that the Final Judgment should be modified over the
opposition of another party, it would then be empowered to grant any particular modification that meets three criteria.
The modification must be (i) in the public interest, (ii) suitably tailored to the changed circumstances or new event
that gave rise to its adoption, and must not result in serious hardship to any defendant, and (iii) consistent with
the purposes of the antitrust laws of the United States, and the telecommunications regulatory regime of the United
Kingdom. This standard protects against overbroad modifications, and recognizes that mere inconvenience or some
hardship to a defendant will not preclude a modification, but only ``serious'' hardship. The loss of opportunity
to profit from anticompetitive conduct is not a ``serious'' hardship within the meaning of this standard. Any proposed
modification, to be consistent with the antitrust laws, must not be of an anticompetitive character, and must protect
competition or consumers in the United States. Modifications must also be consistent with the system of regulation
of telecommunications in the United Kingdom.

Section VII permits the United States, where any party has sought modifications of the Final Judgment, to invoke any
of the visitorial provisions contained in Section V of the Final Judgment in order to obtain from defendants any information
or documents needed to evaluate the proposed modification prior to decision by the Court.



5. Visitorial and Compliance Requirements



Section V of the Final Judgment allows the Department of Justice to monitor defendants' compliance by several means.
Section V.A obliges defendants to maintain records and documents sufficient to show their compliance with the Final
Judgment's requirements. Sections V.B and V.C enable the United States to gain access to inspect and copy the records
and documents of defendants, and also to have access to their personnel for interviews or to take sworn testimony.
Section V.B covers access to MCI, as well as to NewCo's operations in the United States. To avoid difficulties that
might arise in applying that visitorial procedure to discovery directed at foreign operations of NewCo, Section
V.C. provides that NewCo documents and personnel, wherever located (including abroad), would be produced by NewCo
in the United States, within sixty days of request in the case of documents, and subject to the reasonable convenience
of the persons involved in the case of requests for interviews or sworn testimony. Section V.D permits the United States
also to require any defendant to submit written reports relating to any matters contained in the Final Judgment. Finally,
Section V.E supplies confidentiality protections for information and documents furnished by defendants to the
United States under the other provisions of Section V. It permits the Department of Justice to share information and
documents with the Federal Communications Commission (subject to confidentiality protections), and to share information
with the Office of Telecommunications (``OFTEL''), the United Kingdom telecommunications regulator.



6. Term of Years



Section IX.B of the proposed Final Judgment specifies that the substantive restrictions and obligations of the Final
Judgment shall expire five years after the entry of the judgment. Five years is an appropriate duration for the substantive
provisions because the joint venture is expected by BT and MCI to last a minimum of five years and has been planned on
that basis. In addition, MCI can enter BT's assigned territory outside the Americas to compete with BT five years after
closing without losing its special rights in BT. The parties have committed by separate stipulation to notify the
Department whether they will continue the joint venture six months before the expiration of the Final Judgment's
substantive requirements, giving the United States an opportunity to decide whether it is necessary to take further
action to protect competition. The international telecommunications markets, including the market or markets
for international telecommunications services between the United States and the United Kingdom and the emerging
market or markets for seamless global telecommunications services, may evolve rapidly during the next five years,
in part due to the transactions under consideration in this case and the Final Judgment. Under these circumstances,
the United States does not consider it necessary to impose a lengthier duration on the substantive provisions of the
proposed Final Judgment.

B. Effects of the Proposed Final Judgment on Competition


The transactions between BT and MCI represent the first opportunity the Department of Justice has had to consider
the competitive consequences of the acquisition of a substantial interest in a major United States international
telecommunications provider by a foreign telecommunications provider with market power in its home market. The
formation of an exclusive international joint venture between such firms to provide a wide range of enhanced telecommunications
services presents additional competitive issues.
The BT-MCI joint venture may enable the parties to offer services that they would not otherwise provide. But the BT-MCI
transactions also pose substantial risks to competition in the United States, owing to BT's vertically integrated
virtual monopoly in local services and its dominant position in long distance domestic and international services
in the United Kingdom, which when combined with MCI's competitive long distance services would give rise to increased
incentives for BT's market power to be used to favor MCI and NewCo and disadvantage competitors in the United States.
In other circumstances involving vertical integration between large monopoly providers of local exchange telecommunications
services and competitive long distance providers in the United States, the Department of Justice has obtained various
forms of relief under the antitrust laws to protect competition. 

See, e.g., United States 

v. 

American Telephone and Telegraph Co.

, 552 F. Supp. 131 (D.D.C. 1982), 

aff'd mem. sub nom. Maryland 

v. 

United States

, 460 U.S. 1001 (1983); 

United States 

 v. 

GTE Corp.

, 603 F. Supp. 730 (D.D.C. 1984). While the relief proposed here is not the same as in those cases, it serves a similar
competitive purpose, taking into account the particular circumstances and risks associated with the transactions
between MCI and BT. These include the unique practices and relationships between carriers in the provision of international
telecommunications services, the continued existence of MCI as a separate entity following these transactions,
and the involvement of a foreign telecommunications provider subject to a distinct regulatory regime overseas.
The United States believes that the relief proposed here, including both the substantive restrictions and obligations
and the ability of the Court to modify the Final Judgment to respond to additional competitive problems, will substantially
benefit competition. The ability of MCI and NewCo to realize anticompetitive advantages in the United States will
be substantially constrained.
Entry of the proposed Final Judgment will allow the transactions between BT and MCI to proceed, and any benefits from
them to be realized by consumers. At the same time, it will provide United States competitors with increased means
to detect discrimination, protect them against misuse of their confidential business information, and enable them
to respond to BT's provision of international simple resale through MCI and NewCo with services of their own to the
United Kingdom that could bypass BT's international switched correspondent services and alleviate the risks of
anticompetitive conduct involving MCI and NewCo. It will also provide the United States with a mechanism to modify
the Final Judgment, in response to post-judgment changed circumstances or other events, without having to initiate
separate antitrust litigation. This opportunity to impose additional restrictions on defendants to protect competition
and consumers in the United States will ensure against any possibility that the other substantive provisions of the
Final Judgment and existing regulatory requirements may prove insufficient to protect competition. Thus, the modification
provision will serve as an additional important deterrent to anticompetitive behavior.


IV
Remedies Available to Potential Private Litigants


Section 4 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. 15, provides that any person who has been injured as a result of conduct prohibited
by the antitrust laws may bring suit in federal court to recover three times the damages suffered, as well as costs and
reasonable attorney's fees. Entry of the proposed Final Judgment will neither impair nor assist the bringing of such
actions. Under the provisions of Section 5(a) of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. 16(a), the proposed Final Judgment has
no 

prima facie

 effect in any subsequent private lawsuits that may be brought against defendants in this matter.
In addition, persons affected by unreasonable discrimination on the part of MCI, in violation of 47 U.S.C. 202, may
complain to the Federal Communications Commission as provided by 47 U.S.C. 208, for such relief as is available under
the Communications Act and the Commission's regulations, or bring suit for damages pursuant to 47 U.S.C. 206. Persons
affected by an undue preference or undue discrimination on the part of BT in violation of Condition 17 of BT's license,
or other violation of BT's license, in favor of MCI or NewCo, may complain to the United Kingdom Office of Telecommunications
for such relief as OFTEL is authorized to provide under the United Kingdom Telecommunications Act and BT's license.
Entry of the proposed Final Judgment will not impair the bringing of such complaints and actions, and indeed will likely
facilitate the effective detection and prevention of anticompetitive conduct through existing regulatory mechanisms.

V

Procedures Available for Modification of the Proposed Final Judgment



As provided by the Antitrust Procedures and Penalties Act, any person believing that the proposed Final Judgment
should be modified may submit written comments to Richard L. Rosen, Chief, Communications and Finance Section, U.S.
Department of Justice, Antitrust Division, 555 Fourth Street, N.W., Room 8104, Washington, D.C. 20001, within the
60-day period provided by the Act. These comments and the Department's responses, will be filed with the Court and
published in the 

Federal Register

. All comments will be given due consideration by the Department of Justice, which remains free to withdraw its consent
to the proposed Judgment at any time prior to entry. The proposed Final Judgment provides that the Court retains jurisdiction
over this action, and the parties may apply to the Court for any order necessary or appropriate to carry out or construe
the Final Judgment, to modify or terminate any of its provisions, to enforce compliance, and to punish any violations
of its provisions. Modifications of the Final Judgment may be sought by the United States or by the defendants under
the standards described therein.



VI

Alternatives to the Proposed Final Judgment



As an alternative to the proposed Final Judgment, the United States considered litigation to seek an injunction to
prevent the proposed transactions between BT and MCI. The United States rejected that alternative because the relief
in the proposed Final Judgment, together with existing regulatory safeguards in the United States and the United
Kingdom, should provide protection against significant anticompetitive effects on competition.

In formulating the proposed Final Judgment, the United States also considered the extent to which the regulatory
regime in the United Kingdom and the FCC have mechanisms currently in place to address anticompetitive conduct, including
discrimination, by providers of international telecommunications services. The United States considered including
in the Final Judgment specific nondiscrimination conditions, enforceable through contempt sanctions, to deter
discrimination by BT in favor of MCI and NewCo. It concluded that the other provisions of the Final Judgment, existing
regulatory requirements and enforcement practices in the United States and the United Kingdom, and the ability of
the United States to seek modifications of the Final Judgment, are sufficient to protect competition.

The United States was not prepared to rely on existing regulation alone to prevent harm to competition and consumers
in the United States. While the United Kingdom regulatory authorities share with the United States a generally procompetitive
approach to telecommunications policy, protection of competition and consumers in the United States is not the primary
goal of United Kingdom regulators. There are a number of important telecommunications regulatory issues that remain
unsettled in the United Kingdom, and some policies specifically limiting competition remain in effect, such as the
duopoly on international facilities-based competition. Historic experience and the present state of competition
in the United States and the United Kingdom were also taken into account in determining that this relief was needed.

Because, however, the telecommunications regulatory regime in the United Kingdom now embodies or is developing
important competitive policies and safeguards, the United States concluded that it is possible to protect competition
adequately in these circumstances without placing specific antidiscrimination prohibitions in the proposed Final
Judgment or prohibiting the MCI-BT transactions, altogether, as would likely have been necessary otherwise.
The procompetitive direction of United Kingdom telecommunications regulation is evidenced by the ending of the
BT-Mercury domestic duopoly policy in 1991, and by the more recent licensing of additional facilities-based domestic
competitors to BT and Mercury and the grant of several international simple resale licenses to, among others, United
States firms. OFTEL, the principal U.K. telecommunications regulatory authority, has issued a statement on interconnection
and accounting separation setting forth policies and targets for making a wider variety of interconnection arrangements
with BT available to competitors, and creating greater transparency in the relationship between BT's own network
and retail operations. OFTEL is seeking to improve its regulatory oversight of BT and promote greater competition
in other respects as well. In sum, the United Kingdom telecommunications regulatory regime has taken steps to promote
and foster competition that have not yet occurred in most of the world, and it was appropriate for the United States
to take these developments into account in not requiring more extensive relief to be included in the proposed Final
Judgment.

The United States also considered issues of international comity in shaping the proposed Final Judgment. Consistently
with its longstanding enforcement policy, the United States sought in the substantive provisions of the Final Judgment
to avoid situations that could give rise to international conflicts between sovereign governments and their agencies.
The substantive requirements imposed on MCI and NewCo have been tailored so as to avoid direct United States involvement
in BT's operation of its telecommunications network in the United Kingdom on an ongoing basis, minimizing the potential
for conflict with United Kingdom authorities.

VII

Standard of Review Under the Tunney Act for the Proposed Final Judgment



The APPA requires that proposed consent judgments in antitrust cases brought by the United States are subject to a
sixty-day comment period, after which the court shall determine whether entry of the proposed final judgment ``is
in the public interest.'' In making that determination, the court 

may

 consider:




(1) the competitive impact of such judgment, including termination of alleged violations, provisions for enforcement
and modification, duration or relief sought, anticipated effects of alternative remedies actually considered,
and any other considerations bearing upon the adequacy of such judgment;

(2) the impact of entry of such judgment upon the public generally and individuals alleging specific injury from the
violations set forth in the complaint including consideration of the public benefit, if any, to be derived from a determination
of the issues at trial.




15 U.S.C. 16(e) (emphasis added). The courts have recognized that the term ``public interest'' ``take[s] meaning
from the purposes of the regulatory legislation.'' 

NAACP 

v.

 Federal Power Comm'n,

 425 U.S. 662, 669 (1976); 

United States 

v.

 American Cynamid Co.,

 719 F.2d 558, 565 (2d Cir. 1983), 

cert. denied,

 465 U.S. 1101 (1984). Since the purpose of the antitrust laws is to ``preserv[e] free and unfettered competition as
the rule of trade,'' 

Northern Pacific Railway Co. 

v.

 United States,

 356 U.S. 1, 4 (1958), the focus of the ``public interest'' inquiry under the Tunney Act is whether the proposed final
judgment would serve the public interest in free and unfettered competition. 

United States v. Waste Management, Inc.,

 1985-2 Trade Cas.  66,651, at 63,046 (D.D.C. 1985). In conducting this inquiry, ``the Court is nowhere
compelled to go to trial or to engage in extended proceedings which might have the effect of vitiating the benefits
of prompt and less costly settlement through the consent decree process.''
 Rather,






Absent a showing of corrupt failure of the government to discharge its duty, the Court, in making the public interest
finding, should * * * carefully consider the explanations of the government in the competitive impact
statement and its responses to comments in order to determine whether those explanations are reasonable under the
circumstances.

<TEXT>
 



United States v. Mid-America Dairymen, Inc., 

1977-1 Trade Cas.  61,508, at 71,980 (W.D. Mo. 1977).



It is also unnecessary for the district court to ``engage in an unrestricted evaluation of what relief would best serve
the public.'' 

United States v. Bechtel Corp.,

 648 F.2d 660, 666 (9th Cir.), 

cert. denied,

 454 U.S. 1083 (1981). Precedent requires that 




[T]he balancing of competing social and political interests affected by a proposed antitrust consent decree must
be left, in the first instance, to the discretion of the Attorney General. The court's role in protecting the public
interest is one of insuring that the government has not breached its duty to the public in consenting to the decree.
The court is required to determine not whether a particular decree is the one that will best serve society, but whether
the settlement is ``within the reaches of the public interest.'' More elaborate requirements might undermine the
effectiveness of antitrust enforcement by consent decree.






A proposed consent decree is an agreement between the parties which is reached after exhaustive negotiations and
discussions. Parties do not hastily and thoughtlessly stipulate to a decree because, in doing so, they waive their
right to litigate the issues involved in the case and thus save themselves the time, expense, and inevitable risk of
litigation. Naturally, the agreement reached normally embodies a compromise; in exchange for the saving of cost
and the elimination of risk, the parties each give up something they might have won had they proceeded with the litigation.






United States v. Armour & Co.

, 402 U.S. 673, 681 (1971).



The proposed consent decree, therefore, should not be reviewed under a standard of whether it is certain to eliminate
every anticompetitive effect of a merger or whether it mandates certainty of free competition in the future. The court
may reject the agreement of the parties as to how the public interest is best served only if has ``exceptional confidence
that adverse antitrust consequences will result * * *'' 

United States v. Western Electric Co.,

 993 F.2d 1572, 1577 (D.C. Cir. 1993).

Court approval of a final judgment requires a standard more flexible and less strict than the standard required for
a finding of liability. ``[A] proposed decree must be approved even if it falls short of the remedy the court would impose
on its own, as long as it falls within the range of acceptability or is `within the reaches of public interest.'''
 Under the public interest standard, the court's role is limited to determining whether the proposed decree is within
the ``zone of settlements'' consistent with the public interest, not whether the settlement diverges from the court's
view of what would best serve the public interest. 

United States v. Western Electric Co.,

 993 F.2d at 1576 (quoting 

United States v. Western Electric Co.,

 900 F.2d 283, 307 (D.C. Cir. 1990)).

<DOCTITLE>Documents Containing Reporting or Recordkeeping Requirements: Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Review</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC).



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of the OMB review of information collection.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The NRC has recently submitted to the OMB for review the following proposal for the collection of information under
the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. Chapter 35).


1. Type of submission, new, revision, or extension: Revision.
2. The title of the information collection: Proposed Rule, 10 CFR Part 54, ``Nuclear Power Plant License Renewal.''
3. The form number if applicable: Not applicable.
4. How often collection is required: One-time submission with application for renewal of an operating license for
a nuclear power plant and occasional collections for holders of renewed licenses.


5. Who will be required or requested to report: Commercial nuclear power plant licensees who wish to renew their operating
licenses.

6. An estimate of the number of responses: As many as 100 licensees may take advantage of this provision over the next
30 years. It is anticipated that three or four responses will be received on average each year.

7. An estimate of the total number of hours needed to complete this requirement: The estimated burden on the licensee
is being reduced from approximately 135,000 hours to 94,000 hours per license renewal.


8. An indication of whether Section 3504(h), Pub. L. 96-511 applies: Applicable.

9. Abstract: The license renewal rule (10 CFR Part 54) which was completed in December 1991, established procedures,
criteria, and standards governing nuclear power plant license renewal, including information submittal and recordkeeping
requirements. However, many of the details of the current rule are not clear with respect to requirements and procedures.
The proposed rule amendment clarifies the requirements, eliminates unnecessary terminology, and simplifies the
Integrated Plant Assessment to focus only on those passive, long-lived, nonredundant structures and components,
whose functionality is not easily verified through performance or condition monitoring.

Copies of the submittal can be inspected or obtained for a fee from the NRC Public Document Room, 2120 L Street NW., Lower
Level, Washington, DC 20037.

Comments and questions should be directed by mail to the OMB reviewer: Troy Hiller, Office of Information and Regulatory
Affairs, (3150-0155), NEOB-3019, Office of Management and Budget, Washington, DC 20503.

Comments can also be submitted by telephone at (202) 395-3084. The NRC Clearance Officer is Brenda J. Shelton,
(301) 415-7232. Dated at Rockville, Maryland, this 21st day of June, 1994.

<DOCTITLE>Regulatory Guide; Issuance, Availability</DOCTITLE>



The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has issued for public comment a proposed revision to a guide in its Regulatory Guide
Series. This series has been developed to describe and make available to the public such information as methods acceptable
to the NRC staff for implementing specific parts of the Commission's regulations, techniques used by the staff in
evaluating specific problems or postulated accidents, and data needed by the staff in its review of applications
for permits and licenses.

The draft guide, temporarily identified by its task number, DG-1031 (which should be mentioned in all correspondence
concerning this draft guide), is a proposed revision to Regulatory Guide 1.160, ``Monitoring the Effectiveness
of Maintenance at Nuclear Power Plants.'' This guide is being revised to provide guidance on meeting the Commission's
current rules on maintenance and on monitoring the effectiveness of maintenance in nuclear poser plants.

This draft guide is being issued to involve the public in the early stages of the development of a regulatory position
in this area. It has not received complete staff review and does not represent an official NRC staff position.

Public comments are being solicited on the draft guide. Comments should be accompanied by supporting data. Written
comments may be submitted to the Rules Review and Directives Branch, Division of Freedom of Information and Publications
Services, Office of Administration, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555. Comments will be
most helpful if received by August 25, 1994.

Although a time limit is given for comments on these drafts, comments and suggestions in connection with (1) items
for inclusion in guides currently being developed or (2) improvements in all published guides are encouraged at any
time.

Regulatory guides are available for inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, 2120 L Street NW., Washington,
DC. Requests for single copies of draft guides (which may be reproduced) or for placement on an automatic distribution
list for single copies of future draft guides in specific divisions should be made in writing to the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory
Commission, Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Director, Distribution and Mail Services Section. Telephone requests
cannot be accommodated. Regulatory guides are not copyrighted, and Commission approval is not required to reproduce
them.

<DOCTITLE>Public Service Electric and Gas Co.; Correction</DOCTITLE>





On July 27, 1989 (54 FR 31270) was published in the 

Federal Register

 which contained exemptions to 10 CFR part 50, appendix R, related to the Salem Nuclear Generating Station, Units 1
and 2. The following corrections should be incorporated:


1. Page 31271, Column 1, Line 53, change ``1 & 2'' to ``12''.


2. Page 31271, Column 2, replace Line 3 through Line 32 with the following:


``The rooms within this area are separated by hollow core metal office partitions except the air conditioning rooms,
which are separated by a reinforced concrete wall. The two control rooms are separated by a 10-foot wide corridor.
Room partitions between the control rooms and the senior shift and shift supervisor's office contain glass panels.
The control rooms are separated from their associated control equipment rooms by built-in steel frame control cabinets.
Dropped ceilings are finished with acoustic tile.''


3. Page 31272, Column 1, Line 5, change ``1006'' to ``100G''.


4. Page 31272, Column 2, Line 35, change ``781'' to ``78I''.


5. Page 31272, replace Column 2, Line 37 to Column 3, Line 44, with the following:



``4.1 Exemption Requested




An exemption was requested from Section III.G.2.c to the extent that it requires the separation of redundant cables
and equipment by hour rated fire barriers plus area-wide suppression and detection. Specifically, these locations
are not protected by automatic fire suppression system or area-wide fire detection systems.



4.2 Discussion




This fire area consists of the mechanical penetration areas on elevations 78 feet and 100 feet of the auxiliary building.
It is constructed of reinforced concrete with 3-hour fire rated barriers. Doors, dampers, and HVAC duct penetrations
are not 3-hour rated; however, these are the subject of a generic exemption previously evaluated to be acceptable.


Elevation 100 ft contains the fuel handling area exhaust ventilation equipment and the containment pressure relief
exhaust unit and the steam generator blowdown tanks. The area also contains some safety-related instrument panels.
Elevation 78 ft. contains piping for various systems which run between the auxiliary and the containment building.
The area also contains service water piping which enters the auxiliary building from the service water intake structure.
Partial area fire detection is provided for the protection of the major fire hazards on elevations 78 ft. and 100 ft.
Continuous thermal strip detectors are also provided to protect charcoal filters in the ventilation units. Additionally,
automatic fire suppression is provided in the ventilation units by a water deluge spray system actuated by the thermal
strip detectors. Portable fire extinguishers and manual hose stations are also provided on elevation 100 ft.


The redundant equipment located in this area includes piping and valves associated with the following systems:






_Auxiliary Feedwater

_Component Cooling

_Charging System

_Containment Ventilation

_Service Water

_Residual Heat Removal

_Main Steam



4.3 Evaluation




The fire protection in this area does not comply with the technical requirements of Section III.G.2.c of Appendix
R because the redundant cables are protected by a 1-hour rated barrier but, without automatic suppression and area-wide
detection.


There was a concern that a fire in this fire area could cause the loss of normal shutdown capability. The in-site combustibles
in the Mechanical Penetration area will result in a total fire load of approximately 28,000 BTU/ft

2

 (21 minutes on the ASTM time-temperature curve). The major combustibles in this area consist of the charcoal filters
and electrical cable insulation. The charcoal filters are protected by automatic deluge suppression systems. The
electrical cables are widely dispersed and protected by the partial detection system. There is a reasonable assurance
that a fire in this area will be detected by the partial fire detection system in its early stages and extinguished by
the fixed fire suppression system or the fire brigade before adjacent safety-related areas are threatened. The 1-hour
fire barriers would maintain one division of cables needed for safe shutdown free of fire damage until the fire brigade
could extinguish the fire.



4.4 Conclusion




Based on the above evaluation, it is concluded that the existing fire protection features already in place combined
with the 1-hour fire barriers in the above described fire areas provide a level of fire protection equivalent to the
technical requirements of Section III.G.2.c of Appendix R. Therefore, the exemption is granted.''


6. Page 31275, Column 1, Line 8, change ``Panel 35'' to ``Panel 355''.


7. Page 31275, Column 3, Line 67, change ``1&2 FA-AB-122A'' to ``12 FA-AB-122A''.


8. Page 31276, Column 1, Line 16, change ``781'' to ``78I''.


9. Page 31276, Column 1, replace Lines 18 through 24 with the following:


``7. Lack of complete 1-hour fire rated barriers between redundant shutdown systems in the 460V switchgear room.
(Areas 1&2 FA-AB-84A) (Licensee Exemption 6);''


10. Page 31276, Column 1, replace Lines 30 through 33 with the following:


``9. Lack of complete 1-hour fire rated barriers between redundant shutdown system and a manually actuated fire suppression
system in lieu of an automatic system in the 4160V switchgear room (Areas 1&2 FA-AB-64A) (Licensee
Exemption 9);''


11. Page 31276, Column 1, Line 46, change ``45A'' to ``45A and B''.

<DOCTITLE>Western Industrial X-Ray Inspection Company, Inc., Evanston, Wyoming; Order Suspending License (Effective Immediately)
and Demand for Information</DOCTITLE>



I



Western Industrial X-Ray Inspection Company, Inc. (Licensee or WIX) is the holder of Byproduct Material License
No. 49-27356-01 issued by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC or Commission) pursuant to 10 CFR Parts
30 and 34. The license authorizes the Licensee to possess sealed sources of iridium-192 in various radiography devices
for use in performing industrial radiography activities. The license, originally issued on August 12, 1991, is due
to expire on August 31, 1996.



II



In April 1993 and in January and March 1994, the NRC conducted inspections and investigations of Western Industrial
X-Ray Inspection Company, Inc., at the company's offices in Evanston, Wyoming, and at temporary job sites near Granger,
Wyoming. These inspections and investigations identified numerous violations of NRC's radiation safety requirements,
including some violations which were found to have recurred after being found in previous inspections. These violations
were described in inspection reports 030-32190/93-01 and 030-32190/94-01 issued on May
12, 1994. In addition, based on the investigations conducted by the Office of Investigations (OI), several of the
violations have been determined by the NRC to have been committed deliberately by Licensee employees.

In a March 2, 1994, letter to the Licensee, the NRC described the apparent violations that had been identified as of
that date and confirmed the arrangements for the Licensee to attend an enforcement conference in the NRC's Arlington,
Texas office. The enforcement conference, which was transcribed, occurred on April 1, 1994. The Licensee was represented
by Mr. Larry D. Wicks, who is the president and owner of WIX as well as the company's designated radiation safety officer
(RSO).

The most significant of the NRC's concerns, and many of the violations, are related to a July 31, 1993, incident involving
a WIX radiographer and radiographer's assistant who were performing radiography on a pipeline near LaBarge, Wyoming.
The incident involved a radiographic device containing a 37-curie, sealed iridium-192 source and resulted in a potentially
significant radiation exposure to the radiographer's assistant.

This incident was reviewed during the inspection and investigation that began in January 1994. The following information
regarding this incident is based on joint interviews conducted by the inspector and investigator; on signed, sworn
statements taken by the investigator during these interviews; and on statements made by Mr. Wicks at the April 1 enforcement
conference. With the exception of certain statements made by Mr. Wicks at the enforcement conference, which are noted
below, all other statements were made to the inspector and investigator during their joint interviews of WIX personnel.

The radiographer admitted that he violated NRC requirements by not observing the assistant as she radiographed welds
and moved equipment from one location to another (in a later statement, the radiographer said he was aware he was responsible
for the assistant but not aware that he had to observer performing radiographic operations 100% of the time). The assistant
admitted that she violated NRC requirements by not performing a radiation survey after each radiographic exposure
and by not locking the sealed radioactive source in the radiography device prior to moving equipment to another weld.
The assistant stated further that after moving the equipment to another weld she noticed her survey instrument was
``pegged,'' an that her self-reading pocket dosimeter was off-scale, both indications that the device's radioactive
source had not been returned to its fully shielded position or had been jostled from its shielded position when the
device was moved. The assistant stated that her alarm ratemeter, a protective device which is set to alarm in a radiation
field of 500 millirem/hour, did not alarm but added that it was probably turned off. Both she and the radiographer stated
that she immediately brought this incident to the radiographer's attention an that he ``cranked'' the source into
the device and locked it, and that they stopped work for the day.

Both the assistant and the radiographer stated that they prepared incident reports for their employer, Larry Wicks,
the company president an RSO, and that the incident reports were false in that they falsely stated that the radiographer
and the assistant were working together at the time of the incident and falsely stated that they had surveyed the device
and locked the source in the device prior to its being moved. The Assistant claimed that she told Mr. Wicks at the time
the reports were turned in that the incident reports were false, but Mr. Wicks denied this claim during interviews
with the inspector and investigator and at the enforcement conference, stating that he did not know the incident reports
were false until brought to his attention by the NRC.

Mr. Wicks stated during the investigation and at the enforcement conference that after learning of the incident he
sent the assistant's thermoluminescent dosimeter (TLD) in for immediate processing along with other TLDs worn by
company personnel during the month of July 1993. Mr. Wicks also stated that all of the TLDs were sent in the same package.
However, the company that processes TLSs for WIX, Laudauer, Inc., stated, through its representative, to NRC personnel
that while it had received TLDs from WIX for other employees for the month of July 1993, it had no record of receiving
a TLD for the assistant for the month of July 1993 and no record of receiving a request from Mr. Wicks for immediate processing
of any TLDs sent in for that month. Exposure records mailed by Landauer to WIX and retained by WIX contain no information
regarding the assistant's exposure for the month of July 1993 (her exposure records for all other months are available).
The assistant, whom Mr. Wicks placed on restricted duty pending a determination of their exposure, also told NRC personnel
that she persisted in trying to obtain from Mr. Wicks her exposure record for the month of July and that Mr. Wicks eventually_about
three weeks after the incident_told her that she had received 350 millirem.

Mr. Wicks stated during the investigation, however, that he never provided the assistant an exposure estimate based
on Landauer's processing of the TLD because he did not have such a number to give her. The only explanation he has offered
for not pursuing the question of her July 1993 exposure is that he was very busy. Despite the occurrence of the following
events, Mr. Wicks has stated that he was not reminded of the need to evaluate the assistant's exposure from the incident
or for the month of July 1993: (1) Placing the assistant on restricted duty from the date of the incident (July 31, 1993)
until she left his employ in September 1993; (2) receiving Landauer reports for July 1993 which contained no exposure
records for the assistant even though, according to Mr. Wicks' statement, he had sent in her TLD for immediate emergency
processing; (3) preparing a summary of the assistant's radiation exposure history for her employer, which included
the period in question (July 1993); and (4) responding in the fall of 1993 to a request from the NRC for the radiation
exposure reports of terminated employees. In responding to the latter request, Mr. Wicks did not provide a report
for the radiographer's assistant despite having provided one for her husband, whose termination date occurred five
days after hers. As of the time of the inspection and investigation in January 1994, Mr. Wicks had not performed an adequate
evaluation to determine the assistant's exposure resulting from the July 31, 1993 incident. After further requests
from the NRC, Mr. Wicks submitted on March 8, 1994, an estimate of 6 rems for the assistant's whole body exposure and
at the enforcement conference characterized that estimate as ``pure and simply a guess,'' noting that ``I had to have
something to send you.''

Based on its inspection and investigation of the July 31, 1993 incident, as well as the information obtained during
the enforcement conference, the NRC has concluded that the Licensee and its employees violated NRC requirements
by failing to: (1) perform an evaluation of the assistant's radiation exposure to ensure compliance with NRC limits,
as required by 10 CFR 20.201, and send the assistant's TLD in for immediate processing when her pocket dosimeter had
gone off-scale, as required by 10 CFR 34.33(d); (2) check the alarm function on alarm ratemeters prior to the start
of each shift, as required by 10 CFR 34.33(f)(1); (3) perform a radiation survey of a radiography device following
each exposure, as required by 10 CFR 34.43(b); (4) lock the sealed radioactive source in the device after each exposure,
as required by 10 CFR 34.22(a); (5) ensure that radiographers supervise assistant radiographers who are performing
radiographers operations, as required by 10 CFR 34.44, a repeat violation in that it occurred in July 1993, was discussed
during the inspection in January 1994, and was found again in March 1994; (6) provide NRC a report of an individual's
radiation exposure following the individual's termination of employment, as required by 10 CFR 20.408(b); and (7)
ensure that alarm ratemeters worn by radiography personnel were calibrated at a one-year frequency, as required
by 34.33(f)(4), a repeat violation in that it was found and discussed with Mr. Wicks following the inspection and investigation
in April 1993, recurred in July 1993 and was found again in January 1994.

<TEXT>
 

Other violations found during the NRC's inspections and investigations, but unrelated to the July 1993 incident,
include the Licensee's failure to: (1) ensure that pocket dosimeters worn by radiography personnel were checked
for correct response to radiation at 12-month intervals, as required by 10 CFR 34.33(c), a violation that occurred
on January 18, 1994, 13 days after the inspector had informed the RSO that he should remove uncalibrated dosimeters
from service; (2) perform and record quarterly audits of radiography personnel for all calendar quarters in 1992,
as required by license condition; (3) maintain constant surveillance and immediate control of licensed material
in March 1993, as required by 10 CFR 20.207; (4) submit to the NRC a quality assurance program for use of shipping containers,
as required by 10 CFR 71.12(b), a repeat violation in that it was cited in 1992 and had not been corrected by January 1994;
and (5) leak test sealed sources prior to removing them from storage and transferring them to the manufacturer in April
1993 and December 1993, as required by license condition.





The NRC has also concluded from its inspections and investigations that Mr. Wicks and employees of WIX violated the
provisions of 10 CFR 30.10, ``Deliberate Misconduct,'' a regulation which prohibits individuals from deliberately
causing a licensee to be in noncompliance with NRC requirements and prohibits individuals from deliberately providing
materially false information to the NRC or a licensee. Specifically, based on its review of the July 31, 1993 incident,
its review of the OI findings, and its review of the enforcement conference transcript, the NRC has concluded that
Mr. Wicks deliberately failed to perform an evaluation of the assistant's radiation exposure; that Mr. Wicks deliberately
failed to send the assistant's TLD in for immediate processing; that the radiographer deliberately failed to watch
an assistant perform radiography operations; and that the radiographer and assistant deliberately provided materially
false information to the Licensee about the incident.



Based on its review of violations that were unrelated to the July 1993 incident, the NRC has concluded that Mr. Wicks
deliberately failed to perform and record quarterly audits of radiography personnel in 1992, because Mr. Wicks stated
that he was aware of these requirements and his responsibility to comply with them but failed to do so. The NRC also has
concluded that Mr. Wicks deliberately failed to ensure that alarm ratemeters used by radiography personnel in March,
April and July 1993 and January 1994 were calibrated at a one-year frequency, again because Mr. Wicks stated that he
was aware of these requirements and his responsibility to comply with them but repeatedly failed to do so.







III




Based on the above, it appears that Licensee employees, including the president and radiation safety officer, have
engaged in deliberate misconduct by deliberately violating NRC requirements that are important to the protection
of radiography personnel and the public and have failed to ensure compliance with numerous requirements that are
important to the safe use of radiographic sources. Deliberate violations of the nature described above cannot and
will not be tolerated by the NRC. Further, the history of numerous violations, including repetitive violations,
and the failure to follow through on important safety issues, indicate that Mr. Wicks, who is the president and radiation
safety officer, is either incapable or unwilling to ensure that the Licensee's radiography program is conducted
in accordance with all NRC requirements.





Consequently, I lack the requisite reasonable assurance that the Licensee's current operations can be conducted
under License No. 49-27356-01 in compliance with the Commission's requirements and that the health and
safety of the public, including the Licensee's employees, will be protected. Therefore, the public health, safety,
and interest require that License No. 49-27356-01 be suspended. Furthermore, pursuant to 10 CFR 2.202,
I find that the significance of the violations and deliberate misconduct described above are such that the public
health, safety, and interest require that this Order be immediately effective.

<DOCTITLE>Yankee Atomic Electric Company (Yankee Nuclear Power Station); Exemption</DOCTITLE>



I



The Yankee Atomic Electric Company (YAEC or the licensee), is the holder of Facility Operating License (Possession
Only) No. DPR-3 which authorizes possession and maintenance of the Yankee Nuclear Power Station (YNPS or plant).
The license provides, among other things, that the licensee is subject to all rules, regulations, and orders of the
Commission now or hereafter in effect.

The facility is a permanently shutdown pressurized water reactor, currently in the process of being prepared for
decommissioning, and is located at the licensee site in Franklin County, Massachusetts.



II



The licensee, by letter dated February 27,1992, supplemented by letter dated January 19,1 993, informed the NRC and
YAEC had permanently ceased power operations, removed the fuel from the reactor to the fuel pool, and had begun to develop
detailed plans to decommission the facility. The reactor was actually shut down on October 1, 1991; thus, the fuel
has now undergone over two years and seven months of decay. The NRC in a license amendment dated August 5, 1992, modified
License No. DPR-3 to possession only status. The license is conditioned so that YAEC is not authorized to operate
the reactor and fuel may not be placed in the reactor vessel, thus formalizing the YAEC commitment to permanently cease
power operations.

By letter dated September 28, 1992, the licensee requested an amendment to the Yankee Atomic Electric Company (YAEC)
Indemnity Agreement No. B-17 which would reduce the primary level of financial protection maintained at the
plant to $4.5 million from the current level of $200 million and provide relief from participation in the industry
retrospective rating plan (secondary level). This letter was supplemented by the licensee letter to the Commission
dated January 19, 1993.



III



The justification presented by the licensee for amendment of its indemnity agreement is that because of the permanently
shutdown status of the plant, defueled condition of the reactor, and possession only license amendment (which prohibits
operation), 10 CFR 140.11 no longer applies to YAEC. Given these considerations, the licensee contends that 10 CFR
140.12, which describes financial protection for reactors not covered by 10 CFR 140.11, applies to YAEC. The licensee
also addressed past NRC actions with respect to relief granted to the consolidated Edison facility, Indian Point
Unit 1. Consequently, the licensee has requested that its indemnity agreement be amended such that the licensee would
no longer be required to participate in the secondary protection program, and that its primary financial protection
be reduced to the minimum required under 10 CFR 140.12, which is $4.5 million.

The staff has determined on its own initiative that an exemption from the requirements of 10 CFR 140.11 is required
in order to implement an amendment to the licensee indemnity agreement. The bases for providing this exemption to
10 CFR 140.11(a)(4) are provided herein.

The NRC staff independently evaluated the legal and technical issues associated with the application of the Price-Anderson
Act to permanently shut down reactors in SECY-93-127, ``Financial Protection Required of Licensees
of Large Nuclear Power Plants During Decommissioning,'' dated May 10, 1993. In this evaluation, the staff concluded
that the Commission has discretionary authority to respond to licensee requests for a reduction in the level of primary
financial protection and withdrawal from participation in the industry retrospective rating plan. Depending on
the plant-specific configuration and the time since permanent shutdown, the staff also concluded that potential
hazards may exist at permanently shutdown reactors for which financial protection is warranted. The staff concluded
that accidents and hazards insured against under the Price-Anderson Act go beyond design basis accidents and beyond
those considered ``credible'' as that term is used in 10 CFR Part 100 and cases interpreting the application of that
regulation. The Commission issued a SRM in response to SECY-93-127 on July 13, 1993. In this SRM, the Commission
approved a staff recommendation to permit a reduction of primary level coverage to $100 million through the exemption
process after an appropriate spent fuel cooling period and after allowing withdrawal from participation in the secondary
level of financial protection.

<TEXT>
 

In the exercise of its discretionary authority, the Commission may, as long as a potential hazard exists at a permanently
shutdown reactor, require the full amount of primary financial protection and full participation in the industry
retrospective rating plan. At such time that the hazard is determined to no longer exist or to be significantly reduced,
the Commission may reduce the amount of primary financial protection and permit the licensee to withdraw from participation
in the industry retrospective rating plan.

Since the legislative history of the Price-Anderson Act does not explicitly consider the potential hazards that
might exist after termination of operation, the staff generically evaluated the offsite consequences associated
with normal and abnormal operations, design basis accidents, and beyond design basis accidents for reactors that
have been permanently defueled and shut down. The staff concluded that where an appropriate cooling time has elapsed
since plant shutdown, aside from the handling, storage, and transportation of spent fuel and radioactive materials,
no reasonably conceivable potential accident exists that could cause significant offsite damage.

As summarized in SECY-93-127, a severe transportation accident could potentially result in local contamination
requiring cleanup and offsite liabilities resulting from traffic disruption and consequential damages. This type
of accident would warrant maintaining some level of liability insurance. The liabilities an indemnification requirements
associated with the transfer of spent fuel from the licensee to the Department of Energy will be evaluated on a case-by-case
basis at a future time when spent fuel is shipped to a repository.

As further set forth in SECY-93-127, the most significant accident sequence for a permanently defueled
and shutdown reactor involves the complete loss of water from a light water reactor spent fuel pool. This beyond-design-basis
accident sequence could result in a zirconium fuel cladding fire that could propagate through the spent fuel storage
pool and result in significant offsite consequences. The potential consequences of such an accident could involve
billions of dollars. Although such an accident is beyond the design bases, it may be considered ``reasonably conceivable''
and could warrant requiring substantial financial protection. Such an accident is possible during the first year
after reactor shutdown for a low density spent fuel storage configuration and during the first two or three years after
shutdown for spent fuel stored in certain high density configurations.

Accident scenarios involving blockage of coolant channels in conjunction with loss of spent fuel pool water could
hypothetically extend the time within which a zirconium fuel cladding fire could occur. However, in addition to being
less likely than loss of water, air flow to react with the zirconium and to disperse fission products would likely be
inhibited by such blockage. The staff believes that this sequence approaches the strictly hypothetical.

Once the requisite cooling period after reactor shutdown has elapsed, the zirconium fuel cladding fire sequence
after a postulated loss of spent fuel pool water is no longer a concern since the fuel would air cool sufficiently to
avoid zirconium fuel cladding combustion. Possible accident scenarios, after these cooling period have elapsed,
have greatly reduced consequences but could still result in small releases or precautionary evacuations which could
result in offsite liability.

With respect to the Yankee Nuclear Power Station plant-specific evaluation, the NRC staff independently evaluated
the legal and technical justifications for this exemption. In particular, the NRC evaluated the current Yankee status,
that is, the plant is permanently shut down and defueled, the license has been amended to authorize ``possession only,''
the possession only license amendment prohibits fuel movement from the spent fuel pool into the reactor building,
and the fuel is stored in a low density configuration. The staff concludes, after evaluation of the remaining spectrum
of accidents and considering that the stored fuel has decayed for over two years and seven months and is stored in a low
density configuration, that any such accident would result in greatly reduced offsite consequences. Thus, the staff
further concludes that the YNPS meets the criterion established in SECY-93-127 for relief from the full
financial protection requirements.

Although the licensee presented legal views and opinions regarding the applicability of 10 CFR 140.12 versus 10 CFR
140.11(a)(4), the staff did not concur with those legal views and opinions and concludes that the licensee has not
demonstrated the applicability of 10 CFR 140.12 to the YNPS. The staff has also concluded that the Three Mile Island
Unit 2 (TMI-2) claims settlement experience (an accident which did not result in a significant release of radioactivity)
provides a reasonable basis for establishing the appropriate level of primary insurance coverage. Because TMI-2
claims have reached $60 million and a large number of TMI-2 claims are still unsettled, the staff concluded that
a level of $100 million for primary financial protection coverage is warranted. This level of primary insurance coverage
is consistent with the SRM dated July 13, 1993, based on SECY-93-127, for relief from financial protection
requirements.



IV



The staff, based on its independent evaluation, consistent with the Commission July 13, 1993 SRM based on SECY-93-127,
``Financial Protection Required of Licensees of Large Nuclear Power Plants During Decommissioning,'' has concluded
that sufficient bases exist for approval of a partial exemption from the financial protection requirements for the
YNPS. The staff has also concluded that granting the proposed exemption does not increase the probability or consequences
of any accidents or reduce the margin of safety at the facility.



V



Based on the discussion presented in Sections III and IV above, the Commission has determined, that pursuant to 10
CFR 140.8, this exemption is authorized by law and is otherwise in the public interest. Therefore, the Commission
grants an exemption from the requirements of 10 CFR 140.11(a)(4) to the extent that primary financial protection
in the amount of $100 million shall be maintained, and an exemption from participation in the industry retrospective
rating plan (secondary level financial protection) is granted for the YNPS.

Pursuant to 10 CFR 51.32, the Commission has determined that the granting of this exemption will not have a significant
effect on the quality of the human environment (59 FR 31651).

This exemption is effective immediately.

<USDEPT>SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION</USDEPT>






Self-Regulatory Organizations; Filing of Proposed Rule Change by the National Association of Securities Dealers,
Inc. Relating to Clearance and Settlement Requirements for NASD Member Firms That Are Market Makers in the Nasdaq
Stock Market or the OTC Bulletin Board

 

 Service



June 20, 1994.



Pursusant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby
given that on May 23, 1994, the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (``NASD'' or ``Association'') filed
with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'' or ``SEC'') the proposed rule change as described in
Items I, II, and III below, which Items have been prepared by the NASD. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit
comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons.



I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change



Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Act, the NASD hereby files a proposed rule change that deals with clearance and
settlement requirements applicable to NASD member firms functioning as market makers in The Nasdaq Stock Market
(``Nasdaq'') or the OTC Bulletin Board

 

 Service (``OTCBB''). Below is the text of the proposed rule change. (Additions are italicized and deletions are bracketed.)



Scheduled D_Part V: Requirements Applicable to NASDAQ Market Makers



Sec. 7 Clearance and Settlement



(a) A market maker shall clear and settle transaction in 

Nasdaq 

securities [other than securities in SOES] through the facilities of a registered clearing agency [where clearing
facilities are located within 25 miles of the market maker.] 

that uses a continuous net settlement system. This requirement may be satisfied by direct participation, use of direct
clearing services, or by entry into a correspondent clearing arrangement with another member that clears trades
through such an agency.

(b) [Notwithstanding its proximity to a particular clearing facility, a market maker may also clear and settle its
transactions in a security that is not a SOES security through any registered clearing facility using a continuous
net settlement system; enter into a correspondent clearing arrangement with a member that clears through a continuous
net settlement clearing facility; settle transactions ``ex-clearing'' provided both parties to the transaction
agree; or use direct clearing services.] Notwithstanding paragraph (a), transactions in Nasdaq securities may
be settled ``ex-clearing'' provided that both parties to the transaction agree.

(c) No change.



OTC Bulletin Board Service Rules



Section 4. Requirements Applicable to Market Makers



(d) Clearance and Settlement

(1) A market maker shall clear and settle transactions in OTCBB-quoted securities through the facilities of a registered
clearing agency that uses a continuous net settlement system. This requirement applies only to transactions in OTCBB
securities that are clearing eligible.

(2) The foregoing requirement may be satisfied by direct participation, use of direct clearing services, or by entry
into a correspondent clearing arrangement with another member that clears trades through such an agency.

(3) Notwithstanding paragraph (d)(1), transactions in OTCBB-quoted securities may be settled ``ex-clearing''
provided that both parties to the transaction agree.



II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



In its filing with the Commission, the NASD included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed
rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be
examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The NASD has prepared summaries, set forth in Sections (A), (B),
and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.



A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



The purpose of this rule change is to mandate market maker utilization of the facilities of a registered clearing agency
to ensure efficient clearance and settlement of securities transactions. For securities listed on Nasdaq, this
will be accomplished by eliminating the ``25 mile exception''' from Section 7(a) in Part V of Schedule D to the NASD
By-Laws. (Part V articulates the basic requirements applicable to Nasdaq market makers.) Even today, this exception
is quite limited in that it is only available to market makers who are located more than 25 miles from a clearing facility,
limit their Nasdaq market making activity to Nasdaq SmallCap

SM

 securities, and do not participate in the Small Order Execution System (``SOES'').
 With respect to equity securities quoted in the OTCBB, a new requirement is being proposed to mandate market maker
participation in a registered clearing agency for clearance and settlement of transactions in OTCBB securities
that are clearing eligible.
 As a result, parallel requirements will exist for the two largest equity market segments in which NASD members function
as market makers and utilize the Automated Confirmation Transaction Service (``ACT'') for trade reporting and comparison
purposes.








ACT is the primary facility for collecting, processing, and disseminating transaction reports on Nasdaq securities
as well as equity issues quoted in the OTCBB. ACT also facilitates the clearance and settlement of inter-member transactions
by locking-in trade details for transmission to the National Securities Clearing Corporation (``NSCC''). The generation
of locked-in trades by ACT enhances the overall efficiency of the clearance and settlement process and virtually
eliminates a members risk exposure respecting uncompared trades. These benefits cannot be realized, however, unless
the broker-dealers on both sides of the trade have some form of participation in a registered clearing agency.

This rule proposal is believed to be consistent with the provisions of Sections 11A(a)(1), 15A(b)(6), and 17A(a)(1)
of the Act. Section 11A(a)(1) contains the Congressional findings that have guided development of the National Market
System. These findings include a directive to apply state-of-the-art data processing and communications techniques
to achieve more efficient and effective market operations and to ensure the economical execution of securities orders.
Similarly, Section 15A(b)(6) requires, among other things, that the rules of a national securities association
be designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to promote just and equitable principles
of trade, and to foster cooperation and coordination with persons engaged in regulating, clearing, settling, and
processing information with respect to and facilitating transactions in securities. Finally, Section 17A(a)(1)
reflects the statutory goals of a national system for clearance and settlement of securities transactions. These
goals include the application of new data processing and communications techniques to create the opportunity for
more efficient, effective, and safe procedures for clearance and settlement. The NASD believes that this proposed
rule change is fully consistent with these statutory requirements. In sum, the primary objectives of this rule change
are to minimize risk exposure from uncompared trades and foster optimal usage of ACT to lock-in the details of individual
trades prior to their submission to a registered clearing agency.



B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition



The NASD believes that the rule change will not result in any burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate
in furtherance of the purposes of the Act.



C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants,
or Others 



The NASD did not solicit or receive written comments on this rule proposal.



III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action



Within 35 days of the date of publication of this notice in the 

Federal Register

 or within such longer period (i) as the Commission may designate up to 90 days of such date if it finds such longer period
to be appropriate and publishes its reasons for so finding or (ii) as to which the NASD consents, the Commission will:

A. By order approve such proposed rule change, or

B. Institute proceedings to determine whether the proposed rule change should be disapproved.



IV. Solicitation of Comments



Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views, and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying in the Commission's
Public Reference Room. Copies of such filing will also be available for inspection and copying at the principal office
of the NASD. All submissions should refer to file number SR-NASD-94-28 and should be submitted by
July 18, 1994.

<DOCTITLE>Noise Exposure Map Notice; Receipt of Noise Compatibility Program and Request for Review; Dannelly Field, Montgomery,
AL</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Federal Aviation Administration, DOT.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) announces its determination that the noise exposure maps submitted by
Montgomery Airport Authority for Dannelly Field under the provisions of Title I of the Aviation Safety and Noise Abatement
Act of 1979 (Pubic Law 96-193) and 14 CFR Part 150 are in compliance with applicable requirements. The FAA also
announces that it is reviewing a proposed noise compatibility program that was submitted for Dannelly Field under
Part 150 in conjunction with the noise exposure map, and that this program will be approved or disapproved on or before
December 10, 1994.




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

This notice announces that the FAA finds that the noise exposure maps submitted for Dannelly Field are in compliance
with applicable requirements of Part 150, effective June 13, 1994. Further, FAA is reviewing a proposed noise compatibility
program for that airport which will be approved or disapproved on or before December 10, 1994. This notice also announces
the availability of this program for public review and comment.



Under section 103 of Title I of the Aviation Safety and Noise Abatement Act of 1979 (hereinafter referred to as ``the
Act''), an airport operator may submit to the FAA noise exposure maps which meet applicable regulations and which
depict noncompatible land uses as of the date of submission of such maps, a description of projected aircraft operations,
and the ways in which such operations will affect such maps. The Act requires such maps to be developed in consultation
with interested and affected parties in the local community, government agencies, and persons using the airport.


An airport operator who has submitted noise exposure maps that are found by FAA to be in compliance with the requirements
of Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) Part 150, promulgated pursuant to Title I of the Act, may submit a noise compatibility
program for FAA approval which sets forth the measures the operator has taken or proposed for the reduction of existing
noncompatible uses and for the prevention of the introduction of additional noncompatible uses.



Montgomery Airport Authority submitted to the FAA on March 3, 1994, noise exposure maps, descriptions and other documentation
which were produced during the Dannelly Field Part 150 Noise Study dated January 1993. It was requested that the FAA
review this material as the noise exposure maps, as described in section 103(a)(1) of the Act, and that the noise mitigation
measures, to be implemented jointly by the airport and surrounding communities, be approved as a noise compatibility
program under section 104(b) of the Act.

The FAA has completed its review of the noise exposure maps and related descriptions submitted by Montgomery Airport
Authority. The specific maps under consideration are, ``1992 Noise Levels'' and ``1997 Preferred Runway Operations,''
in the submission. The FAA has determined that these maps for Dannelly Field are in compliance with applicable requirements.
This determination is effective on June 13, 1994. FAA's determination on an airport operator's noise exposure maps
is limited to a finding that the maps were developed in accordance with the procedures contained in appendix A of FAR
Part 150. Such determination does not constitute approval of the applicant's data, information or plans, or a commitment
to approve a noise compatibility program or to fund the implementation of that program.



If questions arise concerning the precise relationship of specific properties to noise exposure contours depicted
on a noise exposure map submitted under section 103 of the Act, it should be noted that the FAA is not involved in any way
in determining the relative locations of specific properties with regard to the depicted noise contours, or in interpreting
the noise exposure maps to resolve questions concerning, for example, which properties should be covered by the provisions
of section 107 of the Act. These functions are inseparable from the ultimate land use control and planning responsibilities
of local government. These local responsibilities are not changed in any way under Part 150 or through FAA's review
of noise exposure maps. Therefore, the responsibility for the detailed overlaying of noise exposure contours onto
the map depicting properties on the surface rests exclusively with the airport operator which submitted those maps,
or with those public agencies and planning agencies with which consultation is required under section 103 of the Act.
The FAA has relied on the certification by the airport operator, under  150.21 of FAR Part 150, that the statutorily
required consultation has been accomplished.

The FAA has formally received the noise compatibility program for Dannelly Field, also effective on June 13, 1994.
Preliminary review of the submitted material indicates that it conforms to the requirements for the submittal of
noise compatibility programs, but that further review will be necessary prior to approval or disapproval of the program.
The formal review period, limited by law to a maximum of 180 days, will be completed on or before December 10, 1994.

The FAA's detailed evaluation will be conducted under the provisions of 14 CFR Part 150,  150.33. The primary
considerations in the evaluation process are whether the proposed measures may reduce the level of aviation safety,
create an undue burden on interstate or foreign commerce, or be reasonably consistent with obtaining the goal of reducing
existing noncompatible land uses and preventing the introduction of additional noncompatible land uses.


Interested persons are invited to comment on the proposed program with specific reference to these factors. All comments,
other than those properly addressed to local land use authorities, will be considered by the FAA to the extent practicable.
Copies of the noise exposure maps, the FAA's evaluation of the maps, and the proposed noise compatibility program
are available for examination at the following locations:

Options for Coordinating the Metric Conversion of Traffic Control Signs





<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) DOT.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of agency decision. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

In this notice, the FHWA summarizes the responses to an FHWA notice titled ``Options for Coordinating the Metric Conversion
of Traffic Control Signs,'' and announces the agency's decision to delay implementation of any national metric sign
conversion until after 1996, or until further indication of the intention of Congress on this subject is received.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

On August 31, 1993, the FHWA published a notice in the 

Federal Register

 in which the agency requested comments on the three options it is considering for coordinating an orderly transition
of distance, weight, and speed traffic control sign legends from English to metric units consistent with the Federal
Highway Administration's five-year plan to convert its activities and business operations to the metric system,
as required under the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988. 58 FR 46036. 



Option 1 involved making the conversion over an extended period of time (a maximum of 4 to 7 years) through routine maintenance
replacement. 

Option 2 recommended a quick conversion of all signs over a short period (6 months to 1 year) through a concentrated
effort. 

Option 3 encouraged a two-phase conversion process using dual posting of both metric and English messages for speed,
weight, and distance signs in the first phase (complete by September 30, 1996). The second phase would involve the
removal of all of the English units with metric units remaining. 


All comments were to be received by November 1, 1993. Comments continue to be received sporadically. As of January
12, 1994, the FHWA received 2,736 comments to this docket divided as follows:







Two Congressional responses were received with both opposing any change.

Responses From the General Public



Eighty-six percent of the comments received opposed converting English measurement signs to metric. A majority
of the negative responses stated the funds to convert the signs could be better used for repair of roads and bridges
or for charitable purposes. A number of comments advised that the conversion to metric was unnecessary and discussed
personal objections.

The responses in favor of the metric change were split between Options 2 and 3, with Option 2 receiving about twice the
number of favorable comments as Option 3. In general, those that strongly supported converting to metric favored
``the quicker the better'' Option 2, and many commented that the United States was behind most of the other nations
in adopting the metric system.

Where nearly every negative response mentioned the cost involved with converting and the need to do other things with
that money, almost none of the responses in favor of change mentioned costs. Also, quite a few of the positive responses
stated that a public education program was needed before the change was made.



Responses From Organizations and Other Federal Agencies



These responses included the American Public Works Association, The Department of Commerce, the Institute of Transportation
Engineers, U.S. Metric Association, and several others. There was one negative response with the others mostly favoring
Option 2 (quick change). The U.S. Department of Commerce (the lead Federal agency in the change to metric) recommended
``that metric conversion of highway signs be delayed until after successful completion of FHWA's current conversion
plan.''



Responses From Cities/Counties



Nearly all responses, both positive and negative, identified the need for special funding and a public education
program if the decision is made to change signs to metric units. Most of the negative responses especially emphasized
the cost of this proposal. Several commented that this was another Federal mandate without thought of how it would
be locally financed. Most of the positive responses favored Option 2.



Responses From States



Forty-five States responded. Eight States expressed opposition to the metrication of highway signs and all of the
eight questioned the need to make the change. A ninth State expressed opposition but stated that if the sign legends
must be converted to metric it would recommend a modified Option 2. The remaining 36 States supported the switch to
metric. Most of these expressed support for Option 2 or some combination of two or all three of the Options. One State
recommended implementation of the change using a method different from all of the three Options. Most of the State
responses, both positive and negative, requested special funding and an education/public information program
before implementation. Several States included an estimate of the cost to convert signs on the State highway systems
and also estimated that the conversion costs of the signs on the non-State highway system, because of the much larger
mileage, would cost a great deal more than the State system conversion.



Agency Decision



Subsequent to the August 31, 1993, notice, Congress passed the Department of Transportation and Related Agencies
Appropriations Act of 1994. Public Law 103-122, 107 Stat. 1198. Section 331 of this Act prohibits the use of Department
of Transportation Fiscal Year 1994 funds for implementing metric signing. Currently, there are several proposed
bills in both the Senate and House of Representatives placing future restriction on the changing of highway signs
from the English system to the metric system.

In consideration of the docket responses, the current statutory prohibition, and a possible future Congressional
restriction on using Federal funds for metric signs, the FHWA will not require the implementation of metric sign legends
until at least after 1996. Before any nationally directed conversion to metric highway signs is implemented, the
agency will conduct a strong public education program and will consider other appropriate measures to assure that
such a conversion would be as smooth as possible.






Authority: 

23 U.S.C. 315; 49 CFR 1.48.

Important Notice to Prospective Participants in U.S. Department of Education Contract and Grant Programs



Grants



Applicants for grants from the U.S. Department of Education (ED) have to compete for limited funds.

Deadlines assure all applicants that they will be treated fairly and equally, without last minute haste.

For these reasons, ED must set strict deadlines for grant applications. Prospective applicants can avoid disappointment
if they understand that failure to meet a deadline will mean that an applicant will be rejected without any consideration
whatever.

The rules, including the deadline, for applying for each grant are published, individually, in the 

Federal Register. 

A one-year subscription to the 

Federal Register

 may be obtained by sending $340.00 to: Superintendent of Documents, U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington,
DC 20202-9371. (Send check or money order only, no cash or stamps.)

The instructions in the 

Federal Register

 must be followed exactly. Do not accept any other advice you may receive. No ED employee is authorized to extend any
deadline published in the 

Federal Register

.

Questions regarding submission of applications may be addressed to: U.S. Department of Education, Application
Control Center, Washington, DC 20202-4725.



Contracts



Competitive procurement actions undertaken by ED are governed by the Federal Procurement Regulations and implementing
ED Procurement Regulations.

Generally, prospective competitive procurement actions are synopsized in the Commerce Business Daily (CBD). Prospective
offerors are therein advised of the nature of the procurement and where to apply for copies of the Request for Proposals
(RFP).

Offerors are advised to be guided solely by the contents of the CBD synopsis and the instructions contained in the RFP.
Questions regarding the submission of offers should be addressed to the Contracting Specialist identified on the
face page of the RFP.

Offers are judged in competition with others, and failure to conform with any substantive requirements of the RFP
will result in rejection of the offer without any consideration whatever.

Do not accept any advice you receive that is contrary to instructions contained in either the CBD synopsis or the RFP.
No ED employee is authorized to consider a proposal which is non-responsive to the RFP.

A subscription to the CBD is available for $208.00 per year via second class mailing or $261.00 per year via first class
mailing. Information included in the Federal Acquisition Regulations is contained in Title 48, Code of Federal Regulations,
Chapter 1 ($49.00). The foregoing publication may be obtained by sending your check or money order only, no cash or
stamps, to: Superintendent of Documents, U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, DC 20402-9371.

In an effort to be certain this important information is widely disseminated, this notice is being included in all
ED mail to the public. You may, therefore, receive more than one notice. If you do, we apologize for any annoyance it
may cause you.
