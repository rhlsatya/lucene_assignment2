CONSUMER PRODUCT SAFETY COMMISSION 





Standard for the Flammability of Clothing Textiles; Amendment to Remove Footnotes 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Consumer Product Safety Commission.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Commission is amending the Standard for the Flammability of Clothing Textiles by removing two footnotes which
identify a particular firm as the source for two items of test equipment specified in the standard. The Commission
has learned that the firm named in the footnote is not the only source of the equipment used to determine if fabrics and
garments comply with the clothing textiles flammability standard. For this reason, the Commission has decided to
remove the footnotes.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Standard for the Flammability of Clothing Textiles (16 CFR Part 1610) is applicable to clothing and to textile
fabrics intended for use in clothing. This standard prescribes a test to determine whether clothing and fabrics intended
for use in clothing are dangerously flammable because of ``rapid and intense burning.'' 


A. Origin of the Standard 


The clothing textiles flammability standard was first published by the Department of Commerce in 1953 as a voluntary
commercial standard designated ``Flammability of Clothing Textiles, Commercial Standard (CS) 191-53.''
In the same year, Congress enacted the Flammable Fabrics Act of 1953 (Pub. L. 83-88, 67 Stat. 111). As enacted
in 1953, and amended in 1954, the Flammable Fabrics Act of 1953 prohibits the importation, manufacture for sale, or
the sale in commerce of any article of wearing apparel, or any fabric used or intended for use in wearing apparel, which
is ``so highly flammable as to be dangerous when worn by individuals.'' The Flammable Fabrics Act of 1953 specifies
that the test in CS 191-53 shall be used to determine if a fabric or article of wearing apparel is ``so highly flammable
as to be dangerous when worn by individuals.'' The Flammable Fabrics Act of 1953 placed enforcement authority with
the Federal Trade Commission. 

In 1967, Congress amended the Flammable Fabrics Act to expand its coverage to include products of interior furnishing
and wearing apparel made from fabric or related material, and fabric or related material used or intended for use in
products of interior furnishing and wearing apparel. The 1967 amendment authorized the Secretary of Commerce to
issue flammability standards by rulemaking proceedings. Enforcement responsibility remained with the Federal
Trade Commission. The Flammable Fabrics Act, as amended in 1967, is codified at 15 U.S.C. 1191 through 1204. An uncodified
savings clause in the 1967 amendment continued the flammability standard for clothing textiles mandated by the Flammable
Fabrics Act of 1953 in effect until such time as it is amended or superseded in accordance with the procedures specified
by the 1967 amendment. See section 11 of Pub. L. 90-189, 81 Stat. 568, December 14, 1967. 

In 1972, Congress enacted the Consumer Product Safety Act (CPSA) (15 U.S.C. 2051 

et seq

.), which established the Consumer Product Safety Commission. The CPSA also transferred to the Commission the authority
formerly held by the Secretary of Commerce to issue and amend flammability standards, and the authority formerly
held by the Federal Trade Commission to enforce flammability standards. See 15 U.S.C. 2079(b). 

In 1975, the Commission codified the Flammable Fabrics Act of 1953 at 16 CFR Part 1609, and the Standard for the 
Flammability of Clothing Textiles at 16 CFR Part 1610. See 40 FR 59931 (December 30, 1975). The Commission's codification
of the flammability standard for clothing textiles included all of the footnotes contained in Commercial Standard
191-53, as published by the Department of Commerce. 



B. Firm Named in Footnotes


Section 4.2 of CS 191-53 describes an item of test apparatus called the ``flammability tester'' in the following
language: 



Flammability tester

.3The Flammability Tester 
consists of a draft-proof ventilated chamber 
enclosing a standard ignition medium, sample 
rack, and automatic timing device. 



* * * * * 



3This apparatus is manufactured by the United States Testing Co., 1415 Park Avenue, Hoboken, N.J. Blue prints of working
plans for the manufacture of 
this apparatus are available, at a nominal charge, from the above-named firm.




Section 4.3 of CS 191-53 described an item of equipment called a ``brushing device.'' A footnote to section 4.3
states:




5This device is manufactured by the United States 
Testing Co., 1415 Park Avenue, Hoboken, N.J.




These provisions, including the footnotes, are codified at 16 CFR 1610.4(b) and 1610.4(c)(1). 

The Commission has received information that similar items of equipment are presently available from several sources.
When CS 191-53 was first published, a need may have existed to name a specific firm as the source for particular
items of test equipment specified by the standard. However, because more than one firm now supplies the test equipment,
that need no longer exists.

<DOCNO> FR940628-0-00003 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940628-0-00001 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Additionally, naming a single firm as the manufacturer or supplier of an item of equipment which is available from
other sources may be unfair to those firms not identified in the footnotes. The Commission has considered the possibility
that the footnotes could be revised to include the names of additional firms which make or sell those items of test equipment.
However, that approach could require periodic revision of the standard to assure that the footnote lists all current
sources for the flammability tester and brushing device. Rather than list all sources of those items, the Commission
has decided to amend the Standard for the Flammability of Clothing Textiles by removing footnotes 3 and 5. 



C. Rulemaking Procedures 


Generally, the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553) requires that agencies must give notice of proposed rulemaking
and provide opportunity for interested parties to submit written comments on the proposal before a rule can be issued
or amended. However, 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B) provides that notice of proposed rulemaking and public participation are
not required when the agency makes a finding for good cause that such notice and opportunity for comment are ``impracticable,
unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest.'' 

The Commission finds for good cause that notice of proposed rulemaking and opportunity for written comment are not
necessary for issuance of the amendment to delete footnotes 3 and 5 from the clothing textiles flammability standard
because that amendment does not affect the rights or duties of any person or firm subject to the requirements of the
standard. The amendment does not change the apparatus, procedure, or criteria used to determine if clothing and textiles
intended for use in clothing are dangerously flammable because of rapid and intense burning. The only purpose of the
amendment is to delete footnotes which identify a single firm as the source of two items of equipment used to conduct
the test specified by the standard. 



D. Impact on Small Businesses


Section 603 of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) (5 U.S.C. 603) requires agencies to prepare and make available
for public comment an initial regulatory flexibility analysis of the impact of a proposed rule on small entities,
including small businesses. Section 605(b) of the RFA provides that an agency is not required to prepare a regulatory
flexibility analysis when the agency certifies that the rule will not, if issued, have a significant economic impact
on a substantial number of small entities. In accordance with provisions of section 605(b) of the RFA, the Commission
certifies that the amendments proposed below, if issued on a final basis, will not have a significant economic impact
on a substantial number of small entities. 

As noted above, the amendment does not modify the equipment, test procedure, or pass/fail criteria of the clothing
textiles flammability standard. The amendment will simply remove two footnotes naming one firm as the source for
two items of test equipment. The amendment will not affect the availability of either item of test equipment or increase
or decrease any cost for any firm which manufactures or sells any product subject to the clothing textiles flammability
standard. 



E. Environmental Considerations 



The proposed amendments fall within the categories of Commission actions described at 16 CFR 1021.5(c) that have
little or no potential for affecting the human environment. 
Because the proposed amendments, if issued on a final basis, will not change any aspect of the testing required by the
standard, the proposed action does not have any potential to produce significant environmental effects. For that
reason, neither an environmental assessment nor an environmental impact statement is required. 



List of Subjects in 16 CFR Part 1610

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is amending the food additive regulations to provide for the safe use of siloxanes
(silicones), dimethyl, isopropyl methyl, methyl 1-methyl-C

-alkyl, as a modifier for polyolefin resins to be used as coatings for paper and paperboard. This action responds to
a food additive petition filed by Chugai Boyeki (America) Corp. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 In a notice published in the 

Federal Register

 of July 17, 1990 (55 FR 29105), FDA announced that a petition (FAP 9B4171) had been filed by Chugai Boyeki (America)
Corp. (``Chugai'' was inadvertently misspelled in the filing notice as ``Chaugai''), 500 Fifth Ave., suite 1730,
New York, NY 10110. The petition proposed to amend the food additive regulations to provide for the safe use of the addition
product of (C

-C

50

) alkene and propylene to polymethyl hydrogensiloxane for use as a modifier and as an antifoaming agent for polyolefin
resin coatings for paper and paperboard.
 


 FDA has evaluated the data in the petition and other relevant material and concluded that the proposed use for the additive
in paper and paperboard coatings is safe. However, based upon a complete review of the petition, the agency has determined
that the appropriate technical effect of the additive is primarily as a polymer modifier, that effect is reflected
in the listing regulation. The agency has further determined that the Chemical Abstracts Service nomenclature and
registry number more accurately describe the additive than the description in the notice of filing, and therefore,
the agency has used them in this rule. Under this nomenclature, the additive is denominated ``Siloxanes (silicones),
dimethyl, isopropyl methyl, methyl 1-methyl-C

9

-

49

-alkyl.'' Accordingly, FDA concludes that the food additive regulations should be amended in  176.170 

Components of paper and paperboard in contact with aqueous and fatty foods

 (21 CFR 176.170) as set forth below.
 In accordance with  171.1(h) (21 CFR 171.1(h)), the petition and the documents that FDA considered and relied
upon in reaching its decision to approve the petition are available for inspection at the Center for Food Safety and
Applied Nutrition by appointment with the information contact person listed above. As provided in 21 CFR 171.1(h),
the agency will delete from the documents any materials that are not available for public disclosure before making
the documents available for inspection.
 The agency has carefully considered the potential environmental effects of this action. FDA has concluded that the
action will not have a significant impact on the human environment, and that an environmental impact statement is
not required. The agency's finding of no significant impact and the evidence supporting that finding, contained
in an environmental assessment, may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch (address above) between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m.,
Monday through Friday. 
 Any person who will be adversely affected by this regulation may at any time on or before July 28, 1994, file with the
Dockets Management Branch (address above) written objections thereto. Each objection shall be separately numbered,
and each numbered objection shall specify with particularity the provisions of the regulation to which objection
is made and the grounds for the objection. Each numbered objection on which a hearing is requested shall specifically
so state. Failure to request a hearing for any particular objection shall constitute a waiver of the right to a hearing
on that objection. Each numbered objection for which a hearing is requested shall include a detailed description
and analysis of the specific factual information intended to be presented in support of the objection in the event
that a hearing is held. Failure to include such a description and analysis for any particular objection shall constitute
a waiver of the right to a hearing on the objection. Three copies of all documents shall be submitted and shall be identified
with the docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document. Any objections received in response to the
regulation may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

In a document published in the 

Federal Register

 of February 3, 1981 (46 FR 10462), the animal drug regulations were amended to reflect a change of sponsor for certain
NADA's from Hess & Clark, Division of Rhone-Poulenc, Inc., to Hess & Clark, Inc. This sponsor change necessitated
a new entry in 21 CFR 510.600 for Hess & Clark, Inc. However, the February 3, 1981, final rule codified an incorrect
drug labeler code for the firm. This document corrects that error.

HUD Procedure for the Implementation of Executive Order 11988; 
Technical Amendment to Final Rule 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Office of the Secretary, HUD.

 

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Technical amendment to final rule.

 


</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 HUD is adopting a technical amendment to its final rule containing procedures to implement Executive Order 11988
on floodplain management. The final rule requires that documents used in the conveyance of HUD-acquired properties
in a floodplain must refer to uses restricted under Federal, state or local floodplain regulations and include any
land use restrictions under state or local laws. The final rule also requires purchasers of HUD-acquired properties
containing Critical Actions to notify tenants regarding floodplain hazards and flood insurance. The technical
amendment restricts these requirements to the disposition of multifamily properties. HUD is also correcting an
error in a cross-citation within the final rule.

 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 HUD published 24 CFR part 55 as a final rule on April 21, 1994 (59 FR 19100), with an effective date of May 23, 1994. Part
55 contains procedures implementing Executive Order 11988, Floodplain Management (42 FR 26951, May 25, 1977). 



Section 55.22(a) of the final rule requires that in the disposition (including leasing) of properties acquired by
HUD that are located in a 100-year floodplain (a 500-year floodplain for a Critical Action), the documents used for
the conveyance must: (1) Refer to those uses that are restricted under identified federal, state, or local floodplain
regulations; and (2) include any land use restrictions limiting the use of the property by a grantee or purchaser and
any successors under state or local laws. 

Section 55.22(b) requires that for disposition of properties acquired by HUD that are located in a 500-year floodplain
and contain Critical Actions, HUD shall, as a condition of approval of the disposition, require by covenant or comparable
restriction on the property's use that the property owner and successive owners provide written notification to
each current and prospective tenant, and post an easily visible notice, concerning: (1) The hazards to life and property
for persons who reside or work in a structure in the 500-year floodplain, and (2) the availability of flood insurance
on the contents of their dwelling unit or business. 

The requirements in  55.22(a) were intended to implement Section 3(d) of Executive Order 11988, which applies
to agencies with responsibilities for Federal real property and facilities. However, HUD annually disposes of approximately
65,000 to 70,000 one- to four-family properties acquired as the result of foreclosure or similar means, generally
in connection with a homeowner's default under a mortgage that has been insured by HUD under the National Housing Act.
HUD has determined that application of the requirements in  55.22(a) to the disposition of these one- to four-family
properties would be impractical and unnecessary. Application of the requirement to these properties is impractical
because it would necessitate the research of Federal, state and local restrictions on thousands of properties to
be disposed of within the floodplain each year. These restrictions may be located within building codes, zoning ordinances
or other bodies of law, thus requiring a broad search of various laws and ordinances. The research needed to locate
these provisions for each one- to four-family property would impose an unreasonable burden on HUD resources. In addition,
the requirement is unnecessary, because the Federal, State and local laws and regulations are applicable and enforceable
regardless of whether they are specifically mentioned in conveyance documents. The vast majority of such acquired
properties will already contain an existing residential structure, so that any legal restrictions will generally
apply only to additions to the structure or a change in use; in any case, the owner will generally need to obtain a building
permit or other local government approval for any improvements or additions to the property. 

Accordingly, HUD has determined to amend  55.22(a) to apply these requirements only to the disposition of multifamily
properties. 

The requirements contained in  55.22(b) with regard to notification of tenants in properties containing Critical
Actions (such as hospitals, nursing homes, and other facilities that are likely to contain occupants with mobility
difficulties) are not expected to be applied to one- to four-family properties, since it is unlikely that one- to four-family
properties will contain critical actions. However, to avoid confusion on this issue, HUD is amending  55.22(b)
to clarify that the requirements of that paragraph apply only to the disposition of multifamily properties that contain
Critical Actions. 

Finally, HUD is correcting an inadvertent error in a cross-citation within part 55. Section 55.12(b)(2) refers to
the definition of ``substantial improvement''. The citation to that definition is corrected to refer to  55.2(b)(8)
rather than  55.12(b)(9). 



Other Matters 



The findings and statements made in the preamble to the final rule with respect to Executive Orders 12606, 12612 and
12866 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act are not affected by this technical amendment. The Finding of No Significant
Impact with respect to the environment that has been made with respect to this rule is also unaffected. 



List of Subjects in 24 CFR Part 55

Accordingly, 24 CFR part 55 is amended as follows: 



PART 55_[AMENDED]



1. The authority citation for part 55 continues to read as follows:

2. Section 55.12(b)(2) is amended by deleting `` 55.2(b)(9)'' and adding in its place `` 55.2(b)(8)''.


3. Section 55.22 is amended by revising the section heading to read as set forth below and by adding the word ``multifamily''
immediately before the words ``properties acquired by HUD'' in the introductory text of paragraphs (a) and (b) (1).

Safety Zone; Cape Fear River, Wilmington, NC



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Coast Guard, DOT.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Coast Guard is establishing a permanent safety zone on the Cape Fear River in the vicinity of the Battleship USS
NORTH CAROLINA Memorial in the waterfront area of downtown Wilmington, North Carolina. The safety zone is needed
to protect people, vessels, and property from safety hazards associated with the annual launching of fireworks from
Eagle Island during the 4th of July and Riverfest celebrations.




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 


Drafting Information



The drafters of this regulation are LTJG G. A. Howard, project officer for the Captain of the Port, Wilmington, North
Carolina, and LT M. L. Lombardi, project attorney, Fifth Coast Guard District Legal Office.


Regulatory History




On September 27, 1993, the Coast Guard published a notice of proposed rulemaking in the 

Federal Register

 (58 FR 50303). The Coast Guard received one letter commenting on the proposal. A public hearing was not requested and
one was not held.


Background and Purpose




In years past, the Coast Guard has provided a safety zone on the Cape Fear River in Wilmington, North Carolina, for several
annual events. The fireworks are generally launched during the annual 4th of July celebration, and on the first Saturday
of October each year during the Riverfest celebration. The launching of commercial fireworks constitutes a potential
safety hazard to the people, vessels, and property in the vicinity. This safety zone is needed to protect the public
from the potential hazards near the fireworks display and to insure a smooth launching operation. It will consist
of an area of water 200 yards wide and 667 yards long.


Discussion of Comments



Only one comment was received. The Commentor objected to safety zones in general and did not offer alternatives except
for not enacting a safety zone or reducing the size. Because of the past experiences with fireworks displays, the zone
is needed. Based on those same experiences and the fireworks used in the displays, the size of the zone is the minimum
necessary to protect the public and Coast Guard officers patrolling the zone from unacceptable risks.


Regulatory Evaluation



This rule is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does not require an
assessment of potential cost and benefits under 6(a)(3) of that order. It has been exempted from review by the Office
of Management and Budget under that order. It is not significant under the regulatory policies and procedures of the
Department of Transportation (DOT) (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). The Coast Guard expects the economic impact
of this rule to be so minimal that a full Regulatory Evaluation under paragraph 10e of the regulatory policies and procedures
of DOT is unnecessary.


Small Entities



There were no comments made suggesting any impact to small entities. The Coast Guard certifies under 5 U.S.C. 605(b)
that this rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities.


Environmental Assessment



The Coast Guard has considered the environmental impact of this rule consistent with section 2.B.2.c of Commandant
Instruction M16475.1B (National Environmental Protection Act), and actions to protect the public safety have been
determined to be categorically excluded from further environmental documentation.


Federalism




This action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612,
and it has been determined that this rule will not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant preparation
of a Federalism Assessment.

Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panels: Rules and Regulations


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Copyright Office, Library of Congress.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule and corrections.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

As directed in the Copyright Royalty Tribunal Reform Act of 1993, the Copyright Office of the Library of Congress adopted
the rules and regulations of the Tribunal that were found in 37 CFR chapter III on an interim basis with only technical
changes. It later issued revised rules and regulations. The Office failed to amend one of the existing Copyright Office
regulations and also erred in several sections of the revised interim regulations. The Office is making only technical
changes to correct those errors.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

On December 17, 1993, the President signed into law the Copyright Royalty Tribunal Reform Act of 1993 (Reform Act).
Pub. L. No. 103-198. Effective immediately upon enactment, the Reform Act amended the Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C.,
by eliminating the Copyright Royalty Tribunal and transferring its responsibilities and duties to ad hoc copyright
royalty panels, to be administered by the Library of Congress and the Copyright Office. The copyright royalty panels
will be convened by the Librarian of Congress for limited times for the purpose of adjusting rates and distributing
royalties collected under the compulsory licenses of the Copyright Code. 

See 

17 U.S.C. 111, 115, 118, 119, and Chapter 10.



The Reform Act eliminated the Copyright Royalty Tribunal and directed the Librarian of Congress to adopt immediately
the rules and regulations of the Tribunal in their entirety. We adopted the Tribunal's regulations with certain technical
amendments as interim regulations on December 22, 1993 (58 FR 67690). In one part of these interim regulations we changed
the terms ``Copyright Royalty Tribunal'' and ``Tribunal'' wherever they appeared to ``copyright arbitration royalty
panels and/or Librarian of Congress''. We did not change any references to the Tribunal in our own regulations at that
time.
On May 9, 1994, we issued interim regulations in the 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 23964) amending the interim regulations we had adopted on December 22, 1993. In the amended regulations of May
9, 1994, we made errors in   253.8(e); 255.3(g)(1); 259.1; 259.2, 259.3(d)(e)(f); and 259.4(a)(b)(d).
In the December 22, 1993, amendments, we had changed the designations ``Copyright Royalty Tribunal'' and ``Tribunal''
to ``copyright arbitration royalty panels and/or Librarian of Congress''. We failed to recognize all of these changes
when we revised the interim regulation on May 22, 1994, and inserted ``Copyright Office'' in some sections. However,
instead of amending the existing terms ``copyright arbitration royalty panel and/or Librarian of Congress'' we
made these amendments to the already deleted terms ``Copyright Royalty Tribunal'' and ``Tribunal'' or ``CRT''.
This document will correct the errors found in the May 9, 1994, document.
Also, we did not earlier amend  201.16 (a) and (b)(3)(iii) of our regulations to add ``the former'' in front of
Copyright Royalty Tribunal in  201.16(a) and change ``Copyright Royalty Tribunal'' to ``copyright arbitration
royalty panels and/or Librarian of Congress'' in  201.16(b)(3)(iii). This rule is issued as a final rule for
 201.16 (a) and (b)(3)(iii) and a correction of the document of May 9, 1994.

Approval and Promulgation of State Implementation Plan: Oregon 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is approving the State of Oregon's contingency measure plan as a revision
to Oregon's State Implementation Plan (SIP) for carbon monoxide (CO). EPA's action is based upon a revision request
which was submitted by the state to satisfy a requirement of the Clean Air Act Amendments (CAAA) for Grants Pass, Medford,
Portland, and Klamath Falls, Oregon. 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 


I. Background


States containing CO nonattainment areas with design values of 12.7 ppm or less were required to submit, among other
things, contingency measures to satisfy the provisions under section 172(c)(9). These provisions require contingency
measures to be implemented in the event that an area fails to reach attainment by the applicable attainment date, December
31, 1995. Contingency measures were due by November 15, 1993, as set by EPA under section 172(b) of the Act. 
Contingency measures must be implemented within 12 months after the finding of failure to attain the CO National Ambient
Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). Once triggered they must take effect without further action by the state or EPA, therefore,
all contingency measures must be adopted and enforceable prior to submittal to EPA. 
The CAAA does not specify how many contingency measures are needed or the magnitude of emission reductions they must
provide if an area fails to attain the CO NAAQS. EPA believes that one appropriate choice of contingency measures would
be to provide for the implementation of sufficient vehicle miles traveled (VMT) reductions or emissions reductions
to counteract the effect of one year's growth in VMT while the state revises its SIP to incorporate all of the new requirement
of a serious CO area.



II. This Action 
 

In this action, EPA is approving Oregon's SIP revision submitted to EPA on November 15, 1993 for Grants Pass, Medford,
Portland and Klamath Falls, Oregon because it meets the applicable requirements of the Act.
The State of Oregon held public hearings in Grants Pass, Medford, Portland and Klamath Falls on August 16, 17, and 18,
1993 respectively to entertain public comment on the CO contingency measure SIP revision. Following the public hearing,
the plan was adopted by the Environmental Quality Commission on October 29, 1993, and became effective on November
4, 1993. The Oregon Department of Environmental Quality (ODEQ) submitted the plan to EPA on November 15, 1993 as a proposed
revision to the SIP.
The SIP revision was reviewed by EPA to determine completeness shortly after its submittal, in accordance with the
completeness criteria set out at 40 CFR part 51, appendix V (1991), as amended by 57 FR 42216 (August 26, 1991). The submittal
was found to be complete and a letter dated March 8, 1994 was forwarded to ODEQ's Director indicating the completeness
of the submittal. 


Analysis of State Submission 


Oregon's CO contingency plan requires oxygenates to be supplied at maximum allowable oxygen contents (e.g. 3.5%
ethanol and 2.7% methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE)). A specified minimum average oxygen content level of 2.9% would
be required only if, in subsequent control seasons, the projected control area average oxygen content would be less
than 3.1%. This projection will be based on reported oxygenate mix information submitted by the regulated community.
If any of Oregon's four CO nonattainment areas fail to meet applicable standards by the December 31, 1995 Clean Air
Act (CAA) deadline, or in any subsequent year prior to redesignation to attainment, implementation of the contingency
provision will be formally triggered by written notification to ODEQ from the EPA, or by written notification from
ODEQ to affected fuel suppliers in order to give as much lead time as possible to implement the CO contingency plan for
the 1996-97 CO season. Oxy-fuel suppliers will be provided at least eight months to implement CO contingency
plans from the time notification is received from ODEQ or from EPA, whichever is sooner. ODEQ would expect to notify
suppliers no later than March 1 in order to ensure that oxy-fuel is supplied for the entire winter CO season. EPA is legally
required to make such notification within six months of the end of calendar year 1995. If a standard violation occurs
during 1994, the above implementation time frame could be accelerated by as much as two full years.
After the CO contingency plan is triggered and oxygenates are being supplied at maximum EPA approved levels, ODEQ
will assess seasonal oxygenate mix reports to project whether an average control area oxygen content of 3.1% will
be reached in subsequent control periods. If ODEQ's projection indicates that the oxygen content will be less than
3.1%, a 2.9% mandatory average oxygen content to be achieved by all Control Area Responsible Parties (CARs) and blender
CARs, will be implemented for future control periods. If mandated, a 2.9% oxygen content level could be achieved by:
(a) Using only ethanol as an oxygenate; or (b) through an averaging program using MTBE or other oxygenates and ethanol.
An averaging program would require that at least 25% of the total volume of fuel supplied to a control area be oxygenated
with ethanol to meet an oxygen content of 3.5%. The remaining 75% of total volume could be oxygenated with MTBE or other
oxygenates at a 2.7% level to yield an average oxygen content over the control period of 2.9%.
EPA recently promulgated regulations for reformulated gasoline that control the oxygen content of gasoline under
section 211(c)(1) of the Act in certain ozone nonattainment areas, 59 FR 7716 (February 16, 1994). Since the reformulated
gasoline program would not apply to the gasoline marketed in the Oregon CO nonattainment areas at issue here, EPA does
not believe that Oregon's contingency measures to impose controls on oxygen content beyond those statutorily required
under section 211(m) would be preempted under section 211(c)(4) of the Act.
In addition to the CO contingency plan, the revision contains housekeeping changes to clarify and improve the organization
of the oxy-fuel regulations to minimize misinterpretation. EPA approves of these changes.



III. Administrative Review 


Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 

et seq.

, EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities.
5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial
number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government
entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000.
SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter I, Part D of the CAA do not create any new requirements, but simply approve
requirements that the state is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal SIP-approval does not impose any
new requirements, I certify that it does not have a significant impact on any small entities affected. Moreover, due
to the nature of the Federal-state relationship under the CAA, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis
would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of state action. The CAA forbids EPA to base its
actions concerning SIPs on such grounds.

 v. 

U.SE.P.A.

, 427 U.S. 246, 256-66 (S.Ct. 1976); 42 U.S.C. 7410(a)(2).
Because EPA considers this action noncontroversial and routine, we are approving it without prior proposal. The
action will become effective on August 29, 1994 unless adverse comments are received by July 28, 1994. If the EPA receives
adverse comments, the direct final rule will be withdrawn and all public comments received will be addressed in a subsequent
final rule based on the proposed rule (please see short informational notice published, simultaneously, in the proposal
section of this 

Federal Register

).
Nothing is this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for revision to any SIP. Each request for revision to the SIP shall be considered separately in light of specific technical,
economic and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements.
This action has been classified as a Table 2 action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in
the 

Federal Register

 on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214-2225), as revised by an October 4, 1993 memorandum from Michael H. Shapiro, Acting
Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. A future document will inform the general public of these tables.
On January 6, 1989 the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions (54 FR 2222) from
the requirements of section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for two years. The EPA has submitted a request for a permanent
waiver for Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions. The OMB has agreed to continue the waiver until such time as it rules on EPA's
request. This request continues in effect under Executive Order 12866 which superseded Executive Order 12291 on
September 30, 1993. 
Under section 307(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act, petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed in the United
States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by August 29, 1994. Filing a petition for reconsideration by the
Administrator of this final rule does not affect the finality of this rule for the purposes of judicial review nor does
it extend the time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed and shall not postpone the effectiveness
of such rule or action. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements. (See section
307(b)(2), 42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(2).

Pesticide Tolerances for 1-[(6-Chloro-3-Pyridinyl)Methyl]-N-Nitro-2-Imidazolidinimine

ACTION:

 Final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document establishes time-limited tolerances for residues of the insecticide 1-[(6-chloro-3-pyridinyl)methyl]-

N

-nitro-2-imidzolidinimine and its metabolites (common name ``imidacloprid'') in or on dried hops at 3.0 parts per
million (ppm), milk at 0.05 ppm, and meat, fat, and meat byproducts of cattle, goats, hogs, horses, and sheep at 0.2
ppm, with an expiration date of 1 year after the beginning of the effective date of a final rule based on this proposal.
EPA is issuing this proposal on its own initiative.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 In the 

Federal Register

 of May 16, 1994 (59 FR 25431), EPA issued a proposed rule that on its own initiative and pursuant to section 408(e) of
the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), 21 U.S.C. 346a(e), EPA proposed a time-limited tolerance for residues
of imidacloprid on dried hops at 3.0 parts per million (ppm). EPA recently reclassified dried hops as a raw agricultural
commodity (59 FR 9167; Feb. 25, 1994 and 59 FR 17487; April 13, 1994). EPA is establishing the tolerance because it has
granted a petition for an emergency exemption under section 18 of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide
Act, 7 U.S.C. 136p, for the use of imidacloprid on hops in the States of Washington, Oregon, and Idaho; imidacloprid
is used in other countries that export hops to the United States; and the database for imidacloprid is relatively complete.
The most significant data gap for establishing a permanent tolerance for imidacloprid on dried hops is a third field-residue
trial. Given the relatively low risks presented by imidaclorprid, EPA does not believe that the missing data will
significantly change EPA's risk assessment. Nevertheless, EPA is establishing a 1-year time limitation on this
tolerance for a full residue data base to be available in making a decision on a permanent tolerance. 


There were no comments or requests for referral to an advisory committee received in response to the proposed rule.

The data submitted on the proposal and other relevant material have been evaluated and discussed in the proposed rule.
Based on the data and information considered, the Agency concludes that the time-limited tolerance will protect
the public health. Therefore, the time-limited tolerance is established as set forth below.
Any person adversely affected by this regulation may, within 30 days after publication of this document in the 

Federal Register,

 file written objections and/or request a hearing with the Hearing Clerk, at the address given above (40 CFR 178.20).
A copy of the objections and/or hearing requests filed with the Hearing Clerk should be submitted to the OPP docket
for this rulemaking. The objections submitted must specify the provisions of the regulation deemed objectionable
and the grounds for the objections (40 CFR 178.25). Each objection must be accompanied by the fee prescribed by 40 CFR
180.33(i). If a hearing is requested, the objections must include a statement of the factual issue(s) on which a hearing
is requested, the requestor's contentions on such issues, and a summary of any evidence relied upon by the objector
(40 CFR 178.27). A request for a hearing will be granted if the Administrator determines that the material submitted
shows the following: There is a genuine and substantial issue of fact; there is a reasonable possibility that available
evidence identified by the requestor would, if established, resolve one or more of such issues in favor of the requestor,
taking into account uncontested claims or facts to the contrary; and resolution of the factual issue(s) in the manner
sought by the requestor would be adequate to justify the action requested (40 CFR 178.32).
Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, Oct. 4, 1993), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action is
``significant'' and therefore subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the requirements
of the Executive Order. Under section 3(f), the order defines a ``significant regulatory action'' as an action that
is likely to result in a rule (1) having an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely and materially
affecting a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or
State, local, or tribal governments or communities (also referred to as ``economically significant''); (2) creating
serious inconsistency or otherwise interfering with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially
altering the budgetary impacts of entitlement, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations
of recipients thereof; or (4) raising novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's
priorities, or the principles set forth in this Executive Order. 
Pursuant to the terms of the Executive Order, EPA has determined that this rule is not ``significant'' and is therefore
not subject to OMB review. 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601-612),
the Administrator has determined that regulations establishing new tolerances or raising tolerance levels or establishing
exemptions from tolerance requirements do not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small
entities. A certification statement to this effect was published in the 

Federal Register

 of May 4, 1981 (46 FR 24950).

Barium Sulfate; Toxic Chemical Release Reporting; Community Right-To-Know 



 

<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 EPA is deleting barium sulfate from the category ``barium compounds'' on the list of toxic chemicals for which reporting
is required under section 313 of the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act of 1986 (EPCRA). This action
is based on EPA's conclusion that barium sulfate meets the deletion criteria of EPCRA section 313(d)(3). By promulgating
this rule, EPA is relieving facilities of their obligation to report releases of barium sulfate that occurred during
the 1993 reporting year, and releases that will occur in the future. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 


I. Introduction 


A. Statutory Authority


This action is issued under section 313(d) and (e)(1) of the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act of
1986 (42 U.S.C. 11023). EPCRA is also referred to as Title III of the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act
(SARA) of 1986. 


B. Background


Section 313 of EPCRA requires certain facilities manufacturing, processing, or otherwise using listed toxic chemicals
to report their environmental releases of such chemicals annually. Beginning with the 1991 reporting year, such
facilities also must report pollution prevention and recycling data for such chemicals, pursuant to section 6607
of the Pollution Prevention Act (42 U.S.C. 13106, ``PPA''). Section 313 established an initial list of toxic chemicals
that was comprised of more than 300 chemicals and 20 chemical categories. Section 313(d) authorizes EPA to add chemicals
to or delete chemicals from the list, and sets forth criteria for these actions. Under section 313(e), any person may
petition EPA to add chemicals to or delete chemicals from the list. EPA has added chemicals to and deleted chemicals
from the original statutory list.
EPA issued a statement of petition policy and guidance in the 

Federal Register

 of February 4, 1987 (52 FR 3479), to provide guidance regarding the recommended content and format for petitions.
On May 23, 1991 (56 FR 23703), EPA issued guidance regarding the recommended content of petitions to delete individual
members of the section 313 metal compound categories. 

II. Effective Date 


This action becomes effective immediately. Thus, the last year in which facilities had to report releases of barium
sulfate was 1993, covering releases that occurred in 1992. The effect of this deletion is that, since barium sulfate
will not be on the section 313 list when facilities report in 1994 for releases that occured in 1993, these reports and
all subsequent reports need not include barium sulfate release data. Facilities will therefore not have to collect
release information for any releases of barium sulfate that occur during the 1993 reporting year or for any releases
that occur in the future. 
Section 313(d)(4) provides that ``[a]ny revision [to the section 313 list] made on or after January 1 and before December
1 of any calendar year shall take effect beginning with the next calendar year. Any revision made on or after December
1 and before January 1 shall take effect beginning with the calendar year following the next calendar year.'' The Agency
interprets this delayed effective date provision to apply only to actions that add chemicals to the section 313 list.
For deletions, the Agency may, in its discretion, make such actions immediately effective. An immediate effective
date is authorized, in these circumstances, under 5 U.S.C. section 553(d)(1) since a deletion from the section 313
list relieves a regulatory restriction. 
The Agency believes that the purpose behind the section 313(d)(4) effective date provision is to allow facilities
adequate planning time to incorporate newly added chemicals to their TRI release data collection processes. A facility
would not need additional planning time to not report releases of a given chemical. Thus, a reasonable construction
of section 313(d)(4), given the overall purpose and structure of EPCRA _ to provide the public with information about
chemicals which meet the criteria for inclusion on the section 313 list _ is to apply the delayed effective date requirement
only to additions to the list. Where the Agency has determined, as it has with barium sulfate, that a chemical does not
satisfy the criteria of section 313(d)(2)(A)-(C), no purpose is served by requiring facilities to collect release
data or file release reports for that chemical, or, therefore, by leaving that chemical on the section 313 list for
any additional period of time. Nothing in the legislative history suggests that 313(d)(4) was intended to apply to
deletions as well as additions; indeed, such a construction would be incongruous, since deleted chemicals, by definition,
do not satisfy the criteria for being on the section 313 list and their deletion from that list should not be delayed
in the absence of any compelling reason to the contrary. This construction of section 313(d)(4) is also consistent
with previous rules deleting chemicals from the section 313 list. Indeed, the Agency has not given any of its rules
deleting chemicals from the section 313 list the delayed effective dates specified in section 313(d)(4). 


III. Description of Petition and Rationale for Delisting 


A. Petition and Proposed Action


On September 24, 1991, EPA received a petition from the Chemical Products Corporation (CPC) to delete barium sulfate
(BaSO

4

) from the list of toxic chemicals established under EPCRA section 313. A second petition, submitted by the Dry Color
Manufacturer's Association (DCMA), to delete barium sulfate was received on November 6, 1991. Both petitions are
based on the contention that barium sulfate is not toxic and does not meet any of the statutory criteria under EPCRA
section 313(d)(2). 
Following a review of the petitions, EPA granted the petitions and issued a proposed rule in the 

Federal Register

 of June 11, 1993 (58 FR 32622), to delete barium sulfate from the category ``barium compounds'' on the list of toxic
chemicals under EPCRA section 313. EPA's proposal was based on its conclusion that BaSO

4

 meets the EPCRA section 313(d)(3) criteria for deletion from the list. With respect to deletions, EPCRA section 313(d)(3)
provides that ``[a] chemical may be deleted if the Administrator determines there is not sufficient evidence to establish
any of the criteria described in paragraph [(d)(2)(A)-(C)].'' Specifically, in the proposal EPA preliminarily
concluded that there is not sufficient evidence to establish that BaSO

4

 causes adverse acute human health effects, chronic human health effects, or environmental toxicity. EPA's rationale
is detailed in the proposed rule and is based on the Agency's review of the petitions, as well as other relevant materials.



B. Rationale for Delisting 


After reviewing comments received and other relevant information, EPA has concluded that the assessment set out
in the proposed rule should be affirmed. Therefore, this final rule is based on EPA's conclusion that BaSO

4

 is essentially non-toxic to humans and the environment, and thus meets the EPCRA section 313(d)(3) criterion for
delisting (i.e., it does not meet any of the EPCRA section 313(d)(2) listing criteria). 
In reaching this conclusion, EPA considered the toxicity of the barium ion because another potential source of barium
sulfate toxicity could be from the barium ion. EPA initially analyzed the availability of barium ion. If the ion is
not available, barium sulfate cannot cause toxicity due to barium ion. EPA has concluded that barium ion from barium
sulfate will not be available to humans or the environment in any way that would affect the Agency's decision under
EPCRA section 313(d)(3). This is because barium ion from barium sulfate will occur at significant levels only under
anaerobic conditions in stagnant water bodies that are cut-off from surface and ground waters. As discussed below,
such conditions do not give rise to human health or environmental concerns under the EPCRA section 313(d)(2) criteria.

Because intact BaSO

4

 is acutely toxic only at levels that greatly exceed releases and resultant exposures, BaSO

4

 cannot reasonably be anticipated to cause ``. . .significant adverse acute human health effects at concentration
levels that are reasonably likely to exist beyond facility site boundaries as a result of continuous, or frequently
recurring releases.'' EPA believes that barium ion anaerobically released from barium sulfate into isolated stagnant
water bodies cannot reasonably be anticipated to result in adverse effects on human health because people do not routinely
use these waters as sources of drinking water or food, or for recreation. Under other conditions, barium ion could
not be an issue because it is not available. Thus, EPA has concluded that BaSO

4

 does not meet the toxicity criterion for listing under EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(A). 
EPA has concluded that BaSO

4

 does not meet the toxicity criteria of EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) because BaSO

4

 cannot reasonably be anticipated to cause cancer, developmental toxicity, reproductive toxicity, neurotoxicity,
gene mutations, or chronic toxicity. Intact BaSO

4

 is not known to cause such effects, and for the reasons discussed above barium ion will not be available to cause chronic
human toxicity. 
EPA has concluded that BaSO

4

 does not meet the EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(C) toxicity criteria because of the lack of availability of soluble barium
from barium sulfate. Moreover, ecotoxicity data indicate that barium ion generated in low sulfate, anaerobic environments
cannot reasonably be anticipated to result in adverse effects on the environment of sufficient seriousness to warrant
reporting under EPCRA section 313. 



C. Response to Comments


EPA received 34 comments on the proposed rule, all in support of the deletion of barium sulfate. While all the comments
received were in support of the deletion, a few commenters requested clarification on some points discussed in the
proposed rule. 
Two commenters wanted clarification of the statement regarding the water solubility of barium sulfate and how it
relates to the maximum contaminant level (page 32624, second column, first full paragraph). EPA agrees with the commenters
that, at the water solubility of 2.4 mg/L (2.4 ppm) at 25 
 C, there are 1.4 ppm of barium ion and 1.0 ppm of sulfate ion, and that the 1.4 ppm concentration of barium ion is
below the maximum contaminant level of 2 mg/L (2 ppm) established by EPA under the Safe Drinking Water Act. 
Many commenters requested clarification of EPA's characterization of the regulatory status of barium sulfate under
the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) and the disposal of drilling fluids. Specifically, one commenter
stated that EPA did not clarify that discharges of drilling fluids are in fact exempt from EPCRA as well as RCRA. Another
commenter stated that EPA should clarify the statement in the proposed rule that there are no Federal regulations
prohibiting land disposal of drilling fluids to include the possibility of state regulations. EPA agrees with the
commenters that some clarification is needed on these issues. 40 CFR 261.4(b)(5) exempts from Federal regulation
as hazardous waste drilling fluids and other wastes from the exploration, development, or production of crude oil,
natural gas, or geothermal energy. Therefore, EPA regulations do not prohibit the land disposal of drilling fluids.
This activity, however, may be regulated by state agencies. In addition, the commenter added that underground injection
controls pursuant to the Safe Drinking Water Act and the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System program
under the Clean Water Act also regulate drilling waste. EPA does not agree with the comment that disposal of drilling
fluids is totally exempt from EPCRA reporting. Although the discharge of drilling fluids is not specifically reportable
under EPCRA section 313, the drilling fluids may contain a reportable component and the discharge of that chemical
would require reporting if all applicable criteria are met. 
One commenter wanted clarification of the statements ``Although the TCLP may indicate that barium sulfate is not
a hazardous waste as defined by RCRA. ..'' and later, ``Furthermore, drilling fluids are specifically exempted and
are not considered hazardous wastes under RCRA including those containing barium sulfate, even if the barium sulfate
itself meets the TCLP (40 CFR 261.4)'' (page 32624, column 1, second and third full paragraphs). To clarify, barium
sulfate is not a listed hazardous waste as defined by RCRA. Furthermore, the exemption under 40 CFR 261.4(b)(5) for
barium sulfate in drilling fluids may apply. EPA notes that barium is one of the contaminants tested for in the Toxicity
Characteristics (TC) of 40 CFR 261.24. However, due to its limited water solubility, barium sulfate is not expected
to produce an extractable concentration of barium that exceeds the maximum allowable concentration of soluble barium
(100 mg/L) using the Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure (TCLP) as described in 40 CFR 261.24. Thus, in these
cases, land disposal of barium sulfate is not regulated under RCRA subtitle C. However, EPA reiterates that the TCLP
is not conducted under anaerobic (reducing) conditions and that it is possible for barium sulfate to liberate soluble
barium under such conditions. Thus, even though land disposal of barium sulfate is permissible under RCRA if TC levels
for barium are not exceeded, such disposal may lead to the availability of soluble barium. 
One commenter claimed that throughout the proposal EPA placed too much emphasis on the release of barium ion from barium
sulfate under anaerobic conditions. In addition, the commenter added that it is unlikely that disposal of drilling
fluids as solid wastes would ``encourage perched water and anaerobic digestion of barium sulfate in low sulfate environments.''
In the proposed rule EPA wanted to make clear that although barium sulfate is poorly soluble (i.e., does not significantly
dissociate to barium and sulfate ions) in water, it is still possible for this substance to liberate barium ion in water
as a result of anaerobic degradation. In the proposed rule EPA cited several studies which clearly show that barium
ion concentrations can become elevated as a result of anaerobic degradation of barium sulfate. EPA agrees with the
commenter that it is probably unlikely that discharge of barium sulfate-containing drilling fluids will encourage
the formation of stagnant waterbodies, where anaerobic degradation is likely to occur. In its discussions on the
availability of barium ion from barium sulfate (units IV.D. and E. of the proposed rule) the Agency did not specifically
address discharges of drilling fluids containing barium sulfate. Although EPA cited studies that showed elevated
barium ion concentrations in experiments which used drilling fluids that contained barium sulfate, the main purpose
of these discussions is to illustrate that under certain environmental conditions barium ion can become available
from barium sulfate, regardless of the source of the barium sulfate. 
One commenter stated in the proposal that EPA does not clearly make the distinction that barium is not a heavy metal
(page 32626, column 3, first full paragraph). EPA agrees that barium is not a heavy metal, and it is not EPA's intent
to imply that barium is or can be viewed as a heavy metal. EPA was describing how the solubility of barium sulfate may
be influenced by factors other than sulfate concentration. EPA used references which describe how substances normally
found in the environment (e.g., fulvic and humic acids, bicarbonate, and hydroxyl ions) or soil particle grain size
can enhance the solubility of otherwise poorly soluble metal salts, such as salts of heavy metals. EPA maintains that
the cited studies provide sufficient evidence that the solubility of any metal salt may be significantly affected
by a variety of naturally occurring environmental conditions. The same commenter provided additional information
on the toxicity of barium ion. EPA is considering this information but is not addressing it in this final rule since
it is not relevant to this delisting. In accordance with the May 23, 1991 guidance, this delisting decision is made
on the basis of availability of barium ion and not on barium ion toxicity. If the ion is not available, its inherent toxicity
is irrelevant because it cannot cause adverse effects. Today's action is not intended, and should not be inferred
to affect the status of BaSO

 under any statute or program other than the Toxic Chemical Release Inventory reporting under EPCRA section 313 and
PPA section 6607. 


IV. Rulemaking Record


The record supporting this final rule is contained in the docket number OPPTS-400063A. All documents, including
an index of the docket, are available in the TSCA Document Receipt Office from noon to 4 p.m., Monday through Friday,
excluding legal holidays. The TSCA Document Receipt Office is located at EPA Headquarters, Rm. NE-B607, 401
M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460. 


V. Regulatory Assessment Requirements 


A. Executive Order 12866 


Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action
is ``significant'' and therefore subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the requirements
of the Executive Order. Section 3(f) of the Order defines a ``significant regulatory action'' as an action likely
to lead to a rule (1) Having an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely and materially affecting
a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local,
or tribal governments or communities (also referred to as ``economically significant''); (2) creating serious
inconsistency or otherwise interfering with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially altering
the budgetary impacts of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs; or (4) raising novel legal or policy issues
arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in this Executive Order. 
Pursuant to the terms of this Executive Order, it has been determined that this final rule is not ``significant'' and
therefore not subject to OMB review.


B. Regulatory Flexibility Act


Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, the Agency must conduct a small business analysis to determine whether
a substantial number of small entities would be significantly affected by the final rule. Because this final rule
eliminates an existing requirement, it would result in cost savings to facilities, including small entities. 


C. Paperwork Reduction Act


This final rule does not have any information collection requirements under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction
Act of 1980, 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.

Technical Amendment in Response to Court Decision on Asbestos; Manufacture, Importation, Processing and Distribution
Prohibitions





<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Technical amendment.


 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 EPA is revising the language of the Prohibition of the Manufacture, Importation, Processing, and Distribution in
Commerce of Certain Asbestos-containing Products; Labeling Requirements Rule (also known as the Asbestos Ban and
Phase Out or ABPO Rule) in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) to conform to a court decision that vacated and remanded
part of the ABPO Rule and to an EPA factfinding conducted in accordance with the court's decision. The ABPO Rule prohibited
the manufacture, importation, processing, and distribution in commerce of most asbestos-containing products
in three stages over 7 years beginning in 1990. On October 18, 1991, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth
Circuit (the court) vacated and remanded most of the ABPO Rule. In a subsequent clarification, the court said the rule
continued to govern asbestos-containing products that were not being manufactured, imported, or processed on July
12, 1989. EPA conducted a factfinding and concluded that six asbestos-containing product categories in the ABPO
Rule were not being manufactured, processed, or imported on July 12, 1989, and thus are still subject to the rule. This
document revises the CFR to conform to the findings of EPA in accordance with the court decision, and requires no notice
and public comment. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 In the 

Federal Register

 of July 12, 1989 (54 FR 29460), EPA issued a final rule under section 6 of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA)(15
U.S.C. 2605) that prohibited the manufacture, importation, processing, and distribution in commerce of most asbestos-containing
products in three stages over 7 years (40 CFR 763.160 through 763.179). Stage 1 of the ban went into effect in August
1990. Stages 2 and 3 were scheduled to go into effect in 1993 and 1996 respectively. 


On October 18, 1991, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit vacated and remanded most of the ABPO Rule.


Corrosion Proof Fittings v. EPA

, 947 F.2d 1201 (5th Cir., 1991). In a latter clarification, the court stated that product categories in the ABPO Rule
that were no longer being manufactured, imported, or processed on July 12, 1989, when the ABPO Rule was issued were
still subject to the rule. 

Id

. at 1230. The court left it to EPA to resolve any factual disputes about which product categories in the ABPO Rule were
no longer in commerce on July 12, 1989. 
As a result, in order to determine which product categories in the ABPO Rule were still subject to the rule, EPA published
a document in the 

Federal Register

 of April 2, 1992 (57 FR 11364), that requested information on the commercial status on July 12, 1989, of 14 product categories
in the rule that may no longer have been manufactured, processed, or imported when the rule was published on July 12,
1989. In addition, EPA solicited information on the commercial status of any other product category in the ABPO Rule
that also may no longer have been manufactured, processed, or imported on July 12, 1989. EPA supplemented the original
information in the RIA with the comments received in response to the 

Federal Register

 notice and with additional research. 
EPA published a document in the 

Federal Register

 of November 5, 1993 (58 FR 58964), that announced its findings concerning the regulatory status of the product categories
in the ABPO Rule. EPA concluded that six asbestos-containing product categories were not being manufactured, processed,
or imported on July 12, 1989, and thus are still subject to the rule. The remaining product categories were being manufactured,
processed, or imported on July 12, 1989, and are no longer subject to the rule. 
Accordingly, EPA is issuing this document to revise the language of the ABPO Rule in the CFR to conform to the October
1991 court decision that remanded the rule and to the November 1992 factual findings of EPA, in accordance with the
court decision.

Conferring Designated Port Status on Boston, MA



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Fish and Wildlife Service, Interior.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Fish and Wildlife Service confers designated port status on Boston, Massachusetts pursuant to section 9(f) of
the Endangered Species Act of 1973. The direct importation and exportation of fish and wildlife, including parts
and products, will now be permitted through Boston, Massachusetts. Under this final rule, Boston, Massachusetts
will be added to the list of Customs ports of entry designated for the importation and exportation of wildlife. A public
hearing on this proposal was held on December 8, 1993, in the Massachusetts Port Authority, Maritime Department,
Fish Pier East II, Northern Avenue, Boston, Massachusetts 02210.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Background



Designated ports are the cornerstone of the process by which the Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) regulates the
importation and exportation of wildlife in the United States. With limited exceptions, all fish or wildlife must
be imported and exported through such ports as required by section 9(f) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, 16 U.S.C.
1538(f). The Secretary of the Interior is responsible for designating these ports by regulation, with the approval
of the Secretary of the Treasury after notice and the opportunity for public hearing.

On January 4, 1974, the Service promulgated a final rule designating eight Customs ports of entry for the importation
and exportation of wildlife (39 FR 1158). A ninth port was added on September 1, 1981, when a final rule was published
naming Dallas/Fort Worth, Texas a designated port (46 FR 43834). On March 15, 1990, a final rule was published naming
Portland, Oregon as the tenth designated port of entry (55 FR 9730). An eleventh port was added on May 20, 1992, when
the final rule was published naming Baltimore, Maryland as a designated port (57 FR 21355).

A proposed rule, including a notice of public hearing was published in the 

Federal Register

 of November 12, 1993 (58 FR 59978).



Need for Final Rulemaking



Containerized air and ocean cargo has become the paramount means by which both live wildlife and wildlife products
are transported into and out of the United States. The use of containerized cargo by the airline and shipping industries
has compounded the problems encountered by the Service and by wildlife importers and exporters in the Boston area.
In many instances, foreign suppliers will containerize entire shipments and route them directly to Boston. If, upon
arrival, the shipment contains any wildlife, those items must be shipped under Customs bond to a designated port for
clearance. In most cases, this has involved shipping wildlife products to New York, New York, the nearest designated
port, but reshipment has been both time consuming and expensive. To alleviate this problem, Boston importers and
exporters have attempted to direct entire shipments, even though they contain only a small number of wildlife items,
to a designated port prior to their arrival at Boston. This method of shipment meets the current regulatory requirements
of the Service; however, it is again time consuming and entails additional expense. It is also contrary to the increasing
tendency of foreign suppliers to ship consignments directly to regional ports such as Boston. In addition, time is
a key element when transporting live wildlife and perishable wildlife products. Without designated port status,
business in Boston cannot import and export wildlife products directly, and consequently may be unable to compete
economically with merchants in other international trading centers located in designated ports. With airborne
and maritime shipments into and out of Boston steadily increasing, the Service has concluded that the port should
be designated for wildlife imports and exports. Conferring this status on Boston serves not only the interests of
business in the region, but will also facilitate the mission of the Service in two ways. First, clearance of wildlife
shipments in Boston will relieve inspectors at the port of New York who are now handling cargo for both ports. Second,
it will eliminate the need for the administrative processing of permits by the Regional office that are issued to Boston
area importers who are able to qualify for those permits on the basis of demonstrated economic hardship. Also, Boston's
growth as a major east coast port of entry combined with modernization of shipping routes, make it an essential commercial
link to the New England area.



Results of Public Hearing and Written Comments



Section 9(f) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, 16 U.S.C. 1538(f), requires that the public be given an opportunity
to comment at a hearing prior to the Secretary of the Interior conferring designated port status on any port. Accordingly,
the Service held a public hearing on November 8, 1993, from 9 a.m. to 12 Noon. The hearing was held in the Massachusetts
Port Authority, Maritime Department, Fish Pier East II, Northern Avenue, Boston, Massachusetts 02210. Seven persons
presented oral and/or written testimony at the hearing, representing Maritime Department at the Massachusetts
Port Authority, Advance Brokers, Boston Customs Broker and Freight Forwarders Association, Tower International,
International Cargo Systems, and Liberty International. Most of the witnesses stated that shipping to New York or
another designated port for inspections when small numbers of wildlife items are involved is detrimental to the economic
well being of their clients. They felt that designation would allow their companies and their customers to become
more competitive on both time and cost. The Boston Customs Brokers and Freight Forwarders Association had reviewed
port inspection statistics and felt that the volume of shipments in Boston justifies designated port status as they
are larger than some currently designated ports. International Cargo Systems, is a freight forwarder whose primary
business involves seafood, is anticipating a 30 percent increase in business if Boston becomes a designated port.
Liberty International complained about the application process necessary to obtain a designated port exception
permit. In their opinion, it is so time consuming that many potential importers will not deal in wildlife products
simply to avoid the delays. The witnesses felt that designated port status would increase the numbers of potential
users at the port of Boston.

One additional written comment submitted by MONITOR, on January 10, 1994, was received by the Service during the public
comment period. The commenter opposed the designation of Boston as a port of entry because in the commenter's opinion
the designation of a twelfth port for the importation and exportation of wildlife would spread the staff and finances
of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service even thinner, diminishing the Service's effectiveness in wildlife law enforcement.
The Service believes that this rule will not have a negative impact on other wildlife enforcement efforts nor reduce
the detection of illegal shipments elsewhere by the placement of a wildlife inspector at Boston.

The Service also receives requests for wildlife identification assistance from other Federal Agencies such as U.S.
Customs and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (APHIS) at Boston and Canadian border ports. While many of these locations
are not part of the designated port area, it is important for wildlife inspection services to be available at such major
international facilities when the need arises. This also relieves the burden of Service Special Agents in the Boston
area who must take time from other investigational priorities to address inspection needs. This is particularly
important during the migratory bird hunting season as waterfowl resource protection in the regional flyway is a priority.



Required Determinations



This rule has not been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget under Executive Order 12866. The Department
of the Interior (Department) has determined that this rule will not have a significant economic effect on a substantial
number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq

.). As discussed above, opening Boston as a port of entry will have a slight economic benefit to the Boston area businesses.
This action is not expected to have significant taking implications, as per Executive Order 12630. This rule does
not contain any additional information collection requirements which require approval by the Office of Management
and Budget under the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq

. This action does not contain any federalism impacts as described in Executive Order 12612. These final rule changes
in the regulations in Part 14 are regulatory and enforcement actions which are covered by a categorical exclusion
from National Environmental Policy Act procedures under 516 Department Manual and an Environmental Action Memorandum
is on file at the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service office in Arlington, Virginia. A determination has been made pursuant
to Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act that this revision of Part 14 will not effect federally listed species.

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Closure.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 NMFS is closing the directed fishery for pollock in Statistical Area 63 (between 147




 and 154




 W. long.) in the Gulf of Alaska (GOA). This action is necessary to prevent exceeding the second quarterly allowance
of the total allowable catch (TAC) for pollock in this area.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The groundfish fishery in the GOA exclusive economic zone is managed by the Secretary of Commerce according to the
Fishery Management Plan for Groundfish of the GOA (FMP) prepared by the North Pacific Fishery Management Council
under authority of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act. Fishing by U.S. vessels is governed by regulations
implementing the FMP at 50 CFR parts 620 and 672.


The second quarterly allowance of pollock TAC in Statistical Area 63 is 12,505 metric tons (mt), as established by
the 1994 final specifications (59 FR 7647, February 16, 1994) and modified in accordance with  672.20(a)(2)(iv).
The Director, Alaska Region, NMFS (Regional Director), has determined, in accordance with  672.20(c)(2)(ii),
that the 1994 second quarterly allowance of pollock TAC in Statistical Area 63 soon will be reached. The Regional Director
established a directed fishing allowance of 11,800 mt, and has set aside the remaining 705 mt as bycatch to support
other anticipated groundfish fisheries. The Regional Director has determined that the directed fishing allowance
has been reached. Consequently, directed fishing for pollock in Statistical Area 63 is prohibited, effective from
12 noon, A.l.t., June 22, 1994, until 12 noon, A.l.t., July 1, 1994.
Directed fishing standards for applicable gear types may be found in the regulations at  672.20(g).

Federal Family Education Loan Program 


<AGENCY>

 Department of Education.

 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final regulations.

 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Secretary amends the regulations governing the Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) Program. The FFEL Program
regulations govern the Federal Stafford Loan Program, the Federal Supplemental Loans for Students (Federal SLS)
Program, the Federal PLUS Program, and the Federal Consolidation Loan Program, collectively referred to as the Federal
Family Education Loan Program. The Federal Stafford Loan, the Federal SLS, the Federal PLUS and the Federal Consolidation
Loan programs are hereinafter referred to as the Stafford, SLS, PLUS and Consolidation Loan programs. The final regulations
incorporate statutory changes made to the Higher Education Act of 1965 (HEA) by the Higher Education Amendments of
1992 (the 1992 Amendments), self-implementing provisions of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (OBRA),
and the Higher Education Technical Amendments of 1993 (1993 Technical Amendments). Regulations needed to implement
other OBRA amendments and the 1993 Technical Amendments will be published separately. The final regulations also
reflect various policy initiatives intended to improve program administration.

 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
The Stafford, SLS, and PLUS Loan programs provide loans to eligible student or parent borrowers who might otherwise
be unable to finance the costs of postsecondary education. The Consolidation Loan Program gives borrowers an opportunity
to consolidate loans made under the Stafford loan, Perkins (formerly National Direct Student Loan), Auxiliary Loans
to Assist Students (as in effect before October 17, 1986), PLUS, SLS, Health 
Professions Student Loan (HPSL), and the Higher Education Assistance Loan (HEAL) programs. 



On March 16, 1994, the Secretary published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) for the FFEL program in the 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 12484). Those proposed regulations were developed in compliance with section 492 of the 1992 Amendments (Pub.
L. 102-325), mandating that the regulations be submitted to a negotiated rulemaking process. Regional meetings
were held during September 1992 to obtain public involvement in the development of the proposed regulations and a
negotiated rulemaking process was conducted during January and February 1993. The NPRM published on March 16, 1994
provided an indepth discussion of those areas where the negotiators reached a consensus as reflected in those regulations.


These regulations improve the efficiency of the Federal student aid programs, and, by so doing, improve their capacity
to enhance opportunities for postsecondary education. Encouraging students to graduate from high school and to
pursue high quality postsecondary education are important elements of the National Education Goals. The student
aid programs also enable current and future workers to have the opportunity to acquire both basic and technologically
advanced skills needed for today's and tomorrow's workplace. They provide the financial means for an increasing
number of Americans to receive an education that will prepare them to think critically, communicate effectively,
and solve problems efficiently, as called for in the National Education Goals. 



Substantive Revisions to the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking 



Subpart B_General Provisions 



Section 682.200 Definitions 



 The Secretary has revised the definition of ``disposable income'' to exclude: (1) child support or alimony
payments that are made under a court order or in accordance with a written legally enforceable agreement and (2) the
amounts withheld under wage garnishment. 
 
 The Secretary has revised the definition of ``estimated financial assistance'' to exclude the amount of expected
Federal Perkins loan or Federal Work-study aid if the borrower did not apply for those funds. 
 
 The Secretary has revised the definition of ``repayment period'' as it applies to the SLS Program to reflect
the borrower's option to delay repayment for a period consistent with the grace period in the Stafford Loan Program.


 The Secretary has revised the definition of ``satisfactory repayment arrangement'' to provide that for purposes
of consolidating a defaulted loan, the borrower will be required to make three consecutive reasonable and affordable
full monthly voluntary payments rather than six as provided in the NPRM. The definition has been also revised to specify
that an on-time payment is one received by a guaranty agency or its agent within 15 days of the scheduled due date.

Section 682.204 Maximum Loan Amounts 



 The Secretary has revised the regulations to reflect the changes to the proration of loan amounts made by the
1993 Technical Amendments (Pub. L. 103-208). 



Section 682.207 Due Diligence in Disbursing a Loan 



 The Secretary has revised the regulations to permit lenders to disburse loans proceeds by use of a ``master
check'' for a number of borrowers in addition to an individual check or Electronic Funds Transfer for each borrower.




Subpart D_Administration of the Federal Family Education Loan Programs by a Guaranty Agency 



Section 682.401 Basic Program Agreement 



 The Secretary has revised the regulations to delete the proposed regulations reflecting limitation of lender-of-last-resort
(LLR) services in light of the deletion of these requirements by OBRA (Pub. L. 103-66). 




Section 682.405 Loan Rehabilitation Agreement 



 The Secretary has revised the regulations to allow the guaranty agency to determine if the sale of a loan to a
lender is practicable. 

 The Secretary has revised the regulations to require guaranty agencies to inform borrowers of the consequences
of loan rehabilitation. 



Section 682.409 Mandatory Assignment by Guaranty Agencies of Defaulted Loans to the Secretary





 The Secretary has revised the regulations to require the immediate assignment to the Department of loans held
by a guaranty agency if the Secretary deems it necessary to protect the Federal fiscal interest, which includes ensuring
an orderly transition from the FFEL program to the Federal Direct Student Loan (FDSL) Program and requiring the collection
of unpaid loans owed by Federal employees by Federal salary offset. 



Section 682.414 Records, Reports, and Inspection Requirements for Guaranty Agency Programs 



 The Secretary has revised the regulations to require a lender to maintain a copy of the report of the required
annual independent audit for not less than five years after the report is issued. 



Analysis of Comments and Changes 



In response to the Secretary's invitation in the NPRM, 71 parties submitted comments on the proposed regulations.
An analysis of the comments and the changes in the regulations since publication of the NPRM follows. Substantive
issues and significant technical changes are discussed under the section of the regulations to which they pertain.


Numerous comments were received to the effect that the proposed regulations did not reflect OBRA or the 1993 Technical
Amendments changes and suggested that the Secretary publish a revised notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) indicating
which sections were superseded by subsequent changes in law. Other than those provisions that are self-implementing
and are reflected in this package, the Secretary will issue regulations to implement most substantive provisions
from OBRA and the 1993 Technical Amendments in a separate rulemaking package. 

The Secretary also notes that technical corrections to the regulations governing the FFEL Program were published
in the 

Federal Register

 on May 17, 1994 (59 FR 25750). Some comments made on the NPRM are addressed by those corrections. 



Section 682.100 The Federal Family Education Loan Programs 

Section 682.100(a)(2) 





Comments: 

Several commenters suggested that the regulations be revised to reflect the elimination of the SLS program by OBRA.



Discussion: 

As the commenters noted, OBRA amended the HEA to end the SLS program effective July 1, 1994. However, the Secretary
does not agree with the commenters that references to that program should be removed from these regulations. SLS loans
will remain outstanding for many years after the program ends and the regulations need to reflect the requirements
relating to those loans. However, the Secretary revises the regulations to make reference to the SLS program as in
effect prior to July 1, 1994. 



Changes: 

The regulations have been revised to refer to the SLS Program as in effect prior to July 1, 1994. 



Section 682.100(a)(4) 





Comments: 

Commenters suggested that the Secretary delete the reference to parent PLUS loans made on or after October 17, 1986
because the statutory use of this term was ended by the 1993 Technical Amendments. The commenters also suggested that
the reference to a requirement that a borrower must consolidate at least $7500 in eligible student loans in the Consolidation
Loan Program be deleted to reflect the elimination of this requirement by OBRA. The commenters noted that this change
needs to be reflected in other sections of the regulations. 



Discussion: 

The Secretary agrees that it is appropriate to reflect these statutory changes. The reference to parent PLUS loans
made on or after October 17, 1986 was deleted in the technical corrections package. 



Changes: 

The regulations have been revised to reflect the commenters' recommendations. 



Section 682.102 Obtaining and Repaying a Loan 

Section 682.102(e)(1) 





Comments: 

A commenter suggested that the regulations imply that all FFEL debt is forgiven for borrowers in certain areas of teaching
or nursing professions or community service. 



Discussion: 

The Secretary agrees that the regulations could be interpreted to indicate that the borrower's entire obligation
to repay a debt may be forgiven for borrowers performing certain public service. However, section 428J of the HEA only
authorizes the Secretary to repay limited portions of certain Federal Stafford loan obligations for individuals
who enter certain specified teaching and nursing professions or perform certain other national and community service.
Moreover, the loan forgiveness program is a demonstration program which is not currently funded.

Changes

: The regulations have been revised to reflect the limitation on loan forgiveness for public service. The Secretary
notes that regulations reflecting this loan forgiveness demonstration program are being published separately.



Section 682.200 Definitions 
Co-Maker 




Comments

: A commenter noted that there is an understanding throughout the FFEL industry that the Department is considering
deleting references to ``co-maker'' and replacing that term with the term ``endorser.'' 


Discussion

: The terms ``endorser'' and ``co-maker'' are not synonymous and reflect different legal obligations. The Secretary
will not be deleting the reference to co-maker, since it is a term used in the Consolidation Loan Program. ``Endorser''
is the term used in the Federal PLUS Program for borrowers with adverse credit. 


Changes

: None. 


Disposable Income 




Comments

: Some commenters suggested that in the definition of ``disposable income'' the reference to ``any amounts required
by law to be withheld'' was unclear and recommended further clarification. The commenters noted, for example, that
child support payments would qualify under this definition if the payments were made under a divorce settlement rather
than a court order. The commenters believed that the Department should not treat borrowers who are subject to garnishment
for private debts more favorably than borrowers who are making payments without the need for court intervention.



Discussion

: The Secretary clarifies that the definition of ``disposable income'' is that part of a borrower's compensation
from an employer and other income from any source that remains after the deduction of amounts required by law to be withheld
or any child support or alimony payments that are made under a court order or in accordance with a legally enforceable
written agreement. The Secretary has also revised the definition to exclude payments made under a wage garnishment
order. 


Changes

: The definition of ``disposable income'' has been revised to clarify those payments that may be deducted from the
borrower's compensation. 


Estimated Financial Assistance 




Comments

: Some commenters expressed the same opinion raised during the negotiations that requiring aid officers to certify
the student's estimated eligibility for the Federal Perkins loan or Federal Work-Study program regardless of whether
the student applies for the aid is not reasonable. Some commenters believed that it is unjust to penalize a student
who declines campus-based awards and that it is inappropriate to have the financial aid administrator determine
what is an ``acceptable reason'' for declining aid. 


Discussion

: After further consideration of the commenter's views, the Secretary agrees that financial aid officers should
not be required to certify estimated eligibility for other aid that the student does not apply for or consider as estimated
financial assistance aid offered but declined by the student. The Secretary believes that students and their families
should have discretion in those areas not prescribed by law and that aid administrators should not be placed in the
position of evaluating the merits of a student's reason for declining an award. The Secretary notes that this position
is consistent with Federal Direct Student Loan (FDSL) Program. 


Changes

: The regulations have been revised to delete reference to ``whether or not the student applied'' under paragraph
(1)(vii) and paragraph (2) has been added to delete the reference to the declining aid for an acceptable reason. 


Nonsubsidized Stafford Loan




Comments

: A commenter recommended that the definition be revised to reflect that those loans are not eligible for special allowance
under  682.302. The commenter suggested that confusion exists between the terms ``unsubsidized Stafford
Loan'' and ``nonsubsidized Stafford Loan'' and the revision would clarify the difference. 


Discussion

: The Secretary agrees with the commenter's concern that the regulations need to reflect a clear distinction between
the two programs and has revised the regulations to clarify that a nonsubsidized loan does not qualify for special
allowance payments. 


Changes

: The regulations have been revised to reflect the comment.

Repayment Period 




Comments

: Some commenters stated that they understood that the Secretary had agreed during the negotiated rulemaking process
to permit a 13-year repayment schedule to be established for a borrower who chooses to repay a loan under an income-sensitive
repayment schedule. The commenters also suggested that the definition be revised to incorporate the 10-year repayment
requirement for variable rate interest loans. The commenters suggested that the 10-year repayment period be extended
in the case of an Unsubsidized Stafford Loan. 
The commenters also pointed out that during negotiated rulemaking, the Department agreed that in the case of the PLUS
and SLS loans with a variable rate, the lender could use the rate at the time the loan entered repayment for purposes
of establishing the initial repayment period. 


Discussion

: During the negotiations the Secretary repeatedly made it clear that he had no authority to extend the 10-year repayment
period provided by statute. The Secretary did agree to authorize a three-year forbearance period in the case of an
income-sensitive repayment schedule and agreed to allow forbearance for a period of up to one year in the case of a variable
interest rate loan or graduated repayment schedule. 
The Secretary noted that these extensions have the practical effect of extending the repayment period to eleven or
thirteen years. The Secretary is developing final regulations to the NPRM published on March 24, 1994 that addresses
extending the period of forbearance in cases where the repayment schedule causes the extension of the maximum repayment
term of the loan. 
The Secretary agrees with the commenters that a lender should use the variable interest rate at the time the loan entered
repayment for purposes of establishing the initial repayment period. If the repayment schedule leads to balloon
payments or increased payments, and the borrower is unable to make those payments, the lender may grant forbearance,
which is excluded from the 10-year period. 


Changes

: None. 


Comments

: A few commenters suggested that the Secretary revise the definition of repayment period to include a cross-reference
to  682.209(d), which requires that the calculation of the repayment period on the loans included in a PLUS or
SLS combined repayment schedule be based on the date entered repayment of the most recent included loan. 


Discussion

: The Secretary does not agree that there should be a cross-reference to  682.209(d). The definition of repayment
reflects statutory requirements. The provisions in  682.209(d) govern specific servicing adjustments necessary
in a combined repayment situation and do not modify the basic statutory definition. 


Changes

: None. 


Comments

: Some commenters suggested that the definition of repayment period for SLS be revised to incorporate the borrower's
option to delay repayment for a period consistent with the grace period in the Stafford Loan Program. The commenters
noted that it should be clear that the delay in the repayment of an SLS is not a period of deferment or forbearance and,
as such, special documentation is not required. The commenters also suggested that, since  682.202(c) permits
capitalization during grace periods if provided for in the promissory note (and the addendum and common applications
provided for this capitalization), the Secretary should clarify that the lender may capitalize interest during
this period. 


Discussion

: The Secretary agrees with the commenters. 


Changes

: The Secretary has revised the definition of repayment period to reflect the borrower's option in the SLS program
to delay repayment for a period consistent with the grace period in the Stafford Loan Program. This change is consistent
with the change made in  682.102(e)(3) by the technical corrections. The regulations have also been revised
to clarify that the lender may capitalize interest during this period. 


Satisfactory Repayment Arrangements 




Comments

: While a number of commenters supported a uniform standard for determining ``satisfactory repayment arrangements''
for defaulted borrowers, many commenters objected to the use of the proposed uniform standard for all purposes, including
reinstatement of Title IV eligibility for defaulted borrowers, rehabilitation of defaulted student loans, and
consolidation of defaulted student loans. The commenters believed that use of the proposed standardized definition
to qualify a borrower for rehabilitation and consolidation is not in the FFEL Program's best interest. Although the
commenters supported a standard definition of the term ``satisfactory repayment arrangements'', they did not view
the proposed definition as adequate. Commenters believed that it did not adequately recognize the increase in payments
once the loan has been rehabilitated or consolidated and that it did not provide for more lenient treatment based on
the borrower's individual circumstances. 


Discussion

: The Secretary notes that for purposes of rehabilitation and reinstatement of borrower eligibility, the statutory
language does not provide flexibility in establishing the number of payments to regain eligibility or rehabilitate
a defaulted loan. In regard to Consolidation loans, the 1993 Technical Amendments amended section 428C of the HEA
to refer to ``arrangements satisfactory to the holder.'' The Secretary does not believe that this language was intended
to conflict with the statutory requirement in section 432 of the HEA that common procedures be established or the need
to ensure that similarly situated borrowers be treated fairly. In light of these considerations and the other comments
received on this provision, the Secretary has determined that three consecutive monthly payments will be required
for a borrower to consolidate a defaulted loan. The Secretary believes the making of three consecutive monthly payments
would allow a borrower to initiate loan consolidation and add the defaulted loan to the consolidation loan within
the 180-day provision provided under section 428C(a)(3)(b)(II) of the HEA.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940628-0-00026 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940628-0-00017 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 



Changes:

 The definition has been revised to distinguish the monthly payments required to establish eligibility for rehabilitating,
consolidating or reinstating a defaulted loan. 



Comments:

 Some commenters suggested that defining ``on-time'' to be making a payment within 15 days of the scheduled due date
is a new condition that could not have been anticipated by guarantors, servicers and lenders making good faith efforts
to program their systems to handle loan rehabilitation. Some commenters suggested that ``on-time'' be revised to
mean a payment made within the calendar month. Other commenters suggested that ``on-time'' be revised to be a payment
received by the guaranty agency or its agent within 15 days. The commenters suggested that a guaranty agency is aware
of the date on which payments are received. Using the term ``made'' could be interpreted to mean the date on which the
check was issued by the borrower, or the post-mark date, etc. 



Discussion:

 The Secretary believes that it is critically important for borrowers who have previously defaulted and who are entering
into satisfactory repayment arrangements with a guaranty agency to establish a pattern of monthly payments that
are made timely. For this reason, the Secretary does not agree that an ``on-time'' payment should be one that is made
anytime during the calendar month. The Secretary also notes that the kind of latitude provided by a payment deadline
that is anytime within the calendar month will not be available to the borrower if the loan is rehabilitated subsequently
and is then serviced by a lender or lender servicer. The Secretary also believes there is sufficient time for guaranty
agencies to reprogram their systems prior to the July 1, 1995 effective date of these regulations. The Secretary agrees
with the commenters who suggest that the on-time standard should be based on when payments are ``received'' rather
than ``made'' because a guaranty agency or its agency is aware of this date and the word ``made'' is open to several different
interpretations. 



Changes:

 The definition has been revised to read that an on-time payment is one that is received by the guaranty agency or its
agent within 15 days of the scheduled due date. 



Comments:

 Some commenters suggested that the addition of a definition of ``reasonable and affordable'' would impact the collection
of defaulted loans. The commenters suggested that, based upon the definition provided, each time a guaranty agency
changed the monthly payment amount the agency would have to go through the process of determining what is reasonable
and affordable. The commenters further suggested that a guaranty agency's collection agents or attorneys will also
be subject to conducting the same review whenever they attempt to reach a repayment arrangement. 



Discussion:

 The Secretary believes that this definition will not have an impact on the collection of defaulted loans. This provision
applies to voluntary payments the borrower is making after the borrower specifically initiates voluntary payment
to reinstate eligibility, rehabilitate, or consolidate a defaulted loan. These requirements do not relate to other
routine changes the guaranty agency makes to monthly payment amounts. 



Changes:

 None. 



Comments:

 Commenters suggested that borrowers, whose loans are non-dischargeable and who have not filed a hardship petition,
should be allowed to have their Chapter 12 or 13 plan payments count toward regaining eligibility for FFEL loans. The
commenters suggested that these borrowers are not attempting to have the loan discharged and, as such, are making
voluntary payments. 



Discussion:

 The Secretary does not agree with the commenters. The Secretary believes that if a defaulted loan has been included
in a bankruptcy petition, then payments received under a court mandated bankruptcy plan are not voluntary payments
as required for this purpose. 



Changes:

 None. 



Write-Off 





Comments:

 Some commenters expressed concern that the definition of ``write-off'' was unclear as to which applicable standards
the definition incorporates. Some commenters suggested that the ``applicable standards'' could be easily read
to include the closed school/false certification provision. 



Discussion:

 During negotiations, the Secretary agreed with certain negotiators that a uniform standard for ``write-off'' was
desirable for guaranty agencies to use in determining what constitutes a ``write-off'' in determining whether a
borrower has an adverse credit history. The applicable standards referenced in the definition refers to the Write-off
and Compromise Procedures which the Department of Education is now developing in consultation with the Department
of Treasury, in accordance with the Treasury financial manual and OMB A-129. The Secretary does not consider
a loan that has been discharged under section 437(c) of the Act (language in the preamble incorrectly referred to 437(b))
to be considered a write-off nor does the Secretary intend to require borrowers to reaffirm those loans to receive
additional aid under the FFEL program. 



Changes:

 None.

 A few commenters suggested that the term ``endorser'' as used in the NPRM implies that an endorser on a PLUS loan application
must be the other parent of the student for whom the loan is made. These commenters pointed out that the Secretary has
issued policy guidance for the FFEL Program that would permit a creditworthy nonparent to be an endorser on the Federal
PLUS application of a non-creditworthy parent borrower and that this would be in keeping with the provisions of the
Federal Direct Loan Program. 



Discussion:

 The Secretary does not believe that the term ``endorser'' suggests such a restriction and believes that it is unnecessary
to reflect this guidance in the regulations.

Section 682.201(b)(7) 





Comments:

 Several commenters expressed a concern that lenders be permitted to exercise ``professional judgment'' in determining
whether to make a Federal PLUS loan in spite of an initial finding of adverse credit. They stated that the lender should
have the option of using this ``professional judgment'' to 

document 

the existence of extenuating circumstances. They specifically expressed concern that the NPRM, as written, restricted
valid documentation of extenuating circumstances to a new credit report, a statement from the creditor, or a statement
from the borrower in the event of a debt less than $500. 



Discussion:

 These commenters were addressing two different but related issues in their comments. The first issue addresses lender
flexibility in determining whether to make a loan when the initial credit report includes indicators of adverse credit.
The second issue relates to the documentation needed by a lender when making a determination that extenuating circumstances
exist and determining to make the PLUS loan based on that determination. The NPRM, as written, states in  682.201(b)(7)(iii)
that ``Unless the lender determines that extenuating circumstances existed, the lender must consider each applicant
to have an adverse credit history * * *.'' This provision specifically gives the lender the flexibility
to determine that some cases involve extenuating circumstances that would provide a legitimate criterion for PLUS
loan approval. The NPRM further states that the lender must retain documentation demonstrating its basis for determining
that extenuating circumstances existed and that the documentation 

may 

include an updated credit report, a statement from the creditor that the borrower has made satisfactory arrangements
to repay the debt, or a satisfactory statement from the borrower explaining any delinquencies with outstanding balances
of less than $500. The use of the word ``may'' indicates that there could be other 
documentation that the lender would deem sufficient to override the adverse credit determination. 



Changes:

 The Secretary has amended the language in  682.201(b)(7)(vi) of the regulations to include the phrase ``but
is not limited to'' to the list of documentation to clarify that the list is not all-inclusive. 



Comments:

 Some commenters believed that the definition of adverse credit is too restrictive. The commenters believed that
allowing one account that is 90 days past due to prohibit borrowing when the parent may have ten other accounts that
are current is not a true indication of the borrower's payment history. The commenters recommended that the credit
history have no more than an 

average

 of 30-day delinquency on all debts. 



Discussion:

 The Department views the averaging of past-due accounts to be more burdensome than the 90-day standard proposed in
the regulations. Further, it is unnecessary given the discretion available to a lender to apply the extenuating circumstances
criterion. 



Changes:

 None. 



Comments:

 Several commenters stated that lenders should be given the right to restrict the amount a parent borrows if the parent
does not have the capacity to repay the loan. This is especially significant since Congress removed the cap on PLUS
loans. 



Discussion:

 This issue was discussed in the preamble to the NPRM. While the statute does not include the ability to repay a PLUS loan
as an eligibility criterion, a lender is not prohibited from maintaining a lending policy that would examine parental
ability to repay in determining whether to make a loan. However, once the lender has decided to make a loan, the lender
has no authority to reduce the statutory limit provided under the PLUS program. 



Changes:

 None. 



Comments:

 A few commenters expressed concern about confusion resulting from slightly different wording in Dear Colleague
Letter 93-L-159, dated September 1993, and the NPRM regarding interpretation of the wording in the proposed
regulation that ``* * * the applicant is considered 90 or more days delinquent on the repayment of a
debt.'' The DCL indicated that one criterion for having adverse credit is that the applicant is considered 90 days
or more delinquent on the repayment of a debt ``on the day of the lender's examination of the credit report.'' This was
interpreted by some commenters to mean that the lender must extrapolate delinquency based on the date of the credit
report and the date on which the lender examined that report.

Discussion:

 It was the Secretary's intention in the Dear Colleague Letter that the lender would consider the applicant as being
90 days or more delinquent on the repayment of a debt 

only 

if the applicant was reported 90 days delinquent on the credit report being reviewed. The regulations are consistent
with this approach. 



Changes:

 None. 



Comments:

 Commenters expressed concern that there was no timeframe in the NPRM indicating that the credit bureau report used
in determining adverse credit history must be current and accurate and not outdated. 



Discussion:

 In an attempt to give the lender greater flexibility, the Secretary had not included a reference to a specific timeframe
for the credit report in the regulations. However, in DCL 93-L-159 the Department stated that the credit
report must be secured within a timeframe that would ensure the most accurate, current representation of the borrower's
credit history before the first day of the period of enrollment for which the loan was intended. 



Changes:

 Since the language in the DCL reflects the Secretary's position on the timing of securing the credit report, that language
has been added to the final regulations. 



Comments:

 One commenter indicated that the ``90 days or more delinquent on any debt'' requirement did not make any allowance
for disputed debts with a credit bureau that is still investigating the dispute. This same commenter also found the
term ``default determination'' too vague and undefined. 



Discussion:

 The Secretary believes that the lender's option of applying the extenuating circumstances criterion would permit
the lender, based on its examination of supporting documentation presented by the borrower, to override a determination
of adverse credit in the case of a legitimately disputed debt that was not resolved at the time of the credit report.


The commenter correctly pointed out that while default has been defined for purposes of the FFEL Program, its definition
could vary with regard to other debts. It is specifically for this reason that the Secretary has not attempted to define,
for purposes of these regulations, the term non-Title IV debt. 



Changes:

 None. 



Section 682.201(c) 





Comments:

 Several commenters recommended that the Secretary amend this section to reflect the changes made to the Consolidation
Loan Program by OBRA and 1993 Technical Amendments. The commenters specifically noted that OBRA deleted the requirement
that the borrower must consolidate at least $7,500 in eligible student loans. The commenters also noted that the 1993
Technical Amendments modified the requirement that a defaulted borrower who has made satisfactory repayment arrangements
may be eligible to borrow under the Consolidation Loan Program. 



Discussion:

 The Secretary agrees that these regulations should reflect the self-implementing statutory changes made to the
Consolidation Loan Program. 



Changes:

 The regulations have been revised to incorporate the self-implementing statutory changes. 



Section 682.204 Maximum Loan Amounts 





Comments:

 Many commenters recommended that the annual loan limits be revised to include changes made to the proration requirements
by the 1993 Technical Amendments. 



Discussion:

 The Secretary agrees with the commenters that the regulations should reflect the new proration requirements. 



Changes:

 The regulations have been revised to incorporate the new loan proration requirements. The Secretary has also revised
 682.603(f)(3) to reflect the formula to be used in certifying a Stafford or SLS loan amounts subject to proration.




Comments:

 Some commenters recommended that the regulations should reflect the loan limits for the Unsubsidized Stafford Loan
Program. 



Discussion:

 The Secretary agrees with the commenters. 



Changes:

 Section 682.204 (c), (d) and (e) incorporates the loan limits for the Unsubsidized Stafford Loan Program. 



Section 682.207 Due Diligence in Disbursing a Loan 

Section 682.207(b)(1)(v)(B)(1) 





Comments:

 Some commenters suggested that the regulations be revised to specifically allow for the delivery of a lump sum or master
check from a lender to a school that can be placed in an account of the school, as with electronic funds transfer, and
credited to an individual student's account.

<PARENT> FR940628-0-00017 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 



Discussion:

 The Secretary agrees that the regulations should allow for delivery of loan proceeds by means of a lump sum check. This
change recognizes the acceptance by the Department of the ``master check'' concept as provided in earlier guidance.




Changes:

 The regulations have been revised to permit the disbursement of loan proceeds by ``master check'' for a number of borrowers
in addition to an individual check for each borrower. The definition of ``disbursement'' has also been revised to
include the transfer of loan proceeds by a master check that represents loan amounts for more than one borrower. 



Comments:

 A commenter suggested that the Secretary expand the regulations to provide that a student enrolled in a foreign school
have the option of having the loan proceeds delivered to the student or to the foreign school. The commenter suggested
that the regulations apply to students studying abroad for credit at the home school and appear to exclude students
enrolled in a foreign school who are not studying for credit at the home school. 



Discussion:

 The Secretary agrees with the commenter that the proposed regulations did not provide students attending eligible
foreign schools the option of receiving the loan proceeds directly or having the funds delivered to the school. The
Secretary recognizes that section 428(b)(1)(N) of the HEA specifically provides borrowers in this circumstance
this option. 



Changes:

 Section 682.207(b)(1)(v)(D) has been added to provide the option to borrowers attending an eligible foreign school
but who are not studying for credit at a home school to have their loan proceeds delivered to them directly or sent to
the school. 



Section 682.300 Payments of Interest Benefits on Stafford and Consolidation Loans
 
Section 682.300 (a) 





Comments:

 Several commenters noted that proposed  682.300(a) should be revised to specify that the Secretary pays interest
on 

subsidized

 Stafford loans. 



Discussion:

 The Secretary agrees that this change is necessary to prevent confusion. 



Changes:

 The regulations have been revised to specify ``subsidized Stafford'' loans. 



Section 682.300(c) 





Comments:

 Several commenters suggested that the use of the word ``disbursement'' as it relates to the limitations on interest
paid to a lender prior to disbursement of a loan should be restricted to its more ``traditional'' use, 

i.e.,

 issuing of loan proceeds by the lender, rather than interpreting it to mean ``delivery'' of loan proceeds to the borrower
by the school. 



Discussion:

 As noted in the preamble to the NPRM of March 16, 1994 (59 FR 12489), the Department's interpretation of Congress' use
of the word ``disbursement'' in this context and its applicability to the interest limitation provision were thoroughly
discussed during negotiated rulemaking. However, as a result of discussions with the negotiators, the Department
agreed to proposed regulatory language that would achieve the statutory intent while developing a schedule for lender
billing of interest on the more easily documented disbursement date. The term ``disbursed'' as it is used in  682.300(c)
refers to the traditional use for issuance of funds by the lender. The interest limitation provisions are then applied
depending on whether the loan proceeds are disbursed by the lender before or after the first day of the period of enrollment
for which the loan is intended. 



Changes:

 None. 



Section 682.301 Eligibility of Borrowers for Interest Benefits on Stafford and Consolidation Loans

Section 682.301(a)(3) 





Comments:

 Several commenters noted that  682.301(a)(3), regarding the eligibility of Consolidation loan borrowers
for interest benefits during authorized deferment periods, should be revised to reflect OBRA. 



Discussion:

 OBRA changed section 428C(b)(4)(C)(i) of the HEA to limit interest subsidized deferments to Consolidation loan
borrowers who receive Consolidation loans that discharge only subsidized Stafford loans. This change was effective
for Consolidation loans made based on applications received by the lender on or after August 10, 1993. 



Changes:

 The regulations have been revised to reflect the changes made by OBRA.

Section 682.401 Basic Program Agreement

Section 682.401(b)(4) 
Section 682.401(b)(4)(i)(B) 





Comments: 

Some commenters expressed concern that borrowers not be subjected to unreasonable and onerous demands for documentation
for purposes of reinstatement of borrower eligibility. The commenters suggested that borrowers be allowed to provide
documentation over the phone or by facsimile. 



Discussion: 

The Secretary does not believe that an agency can assess a borrower's total financial circumstances to determine
a reasonable and affordable payment amount without examining documentation from the borrower. The Secretary does
not believe that the documentation requirements contained in the regulations are onerous. The Secretary believes
that submission of a monthly budget statement on a guaranty agency prepared form and some proof of current income are
minimal requirements. The Secretary believes that a statement of the unpaid balance of all of a borrower's FFEL loans
is necessary only if the guaranty agency does not already have this information. The Secretary has no objection to
the borrower submitting this documentation via facsimile technology. 



Changes: 

None. 



Comments: 

Many commenters were strongly opposed to the reference to the $50 payment in proposed  682.401(b)(4)(i)(B)
in regard to the requirement that the guaranty agency document the borrower's file if the borrower's reasonable and
affordable payment is determined to be less than $50. The commenters believe that agencies are using the reference
to $50 to justify their denial of payments of less than $50. 



Discussion: 

The Secretary expects a guaranty agency to make a determination of what constitutes a ``reasonable and affordable''
payment amount on a case-by-case basis after examining financial information from the defaulted borrower who requests
reinstatement of eligibility for federal student financial assistance. The proposed rule clearly stated that $50
may not be the required minimum payment for a borrower if the agency determines that a smaller payment amount is appropriate
based on its examination of the borrower's total financial circumstances. An agency is prohibited from establishing
$50 or any other amount as a required minimum threshold payment amount in lieu of the appropriate reasonable and affordable
payment based on the borrower's total financial these circumstances. The reference to $50 in the regulations is intended
by the Secretary to be a documentation standard for guaranty agencies. A guaranty agency is required to document its
determination of a borrower's reasonable and affordable payment only if the payment is less than $50. 



Changes: 

The regulations have been revised to clearly provide that a guaranty agency must not establish a minimum payment amount
of $50 if the agency determines that a smaller payment amount is reasonable and affordable based on the borrower's
total financial circumstances. 



Comments: 

Some commenters expressed concern that consideration of a spouse's income in the determination of reasonable and
affordable payments may be in violation of the Federal Equal Credit Opportunity Act. The commenters noted that the
spouse is not liable for the other spouse's individual debt and, therefore, consideration of the secondary spouse's
income may not be considered in determining a monthly reasonable and affordable payment. The commenter suggested
that clarification must also be made in this section that disclosure of child support and/or alimony payments is voluntary,
consistent with the Federal Equal Credit Opportunity Act. 



Discussion: 

The Secretary believes that, for a borrower with dependents, examining only the borrower's income and expenses may
not reveal the borrower's true financial circumstances. The Equal Credit Opportunity Act relates to the application
for credit. The determination of reasonable and affordable payments in connection with reinstatement of eligibility,
rehabilitation or meeting conditions for consolidation does not relate to the application for credit. See 12 CFR
Part 202. 



Changes: 

None. 



Section 682.401(b)(6)(i) 





Comments: 

Some commenters supported the regulations that provide a guaranty agency the authority to establish reasonable
criteria for an institution to participate in the guaranty agency's program. However, many other commenters strongly
objected to this provision. The objecting commenters suggested that in  682.401(b)(6)(i), the Secretary
allows a guaranty agency to determine that an institution does not satisfy the standards of administrative capability
and financial stability standards as defined in 34 CFR Part 668 and believed that the Secretary is making the guaranty
agencies enforcers of the set of administrative capability and financial responsibility standards. The commenters
believed that this structure is entirely outside of the statute and clearly ignores the program integrity triad as
mandated under the new Part H (Program Integrity) of the HEA with a particular role for each part of the Triad. The commenters
suggested that if the Triad is to be successful, the responsibilities contained in the statute must be clearly set
forth in regulations with no vagaries concerning responsibility. 
The commenters noted that in the General Provisions NPRM, the Secretary proposed to provisionally certify an institution
that does not currently meet the standards of administrative capability but is expected to meet those standards in
a reasonable period of time. The commenters suggested that under the March 16, 1994 NPRM, a guaranty agency could deny
participation to these institutions, including an institution with a cohort default rate of 20% or greater. The commenters
believed that it is the Secretary's role to ensure that institutions meet appropriate standards of administrative
capability and financial responsibility and believed the Secretary does so by certifying institutions. The commenters
suggested that if the institution has been certified, the guaranty agency should be required to rely on that certification
unless and until the Secretary uses his authority to revoke that certification. The commenters suggested that a guaranty
agency provided this improper delegation of authority may well have an incentive to retaliate against certain institutions
as a result of their filing of appeals of their cohort default rates. The commenters suggested that appeals of cohort
default rates, especially appeals alleging servicing error, may directly or indirectly challenge the integrity
of the guaranty agency and may have the economic effect of removing certain loans from being eligible for federal reinsurance.
The commenters further suggested that because of the clear possibility of conflict of interest, it is irrational
to allow guaranty agencies to effectively terminate the participation of institutions in Title IV programs. The
commenters asserted that in contrast to a State Postsecondary Review Entity (SPRE), an accreditation agency or 
the Department, a guaranty agency is not an impartial adjudicator of these issues.

Discussion: 

The Secretary understands that a guaranty agency is not a member of the Program Integrity Triad authorized under Part
H of the HEA and that the Triad has imposed a new management structure on the oversight of schools participating in the
Title IV student assistance programs. However, the Secretary believes that the statute continues to provide a guaranty
agency with oversight authority for schools applying to or continuing to participate in its guaranteed loan program
and disagrees that the regulations provide an improper delegation beyond the scope of statutory authority. Section
428(b)(1)(V) provides authority for the guaranty agency to require a participation agreement between the agency
and the school as a condition for the agency guaranteeing loans for students attending the school. As part of that process,
the Secretary believes that a guaranty agency must be permitted to establish standards that are consistent with the
standards of administrative capability and financial responsibility contained in 34 CFR 668 for a school's participation
in its guaranteed loan program. The Secretary believes that a guaranty agency should be allowed to protect itself
from schools that abuse the FFEL program. Generally, a guaranty agency must assume that a school that the Secretary
has found to be eligible is eligible. However, because the agency's examination of a school for participation in its
program may take place a significant period of time after the Secretary's examination of the school for certification,
the Secretary understands that the agency may uncover information relevant to the school's administrative capability
and financial responsibility that it wishes the Secretary to consider before signing a participation agreement
with the school. Subject to the Secretary's agreement that such information indicates the school's failure to meet
the standards of administrative capability and financial responsibility contained in 34 CFR 668, the agency may
decline to establish a participation agreement with the school. The Secretary believes this authority provided
to a guaranty agency does not intrude upon the statutory responsibilities of other members of the Triad. The Secretary
also notes that the guaranty agencies have long had responsibility for reviewing schools and have specific statutory
authority in section 428(b)(1)(T)(ii)(I) for limiting, suspending, or terminating a school from the FFEL program.
The Secretary believes that these regulations are consistent with the agency's statutory authority and longstanding
Department policy and regulation. Additionally, the Secretary does not believe that this regulatory authority
would provide an agency with the opportunity to retaliate against a school as a result of a school's appeal of its cohort
default rate. Such an appeal presumes that a school already participates in the agency's program. The statute authorizes
an agency to initiate an emergency action, limitation, suspension or termination (LST) of an eligible institution,
but provides that the action must be undertaken pursuant to criteria, rules, or regulations issued under the student
loan insurance program which are substantially the same as regulations issued by the Secretary. Further, an emergency
action or LST is subject to review by the Secretary. Therefore, the Secretary does not believe that the guaranty agency
can use its authority to retaliate against a school as the commenter suggests. 



Changes: 

The Secretary has revised  682.401(b)(6)(i)(F) of the regulations to clarify that a guaranty agency's determination
that a school does not satisfy the standards of administrative capability and financial responsibility defined
in 34 CFR 668 is subject to the agreement of the Secretary. 



Section 682.401(b)(6)(ii) 





Comments: 

A number of commenters objected to the provision that gives a guaranty agency the authority to limit the total number
of loans or the volume of loans made to students attending a particular school, or to otherwise establish appropriate
limitations on the school's participation in the agency's program where the agency has determined that a school does
not satisfy the financial responsibility and administrative capability standards. The commenters suggested that
this inappropriately places responsibility for evaluating a school's administrative and financial responsibility
in the hands of the guaranty agency. Some commenters objected to applying this provision to schools that are renewing
an application to continue to participate. Some commenters suggested that allowing guaranty agencies to limit the
participation of schools that seek to renew participation gives guaranty agencies an easy way to retaliate against
institutions that appeal their cohort default rates or take other actions that challenge the guaranty agency. 



Discussion: 

Section 428(b)(1)(T) of the HEA authorizes a guaranty agency to limit the total number of loans or the volume of loans
to students attending a particular eligible institution during any academic year. The Secretary notes that there
must be a legitimate basis for the agency to impose such a limitation. The Secretary expects a guaranty agency to maintain
evidence of the school's questionable administrative capability. 




Changes: 

None. 



Section 682.401(b)(6)(iii) 





Comments: 

The commenters suggested that if a guaranty agency limits, suspends, or terminates (LST) the participation of a school
that the Secretary should not extend the LST to all locations of the school until the Department determines that the
guaranty agency in fact followed proper procedures, correctly interpreted the law and regulations, and gave all
due process rights to the institution. 



Discussion: 

Section 428(b)(1)(T)(ii)(I) provides authority to a guaranty agency to limit, suspend, terminate (or take emergency
action against) a school based on the Secretary's regulations or regulations of the guaranty agency that are substantially
the same as regulations issued by the Secretary. The statute further directs the Secretary to apply the limitation,
suspension, or termination proceeding to all locations of those schools unless the Secretary finds, within 30 days
of the guaranty agency's notification to the Secretary of the action, that the action did not comply with the statute
and regulations. To make this finding, the Secretary reviews the guaranty agency's actions under section 428(b)(1)(T)(ii)
of the HEA before extending the LST to all locations. 



Changes: 

None.

Section 682.401(b)(16) 




Comments:

 A few commenters suggested that the regulations be revised to permit assignment of partially disbursed loans if the
lending institution closes or is terminated and the assignment is necessary to be certain that undisbursed funds
are delivered to the student. 


Discussion:

 Section 428G(g) of the HEA allows for sale and transfers only when a loan is fully disbursed unless the sale will not
change the party to whom payments are to be made and the first disbursement has been made. 


Changes:

 None. 


Section 682.401(b)(24) 
Section 682.401(b)(24)(iv) 




Comments:

 A few commenters suggested that the regulations be revised to provide that the guaranty agency provide schools that
request information under this paragraph an appropriate number for borrower inquiries if the assignee of a loan uses
a lender servicer, rather than the number of the lender. The commenters pointed out that many lenders use servicers
to address loan inquiries. The commenters suggested that these lenders do not staff their offices to address borrower
inquiries, or maintain on-line access to borrower information. Inclusion of the assignee's number will flood these
offices with calls, frustrating the intent of providing the borrower with loan information. 


Discussion:

 The Secretary agrees with the commenters. 


Changes:

 The regulations have been revised to include reference to another appropriate number for borrower inquiries if the
assignee uses a lender servicer. 


Section 682.401(b)(25) 




Comments:

 Some commenters suggested that the designation as exceptional servicer or lender is a significant event in the business
of the servicer or lender. The commenters suggested that the parties should be aware of the progress of their application.
Another commenter suggested that the period of time for the guaranty agency to provide the Secretary with any information
regarding an eligible lender or servicer applying for designation for exceptional performance should be increased
to 60 days. 


Discussion:

 The Secretary notes that these comments relate to  682.415 of the regulations included in a Notice of Proposed
Rulemaking published on April 20, 1994. The commenters' concerns will be addressed in that package. 


Changes:

 Section 682.401(b)(25) has been removed. 


Section 682.401(c) 




Comments:

 A number of commenters suggested that the Secretary delete the LLR provisions from the regulations since some of these
provisions have been repealed by OBRA. Other commenters suggested that the regulations should be revised to address
the issues and changes made by OBRA. 


Discussion:

 The Secretary recognizes that OBRA repealed the provisions providing guaranty agencies the authority to deny LLR
services to students attending certain categories of schools and has removed these provisions from the regulations.
In addition, the Secretary has reflected certain other changes made by OBRA in these regulations. 


Changes:

 The regulations have been revised to delete the provisions allowing limitations of LLR services. The Secretary has
also incorporated some changes made by OBRA affecting LLR services. Section 682.401(c) of the regulations has been
revised to incorporate the new requirements that: (1) The guaranty agency must respond to a student within 60 days
after the student submits an original complete application; and (2) prohibit the agency from requiring a borrower
to obtain more than two rejections from eligible lenders. 


Section 682.401(c)(8) 




Comments:

 A commenter suggested that the provision be revised to reflect that during the appeal process, for schools that have
been notified that LLR services will not be provided to the school's students, the guaranty agency must provide LLR
services to students attending the school until the date on which the 

guarantor is notified

 rather than until the date the Secretary rejects the appeal. The commenter noted that the guaranty agency should be
protected for LLR loans made in the brief period between the date that the Secretary rejects the appeal and the date
that the guaranty agency is aware of the rejection and ceases origination activities. The commenter suggested that
the regulations as currently written would appear to cause these ``interim'' loans to be uninsured.

Discussion:

 The Secretary notes that, with the removal of the provisions eliminating LLR services, the school's appeal process
is no longer applicable. Therefore, the Secretary has deleted this provision from the regulations. 


Changes:

 Section 682.401(c)(8) has been deleted. 


Section 682.405 Loan Rehabilitation 




Comments:

 Several commenters suggested that a defaulted borrower be afforded only one opportunity to benefit from an agency's
loan rehabilitation program. The commenters believe that a borrower who defaults again subsequent to rehabilitation
is not likely to be a good candidate for loan rehabilitation. 


Discussion:

 The Secretary points out that pursuant to section 428F(a)(1)(A) of the HEA, a borrower may request to have a defaulted
loan rehabilitated and after the borrower has made 12 consecutive monthly payments, the guaranty agency must, if
practicable, sell the loan to an eligible lender. Once a borrower's loan is rehabilitated, the borrower is no longer
considered to be in default on the loan and regains eligibility for all program benefits. Section 428F(b) of the HEA
allows a borrower with one or more defaulted loans to regain eligibility for Title IV student financial assistance
after the borrower has made six consecutive monthly payments. The Secretary notes that section 428F(b) was amended
by the 1993 Technical Amendments to specifically permit borrowers to receive this benefit only once. However, no
such limitation was placed on the benefits of rehabilitation. In determining whether rehabilitation is practicable,
a guaranty agency should determine whether a borrower who has made 12 consecutive monthly payments is a good candidate
for loan rehabilitation. A borrower's previous experience in the loan rehabilitation program may be a factor considered
by the guaranty agency in making this assessment. 


Changes:

 None. 


Section 682.405(a)(1) 




Comments:

 Some commenters suggested the regulations should be revised to allow guaranty agencies to consider whether the borrower
is a good candidate for loan rehabilitation. The commenters noted that the Dear Colleague Letter (GEN 92-91
dated October 1992) provides that ``In determining whether a sale is practicable, a guaranty agency should determine
whether a borrower * * * is a good candidate for loan rehabilitation.'' The commenters believed that
the guaranty agency should have the discretion to deny borrowers access to its rehabilitation program if it believes
existing circumstances so warrant. The commenters suggested, for example, if there is a judgment against a borrower,
the original terms of the promissory note may have been altered, and the original note may be nonexistent. The commenters
believed that it is overly burdensome, if not illegal, to rehabilitate a loan if a judgment has been issued against
the borrower. 


Discussion:

 The Secretary interprets section 428F of the HEA to require that the rehabilitation program must be available to all
defaulted borrowers even if a guaranty agency has previously been able to secure payment from the borrower only through
involuntary means (e.g., through a court-ordered judgment, Internal Revenue Service tax offset, or wage garnishment).
The Secretary expects guaranty agencies to provide, on an unsolicited basis, information on the loan rehabilitation
program to all defaulted borrowers. However, the Secretary does not expect that payments made on the loan through
involuntary means be counted toward the borrower's required 12 consecutive payments for rehabilitation. The Secretary
believes that the defaulted borrower must initiate a voluntary series of payments for this purpose. The Secretary
understands, however, that even after the required voluntary series of monthly reasonable and affordable payments,
the rehabilitation of the loan through its purchase by a lender may not be possible in all cases. The Department expects
guaranty agencies to work diligently to identify lenders willing to purchase these loans, thereby rehabilitating
them. However, section 428F(a)(2) of the HEA states that the guaranty agency shall sell the loan, 

if practicable

 [emphasis added]. The Secretary believes that the agency has the authority in working with its repurchasing lenders
to determine if some borrowers are not good candidates for loan rehabilitation because they continue to represent
a high risk of default once the loan is purchased. In those instances, the borrower's loan would remain with the guaranty
agency and the borrower would continue to make payments on the loan to the agency.

Changes:

 Section 682.405(a)(1) of the regulations has been revised to allow the agency to determine if the sale of a loan to another
lender is practicable for the purposes of loan rehabilitation. 


Comments:

 Some commenters suggested that a loan should be considered rehabilitated at such point that the borrower has met the
criteria over which the borrower has control, 

i.e.,

 when the twelve payments have been made. The commenters believed that the sale of the loan to an eligible lender is an
unrelated administrative task. 


Discussion:

 The Secretary disagrees with the commenters. The Secretary notes that the loan is still in default as long as it is with
the guaranty agency, even after the required series of payments are made and the borrower is not eligible for all benefits
of the program (e.g., deferment). The Secretary notes that section 428F(a) of the HEA provides that only after the
loan has been repurchased by the lender has it been effectively rehabilitated. 


Changes:

 None. 


Comments:

 Some commenters suggested that the proposed regulations should be clarified to state that the borrower who rehabilitates
a loan regains full eligibility for deferments and forbearances, even if the borrower previously received a deferment.



Discussion:

 The Secretary disagrees with the commenters that the borrower should regain full eligibility for deferments. The
Secretary notes longstanding Department policy that the deferments with which a maximum period is associated apply
to the borrower and not to individual sets of loans and that the borrower will only qualify for the balance of deferment
eligibility. 


Changes:

 Section 682.405(a)(3) of the regulations has been revised to provide that once the loan is rehabilitated, the borrower
regains all benefits of the program, including any remaining deferment eligibility the borrower may have under the
law from the date of the rehabilitation. 


Section 682.405(b)(1) 




Comments:

 Some commenters suggested that the regulations be revised to define ``voluntary payments'' to include payments
made on behalf of the borrower. 


Discussion:

 The Secretary believes that the borrower must make a good faith effort in making the required consecutive monthly
payments to qualify for loan rehabilitation. The Secretary does not believe that payments made by parents or other
individuals on behalf of the borrower for purposes of rehabilitating a defaulted loan constitutes a good faith effort
on the part of the borrower. 


Changes:

 None. 


Comments:

 Some commenters noted that the regulations suggested that a borrower may qualify for loan rehabilitation even if
the guaranty agency has obtained a judgment against the borrower for the defaulted loan. The commenters suggested
that since the original promissory note is surrendered to the court when there is a judgment on the loan, it would become
very difficult to initiate legal proceedings against a rehabilitated borrower who again defaulted on the rehabilitated
loan. 


Discussion:

 The Secretary shares the concerns raised by the commenters. However, the Secretary also believes that a borrower
should not lose the opportunity to rehabilitate a defaulted loan due solely to a judgment. Accordingly, the Secretary
has modified the regulations to require a borrower who wishes to rehabilitate a loan on which a judgment has been entered
to sign a new promissory note prior to the sale of the loan to an eligible lender. This approach is necessary to make sale
of the loan practicable. 


Changes:

 The Secretary has amended  682.405(a) to add a new paragraph (4) to require a borrower against whom the agency
has a judgment to enter into a new promissory note. 


Section 682.405(b)(1)(i)(A) 




Comments:

 Some commenters suggested that the regulations should allow for the inclusion of utilities and work-related expenses
in the listing of necessary expenses for the purpose of determining a reasonable and affordable payment. 


Discussion:

 The Secretary agrees with the commenters. 


Changes:

 The regulations have been revised to include utilities and work-related expenses.

Section 682.405(b)(1)(i)(C)(1) 




Comments:

 Some commenters suggested that the regulations should be revised to clarify that the borrower's financial status
should be determined by reviewing the most current information available, particularly the most recent U.S. income
tax return for documentation of the borrower's current income. 


Discussion:

 The Secretary agrees with the commenters. 


Changes:

 The regulations have been revised to provide that the borrower must provide the most recent U.S. income tax return.



Section 682.405(b)(1)(i)(C)(3) 




Comments:

 A few commenters recommended that the unpaid balances on all FFEL Program loans be considered when determining the
monthly loan amount that is reasonable and affordable, not just defaulted FFEL loans. 


Discussion:

 The Secretary agrees with the commenters. 


Changes:

 Section 682.405(b)(1)(i)(C)(3) of the regulations has been revised to provide that a guaranty agency shall consider
unpaid balances on all FFEL Program loans held by other holders when making a determination of what constitutes a ``reasonable
and affordable'' payment for loan rehabilitation or reinstatement of Title IV eligibility. 


Section 682.405(b)(1)(i)(C)(iv) 




Comments:

 Some commenters suggested that a guaranty agency should not be required to provide the borrower with a 

written

 statement because the borrower may interpret such a statement as a new obligation. The commenters stated that if the
loan is rehabilitated, the lender purchasing the rehabilitated loan will be required to disclose new terms. The commenters
further stated that if the borrower has a written statement from the guaranty agency, but not from the lender, the borrower
may be able to claim that he or she has no legal obligation to abide by the terms established by the rehabilitating lender.



Discussion:

 The Secretary did not intend to require the guaranty agency to disclose new repayment terms on the rehabilitation
loan. The Secretary agrees that it would be more appropriate for the disclosure to be done by the purchasing lender.
Rather, the Secretary merely intended the guaranty agency to provide written confirmation of the agency's determination
of the borrower's reasonable and affordable payment amount, the number of consecutive monthly payments that must
be made to qualify for consideration for loan rehabilitation, any deadlines attached to those payments, and any factors
the agency will consider in determining whether the repurchase of the borrower's loan is practicable. 


Changes:

 Section 682.405(b)(1)(iv) of the regulations has been revised to require the guaranty agency to provide a written
statement confirming the borrower's reasonable and affordable payment amount and other conditions surrounding
the loan rehabilitation. 


Comments:

 Some commenters suggested that the guaranty agencies be required to inform borrowers who enter into a renewed eligibility
plan of the possibility of loan rehabilitation after 12 months. The commenters suggested that by doing so borrowers
can make informed decisions about whether exercising the option after 12 payments is to their advantage. 


Discussion:

 The Secretary agrees with the commenters that a guaranty agency should be required to inform a borrower when entering
into an agreement to reinstate loan eligibility of the possibility of loan rehabilitation after an additional six
monthly payment amounts and the potential consequences of loan rehabilitation. The Secretary believes that a borrower
should be provided sufficient information about the circumstances and potential consequences of loan rehabilitation
to have an understanding of what is expected before making the required 12 monthly payments. Borrowers should be aware
of, for example, that a potential increase in loan payment amounts may be necessary once the loan is repurchased by
the lender if the reasonable and affordable monthly payment amount paid to the guaranty agency will not provide for
the borrower to repay the loan within the 10-year maximum repayment period. The Secretary agrees that providing this
information will place the borrower in a position to make an informed decision of whether or not to exercise his or her
option for loan rehabilitation. 


Changes:

 The regulations have been revised to provide that guaranty agencies must inform borrowers of the consequences of
loan rehabilitation after 12 months. Additionally, a new paragraph has been added as  682.401(b)(4)(iv) to
require guaranty agencies to provide information to defaulted borrowers who made the required series of monthly
payments to reinstate Title IV eligibility of the possibility of loan rehabilitation. 


Section 682.406(a)(14) 




Comments:

 A few commenters recommended that the regulations be revised to reflect the 1993 Technical Amendments change that
provides that the guaranty agencies certify that diligent attempts of skip-tracing have been made by the lender under
 682.411 before receiving reinsurance payments. 


Some commenters suggested that the regulations should indicate that the guaranty agency assures the Secretary that
diligent attempts have been made by the lender and the guaranty agency under  682.411 to locate the borrower
through the use of reasonable skip-tracing techniques. 


Discussion:

 Section 428(c)(2)(G) of the HEA, as changed by the 1993 Technical Amendments, provides that the guaranty agency may
not receive reinsurance payments unless it 

certifies

 that diligent attempts have been made to locate the borrower through the use of reasonable skip-tracing techniques.
As pointed out in the preamble to the proposed regulations, the Secretary believes that it is primarily a lender responsibility
to locate the borrower through the use of skip-tracing techniques. However, the Secretary intends that diligent
attempts must be made by either the lender or the agency to locate the borrower. The language of the regulations is intended
to insure that if the lender does not perform the required skip-tracing, the guaranty agency will be responsible for
doing so.

Section 682.407 




Comments:

 A few commenters pointed out that the language in  682.407(f) incorrectly references ED Form 1189 for adjusting
improperly paid administrative cost allowance payments. 


Discussion:

 The Secretary agrees with the commenters. 


Changes:

 The regulations have been revised to reflect that the adjustment is to be made on the ED Form 1130. 


Section 682.409 Mandatory Assignment by Guaranty Agencies of Defaulted Loans to the Secretary 




Comments:

 One commenter asked if it is the intent of the Secretary to only benefit borrowers who move from the FFEL program to the
Federal Direct Student Loan (FDSL) Program under this provision. 


Discussion:

 Although the Secretary is authorized to require FFEL loans to be assigned to the Secretary to affect an orderly transition
from the FFEL to the Federal Direct Loan Program, one of the primary reasons for loan assignment is that the guaranty
agency has been unable to collect on a defaulted loan it holds and the Secretary believes that the Department can more
effectively collect on the loan. Loans assigned to the Department under the authority specified in section 682.409
are all defaulted FFEL loans held by guaranty agencies. These loans do not include non-defaulted FFEL loans which
a borrower has requested to be consolidated under the Federal Direct Loan Consolidation Program. Until a defaulted
FFEL borrower resolves his default status with the holder of the loan, either the guaranty agency prior to the assignment
or the Department following assignment, the borrower is not eligible for any benefits under the FFEL or Federal Direct
Loan Program. As a result, the Secretary does not believe that the mandatory assignment process benefits particular
defaulted borrowers over others. 


Changes:

 None. 


Comments:

 One commenter asked what guidelines the Secretary would choose to have loans assigned. Specifically, the commenter
was concerned that loan assignment might cause a guaranty agency to experience financial instability. 


Discussion:

 To the extent that the financial stability of a guaranty agency is in the Federal fiscal interest, the Secretary may
choose, on a case-by-case basis, not to require the assignment of loans if the assignment will jeopardize the agency's
financial stability. 


Changes:

 None. 


Comments:

 One commenter requested clarification on how mandatory assignment of FFEL loans relates to an orderly transition
from the FFEL Program to the FDSL Program. 


Discussion:

 As noted by the commenter, section 428(c)(8) of the HEA provides that the Secretary will require an agency to assign
loans if the Federal fiscal interest so requires. In addition, the statute deems the orderly transition to the FDSL
Program to be in the Federal fiscal interest. The proposed regulations did not clearly reflect the Secretary's discretion
in this area. Accordingly, the Secretary has revised the regulations to reflect the Secretary's statutory discretion.
The Secretary believes that the assignment of FFEL loans will not impede the orderly transition to the FDSL Program.
If it appears to the Secretary that the orderly transition to the FDSL Program is either impeded or facilitated by mandatory
assignment, the Secretary will exercise his authority to modify the assignment criteria. 
It is also the view of the Secretary that it is in the Federal fiscal interest for the Federal government to collect defaulted
student loans owed by Federal employees unless the guaranty agency has obtained a judgment against the Federal employee
to collect by wage garnishment 15 percent or more of disposable pay as defined in 34 CFR Part 31. 


Changes:

 The regulations have been changed to reflect the Secretary's discretion. 


Comments:

 One commenter indicated support for the criteria for performance standards established in this section for mandatory
assignment of certain loans to the Secretary by a guaranty agency. The commenter said the language in this section
represents the efforts of the community and the Secretary's staff in developing an equitable criteria for the assignment
of loans and that the criteria outlined in this section best protect the Federal fiscal interest.

Discussion:

 The Secretary agrees with the commenter. 


Changes:

 None. 


Comments:

 Two commenters asked if this section should be revised to exclude those agencies that are determined to qualify for
Exceptional Performer status. 


Discussion:

 Designation as an Exceptional Performer means that a guaranty agency has shown a high level of compliance with the
provisions of 34 CFR 682.410. That section of the regulations focuses on the default collection process, not the results
of the process. Section 682.409 establishes standards that focus on outcomes as expressed in fiscal year loan type
recovery rates. The Secretary believes that the collection of defaulted FFEL loans is important and should be governed
by both process and outcome requirements. The Secretary does not believe that excusing guaranty agencies from complying
with outcome requirements because they have complied (even to a high degree) with process requirements would adequately
protect the Federal fiscal interest. 


Changes:

 None. 


Comments:

 A commenter asked if these provisions would force guaranty agencies to evaluate their entire preclaim and default
collection operations, in order to achieve the highest recovery rate. 


Discussion:

 The Secretary agrees that guaranty agencies need to evaluate their default prevention and default collection operations.
These regulations represent the initial attempt by the Secretary, in consultation with the guaranty agencies, to
establish default collection performance standards. The Secretary believes that it is in the Department's and the
guaranty agencies' best interest to establish default prevention performance standards as soon as practicable.



Changes:

 None. 


Comments:

 A commenter observed that guaranty agencies will be required to monitor their operations constantly, indicating
that it will be more difficult for an agency to continue producing recoveries over the 80 percent standard required
by the regulations. The commenter noted that once the Secretary imposes additional assignment requirements on agencies
that fall below the 80 percent standard, this provision will automatically increase the average recovery rate on
which the 80 percent is based. 


Discussion:

 The Secretary agrees that guaranty agencies will have to constantly monitor their operations to satisfy these standards.
The Secretary also expects that the assignment process based on recovery rate standards will result in the gradual,
steady increase in the average recovery rate. 


Changes:

 None. 


Comments:

 A commenter observed that this section does not require the Department to load and begin collection on defaulted loans
assigned to it within a specified time period. Collection activity could cease for months while an account is being
processed. The commenter noted that it is in the Department's best interest to ensure that this gap in collection activities
is 
minimized by providing specific time periods to begin the collection of new accounts. 


Discussion:

 The Secretary agrees that it is desirable to load assigned accounts quickly so that gaps in collection activity are
minimized. While these regulations do not control this process, the Secretary intends to loan assigned accounts
as quickly as possible. 


Changes:

 None. 


Section 682.409(a)(2)(i) 




Comments:

 A commenter observed that participation in the IRS offset program is required by the Department and recommended that
offset collections be included in calculating the recovery rate standards. The commenter believed that this will
help assure guarantor participation in the IRS offset program to the maximum extent possible. 


Discussion:

 The Secretary agrees with the commenter. However, the Secretary notes that the regulations do not reflect the requirement
that guaranty agencies participate in the Federal Income Tax Refund Offset program. The Secretary has modified the
regulations to reflect this requirement. 


Changes:

 Section 682.409(a)(2)(i) has been revised to reference collections by Federal Income Tax Refund Offset. 


Section 682.409(a)(3)(i)(B) 




Comments:

 A few commenters suggested that the Secretary amend the appeals process for failure to meet performance standards.
They asked that the Secretary either permit agencies that have a large number of borrowers making ``reasonable and
affordable'' payments as a result of the borrowers' financial circumstances to appeal on that basis or that these
loans be excluded entirely from the calculation. 


Discussion:

 The Secretary agrees with the commenters that the regulations should be revised to encourage compliance with the
provisions in  682.401(b)(4) and  682.405 requiring guaranty agencies to provide certain borrowers
with ``reasonable and affordable'' payment plans. However, the Secretary believes that excluding loans with ``reasonable
and affordable'' payment plans from the calculation would place an unnecessary reporting burden on the guaranty
agencies, as well as increase the costs that would be incurred by the Department associated with collecting and auditing
the data. The Department will provide a guaranty agency with the opportunity to demonstrate how ``reasonable and
affordable'' payment arrangements have affected its recovery rate. The Department will make a determination on
an acceptable agency recovery rate on an agency-by-agency basis. The agency will be required to identify all borrower
accounts for which required reasonable and affordable payment amounts have impacted the agency's collection recovery
rate. The Department will examine a sample of these accounts to determine how this should be assessed in determining
the agency's recovery rate. 


Changes:

 The Secretary has revised  682.409(a)(3)(i)(B) to provide that the Federal interest will be served if the agency
demonstrates that its compliance with  682.401(b)(4) and  682.405 has reduced substantially its fiscal
year loan type recovery rate or rates. 


Section 682.409(a)(3)(i)(C)(2) 




Comments:

 A commenter suggested that as the paragraph is not describing a mathematical derivation, the word ``categorized''
is more appropriate. 


Discussion:

 The Secretary agrees with the commenter. 


Changes:

 Section 682.409(a)(3)(i)(C)(2) has been revised to replace ``divided'' with ``categorized.'' 


Section 682.409(c)(1) 




Comments:

 A few commenters asked if  682.409(c)(1) needs to specify the manner, information, and documentation necessary
for mandatory assignment. 


Discussion:

 The Secretary considered expanding  682.409(c)(1) to incorporate the manual assignment and computer tape
assignment procedures that are transmitted to the guaranty agencies each year by mail. However, the Secretary believes
that this informal notification process has worked particularly well over the last two years, in part because it has
been accomplished without the burden presented by the regulatory process. He believes that the current procedures
have provided for a flexible process that has been responsive to changing guaranty agency and Departmental needs.
Therefore, the Secretary has decided not to expand these regulations to include operational procedures associated
with mandatory assignment.

Section 682.410 Fiscal, Administrative, and Enforcement Requirements 
Section 682.410 General 




Comments:

 A few commenters noted that on-going negotiated rulemaking sessions are addressing matters covered in this section
of the regulations. The commenters suggested that it would be inappropriate for final rules to be issued in light of
the negotiations underway. Commenters recommended that the Department should propose regulations for issues related
to this section later through an NPRM and final rules process devoted solely to these issues. 


Discussion:

 The Secretary notes that these regulations are directly related to the 1992 Amendments and were developed under the
negotiated rulemaking sessions required by the 1992 Amendments. The provisions of the 1992 Amendments that were
not changed by OBRA are reflected in these final regulations. The Secretary intends to propose rules to implement
the provisions of OBRA related to guaranty agency reserves soon after the conclusion of current negotiated rulemaking
sessions on this subject. In addition, the Secretary intends to have final regulations implementing both the 1992
Amendments and OBRA go into effect at the same time on July 1, 1995. 


Changes:

 None. 


Section 682.410(a)(1)(vii) 




Comments:

 Commenters recommended that funds collected by the guaranty agency, included under  682.410(a)(1)(vii)
as reserve fund assets, should include only funds collected on FFELP loans held by that agency or FFELP loans for which
the agency paid a claim. 


Discussion:

 The Secretary agrees that clarification is necessary. 


Changes:

 The final regulations have been revised to clarify that only funds collected on FFELP loans on which a claim has been
paid are included in  682.410(a)(1)(vii). 


Section 682.410(a)(3) 




Comments:

 Commenters objected to  682.410(a)(3), Special rule for use of certain reserve fund assets, as redundant and
confusing. 


Discussion:

 The Secretary agrees that  682.410(a)(3) is unnecessary. 


Changes:

 The language in  682.410(a)(3) has been simplified and merged into  682.410(a)(2). 


Section 682.410(a)(6) 




Comments:

 A commenter urged that the Secretary consider provisions for further review and due process in connection with the
requirements of  682.410(a)(6), minimum reserve fund level. 


Discussion:

 Section 682.410(a)(6) simply states the statutory requirements for minimum reserve levels. This paragraph specifies
no action by the Department requiring review or due process. 


Changes:

 None. 


Section 682.410(a)(7) 




Comments:

 A commenter suggested that the calculation of the guaranty agency ``Reserve fund level'' include receivables from
ED and exclude payables to ED. The commenter argued that acknowledgment of those amounts is essential for an accurate
determination of a guarantor's financial status. 


Discussion:

 The Secretary is interested in determining the amount of assets in a guaranty agency's reserve fund at a point in time.
The Secretary acknowledges that the reserve fund level as defined in this paragraph does not accurately reflect the
overall financial condition of the guaranty agency. However, the Secretary also believes that including receivables
from ED and deducting payables to ED would also not result in an accurate calculation of the agency's financial condition
since agencies have receivables from and payables to parties other than ED. The Secretary agrees that if an agency's
reserve fund level, calculated in accordance with this section, is less than the minimum specified in  682.410(a)(6),
the guaranty agency will be provided with the opportunity to submit information concerning its accounts payable
and accounts receivable in extenuation of its reserve level. 


Changes:

 None. 


Section 682.410(a)(8)(ii)(B) 




Comments:

 A commenter recommended removing loan guarantees transferred to another agency pursuant to a plan of the Secretary
in response to the insolvency of the agency as an exclusion from loan guarantees transferred to another agency in  682.410(a)(8)(ii)(B).



Discussion:

 The Secretary agrees that the reference to those loans should be removed from  682.410(a)(8)(ii)(B) because
it is duplicative of 34 CFR 682.410(a)(8)(i)(B) which already provides for this exclusion. 


Changes:

 Section 682.410(a)(8)(ii)(B) has been revised to delete the reference to loans transferred because of insolvency.



Section 682.410(a)(8)(ii)(E) 




Comments:

 Some commenters recommended that all loans for which a claim has been paid be subtracted from the total loans guaranteed
in calculating loans outstanding in  682.410(a)(8), definition of amount of loans outstanding. One commenter
recommended subtracting from the amount of loans for which a 
claim has been paid only those loans for which claims were paid at the direction of the Secretary. 


Discussion:

 The proposed rule would have subtracted loans for which claims are paid under  682.412(e) on ineligible loans,
under  682.509(a)(1) because of school closing, or at the direction of the Secretary, from total loans for which
a claim has been paid. The Secretary agrees that loans for which claims have been paid are not outstanding. 


Changes:

 The regulations have been revised to remove the three exclusions. 


Section 682.410(a)(8) 




Comments:

 A commenter recommended adding to  682.410(a)(8), amount of loans outstanding, a new paragraph (iii) to subtract
the principal amount of loans not disbursed because the loan guarantee was partially canceled. 


Discussion:

 Reporting requirements for Form 1130 provide detailed definitions for the items listed in  682.410(a)(8).
Partially canceled loans are one of the categories reported under cancelled loan guarantees and are therefore included
in  682.410(a)(8)(ii)(A). 


Changes:

 None.

Section 682.414 Records, Reports, and Inspection Requirements for Guaranty Agency Programs 




Comments:

 A commenter recommended that  682.414(a)(3)(ii)(K) be revised to explicitly require lenders to retain copies
of audit reports for not less than five years after the report is issued. While  682.414(a)(3)(ii)(K) implies
that audits are covered under this section because they are reports, the commenter suggested that the section be revised
explicitly to require that the audit reports be kept on file. 


Discussion:

 The Secretary agrees with the commenter that the regulations should explicitly require a lender to retain a copy of
its annual audit report for not less than five years after the report is issued. 


Changes:

 Section 682.414(a)(3) has been revised to incorporate the commenter's recommendation. 


Section 682.511 Due Diligence in Collecting a Loan 




Comments:

 A few commenters suggested that the regulations be revised to reflect that joint borrowers may cancel a loan even if
they do not simultaneously satisfy the same cancellation criterion but the loan would otherwise be ``cancellable''.
The commenters cited the example of a loan with joint borrowers where one borrower becomes totally, permanently disabled
and the other files for bankruptcy (with the loan subject to discharge), both conditions under which a borrower would
normally be able to cancel a loan. 


Discussion:

 The Secretary clarifies that a lender may file a claim for reimbursement based on the fact that, at the time of the request
for discharge, joint borrowers both have a condition under which a borrower would qualify to cancel a loan. 


Changes:

 The regulations have been revised to reflect that a claim may be filed based on each borrower satisfying the criteria.



Section 682.603 Certification by a Participating School in Connection With a Loan Application 
Section 682.603(h) 




Comments:

 Several commenters suggested that the wording of  682.603(h) could be made clearer by substituting ``earlier
than the 24th day of the student's period of enrollment'' for ``earlier 
than 7 days prior to the 31st day of the student's period of enrollment.'' 


Discussion:

 Paragraph (h) of  682.603 is meant to achieve, in the case of new borrowers subject to delayed delivery of loan
proceeds, the appropriate interest limitation Congress intended in  682.300 using a schedule based on the
date of disbursement by the lender. The Secretary agrees that the suggested rewording would more clearly state that
requirement. 


Changes:

 A change has been made to reflect that a school may not request the disbursement of loan proceeds for a first time borrower
who has not previously borrowed a Stafford or SLS loan earlier than the 24th day of the student's period of enrollment.



Section 682.604 Processing the Borrower's Loan Proceeds and Counseling Borrowers 
Section 682.604(c)(3) 




Comments:

 Some commenters suggested that the Secretary revise the language to codify the Department's earlier guidance that
eliminates the separate borrower authorization statement for those students who provide the authorization for
electronic fund transfer disbursement on the common loan application. 


Discussion:

 The Secretary agrees that this provision does not apply in those instances where the borrower has provided a separate
authorization for electronic fund transfer via the common loan application. 


Changes:

 The regulations have been revised to provide that the school fulfills this requirement if the borrower has authorized
the electronic fund transfer on the common loan application. 


Section 682.604(g)(2)(vi) 




Comments:

 A commenter recommended that the language be revised to reflect that when a borrower has obtained loans from multiple
guarantors, that the institution provide the required updated information to all guarantors listed in the borrower's
file. 


Discussion:

 The Secretary agrees that updated information should be provided to the guaranty agency or agencies within the specified
time. 


Changes:

 The regulations have been revised to incorporate the commenter's recommendation. 


Section 682.604(h) 




Comments:

 A few commenters suggested that the overaward tolerance for the FFEL program be consistent with the $200 overaward
allowed in the campus-based programs. Some commenters suggested that the statutory silence on the issue of tolerance
does not constitute a prohibition. 


Discussion:

 There is no statutory basis for providing a $200 tolerance in the treatment of an FFEL program overaward. Congress
has provided specific statutory tolerances in the campus-based overaward provisions and for limited purposes in
the FFEL program in section 428G(d) of the HEA. Given these precedents, if Congress had intended to provide for a general
tolerance it would have included it in the statute. 


Changes:

 None. 


Executive Order 12866 


These final regulations have been reviewed in accordance with Executive Order 12866. Under the terms of the order
the Secretary has assessed the potential costs and benefits of this regulatory action. 
The potential costs associated with the final regulations are those resulting from statutory requirements and those
determined by the Secretary to be necessary for administering this program effectively and efficiently. Burdens
specifically associated with information collection requirements were identified and explained in the NPRM. 
In assessing the potential costs and benefits_both quantitative and qualitative_of these regulations, the Secretary
has determined that the benefits of these regulations justify the costs. 
The Secretary has also determined that this regulatory action does not unduly interfere with State, local, and tribal
governments in the exercise of their governmental functions.

Waiver of Proposed Rulemaking 


In addition to the changes made to part 682 based on public comment on the notice of proposed rulemaking, the Secretary
has revised the regulations to include technical changes made by certain legislation, as stated above. 
It is the practice of the Secretary to offer interested parties the opportunity to comment on proposed regulations
in accordance with section 431(b)(2)(A) of the General Education Provisions Act (20 U.S.C. 1232(b)(2)(A)) and the
Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 553. However, since these changes merely reflect statutory changes in the
regulations and do not establish substantive policy changes, public comment could have no effect. Therefore, the
Secretary has determined, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B), that public comment on these amendments to the regulations
is unnecessary and contrary to the public interest. 


Assessment of Educational Impact 


In the notice of proposed regulations, the Secretary requested comments on whether the proposed regulations in this
document would require transmission of information that is being gathered by or is available from any other agency
or authority of the United States. 
Based on the response to the proposed rules and on its own review, the Department has determined that the regulations
in this document do not require transmission of information that is being gathered by or is available from any other
agency or authority of the United States.

(1) A borrower may request the rehabilitation of the borrower's defaulted FFEL loan held by the guaranty agency. The
borrower must make one voluntary full payment each month for 12 consecutive months to be eligible to have the defaulted
loans rehabilitated. For purposes of this section, ``full payment'' means a reasonable and affordable payment agreed
to by the borrower and the agency. The required amount of such monthly payment may be no more than is reasonable and affordable
based upon the borrower's total financial circumstances. Voluntary payments are those made directly by the borrower
regardless of whether there is a judgment against the borrower, and do not include payments obtained by income tax
off-set, garnishment, or income or asset execution. A guaranty agency must attempt to secure a lender to purchase
the loan at the end of the twelve-(12-)month payment period. 

(i) For purposes of this section, the determination of reasonable and affordable must_

including, but not limited to, housing, utilities, food, medical costs, work-related expenses, dependent care
costs and other Title IV repayment; 

(B) Not be a required minimum payment amount, e.g. $50, if the agency determines that a smaller amount is reasonable
and affordable based on the borrower's total financial circumstances. The agency must include documentation in
the borrower's file of the basis for the determination if the monthly reasonable and affordable payment established
under this section is less than $50.00 or the monthly accrued interest on the loan, whichever is greater. However,
$50.00 may not be the minimum payment for a borrower if the agency determines that a smaller amount is reasonable and
affordable; and 

(C) Be based on the documentation provided by the borrower or other sources including, but not be limited to_

(

1

) Evidence of current income (e.g., proof of welfare benefits, Social Security benefits, child support, veterans'
benefits, Supplemental Security Income, Workmen's Compensation, two most recent pay stubs, most recent copy of
U.S. income tax return, State Department of Labor reports); 

(

2

) Evidence of current expenses (e.g., a copy of the borrower's monthly household budget, on a form provided by the guaranty
agency); and 

(

3

) A statement of the unpaid balance on all FFEL loans held by other holders. 

(ii) The agency must include any payment made under  682.401(b)(4) in determining whether the 12 consecutive
payments required under paragraph (b)(1) of this section have been made. 

(iii) A borrower may request that the monthly payment amount be adjusted due to a change in the borrower's total financial
circumstances only upon providing the documentation specified in paragraph (b)(1)(i)(C) of this section. 

(iv) A guaranty agency must provide the borrower with a written statement confirming the borrower's reasonable and
affordable payment amount, as determined by the agency, and explaining any other terms and conditions applicable
to the required series of payments that must be made before a borrower's account can be considered for repurchase by
an eligible lender. The statement must inform borrowers of the consequences of having their loans rehabilitated
(e.g. credit clearing, possibility of increased monthly payments). The statement must inform the borrower of the
amount of the collection costs to be added to the unpaid principal at the time of the sale. The collection costs may not
exceed 18.5 percent of the unpaid principal and accrued interest at the time of the sale. 

(v) A guaranty agency must provide the borrower with an opportunity to object to terms of the rehabilitation of the
borrower's defaulted loan. 

(2) The guaranty agency must report to all national credit bureaus within 90 days of the date the loan was rehabilitated
that the loan is no longer in a default status. 

(3) An eligible lender purchasing a rehabilitated loan must establish a repayment schedule that meets the same requirements
that are applicable to other FFEL Program loans made under the same loan type and provides for the borrower to make monthly
payments at least as great as the average of the 12 consecutive monthly payments received by the guaranty agency. For
the purposes of the maximum loan repayment period, the lender must treat the first payment made under the 12 consecutive
payments as the first payment under the 10-year maximum.

17. Section 682.406 is amended by removing ``and'' at the end of paragraph (a)(12); removing the period at the end of
paragraph (a)(13) and adding in its place, ``; and'' and adding a new paragraph (a)(14) to read as follows: 



 682.406

 Conditions of reinsurance coverage. 
 


(a) * * *

(14) The guaranty agency certifies to the Secretary that diligent attempts have been made by the lender and the guaranty
agency under  682.411(g) to locate the borrower through the use of reasonable skip-tracing techniques. 



* * * * * 



18. Section 682.407 is amended by adding a new paragraph (e) to read as follows: 



 682.407 

Administrative cost allowance for guaranty agencies. 



* * * * * 



(e) An administrative cost allowance improperly paid on a loan to a guaranty agency must be deducted by the agency from
the amount reflected in the following quarter's ED form 1130 when it is submitted to the Department for payment. 



* * * * * 



19. Section 682.409 is amended by revising paragraph (a); revising paragraph (c)(1); and adding a new paragraph (c)(6)
to read as follows: 



 682.409 

Mandatory assignment by guaranty agencies of defaulted loans to the Secretary. 



(a) (1) If the Secretary determines that action is necessary to protect the Federal fiscal interest, the Secretary
will direct a guaranty agency to promptly assign to the Secretary any loan held by the agency on which the agency has
received payment under  682.402(d), 682.402(i), or 682.404. An orderly transition from the FFEL program to
the Federal Direct Student Loan (FDSL) Program and the collection of unpaid loans owed by Federal employees by Federal
salary offset are, among other things, deemed to be in the Federal fiscal interest. Unless the Secretary notifies
an agency, in writing, that other loans must be assigned to the Secretary, an agency must assign any loan that meets
all of the following criteria as of April 15 of each year: 

(i) The unpaid principal balance is at least $100. 

(ii) For each of the two fiscal years following the fiscal year in which these regulations are effective, the loan,
and any other loans held by the agency for that borrower, have been held by the agency for at least four years; for any
subsequent fiscal year such loan must have been held by the agency for at least five years.

<TEXT>
 

(iii) A payment has not been received on the loan in the last year. 

(iv) A judgment has not been entered on the loan against the borrower. 

(2) If the agency fails to meet a fiscal year recovery rate standard under paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section for
a loan type, and the Secretary determines that additional assignments are necessary to protect the Federal fiscal
interest, the Secretary may require the agency to assign in addition to those loans described in paragraph (a)(1)
of this section, loans in amounts needed to satisfy the requirements of paragraph (a)(2)(iii) or (a)(3)(i) of this
section. 

(i) 

Calculation of fiscal year loan type recovery rate.

 A fiscal year loan type recovery rate for an agency is determined by dividing the amount collected on defaulted loans,
including collections by Federal Income Tax Refund Offset, for each loan program (i.e., the Stafford, PLUS, SLS,
and Consolidation loan programs) by the agency for loans of that program (including payments received by the agency
on loans under  682.401(b)(4) and  682.409 and the amounts of any loans purchased from the guaranty agency
by an eligible lender) during the most recent fiscal year for which data are available by the total of principal and
interest owed to an agency on defaulted loans for each loan program at the beginning of the same fiscal year, less accounts
permanently assigned to the Secretary through the most recent fiscal year. 

(ii) 

Fiscal year loan type recovery rates standards.

 (A) If, in each of the two fiscal years following the fiscal year in which these regulations are effective, the fiscal
year loan type recovery rate for a loan program for an agency is below 80 percent of the average recovery rate of all active
guaranty agencies in each of the same two fiscal years for that program type, and the Secretary determines that additional
assignments are necessary to protect the Federal fiscal interest, the Secretary may require the agency to make additional
assignments in accordance with paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section. 

(B) In any subsequent fiscal year the loan type recovery rate standard for a loan program must be 90 percent of the average
recovery rate of all active guaranty agencies. 

(iii) 

Non-achievement of loan type recovery rate standards.

 

(A) Unless the Secretary determines under paragraph (a)(2)(iv) of this section that protection of the Federal fiscal
interest requires that a lesser amount be assigned, upon notice from the Secretary, an agency with a fiscal year loan
type recovery rate described in paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section must promptly assign to the Secretary a sufficient
amount of defaulted loans, in addition to loans to be assigned in accordance with paragraph (a)(1) of this section,
to cause the fiscal year loan type recovery rate of the agency that fiscal year to equal or exceed the average rate of
all agencies described in paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section when recalculated to exclude from the denominator
of the agency's fiscal year loan type recovery rate the amount of these additional loans. 

(B) The Secretary, in consultation with the guaranty agency, may require the amount of loans to be assigned under paragraph
(a)(2) of this section to include particular categories of loans that share characteristics that make the performance
of the agency fall below the appropriate percentage of the loan type recovery rate as described in paragraph (a)(2)(ii)
of this section. 

(iv) 

Calculation of loan type recovery rate standards.

 The Secretary, within 30 days after the date for submission of the second quarterly report from all agencies, makes
available to all agencies a mid-year report, showing the recovery rate for each agency and the average recovery rate
of all active guaranty agencies for each loan type. In addition, the Secretary, within 120 days after the beginning
of each fiscal year, makes available a final report showing those rates and the average rate for each loan type for the
preceding fiscal year. 

(3)(i) 

Determination that the protection of the Federal fiscal interest requires assignments.

 Upon petition by an agency submitted within 45 days of the notice required by paragraph (a)(2)(iii)(A) of this section,
the Secretary may determine that protection of the Federal fiscal interest does not require assignment of all loans
described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section or of loans in the full amount described in paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of
this section only after review of the agency's petition. In making this determination, the Secretary considers all
relevant information available to him (including any information and documentation obtained by the Secretary in
reviews of the agency or submitted to the Secretary by the agency) as follows: 

(A) For each of the two fiscal years following the fiscal year in which these regulations are effective, the Secretary
considers information presented by an agency with a fiscal year loan type recovery rate above the average rate of all
active agencies to demonstrate that the protection of the Federal fiscal interest will be served if any amounts of
loans of the loan type required to be assigned to the Secretary under paragraph (a)(1) of this section are retained
by that agency. For any subsequent fiscal year, the Secretary considers information presented by an agency with a
fiscal year recovery rate 10 percent above the average rate of all active agencies. 

(B) The Secretary considers information presented by an agency that is required to assign loans under paragraph (a)(2)
of this section to demonstrate that the protection of the Federal fiscal interest will be served if the agency demonstrates
that its compliance with  682.401(b)(4) and  682.405 has reduced substantially its fiscal year loan
type recovery rate or rates or if the agency is not required to assign amounts of loans that would otherwise have to be
assigned. 

(C) The information provided by an agency pursuant to paragraphs (a)(3)(i)(A) and (B) of this section may include,
but is not limited to the following:

 Supplement to notice of fair housing accessibility guidelines. 






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 On March 6, 1991, the Department published final Fair Housing Accessibility Guidelines (Guidelines) to provide
builders and developers with technical guidance on how to comply with the accessibility requirements of the Fair
Housing Amendments Act of 1988 (Fair Housing Act) that are applicable to certain multifamily dwellings designed
and constructed for first occupancy after March 13, 1991. Since publication of the Guidelines, the Department has
received many questions regarding the applicability of the technical specifications set forth in the Guidelines
to certain types of new multifamily dwellings and certain types of units within covered multifamily dwellings. The
Department also has received several questions concerning the types of new multifamily dwellings that are subject
to the design and construction requirements of the Fair Housing Act. 



This document reproduces the questions that have been most frequently asked by members of the public, and the Department's
answers to these questions. The Department believes that the issues addressed by these questions and answers may
be of interest and assistance to other members of the public who must comply with the design and construction requirements
of the Fair Housing Act. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

Background 



The Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988 (Pub.L. 100-430, approved September 13, 1988) (the Fair Housing Amendments
Act) amended title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968 (Fair Housing Act or Act) to add prohibitions against discrimination
in housing on the basis of disability and familial status. The Fair Housing Amendments Act also made it unlawful to
design and construct 
certain multifamily dwellings for first occupancy after March 13, 1991, in a manner that makes them inaccessible
to persons with disabilities, and established design and construction requirements to make these dwellings readily
accessible to and usable by persons with disabilities.

1

 Section 100.205 of the Department's regulations at 24 CFR part 100 implements the Fair Housing Act's design and construction
requirements (also referred to as accessibility requirements). 





On March 6, 1991 (56 FR 9472), the Department published final Fair Housing Accessibility Guidelines (Guidelines)
to provide builders and developers with technical guidance on how to comply with the accessibility requirements
of the Fair Housing Act. (The Guidelines are codified at 24 CFR Ch.I, Subch.A., App. II. The preamble to the Guidelines
is codified at 24 CFR Ch.I, Subch.A., App.III.) The Guidelines are organized to follow the sequence of requirements
as they are presented in the Fair Housing Act and in 24 CFR 100.205. The Guidelines provide technical guidance on the
following seven requirements:

Requirement 1. Accessible building entrance on an accessible route. 
Requirement 2. Accessible common and public use areas. 
Requirement 3. Usable doors (usable by a person in a wheelchair). 
Requirement 4. Accessible route into and through the dwelling unit. 
Requirement 5. Light switches, electrical outlets, thermostats and other environmental controls in accessible
locations. 
Requirement 6. Reinforced walls for grab bars. 
Requirement 7. Usable kitchens and bathrooms. 




The design specifications presented in the Guidelines are recommended guidelines only. Builders and developers
may choose to depart from these guidelines and seek alternate ways to demonstrate that they have met the requirements
of the Fair Housing Act. The Fair Housing Act and the Department's implementing regulation provides, for example,
for use of the appropriate requirements of the ANSI A117.1 standard. However, adherence to the Guidelines does constitute
a safe harbor in the Department's administrative enforcement process for compliance with the Fair Housing Act's
design and construction requirements. 

Since publication of the Guidelines, the Department has received many questions regarding applicability of the
design specifications set forth in the Guidelines to certain types of new multifamily dwellings and to certain types
of interior housing designs. The Department also has received several questions concerning the types of new multifamily
dwellings that are subject to compliance with the design and construction requirements of the Fair Housing Act. Given
the wide variety in the types of multifamily dwellings and the types of dwelling units, and the continual introduction
into the housing market of new building and interior designs, it was not possible for the Department to prepare accessibility
guidelines that would address every housing type or housing design. Although the Guidelines cannot address every
housing design, it is the Department's intention to assist the public in complying with the design and construction
requirements of the Fair Housing Act through workshops and seminars, telephone assistance, written replies to written
inquiries, and through the publication of documents such as this one. The Department has contracted for the preparation
of a design manual that will further explain and illustrate the Fair Housing Act Accessibility Guidelines. 

The questions and answers set forth in this notice address the issues most frequently raised by the public with respect
to types of multifamily dwellings subject to the design and construction requirements of the Fair Housing Act, and
the technical specifications contained in the Guidelines. 

The question and answer format is divided into two sections. Section 1, entitled ``Dwellings Subject to the New Construction
Requirements of the Fair Housing Act'' addresses the issues raised in connection with the types of multifamily dwellings
(including portions of such dwellings) constructed for first occupancy after March 13, 1991, that must comply with
the Act's design and construction requirements. Section 2, entitled ``Accessibility Guidelines,'' addresses
the issues raised in connection with the design and construction specifications set forth in the Guidelines.

Appendix IV to Subchapter A_Questions and Answers About the Fair Housing Accessibility Guidelines 


Introduction 


On March 6, 1991 (56 FR 9472), the Department published final Fair Housing Accessibility Guidelines (Guidelines).
(The Guidelines are codified at 24 CFR Ch. I, Subch. A, App. II.) The Guidelines provide builders and developers with
technical guidance on how to comply with the accessibility requirements of the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988
(Fair Housing Act) that are applicable to certain multifamily dwellings designed and constructed for first occupancy
after March 13, 1991. Since publication of the Guidelines, the Department has received many questions regarding
the applicability of the technical specifications set forth in the Guidelines to certain types of new multifamily
dwellings and certain types of units within covered multifamily dwellings. The Department also has received several
questions concerning the types of new multifamily dwellings that are subject to the design and construction requirements
of the Fair Housing Act. 
The questions and answers contained in this document address some of the issues most frequently raised by the public
with respect to the types of multifamily dwellings subject to the design and construction requirements of the Fair
Housing Act, and the technical specifications contained in the Guidelines. 
The issues addressed in this document are addressed only with respect to the application of the Fair Housing Act and
the Guidelines to dwellings which are ``covered multifamily dwellings'' under the Fair Housing Act. Certain of these
dwellings, as well as certain public and common use areas of such dwellings, may 

also 

be covered by various other laws, such as section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794); the Architectural
Barriers Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C. 4151 through 4157); and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 12101
through 12213). 
Section 504 applies to programs and activities receiving federal financial assistance. The Department's regulations
for section 504 are found at 24 CFR part 8. 
The Architectural Barriers Act applies to certain buildings financed in whole or in part with federal funds. The Department's
regulations for the Architectural Barriers Act are found at 24 CFR parts 40 and 41. 
The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) is a broad civil rights law guaranteeing equal opportunity for individuals
with disabilities in employment, public accommodations, transportation, State and local government services,
and telecommunications. The Department of Justice is the lead federal agency for implementation of the ADA and should
be contacted for copies of relevant ADA regulations. 
The Department has received a number of questions regarding applicability of the ADA to residential housing, particularly
with respect to title III of the ADA, which addresses accessibility requirements for public accommodations. The
Department has been asked, in particular, if public and common use areas of residential housing are covered by title
III of the ADA. Strictly residential facilities are not considered places of public accommodation and therefore
would not be subject to title III of the ADA, nor would amenities provided for the exclusive use of residents and their
guests. However, common areas that function as one of the ADA's twelve categories of places of public accommodation
within residential facilities are considered places of public accommodation if they are open to persons other than
residents and their guests. Rental offices and sales office for residential housing, for example, are by their nature
open to the public, and are places of public accommodation and must comply with the ADA requirements in addition to
all applicable requirements of the Fair Housing Act. 
As stated above, the remainder of this notice addresses issues most frequently raised by the public with respect to
the types of multifamily dwellings subject to the design and construction requirements of the Fair Housing Act, and
the technical specifications contained in the Guidelines.

Section 1: Dwellings Subject to the New Construction Requirements of the Fair Housing Act


The issues addressed in this section concern the types of multifamily dwellings (or portions of such dwellings) designed
and constructed for first occupancy after March 13, 1991 that must comply with the design and construction requirements
of the Fair Housing Act. 


1. Townhouses 


(a) Q. Are townhouses in non-elevator buildings which have individual exterior entrances required to be accessible?

A. Yes, if they are single-story townhouses. If they are multistory townhouses, accessibility is not required. (

See 

the discussion of townhouses in the preamble to the Guidelines under ``Section 2_Definitions [Covered Multifamily
Dwellings]'' at 56 FR 9481, March 6, 1991, or 24 CFR Ch. I, Subch. A, App. III.) 
(b) Q. Does the Fair Housing Act cover four one-story dwelling units that share common walls and have individual entrances?

A. Yes. The Fair Housing Act applies to all units in buildings consisting of four or more dwelling units if such buildings
have one or more elevators; and ground floor dwelling units in other buildings consisting of four or more dwelling
units. This would include one-story homes, sometimes called ``single-story townhouses,'' ``villas,'' or ``patio
apartments,'' regardless of ownership, even though such homes may not be considered multifamily dwellings under
various building codes. 
(c) Q. What if the single-story dwelling units are separated by firewalls? 
A. The Fair Housing Act would still apply. The Guidelines define covered multifamily dwellings to include buildings
having four or more units within a single structure separated by firewalls. 


2. Commercial Space 


Q. If a building includes three residential dwelling units and one or more commercial spaces, is the building a ``covered
multifamily dwelling'' under the Fair Housing Act? 
A. No. Covered multifamily dwellings are buildings consisting of four or more dwelling units, if such buildings have
one or more elevators; and ground floor dwelling units in other buildings consisting of four or more dwelling units.
Commercial space does not meet the definition of ``dwelling unit.'' Note, however, that title III of the ADA applies
to public accommodations and commercial facilities, therefore an independent determination should be made regarding
applicability of the ADA to the commercial space in such a building. (

See 

the introduction to these questions and answers, which provides some background on the ADA.)


3. Condominiums 


(a) Q. Are condominiums covered by the Fair Housing Act? 
A. Yes. Condominiums in covered multifamily dwellings are covered by the Fair Housing Act. The Fair Housing Act makes
no distinctions based on ownership. 
(b) Q. If a condominium is pre-sold as a shell and the interior is designed and constructed by the buyer, are the Guidelines
applicable? 
A. Yes. The Fair Housing Act applies to design and construction of covered multifamily dwellings, regardless of whether
the person doing the design and construction is an architect, builder, or private individual. (

See 

discussion of condominiums in the preamble to Guidelines under ``Section 2_Definitions [Dwelling Units]'' at 56
FR 9481, March 6, 1991, or 24 CFR Ch. I, Subch. A, App. III.) 


4. Additions 


(a) Q. If an owner adds four or more dwelling units to an existing building, are those units covered by the Fair Housing
Act? 
A. Yes, provided that the units constitute a new addition to the building and not substantial rehabilitation of existing
units.

<TEXT>
 

(b) Q. What if new public and common use spaces are also being added? 

A. If new public and common use areas or buildings are also added, they are required to be accessible. 

(c) Q. If the only new construction is an addition consisting of four or more dwelling units, would the existing public
and common use spaces have to be made accessible? 

A. No, existing public and common use areas would not have to be made accessible. The Fair Housing Act applies to 

new construction 

of covered multifamily dwellings. (

See 

section 804(f)(3)(C)(i) of the Act.) Existing public and common use facilities are not newly constructed portions
of covered multifamily dwellings. However, reasonable modifications to the existing public and common use areas
to provide access would have to be allowed, and the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) may apply to certain public
and common use areas. An independent determination should be made regarding applicability of the ADA. (

See 

the introduction to these questions and answers, which provides some background on the ADA.) 



5. Units Over Parking 



(a) Q. Plans for a three-story building consist of a common parking area with assigned stalls on grade as the first story,
and two stories of single-story dwelling units stacked over the parking. All of the stories above the parking level
are to be accessed by stairways. There are no elevators planned to be in the building. Would the first story of single-story
dwelling units over the parking level be required to be accessible? 

A. Yes. The Guidelines adopt and amplify the definition of ``ground floor'' found in HUD's regulation implementing
the Fair Housing Act (

see 

24 CFR 100.201) to indicate that ``* * * where the first floor containing dwelling units is
above grade, all units on that floor must be served by a building entrance on an accessible route. This floor will be
considered to be a ground floor.'' (

See 

definition of ``ground floor'' in the Guidelines at 24 CFR Ch. I, Subch. A, App. II, Section 2.) Where no dwelling units
in a covered multifamily dwelling are located on grade, the first floor with dwelling units will be considered to be
a ground floor, and must be served by a building entrance on an accessible route. However, the definition of ``ground
floor'' does not require that there be more than one ground floor. 

(b) Q. If a building design contains a mix of single-story flats on grade and single-story flats located above grade
over a public parking area, do the flats over the parking area have to be accessible? 


A. No. In the example in the above question, because some single-story flats are situated on grade, these flats would
be the ground floor dwelling units and would be required to be accessible. The definition of ground floor in the Guidelines
states, in part, that ``ground floor means a floor of a building with a building entrance on an accessible route. A building
may have one or more ground floors * * *.'' Thus, the definition includes situations where the design
plan is such that more than one floor of a building may be accessed by means of an accessible route (for an example, see
Question 6, which follows). There is no requirement in the Department's regulations implementing the Fair Housing
Act that there be more than one ground floor. 



6. More Than One Ground Floor 



Q. If a two or three story building is to be constructed on a slope, such that the lowest story can be accessed on grade
on one side of the building and the second story can be accessed on grade on the other side of the building, do the dwelling
units on both the first and second stories have to be made accessible? 

A. Yes. By defining ``ground floor'' to be any floor of a building with an accessible entrance on an accessible route,
the Fair Housing Act regulations recognize that certain buildings, based on the site and the design plan, have more
than one story which can be accessed at or near grade. In such cases, if more than one story can be designed to have an accessible
entrance on an accessible route, then all such stories should be so designed. Each story becomes a ground floor and
the dwelling units on that story must meet the accessibility requirements of the Act. (

See 

the discussion on this issue in Question 12 of this document.)

7. Continuing Care Facilities 



Q. Do the new construction requirements of the Fair Housing Act apply to continuing care facilities which incorporate
housing, health care and other types of services? 

A. The new construction requirements of the Fair Housing Act would apply to continuing care facilities if the facility
includes at least one building with four or more dwelling units. Whether a facility is a ``dwelling'' under the Act
depends on whether the facility is to be used as a residence for more than a brief period of time. As a result, the operation
of each continuing care facility must be examined on a case-by-case basis to determine whether it contains dwellings.
Factors that the Department will consider in making such an examination include, but are not limited to: (1) the length
of time persons stay in the project; (2) whether policies are in effect at the project that are designed and intended
to encourage or discourage occupants from forming an expectation and intent to continue to occupy space at the project;
and (3) the nature of the services provided by or at the project. 



8. Evidence of First Occupancy 



Q. The Fair Housing Act applies to covered multifamily dwellings built for first occupancy after March 13, 1991. What
is acceptable evidence of ``first occupancy''? 

A. The determination of first occupancy is made on a building by building basis. The Fair Housing Act regulations provide
that ``covered multifamily dwellings shall be deemed to be designed and constructed for first occupancy on or before
March 13, 1991 (and therefore exempt from the Act's accessibility requirements) if they are occupied by that date
or if the last building permit or renewal thereof for the covered multifamily dwellings is issued by a State, county
or local government on or before June 15, 1990.'' 

For buildings that did not obtain the final building permit on or before June 15, 1990, proof of the date of first occupancy
consists of (1) a certificate of occupancy, and (2) a showing that at least one dwelling unit in the building actually
was occupied by March 13, 1991. For example, a tenant has signed a lease and has taken possession of a unit. The tenant
need not have moved into the unit, but the tenant must have taken possession so that, if desired, he or she could have
moved into the building by March 13, 1991. For dwelling units that were for sale, this means that the new owner had completed
settlement and taken possession of the dwelling unit by March 13, 1991. Once again, the new owner need not have moved
in, but the owner must have been in possession of the unit and able to move in, if desired, on or before March 13, 1991.
A certificate of occupancy alone would not be an acceptable means of establishing first occupancy, and units offered
for sale, but not sold, would not meet the test for first occupancy. 



9. Converted Buildings 



Q. If a building was used previously for a nonresidential purpose, such as a warehouse, office building, or school,
and is being converted to a multifamily dwelling, must the building meet the requirements of the Fair Housing Act?


A. No, the Fair Housing Act applies to ``covered multifamily dwellings for first occupancy after'' March 13, 1991,
and the Fair Housing Act regulation defines ``first occupancy'' as ``a building that has never before been used for
any purpose.'' (

See 

24 CFR 100.201, for the definition of ``first occupancy,'' and also 24 CFR Ch. I, Subch. A, App. I.) 



Section 2: Accessibility Guidelines



The issues addressed in this section concern the technical specifications set forth in the Fair Housing Accessibility
Guidelines. 



Requirement 1_Accessible Entrance on an Accessible Route 



10. Accessible Routes to Garages 



(a) Q. Is it necessary to have an accessible path of travel from a subterranean garage to single-story covered multifamily
dwellings built on top of the garage? 

A. Yes. The Fair Housing Act requires that there be an accessible building entrance on an accessible route. To satisfy
Requirement 1 of the Guidelines, there would have to be an accessible route leading to grade level entrances serving
the single-story dwelling units from a public street or sidewalk or other pedestrian arrival point. The below grade
parking garage is a public and common use facility. Therefore, there must also be an accessible route from this parking
area to the covered dwelling units. This may be provided either by a properly sloped ramp leading from the below grade
parking to grade level, or by means of an elevator from the parking garage to the dwelling units. 

(b) Q. Does the route leading from inside a private attached garage to the dwelling unit have to be accessible? 

A. No. Under Requirement 1 of the Guidelines, there must be an accessible entrance to the dwelling unit on an accessible
route. However, this route and entrance need not originate inside the garage. Most units with attached garages have
a separate main entry, and this would be the entrance required to be accessible. Thus, if there were one or two steps
inside the garage leading into the unit, there would be no requirement to put a ramp in place of the steps. However, the
door connecting the garage and dwelling unit would have to meet the requirements for usable doors.

11. Site Impracticality Tests 


(a) Q. Under the individual building test, how is the second step of the test performed, which involves measuring the
slope of the finished grade between the entrance and applicable arrival points? 
A. The slope is measured at ground level from the entrance to the top of the pavement of all vehicular and pedestrian
arrival points within 50 feet of the planned entrance, or, if there are none within 50 feet, the vehicular or pedestrian
arrival point closest to the planned entrance. 
(b) Q. Under the individual building test, at what point of the planned entrance is the measurement taken? 
A. On a horizontal plane, the center of each individual doorway should be the point of measurement when measuring to
an arrival point, whether the doorway is an entrance door to the building or an entrance door to a unit. 
(c) Q. The site analysis test calls for a calculation of the percentage of the buildable areas having slopes of less
than 10 percent. What is the definition of ``buildable areas''? 
A. The ``buildable area'' is any area of the lot or site where a building can be located in compliance with applicable
codes and zoning regulations. 


12. Second Ground Floors 


(a) Q. The Department's regulation for the Fair Housing Act provides that there can be more than one ground floor in
a covered multifamily dwelling (such as a three-story building built on a slope with three stories at and above grade
in front and two stories at grade in back). How is the individual building test performed for additional stories, to
determine if those stories must also be treated as ``ground floors''? 
A. For purposes of determining whether a non-elevator building has more than one ground floor, the point of measurement
for additional ground floors, after the first ground floor has been established, is at the center of the entrance (building
entrance for buildings with one or more common entrance and each dwelling unit entrance for buildings with separate
ground floor unit entrances) at floor level for that story. 
(b) Q. What happens if a builder deliberately manipulates the grade so that a second story, which also might have been
treated as a ground floor, requires steps? 
A. Deliberate manipulation of the height of the finished floor level to avoid the requirements of the Fair Housing
Act would serve as a basis for the Department to determine that there is reasonable cause to believe that a discriminatory
housing practice has occurred. 


Requirement 2_Public and Common Use Areas 


13. No Covered Dwellings 


Q. Are the public and common use areas of a newly constructed development that consists entirely of buildings having
four or more multistory townhouses, with no elevators, required to be accessible? 
A. No. The Fair Housing Act applies only to new construction of covered multifamily dwellings. Multistory townhouses,
provided that they meet the definition of ``multistory'' in the Guidelines, are not covered multifamily dwellings
if the building does not have an elevator. (

See

 discussion of townhouses in the preamble to the Guidelines under ``Section 2_Definitions [Covered Multifamily
Dwellings]'' at 56 FR 9481, March 6, 1991, or 24 CFR Ch. I, Subch. A, App. III.) If there are no covered multifamily dwellings
on a site, then the public and common use areas of the site are not required to be accessible. However, the Americans
with Disabilities Act (ADA) may apply to certain public and common use areas. Again, an independent determination
should be made regarding applicability of the ADA. (

See

 the introduction to these questions and answers, which provides some background on the ADA.) 


14. Parking Spaces and Garages 


(a) Q. How many resident parking spaces must be made accessible at the time of construction? 





</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940628-0-00061 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940628-0-00018 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

A. The Guidelines provide that a minimum of two percent of the parking spaces serving covered dwelling units be made
accessible and located on an accessible route to wheelchair users. Also, if a resident requests an accessible space,
additional accessible parking spaces would be necessary if the two percent are already reserved. 
(b) Q. If both open and covered parking spaces are provided, how many of each type must be accessible? 
A. The Guidelines require that accessible parking be provided for residents with disabilities on the same terms and
with the full range of choices, 

e.g.

, surface parking or garage, that are provided for other residents of the project. Thus, if a project provides different
types of parking such as surface parking, garage, or covered spaces, some of each must be made accessible. While the
total parking spaces required to be accessible is only two percent, at least one space for each type of parking should
be made accessible even if this number exceeds two percent. 
(c) Q. If a project having covered multifamily dwellings provides parking garages where there are several individual
garages grouped together either in a separate area of the building (such as at one end of the building, or in a detached
building), for assignment or rental to residents, are there any requirements for the inside dimensions of these individual
parking garages? 
A. Yes. These garages would be public and common use space, even though the individual garages may be assigned to a particular
dwelling unit. Therefore, at least two percent of the garages should be at least 14
' 2
'
' wide and the vehicular door should be at least 10
'-0
'
' wide. 
(d) Q. If a covered multifamily dwelling has a below grade common use parking garage, is there a requirement for a vertical
clearance to allow vans to park? 
A. This issue was addressed in the preamble to the Guidelines, but continues to be a frequently asked question. (

See

 the preamble to the Guidelines under the discussion of ``Section 5_Guidelines for Requirement 2'' at 56 FR 9486, March
6, 1991, or 24 CFR Ch. I, Subch. A, App. III.) In response to comments from the public that the Guidelines for parking
specify minimum vertical clearance for garage parking, the Department responded: 



No national accessibility standards, including UFAS, require particular vertical clearances in parking garages.
The Department did not consider it appropriate to exceed commonly accepted standards by including a minimum vertical
clearance in the Fair Housing Accessibility Guidelines, in view of the minimal accessibility requirements of the
Fair Housing Act. 




Since the Guidelines refer to ANSI A117.1 1986 for the standards to follow for public and common use areas, and since
the ANSI does not include a vertical clearance for garage parking, the Guidelines likewise do not. (Note: UFAS is the
Uniform Federal Accessibility Standard.) 


15. Public Telephones 


Q. If a covered multifamily dwelling has public telephones in the lobby, what are the requirements for accessibility
for these telephones? 
A. The requirements governing public telephones are found in Item 

#

14, ``Common use spaces and facilities,'' in the chart under Requirement 2 of the Guidelines. While the chart does
not address the quantity of accessible public telephones, at a minimum, at least one accessible telephone per bank
of telephones would be required. The specifications at ANSI 4.29 would apply. 


Requirement 3_Usable Doors 


16. Required Width 


Q. Will a standard hung 32-inch door provide sufficient clear width to meet the requirements of the Fair Housing Act?

A. No, a 32-inch door would not provide a sufficient clear opening to meet the requirement for usable doors. A notation
in the Guidelines for Requirement 3 indicates that a 34-inch door, hung in the standard manner, provides an acceptable
nominal 32-inch clear opening.

<TEXT>
 

17. Maneuvering Clearances and Hardware 


Q. Is it correct that only the exterior side of the main entry door of covered multifamily dwellings must meet the ANSI
requirements? 
A. Yes. The exterior side of the main entry door is part of the public and common use areas and therefore must meet ANSI
A117.1 1986 specifications for doors. These specifications include necessary maneuvering clearances and accessible
door hardware. The interior of the main entry door is part of the dwelling unit and only needs to meet the requirements
for usable doors within the dwelling intended for user passage, i.e., at least 32 inches nominal clear width, with
no requirements for maneuvering clearances and hardware. (

See

 56 FR 9487-9488, March 6, 1991, or 24 CFR Ch. I, Subch. A, App. III.) 


18. Doors to Inaccessible Areas 


Q. Is it necessary to provide usable doors when the door leads to an area of the dwelling that is not accessible, such
as the door leading down to an unfinished basement, or the door connecting a single-story dwelling with an attached
garage? (In the latter case, there is a separate entrance door to the unit which is accessible.) 
A. Yes. Within the dwelling unit, doors intended for user passage through the unit must meet the requirements for usable
doors. Such doors would have to provide at least 32 inches nominal clear width when the door is open 90 degrees, measured
between the face of the door and the stop. This will ensure that, if a wheelchair user occupying the dwelling unit chooses
to modify the unit to provide accessibility to these areas, such as installing a ramp from the dwelling unit into the
garage, the door will be sufficiently wide to allow passage. It also will allow passage for people using walkers or
crutches. 


Requirement 4_Accessible Route Into and Through the Unit 


19. Sliding Door 


Q. If a sliding door track has a threshold of 3/4
'
', does this trigger requirements for ramps? 
A. No. The Guidelines at Requirement 4 provide that thresholds at doors, including sliding door tracks, may be no higher
than 3/4
'
' and must be beveled with a slope no greater than 1:2. 


20. Private Attached Garages 


(a) Q. If a covered multifamily dwelling has an individual, private garage which is attached to and serves only that
dwelling, does the garage have to be accessible in terms of width and length? 
A. Garages attached to and which serve only one covered multifamily dwelling are part of that dwelling unit, and are
not covered by Requirement 2 of the Guidelines, which addresses accessible and usable public and common use space.
Because such individual garages attached to and serving only one covered multifamily dwelling typically are not
finished living space, the garage is not required to be accessible in terms of width or length. The answer to this question
should be distinguished from the answer to Question 14(c). Question 14(c) addresses parking garages where there
are several garages or stalls located together, either in a separate, detached building, or in a central area of the
building, such as at one end. These types of garages are not attached to, and do not serve, only one unit and are therefore
considered public and common use garages. 


21. Split-Level Entry 


Q. Is a dwelling unit that has a split entry foyer, with the foyer and living room on an accessible route and the remainder
of the unit down two steps, required to be accessible if it is a ground floor unit in a covered multifamily dwelling?

A. Yes. Under Requirement 4, there must be an accessible route into and through the dwelling unit. This would preclude
a split level foyer, unless a properly sloped ramp can be provided. 


Requirement 5_Environmental Controls 


22. Range Hood Fans 


Q. Must the switches on range hood kitchen ventilation fans be in accessible locations? 
A. No. Kitchen ventilation fans located on a range hood are considered to be part of the appliance. The Fair Housing
Act has no requirements for appliances in the interiors of dwelling units, or the switches that operate them. (See
``Guidelines for Requirement 5'' and ``Controls for Ranges and Cooktops'' at 56 FR 9490 and 9492, March 6, 1991, or
24 CFR Ch. I, Subch. A, App. III.) 


Requirement 6_Reinforced Walls for Grab Bars 


23. Type of Reinforcement 


Q. What type of reinforcement should be used to reinforce bathroom walls for the later installation of grab bars? 
A. The Guidelines do not prescribe the type of material to use or method of providing reinforcement for bathroom walls.
The Guidelines recognize that grab bar reinforcing may be accomplished in a variety of ways, such as by providing plywood
panels in the areas illustrated in the Guidelines under Requirement 6, or by installing vertical reinforcement in
the form of double studs at the points noted on the figures in the Guidelines. The builder/owners should maintain records
that reflect the placement of the reinforcing material, for later reference by a resident who wishes to install a grab
bar. 


24. Type of Grab Bar 


Q. What types of grab bars should the reinforcement be designed to accommodate and what types may be used if the builder
elects to install grab bars in some units at the time of construction? 





</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940628-0-00063 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940628-0-00018 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

A. The Guidelines do not prescribe the type of product for grab bars, or the structural strength for grab bars. The Guidelines
only state that the necessary reinforcement must be placed ``so as to permit later installation of 

appropriate

 grab bars.'' (Emphasis added.) In determining what is an appropriate grab bar, builders are encouraged to look to
the 1986 ANSI A117.1 standard, the standard cited in the Fair Housing Act. Builders also may follow State or local standards
in planning for or selecting appropriate grab bars. 


Requirement 7_Usable Kitchens and Bathrooms 


25. Counters and Vanities 


Q. It appears from Figure 2(c) of the Guidelines (under Requirement 5) that there is a 34 inch height requirement for
kitchen counters and vanities. Is this true? 
A. No. Requirement 7 addresses the requirement for usable kitchens and bathrooms so that a person in a wheelchair can
maneuver about the space. The legislative history of the Fair Housing Act makes it clear that the Congress intended
that the Act affect ability to maneuver within the space of the kitchen and bathroom, but not to require fixtures, cabinetry
or plumbing of adjustable design. Figure 2(c) of the Guidelines is illustrating the maximum side reach range over
an obstruction. Because the picture was taken directly from the ANSI A117.1 1986 standard, the diagram also shows
the height of the obstruction, which, in this picture, is a countertop. This 34 inch height, however, should not be
regarded as a requirement. 


26. Showers 


Q. Is a parallel approach required at the shower, as shown in Figure 7(d) of the Guidelines? 
A. Yes. For a 36
'
' x 36
'
' shower, as shown in Figure 7(d), a person in a wheelchair would typically add a wall hung seat. Thus the parallel
approach as shown in Figure 7(d) is essential in order to be able to transfer from the wheelchair to the shower seat.



27. Tub Controls 


Q. Do the Guidelines set any requirements for the type or location of bathtub controls? 
A. No, except where the specifications in Requirement 7(2)(b) are used. In that case, while the type of control is not
specified, the control must be located as shown in Figure 8 of the Guidelines. 


28. Paragraph (b) Bathrooms 


Q. If an architect or builder chooses to follow the bathroom specifications in Requirement 7, Guideline 2, paragraph
(b), where at least one bathroom is designed to comply with the provisions of paragraph (b), are the other bathrooms
in the dwelling unit required to have reinforced walls for grab bars? 
A. Yes. Requirement 6 of the Guidelines requires reinforced walls in bathrooms for later installation of grab bars.
Even though Requirement 6 was not repeated under Requirement 7_Guideline 2, it is a separate requirement which must
be met in all bathrooms. The same would be true for other Requirements in the Guidelines, such as Requirement 5, which
applies to usable light switches, electrical outlets, thermostats and other environmental controls; Requirement
4 for accessible route; and Requirement 3 for usable doors. 


29. Bathroom Clear Floor Space 


Q. Is it acceptable to design a bathroom with an in-swinging 2
'10
'
' door which can be retrofitted to swing out in order to provide the necessary clear floor space in the bathroom?

A. No. The requirements in the Guidelines must be included at the time of construction. Thus, for a bathroom, there
must be sufficient maneuvering space and clear floor space so that a person using a wheelchair or other mobility aid
can enter and close the door, use the fixtures and exit. 


30. Lavatories 


Q. Would it be acceptable to use removable base cabinets beneath a wall-hung lavatory where a parallel approach is
not possible? 
A. Yes. The space under and around the cabinet should be finished prior to installation. For example, the tile or other
floor finish must extend under the removable base cabinet. 


31. Wing Walls 


Q. Can a water closet (toilet) be located in an alcove with a wing wall? 
A. Yes, as long as the necessary clear floor space shown in Figure 7(a) is provided. This would mean that the wing wall
could not extend beyond the front edge of a lavatory located on the other side of the wall from the water closet. 


32. Penalties 


Q. What types of penalties or monetary damages will be assessed if covered multifamily dwellings are found not to be
in compliance with the Fair Housing Act? 
A. Under the Fair Housing Act, if an administrative law judge finds that a respondent has engaged in or is about to engage
in a discriminatory housing practice, the administrative law judge will order appropriate relief. Such relief may
include actual and compensatory damages, injunctive or other equitable relief, attorney's fees and costs, and may
also include civil penalties ranging from $10,000 for the first offense to $50,000 for repeated offenses. In addition,
in the case of buildings which have been completed, structural changes could be ordered, and an escrow fund might be
required to finance future changes. 
Further, a Federal district court judge can order similar relief plus punitive damages as well as civil penalties
for up to $100,000 in an action brought by a private individual or by the U.S. Department of Justice.

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This rulemaking amends miscellaneous hazardous liquid and carbon dioxide pipeline safety standards to provide
clarity, eliminate unnecessary or overly burdensome requirements, and foster economic growth. The changes result
from the regulatory review RSPA carried out in response to the President's directive of January 28, 1992, on reducing
the burden of government regulation. The changes reduce costs in the liquid pipeline industry without compromising
safety.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

Background 



In a January 28, 1992, memorandum, the President wrote to Department and agency heads about the need to reduce the burden
imposed by government regulation. The President was concerned that agencies were not doing enough to review and revise
existing regulations to eliminate unnecessary and overly burdensome requirements. The President recognized that
regulations that do not keep pace with new technologies and innovations impose needless costs and impede economic
growth. 

In response to the President's memorandum, DOT published a notice requesting public comment on the Department's
regulatory programs (57 FR 4745; Feb. 7, 1992). Commenters were asked to identify regulations that substantially
impede economic growth, may no longer be necessary, are unnecessarily burdensome, impose needless costs or red tape,
or overlap or conflict with other DOT or federal regulations. The deadline for submitting comments was March 2, 1992.


RSPA received comments from six organizations about the pipeline safety regulations in part 195. Comments were from
three regulated pipeline companies, a pipeline trade association, a state pipeline safety agency, and a federal
agency. RSPA considered all comments in its review of the regulations, and these comments are available in the docket.
Some comments will be considered in future rulemakings. Additionally, RSPA has published a separate rulemaking
``Update of Standards Incorporated by Reference'' (58 FR 14519; March 18, 1993) which updates the editions of the
industry standards that are incorporated in part 195. 

On November 27, 1992, RSPA published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, NPRM, (57 FR 56304) proposing 18 changes to the
regulations based on the comments received from the public and asked for further comments regarding the proposed
changes. RSPA received comments from 21 organizations: 15 pipeline companies, 3 pipeline trade associations, 2
environmental organizations, and 1 county government. RSPA considered all comments in preparation of the final
rulemaking and the comments are available in the Docket.

Advisory Committee 



The Technical Hazardous Liquid Pipeline Safety Standards Committee (THLPSSC), consisting of 15 members, was established
by statute to consider the feasibility, reasonableness, and practicability of proposed pipeline regulations.
RSPA implemented the committee balloting process by mail. After initial balloting, the process allowed each member
to review the ballots, including comments, of all other members, and to change his or her vote or initial comment if
desired. Although some THLPSSC members did not vote on every proposed change, a tally of the second ballots showed
that a large majority of THLPSSC members found all the proposed changes technically feasible, reasonable, and practicable.
Nonetheless, in developing the final regulations, RSPA considered all final THLPSSC votes and comments, including
minority positions. The following discussion explains how RSPA treated THLPSSC positions and public comments on
the proposed amendments in developing the final rule. 



Changes to Part 195 Safety Standards 



The following discussion explains the changes to various standards in part 195: 



Section 195.1 Applicability. 





Offshore production.

 Part 195 does not apply to pipelines used in offshore production, whether on the Outer Continental Shelf or in state
offshore waters. However, this exception is clearly stated in part 195 only for production on the Outer Continental
Shelf ( 195.1(b)(5)). To clarify that all offshore pipelines used in production are outside part 195, RSPA
proposed to delete from  195.1(b)(5) the phrase ``on the Outer Continental Shelf''. 

The 10 THLPSSC members who voted on the proposed amendment to  195.1(b)(5) all approved the amendment. 

In addition, RSPA received comments from three operators and two pipeline-related associations in support of the
amendment and no adverse comments. Therefore,  195.1(b)(5) is amended as proposed in the NPRM. 

We also requested comments on whether there is a gap in the regulation of production lines in state offshore waters.
Only one commenter responded. This commenter opined that existing state and federal programs adequately regulate
production lines in state waters. In Louisiana, the Departments of Natural Resources and Environmental Quality
were said to have comprehensive regulations on facility installation, operation, integrity, and removal, and sufficient
authority to address any ``gap'' that is identified. Since the other states with production lines in state waters
have similar regulations, RSPA does not believe there is a gap in the regulation of production lines in state waters.




In-plant piping.

 Part 195 does not apply to pipeline transportation through onshore production, refining, or manufacturing facilities,
or storage or in-plant piping systems associated with such facilities ( 195.1(b)(6)). Because the physical
distinction between a regulated pipeline serving a plant and unregulated in-plant piping is unclear, RSPA proposed
to add a definition of ``in-plant piping system'' to  195.2. The definition proposed was: ``

In-plant piping system

 means piping that is located on the grounds of a plant and used to transfer hazardous liquid or carbon dioxide between
plant facilities or between plant facilities and a pipeline, not including any device and associated piping that
are necessary to control pressure in the pipeline.'' The NPRM explained that we would consider in-plant piping to
extend to the plant boundary in the absence of a necessary pressure control device on plant grounds. 

All ten THLPSSC members who voted on this proposal supported it. However, four members believed that because the NPRM
primarily concerned pipeline transportation rather than production, refining, or manufacturing plants, it did
not give plant owners adequate notice that the proposed definition could affect plant piping. These members wanted
RSPA to publish a separate NPRM on the subject of in-plant piping.

RSPA does not agree that another NPRM is needed. The subject of in-plant piping and the associated issues were clearly
discussed in the published NPRM. Also, all interested persons, including plant owners as well as pipeline operators,
were given an opportunity to comment on the subject of in-plant piping. 

RSPA received comments on the proposed definition from seven operators, two pipeline-related associations, and
one state agency. Two operators and one association fully supported the proposal. 

One operator and a pipeline-related association thought plant owners were not adequately notified of the proposed
rule, and that RSPA should treat the subject in a separate NPRM. Our position on this issue is given supra in response
to a similar criticism by four THLPSSC members. 

Another operator was concerned that the proposed definition would cause operator-owned components, such as pipe,
meters, instruments, and manifolds, that are located on plant grounds downstream from the operator's pressure control
device to fall outside part 195. The operator was worried that other agencies would regulate these components as non-transportation
related facilities. We are not persuaded, however, that the potential for such regulation is sufficient reason to
exclude the components from the definition of in-plant piping system. The aim of the proposed definition was to distinguish
unregulated piping, not to limit the jurisdiction of other government agencies. 

In contrast, an operator of gathering and processing facilities was concerned that part 195 would apply to plant piping
that lies between any necessary pressure control device and the connection to a pipeline. This commenter apparently
did not realize that such piping is subject to part 195. RSPA has applied part 195 to such piping because it is subject
to pressure which is controlled by a device operators must have to meet  195.406(b). However, this application
has had little effect on plant owners, because we hold the pipeline operator, not the plant owner, responsible for
compliance. 

An operator commenting on the plant device exclusion in the proposed definition advised us to change ``control pressure''
to ``prevent overpressure.'' This commenter said the change would avoid making pipeline operators responsible
under part 195 for nonessential pressure control devices. We agree the suggested rewording would better convey the
intent of the proposal. But, in the final definition, we have changed ``control pressure in the pipeline'' to ``control
pressure in the pipeline under  195.406(b)'' to convey the intent even more precisely.

The state agency commented that if piping on plant grounds does not include a device necessary to control pipeline
pressure, the jurisdiction of part 195 over the pipeline should not end at the plant boundary. Instead, the state agency
recommended ending jurisdiction at a component inside the plant, such as a flange, where the pipeline can be isolated
for purposes of testing. Although operators may use such components, part 195 does not require that they be on the pipeline.
Also, we believe the plant boundary is a more convenient demarcation of in-plant piping than an unspecific inside-the-plant
component. Thus, the state agency's comment is not incorporated in the final definition. 

The state agency, an operator, and a pipeline-related association were concerned that because segments of transfer
piping located off plant grounds were not included in the proposed definition, a large number of short pipelines would
come under part 195. RSPA recognizes that production, refining, or manufacturing plants often install transfer
piping off plant grounds. A plant may use this piping to transfer hazardous liquids between its different facilities
located on the same grounds; between its different facilities located on separate grounds (usually separated by
a roadway, railway, waterway, or industrial area); between its facilities and a transportation system, such as a
railroad or pipeline; or between its facilities and the facilities of another plant or industrial consumer. The three
commenters thought the off-grounds segments should qualify as in-plant piping if they connect facilities of the
same plant. The association also wanted to include under the definition off-grounds segments that connect facilities
of different plants. In addition, the operator and association argued that the off-grounds segments pose minimum
risk to public safety and the environment, because the segments generally are located in industrial areas, roadways,
or railways. The association further argued that a plant has the same operational control, including response capability,
over the off-grounds segments as it does over piping on plant grounds. 

In response to these comments, we note that  195.1(b)(6) echoes section 201(3) of the Hazardous Liquid Pipeline
Safety Act of 1979 (HLPSA), (49 U.S.C. app. 2001(3)), which excludes certain ``in-plant piping systems'' from regulation
under the HLPSA. Since neither the HLPSA nor its legislative history explain ``in-plant piping,'' we adopt an ordinary,
reasonable understanding of the term. Therefore, we do not accept the interpretation that the term includes piping
that crosses the property of others outside plant grounds. However, many plants are separated by a public thoroughfare,
and plant transfer piping crosses the thoroughfare. A single public thoroughfare would include any road, from a country
lane to an interstate highway, but it does not include a railroad. Because transfer piping that crosses such thoroughfares
is comparable in most respects to other in-plant piping, RSPA considers the in-plant piping exception to include
the thoroughfare crossings. The thoroughfare exception does not apply to inter-facility lines or delivery lines,
because these lines are distinct from in-plant piping. We did not intend the proposed definition of ``in-plant piping
systems'' to expand our present interpretation of the term. So the final definition does not incorporate any of the
comments concerning piping located off plant grounds other than for thoroughfare crossings. 

However, the proposed definition's first use of the term ``pipeline'' is changed to ``pipeline or other mode of transportation.''
This change is needed to include, within the definition, piping on plant grounds that transfer hazardous liquid or
carbon dioxide between plant facilities and modes of transportation other than pipeline. 



Terminal facilities. 

Part 195 does not apply to the transportation of hazardous liquid or carbon dioxide by vessel, aircraft, tank truck,
tank car, or other vehicle, or by terminal facilities used exclusively to transfer hazardous liquid or carbon dioxide
between such modes of transportation ( 195.1(b)(7)). RSPA proposed to amend  195.1(b)(7) to clarify
that terminal facilities located off terminal grounds are subject to part 195, and to distinguish unregulated terminal
facilities from a regulated pipeline entering or leaving the terminal. As with the proposed in-plant piping definition,
any device and associated piping on terminal grounds necessary to control pressure in a regulated pipeline would
not be excepted from part 195.

The THLPSSC voted to approve this proposal, but four members believed the NPRM did not give terminal owners adequate
notice that the proposed amendment could affect their piping. These members wanted RSPA to publish a separate NPRM
on the subject. For the reasons stated supra in response to a similar argument by these THLPSSC members concerning
in-plant piping, RSPA does not agree that another NPRM is needed. 
Five operators and two pipeline-related associations commented on the proposed amendment to  195.1(b)(7).
Of these commenters, two operators and one association agreed with the proposal. 
A few commenters expressed the same concerns about the proposed amendment to  195.1(b)(7) as they did about
the proposed in-plant piping definition. These concerns were that the NPRM did not adequately notify plant (terminal)
owners of the proposed rule, and that some operator-owned components located on plant (terminal) grounds would fall
outside part 195. Our response to these concerns is the same as stated supra regarding in-plant piping. 
In regard to transfer lines located outside terminal grounds at ports, an operator and a pipeline-related association
pointed out that the U.S. Coast Guard regulates transfers between terminal storage and dock facilities. These commenters
suggested that RSPA and Coast Guard develop a memorandum of understanding to limit Coast Guard's regulations to dock
facilities. 
We recognize that Coast Guard and RSPA jurisdictions overlap in port areas, but the two agencies have different responsibilities.
Also, the overlap does not automatically result in regulatory conflicts, and the commenters did not mention any.
Nonetheless, though we have not changed the final rule as a result of this comment, in enforcing part 195 at port areas,
RSPA will act appropriately to resolve any unnecessary regulatory burdens. 


Carbon dioxide injection system.

 Section 195.1(b)(8) provides that part 195 does not apply to ``[t]ransportation of carbon dioxide downstream from
a point in the vicinity of the well site at which carbon dioxide is delivered to a production facility.'' RSPA proposed
to amend this section to clarify that the exception covers pipelines used in the injection of carbon dioxide for oil
recovery operations. 
The THLPSSC approved the proposed amendment (10 voted in favor and 5 did not vote), and we received no adverse comments
from the public. The proposed amendment to  195.1(b)(8) is, therefore, adopted as final. 


Section 195.2 Definitions. 


The proposed revision of the definition of ``Secretary'' is not adopted in this rulemaking. Instead, it is being handled
in an omnibus rulemaking covering all regulations involving pipeline safety. 
The definition of ``In-plant piping system'' is discussed above in  195.1 Applicability. 
Two commenters objected to the proposed definition for petroleum products because of its use of the terms ``flammable'',
``toxic'', and ``corrosive'' which are not defined under part 195. The commenters stated that absent specific definitions
for these terms, their applicability could be unclear. 
RSPA agrees with the comments about the lack of clarity in the proposed definition for petroleum products. So, the
final rule for this section includes new definitions for ``flammable'', ``toxic'', and ``corrosive'' that come
from the definitions contained in 49 CFR part 173 for Transportation and Packaging of Hazardous Materials for the
terms ``flammable liquid'', ``poisonous material'', and ``corrosive material'', respectively. RSPA has adopted
the definition of ``poisonous material'' for ``toxic'' because it considers the terms synonymous. 



Sections 195.2, 195.106, 195.112, 195.212 and 195.413 (Nominal Outside Diameter of the Pipe in Inches) 


RSPA proposed to standardize the dimensioning of pipe size throughout part 195 (Changes are made to   195.2,
195.106(b), 195.106(c), 195.112(c), 195.212(b)(3)(ii) and 195.413(a)). All 10 THLPSSC members who voted were
in favor of the proposal and no commenter objected thereto. Accordingly, the proposed amendment is adopted as final.



Section 195.3 Matter incorporated by reference. 


Section 195.3 sets out the general requirements for the incorporation in the regulations of industry standards for
the design, construction and operation of hazardous liquid and carbon dioxide pipelines. Paragraph 195.3(a) states
that incorporation of a document by reference has the same force as if the document were copied in the regulations.
Some operators have misinterpreted this section to mean that they must comply with all of the terms contained in a referenced
document. Accordingly, RSPA hereby revises  195.3(a) to clarify that an entire document is not incorporated
when the document is incorporated by reference; rather, only those portions specifically referenced in the regulations
are incorporated. 
The rule is being revised to conform to a recent update of references in another rulemaking (Update of Standards Incorporated
by Reference (58 FR 14519; March 18, 1993)). Also, references to ASME/ANSI Codes B31.8 and B31.G are being added. The
10 THLPSSC members who voted and 7 commenters favored the revision.

Section 195.5 Conversion to service subject to this part.


Section 195.5 regulates the conversion of steel pipelines to hazardous liquid or carbon dioxide service that is subject
to part 195. Under  195.5(a)(4), a converted pipeline must be hydrostatically tested to substantiate the maximum
operating pressure (MOP) permitted by  195.406.
 




To substantiate the MOP of a converted pipeline, an operator must know the pipe design pressure (see current  195.406(a)(1)).
Consequently, if pipe design pressure is unknown, a steel pipeline may not be converted under  195.5. Although
the design pressure of components is an MOP factor under  195.406(a)(2), pipeline components are normally
designed to be as strong or stronger than attached pipe. Thus, pipe design is the critical factor in substantiating
MOP under  195.5(a)(4), and lack of knowledge of component design pressure is not a significant safety concern.

RSPA proposed to amend  195.5 to permit conversion using an approach found in section 845.214 and Appendix N
of ASME B31.8 for gas pipelines whose design pressure is unknown. Under this proposal, operators would pressure test
the pipeline under Appendix N until pipe yield occurs. Instead of design pressure, this yield test pressure would
be used to compute MOP by applying certain reduction factors to 80 percent of the first pressure that produces pipe
yield. 
All THLPSSC members who voted on the proposed amendment to  195.5 supported it in concept. However, two members
thought the wording of Appendix N should be copied directly into part 195 to avoid referencing a gas pipeline code in
liquid pipeline regulations. We believe the principles of Appendix N apply equally to gas and liquid pipelines. And
since the B31.8 Code is widely used, operators of hazardous liquid or carbon dioxide pipelines will not find it difficult
to obtain and apply Appendix N. 
RSPA received five comments on the proposed amendment to  195.5. Two operators and a pipeline-related association
agreed with the proposed amendment. 
One operator suggested that if pipelines operating at less than 20 percent of specified minimum yield strength (SMYS)
are subject to  195.5, RSPA should allow operators up to 10 years to meet the testing requirements. At present,
none of the standards in part 195, including  195.5, applies to pipelines operating at less than 20 percent of
SMYS (see  195.1(b)(3)). However, this commenter may have had in mind  206 of the Pipeline Safety Act of
1992 (Pub. L. 102-508), which provides that exceptions to regulations under the Hazardous Liquid Pipeline
Safety Act of 1979 (49 U.S.C. app. 2001 

et seq.

), such as part 195, may not be based solely on low internal stress. Because of this statutory mandate, RSPA has proposed
to apply part 195 to certain low-stress hazardous liquid pipelines (Docket PS-117; 58 FR 12213; March 3, 1993).
Still, that proposal would not require any existing low-stress hazardous liquid pipeline to be tested under  195.5,
because such pipelines would not be converted pipelines. Of course, if part 195 becomes applicable to low stress pipelines,
any pipeline converted to low stress hazardous liquid service subject to part 195 would have to be tested under  195.5.
But, since testing is the backbone of the conversion process, RSPA does not believe  195.5 should be amended
to extend the time for testing to 10 years. 
A state agency was concerned that if test pressure must be measured at the high elevation point of test segments, the
test could stress the low point of the segment beyond yield. However, the Appendix N test method should not result in
overstress at the low elevation, because the method does not require increases in test pressure after the first yield
occurs in the test segment. 
In a separate rulemaking proceeding (Docket No. PS-124; 57 FR 39572; August 31, 1992), RSPA proposed to allow
the use of the Appendix N method in converting pipelines to gas service under 49 CFR 192.14. This gas pipeline conversion
standard is similar to  195.5. Comments to that notice argued that pressure testing to yield is unnecessary
to qualify certain pipelines that operate at low stress (generally pipelines 123/4 inches or less in nominal outside
diameter operating at pressures of 200 psig or less). RSPA believes these comments are also relevant to hazardous
liquid pipelines. All other factors being equal, hazardous liquid pipelines operating at low internal stress present
less risk of failure from time-dependent defects than higher stress hazardous liquid pipelines. Because of the lower
risk, RSPA has modified the final rule to provide that pipelines 123/4 inches or less in nominal outside diameter to
be operated at a pressure of 200 psig or less may be converted without testing to yield. The MOP of such pipelines may
be determined under  195.406 by using 200 psig as pipe design pressure. 
The proposed rule has been redrafted to improve clarity, to better relate conversion to design pressure and MOP under
 195.406, and to include the changes discussed supra. In the final rule, the proposed amendment to  195.5(a)(1)
is revised and published as an amendment to  195.406(a)(1). This latter section deals specifically with pipe
design pressure and MOP. As set forth infra, revised  195.406(a)(1) provides that when pipe design pressure
is unknown for steel pipelines being converted, a reduced value of first yield hydrostatic test pressure may be used
as design pressure to compute MOP. If the pipeline to be converted is 123/4 inches or less in nominal outside diameter
and is not yield tested, 200 psig may be used as design pressure.

Section 195.8 Transportation of hazardous liquid or carbon dioxide in pipelines constructed with other
than steel pipe. 



The proposal to replace the word ``he'' with ``the Secretary'' to remove any implication of gender is not adopted in
this rulemaking. Instead, this proposal will be handled in an omnibus rulemaking to make minor clarifications and
error corrections covering all the pipeline safety regulations. 



Section 195.50 Reporting accidents and  195.52 Telephonic notice of certain accidents. 



Sections 195.50(f) and 195.52(a)(3) require operators to prepare reports and give telephonic notice of accidents,
respectively, when the estimated property damage due to an accident exceeds $5,000. RSPA discovered from its regulatory
review and previous enforcement cases that a significant amount of confusion exists among pipeline operators as
to which cost estimates must be included in calculating the ``estimated property damage to the property of the operator
or others * * *'' Frequently, when reporting accidents, pipeline operators fail to include as ``property
damage'' the fair market value of the product released or those costs associated with clean-up and recovery efforts.
RSPA believes these costs should be included when reporting accidents. 

Because the $5,000 reporting requirement requires the reporting of minor accidents, RSPA proposed amending   195.50(f)
and 195.52(a)(3) to increase the reporting threshold to $50,000, the same level as required in 49 CFR part 192 and to
include as property damage the value of the product released and the costs associated with clean-up and recovery efforts.
The THLPSSC voted 10 to 0 in favor of the change (5 members did not vote). Two of those favoring the proposed changes recommended
that RSPA modify the final rule to limit property damage to fair market value of the lost product and initial clean-up
and product recovery costs. One member said that clean-up and recovery costs should not be included in total property
damage.

Three commenters disagreed with the proposed changes and recommended that the rule be withdrawn. One complaint was
that the statistical base would be discontinuous because, in the future, RSPA would not receive information on accidents
costing between $5,000 and $50,000. Another complaint was that the change could affect the development of environmental
protection requirements. RSPA understands that a change in reporting levels will cause a slight skewing due to truncation
of the data, but believes requiring operators to report accidents based solely on the $5,000 property damage criterion
is unnecessary and burdensome. Significant accidents will still be reported because the other criteria (especially
those that are environmentally related) requiring reports will be unchanged: (1) Explosion or fire, (2) loss of 50
barrels of liquid, (3) escape of five barrels a day of highly volatile liquids, (4) a death, (5) bodily harm, or (6) resulted
in the pollution of any stream. Because these requirements remain unchanged, those operators with more frequent
small releases will still be identified. As to a skewing of the data, those organizations that keep track of such statistical
data should be able to make adjustments to account for such changes. Also, as explained in the NPRM, this change will
make the liquid safety reporting requirements consistent with the gas safety reporting requirements which will
eliminate confusion. The rule change should have little, if any, effect on the environment because the same spill
volume reporting criteria remain in effect. Only the dollar level of the reporting criterion is being changed.

Two commenters supported the rule changes as they were written. Five others favored the changes, but proposed modification
of the rules to explain more fully the meaning of ``estimated total damage'' in order to spell out the items that must
be covered. They said that ``estimated total damage'' is ambiguous and confusing and subject to interpretation.
One commenter stated that the costs of subsurface restoration should be excluded from property damage because it
is nearly impossible to estimate the subsurface restoration costs within the time allowed to report the accident.
RSPA agrees that early estimates of the costs to clean-up a liquid spill may not be exact; however, the operator should,
at a later date, submit a revised report that provides more reliable cost figures for the clean-up.

RSPA is clarifying the issue by amending  195.50(f) to read: ``(f) Estimated property damage, including cost
of clean-up and recovery, value of lost product, and damage to the property of the operator or others, or both, exceeding
$50,000'' and  195.52(a)(3) to read: ``(3) Caused estimated property damage, including cost of clean-up and
recovery, value of lost product, and damage to the property of the operator or others, or both, exceeding $50,000.''

Section 195.106 Internal design pressure. 


Section 195.106(a) prescribes the formula for calculating the design pressure of steel pipe. In addition,  195.106(b)
regulates the pipe yield strength used in the design pressure formula. When the specified minimum yield strength
(SMYS) of pipe is unknown,  195.106(b) requires that yield strength be derived from tensile tests on random
samples of pipe. Based on a comparable gas pipeline safety standard (49 CFR 192.107(b)(2)), RSPA proposed to amend
 195.106(b) to allow operators to use 24,000 psi as yield strength if pipe of unknown SMYS is not tensile tested.
Editing changes to  195.106(b) were also proposed. 
The 10 THLPSSC members who voted on the proposed amendment of  195.106(b) supported it (5 did not vote). In addition,
RSPA received comments from four operators and one pipeline-related association. The association and three of the
operators agreed with the proposal. One of these operators suggested further editing, part of which RSPA has included
in the final rule.

One operator was concerned that the proposed rule could unjustifiably reduce the MOP of its pipelines. The operator
said its pipelines are made of Grade B pipe (yield strength at least 35,000 psi) or better. However, some pipelines
may contain pipe for which documentation of yield strength or tensile testing does not exist. For such pipe, without
new tensile testing, yield strength would have to be assumed to be 24,000 psi. The operator suggested that RSPA allow
operators to use appropriate evidence besides tensile tests to demonstrate the yield strength of pipe.

In response to this comment, we note, first, that the proposed amendment to  195.106(b) would not affect the
design pressure of existing pipelines unless they are replaced, relocated, or otherwise changed (see  195.100).
Second,  195.106(b) currently requires operators to use as yield strength either SMYS or a value based on tensile
testing. So the operator's apparent difficulty in verifying yield strength is a problem of compliance with the current
rule. Third, the proposed rule would relax the burden of tensile testing only when MOP does not exceed the level that
corresponds to a yield strength of 24,000 psi. When a higher MOP is desired, operators must use the tensile testing
option. Finally, RSPA is not aware of any acceptable evidence of the yield strength of pipe of unknown SMYS apart from
appropriate tensile testing. Thus, the amendments to  195.106(b), as discussed above, are adopted.



Section 195.204 Inspection-general. 


The THLPSSC voted 10 to 0 in favor of the proposed change to make the language gender neutral and, except for a minor correction,
no objections were received from commenters. The proposed change is adopted as corrected.



Section 195.228 Welds; standards of acceptability. 


One of the comments we received on proposed amendments to nondestructive testing requirements under  195.234(e)
(discussed infra) concerned the standards for acceptance of weld flaws ( 195.228(b)). A pipeline-related
association asked us to incorporate by reference the alternative acceptance standards for girth welds that are in
the Appendix to American Petroleum Institute (API) Standard 1104 (17th edition). For weld acceptability,  195.228(b)
now references the standards in Section 6 of API Standard 1104.

In a notice of proposed rulemaking involving our review of the gas pipeline safety standards in 49 CFR part 192 (Docket
PS-124; 57 FR 39572; August 31, 1992), RSPA proposed to allow gas operators to apply the API appendix in addition
to section 6 criteria. Although that proposal was based on a petition by API to incorporate the appendix by reference
in both parts 192 and 195, we overlooked the request to include such a proposal in the present rulemaking.

In the part 192 rulemaking, RSPA's gas pipeline safety advisory committee voted to support the proposed amendment.
Also, all but one of the public comments were in favor of allowing use of the Appendix of API Standard 1104.

The dissenting commenter was concerned that industry inspection personnel may not be qualified to apply the appendix.
However, this commenter may not have recognized that under   192.243(b) and (c), operators must ensure
that nondestructive testing is performed in accordance with written procedures by persons who have been properly
trained and qualified. Sections 195.234(b) and (c) provide similar requirements for nondestructive testing of
welds on hazardous liquid and carbon dioxide pipelines. RSPA believes these requirements are adequate to assure
proper application of the appendix.

The Appendix of API Standard 1104 applies equally to girth welds in gas and liquid pipelines. This amendment is not
mandatory, rather it provides pipeline operators an optional operating procedure. In view of the prior opportunity
for public comment on use of the appendix for gas pipelines, the favorable response by public commenters and RSPA's
advisory committee, and the fact that use of the appendix would not be mandatory, we believe that a further opportunity
for public comment is unnecessary to allow use of the appendix under  195.228(b). We feel this amendment is a
logical outgrowth of the Notice and furthers our efforts to make parts 192 and 195 consistent wherever possible. This
amendment will not have a substantial impact on the regulated community.

Thus, in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(3)(B), we are amending  195.228(b) to reference the appendix without
further rulemaking notice. However, should any person be adversely affected by this decision or wish to change the
final rule, that person may submit a petition for reconsideration under RSPA's rulemaking procedures in 49 CFR 106.35.


The final rule provides that the appendix may be used only for girth welds to which the appendix applies. For example,
as section A.1 of the appendix states, neither welds in pump stations nor welds used to connect fittings and valves
are covered by the appendix. Also, the appendix applies only to girth welds between pipe of equal nominal wall thickness.




Section 195.234 Welds: Nondestructive testing. 



Section 195.234(e) requires that ``100 percent of each day's girth welds installed in * * * [certain]
locations must be nondestructively tested 100 percent unless impracticable, in which case at least 90 percent must
be tested.'' RSPA proposed to amend  195.234(e) to clarify that ``90 percent'' pertains to the number of girth
welds that must be tested over their entire circumference. 

In addition,  195.234(g) requires: ``At pipeline tie-ins 100 percent of the girth welds must be nondestructively
tested.'' RSPA proposed to clarify that this standard applies to tie-ins of replacement sections of pipeline. 

The THLPSSC supported the proposed amendments, although one member thought part 195 should define the word ``impracticable.''
We did not adopt this recommendation because the word is used in its ordinary dictionary sense. 

Three operators and two pipeline-related associations commented on the proposed amendments. Three commenters
agreed with the proposal, one suggested editing changes, and one made a related proposal discussed supra under the
heading, `` 195.228(b) Welds; standards of acceptability.'' Although we did not adopt all the editing suggestions,
these comments helped us provide clarity to the final rule. 

In addition, one commenter thought the proposed amendment of  195.234(g) was unnecessary because  195.200
already indicates that  195.234(g) applies to replacement sections. Moreover, the commenter thought adding
the proposed phrase to  195.234(g) would create confusion over whether   195.234(a) through (f)
apply to replacement sections. While these observations have theoretical merit, in practice, some operators have
failed to recognize that ``pipeline tie-ins'' include tie-ins of replacement sections. The clarifying phrase adds
emphasis where it is apparently needed to assure compliance with the full extent of the rule. Section 195.234(g) is,
therefore, adopted as proposed. 



Sections 195.246 Installation of pipe in a ditch and 195.248 Cover over buried pipeline. 



Section 195.246(b) is inconsistent with  195.413(b)(3) for pipe in the Gulf of Mexico and its inlets (See  195.2
Definitions) under water less than 15 feet deep but at least 12 feet deep, because  195.246(b) permits the pipe
to be without cover or to be above the seabed if properly protected. Such pipe is a ``hazard to navigation'' under the
definition of that term in  195.2, and must have the minimum cover required by  195.413(b)(3). In addition,
  195.248(a) and (b) are inconsistent with  195.413(b)(3) for pipe in the Gulf of Mexico and its
inlets under water less than 12 feet deep. Section 195.248(a) allows pipe to be less than 12 inches below the seabed
(i.e., a hazard to navigation). In certain instances,  195.248(b) allows pipe to be without cover or less than
12 inches below the seabed. Neither condition is allowed under  195.413(b)(3). In light of these inconsistences,
RSPA proposed in the NPRM to amend   195.246(b) and 195.248(a) and (b) to correct the problem.

Ten THLPSSC members favored the proposed changes (5 members did not vote). One of the members favoring the changes
said it would make more sense to retain the existing regulation which operators have adhered to for years. In similar
manner, two commenters and one pipeline-related organization agreed with the proposal. One commenter and two pipeline-related
organizations disagreed and suggested that references to a depth of 15 feet in the rule be eliminated. RSPA proposed
changes to   195.246(b), 195.248(a) and 195.248(b) so these sections would conform with Public Law 101-599
(section 1, 104 Stat. 3038 (1990)) which requires burial of pipe where the subsurface is under 15 feet of water as measured
from mean low water. Therefore,   195.246(b), 195.248(a) and 195.248(b) are adopted as proposed in the
NPRM. 



Section 195.262 Pumping equipment. 



Section 195.262(d) regulates the location of pumping equipment. The rule prohibits the installation of pumping
equipment on property not under the operator's control. It also prohibits installation less than 50 feet from the
pump station boundary. RSPA proposed to amend  195.262(d) to clarify that these two restraints on location
apply conjunctively not alternatively. 

The THLPSSC members who voted on the proposed amendment supported it in concept, but 5 members recommended further
editing of the rule for clarity. Although three of the five persons who commented on the proposal supported it as proposed,
the other two commenters thought further clarifying changes were needed. In view of these comments and THLPSSC views,
we have modified the final rule based on identical wording suggested by five THLPSSC members and one commenter. 



Section 195.304 Testing of components. 



Section 195.304(b) excludes from hydrostatic testing under part 195 any component that is the only item being replaced
or added to a pipeline system if the component or a prototype was tested at the factory. RSPA proposed to amend  195.304(b)
to clarify that the excluded components do not include pipe. 

The THLPSSC fully supported the proposed amendment. Of the six comments from the public on the proposal, a pipeline-related
association and two operators agreed with it, while three operators suggested changes. 

An operator suggested that instead of amending  195.304(b), we should revise the definition of ``component''
to exclude pipe. We did not adopt this suggestion because the revision would affect every rule in part 195 that uses
the term ``component.'' Editing suggested by another operator was not adopted because it concerned matters not addressed
in the NPRM.

One operator felt pipe should be excluded from hydrostatic testing under  195.304(b) to the same extent as other
components. The operator said that hydrostatically testing short sections of mill tested pipe is duplicative, costly,
and not needed for safety. Although the NPRM did not propose to alter the existing requirement that replacement sections
of pipe of any length must be hydrostatically tested to part 195 standards before operation, we do not agree with this
commenter's contention. Normal pipe mill tests are not duplicative of part 195 tests, and are not a proven safe alternative
to part 195 requirements. However, for short sections of replacement pipe, part 195 test requirements could be met
anywhere, including, by prior arrangement with the operator, in the pipe mill. So if an operator wishes to avoid field
testing of short replacement sections of pipe, it only needs to assure that the mill tests of those sections were done
in accordance with part 195 test requirements. 



Section 195.406 Maximum operating pressure. 


The changes to  195.406 are discussed supra under  195.5. 



Section 195.412 Inspection of rights-of-way and crossings under 

navigable waters. 



Section 195.412(a) requires an operator, at intervals not exceeding 3 weeks, but at least 26 times each calendar year,
to inspect the surface conditions on or adjacent to each pipeline right-of-way. Because some surface condition activities
that affect the safety and operation of pipelines are more visible from aerial patrols than from walking or driving
the right-of-way, RSPA proposed that the section be changed to clarify that aerial patrols are an optional method
of compliance. No comments were received regarding the change and the THLPSSC voted 10 to 0 in favor of the change (5
members did not vote). Accordingly, the change to  195.412(a) is adopted as proposed. 


Section (b) requires operators, at intervals not exceeding 
5 years, to inspect each crossing under a navigable waterway (except offshore) to determine the condition of the crossing.

The purpose of the inspection is to look for any damage, unanticipated loading, or loss of protection that could threaten
the safety of the pipeline. We stated in the NPRM that bored crossings are usually so deep that there is little likelihood
the pipeline could be affected by waterway-related events, such as scouring or anchor dragging. We proposed to add
an exception to  195.412(b) to cover bored crossings that are too deep to be subject to waterway-related damage.


The THLPSSC voted 10 to 0 in favor of the rule (5 members did not vote). However, a state pipeline agency suggested the
existing regulation be retained. The agency stated that a pipeline operator cannot be 100 percent sure a bored crossing
is so deep it cannot be affected as stated. RSPA received four additional comments, three of which expressed an opinion
that the phrase ``too deep to anticipate damage from waterway conditions or vessel traffic'' is vague and inappropriate.
The other commenter said the proposal is unduly restrictive and should be refocused from bored crossings to a more
generic performance standard potentially including all crossings. 

In view of the comments received, RSPA agrees with those who opined that ``too deep to anticipate damage from waterway
conditions or vessel traffic'' is too vague. In the absence of a recognized standard on the subject, it is too speculative
to judge when bored crossings are buried at a sufficient depth to be safe from damage by external forces. Therefore,
it is in the interest of public safety that the current rule requiring inspection at intervals not exceeding 5 years
be retained. Accordingly, the proposed change to  195.412(b) is not adopted. 



Section 195.416 External Corrosion Control. 



Section 195.416(a) states that each operator shall, at intervals not exceeding 15 months, but at least once each calendar
year, conduct tests on each underground facility that is under cathodic protection to determine whether protection
is adequate. RSPA is clarifying the rule to reduce any misunderstanding regarding what is meant by ``underground.''
The word ``underground'' in this paragraph has meant any facility that is buried or in contact with the ground. This
rule clarification will not change the burden on operators because RSPA compliance inspectors have consistently
required any facility in contact with the ground to be cathodically protected. 

RSPA received two comments regarding the change to  195.416(a). One commenter recommended that offshore pipelines
be excluded from annual testing requirements. RSPA believes there is no acceptable substitute for regular testing
to determine if corrosion protection of all lines, both onshore and offshore, is adequate. Accordingly, ``in contact
with the ground or submerged'' is added to the rule to assure that all underwater pipelines, both onshore and offshore,
are included in the definition. The other commenter suggested requiring the testing of ``carrier pipes'' in casings.
``Carrier pipes'' are normally buried and subject to the rule. The THLPSSC voted 10 to 0 in favor of the proposed change
(5 members did not vote). The revision to  195.416(a) is adopted as modified. 

Section 195.416(f) requires that any pipe found to be generally corroded so that the remaining wall thickness is less
than the minimum thickness required by the pipe specification tolerances must either be replaced with coated pipe
that meets the requirements of part 195 or, if the area is small, must be repaired. However, the operator need not replace
generally corroded pipe if the operating pressure is reduced to be commensurate with the limits on operating pressure
specified in  195.406, based on the actual remaining wall thickness.

Section 195.416(g) states that if localized corrosion pitting is found to exist to a degree where leakage might result,
the pipe must be replaced or repaired, or the operating pressure must be reduced commensurate with the strength of
the pipe based on the actual remaining wall thickness in the pits. 
RSPA recognizes that paragraphs (f) and (g) do not provide guidance for an operator's use in determining the strength
of the actual remaining wall thickness of corroded steel pipe. To provide such guidance, RSPA proposed amending  195.416(h)
to adopt the ASME Manual B31G procedure for determining the remaining strength of corroded steel pipe in existing
pipelines. Application of the procedure was proposed to be in accordance with the limitations set out in the B31G Manual.
The rule would provide guidance as to whether a corroded region (not penetrating the pipe wall) may be left in service;
this option might require a reduction in maximum allowable operating pressure, but may be more economical than replacement
or repair of the corroded pipe. 
Ten THLPSSC members voted for the proposal (5 members did not vote). 
Comments relative to  195.416(h) were received from five commenters. One commenter said the proposal to change
 195.416(h) is inappropriate and should be redone to be consistent with  192.485. Others stated that
the proposal was unnecessarily restrictive because it did not allow the use of other proven industry developed methods
for determining the remaining strength of corroded pipelines. The most noteworthy method mentioned was ``A Modified
Criterion for Evaluating the Remaining Strength of Corroded Pipe (with RSTRENG disk)'' developed by Battelle under
the Pipeline Research Committee of the American Gas Association (AGA). (Project PR 3-805, December 1989, AGA
catalog No. L51609). Project PR 3-805 was undertaken to devise a modified criterion that, while still assuring
pipeline integrity, would eliminate as much as possible the excessive specifications embodied in the ASME B31G manual.
The AGA modified criterion, using a complex analysis approach, can be carried out by means of a PC-based program called
RSTRENG. The modified criterion can also be applied via tables or curves or a long-hand equation if a simplified analysis
is preferred. 
The addition of the modified criterion to the rule does not compromise safety because it merely accepts an established
pipeline industry guideline, and does not impose new requirements on the operators. Accordingly, RSPA is amending
 195.416(h) to include the AGA/Battelle_A Modified Criterion for Evaluating the Remaining Strength of Corroded
Pipe (with the computer disk RSTRENG). 


Rulemaking Analyses 


Impact Assessment 


This final rule is not considered a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and,
therefore, was not subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget. The rule is not considered significant
under the regulatory policies and procedures of the Department of Transportation (44 FR 11034). 
A Regulatory Evaluation has been prepared and is available in the docket. RSPA estimates the proposed changes to existing
rules would result in an estimated savings of $1,534,000 per year for the hazardous liquid pipeline industry at no
cost to the industry, and with no adverse effect on safety. As discussed above, these savings would come largely from
the use of new technology, greater flexibility in constructing and operating pipelines, and the elimination of unnecessary
requirements. 


Federalism Assessment 


RSPA has analyzed the proposed rules under the criteria of Executive Order 12612 (52 FR 41685; October 30, 1987). The
regulations have no substantial effects on the states, on the current federal-state relationship, or on the current
distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Thus, preparation of a federalism
assessment is not warranted. 


Regulatory Flexibility Act 


RSPA criteria for small companies or entities are those with less than $1,000,000 in revenues and are independently
owned and operated. Few of the companies subject to this rulemaking meet these criteria. Accordingly, based on the
facts available concerning the impact of this proposal, I certify under Section 605 of the Regulatory Flexibility
Act that this proposal would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This
rule applies to intrastate and interstate pipeline facilities used in the transportation of hazardous liquids or
carbon dioxide. 


Paperwork Reduction Act 


The documentation for the information collection requirements for part 195 was submitted to the Office of Management
and Budget (OMB) during the original rulemaking processes. Currently, regulations in part 195 are covered by OMB
Control Numbers 2137-0047 (approved through May 31, 1994), 2137-0578 (approved through October 31,
1994) and 2137-0583 (approved through May 31, 1994). There are no new information collection requirements
in this final rule.
