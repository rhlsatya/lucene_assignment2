 Proposed rule.

 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 We are proposing to revise completely subpart A of part 82 of title 9, Code of Federal Regulations, concerning exotic
Newcastle disease in birds and poultry, and psittacosis or ornithosis in poultry. We have reviewed part 82 as part
of our ongoing review of existing regulations, and believe that a complete revision of subpart A is necessary. Revising
the regulations would make them easier to understand, thereby increasing compliance with the regulations, and would
make them more effective in preventing the interstate spread of these diseases. We are also proposing to amend parts
53, 71, 92, 94, and 161 of Title 9, Code of Federal Regulations, to reflect the amendments to part 82 we are proposing.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

Background 



Part 82 



The regulations in 9 CFR part 82, subpart A, restrict the interstate movement of certain poultry, birds, and other
items from premises and areas quarantined because of exotic Newcastle disease, and psittacosis or ornithosis.

1

 These regulations are designed to prevent the interstate spread of these contagious, infectious, and communicable
diseases of birds and poultry, which could devastate the United States poultry industry. 





We have reviewed the exotic Newcastle disease and psittacosis/ornithosis regulations in accordance with our regulatory
review plan, which provides for ongoing review of existing regulations. Based on this review, we believe a complete
revision of these regulations is necessary.

We have also reviewed the regulations in 9 CFR part 82, subpart B, which provide for certain testing, restrictions
on movement, and other restrictions on certain chickens, eggs, and other articles due to the presence of 

Salmonella enteritidis

. These regulations were established in February 1990 [Docket No. 88-161, 55 FR 5576-5584] and were most
recently amended in January 1992 [Docket No. 91-193, 57 FR 776-779]. These regulations are not being revised
as part of this rulemaking.

We are proposing to revise the regulations in subpart A (referred to below as the regulations) to accomplish two goals.
One goal is to make the regulations easier to understand, thereby increasing compliance with them. The other goal
is to make the regulations more effective in preventing the interstate spread of 

exotic Newcastle disease

 and psittacosis/ornithosis. 



Psittacosis or Ornithosis



We are proposing to change the name of the disease ``psittacosis or ornithosis'' to ``chlamydiosis.'' Since the time
the regulations were last amended, accepted veterinary medical terminology has changed. The disease ``psittacosis
or ornithosis'' is now generally referred to as ``chlamydiosis.'' In this proposed rule, we will use the term ``chlamydiosis''
when referring to the disease referred to in the current regulations as ``psittacosis or ornithosis.''



Exotic Newcastle Disease



In current  82.1, 

exotic Newcastle disease

 is defined as the exotic viscerotropic type of Newcastle disease, a contagious, infectious, and communicable disease
of poultry. We are proposing to revise the definition of 

exotic Newcastle disease

 to include any velogenic Newcastle disease. (``Velogenic'' refers to the severity of the strain of the virus in question.)
Velogenic Newcastle disease is an acute, rapidly spreading, and usually fatal exotic viral disease of birds and poultry.
If there were an outbreak of any velogenic Newcastle disease in this country, it would be treated in the same way as velogenic
viscerotropic Newcastle disease.

Consistent with the change to the definition of 

exotic Newcastle disease

 we are proposing in part 82, we are proposing to amend 9 CFR parts 92, 94, and 161 to use the term ``

exotic Newcastle disease

'' instead of velogenic viscerotropic Newcastle disease (VVND), and are proposing to revise the definition of 

Exotic Newcastle disease

 in 9 CFR part 94 to make it consistent with the proposed definition in part 82.



Organizational Changes



In order to make the regulations easier to understand, we are proposing to reorganize them. Under our proposal, part
82 would be divided into three portions, instead of the current two. The first portion (proposed subpart A) would concern
quarantines and other restrictions imposed only because of 

exotic Newcastle disease

 (END). The second portion (proposed subpart B) would concern restrictions imposed only because of chlamydiosis.
Subpart C would contain the 

Salmonella enteritidis

 serotype 

enteritidis

 regulations.

The regulations in proposed subpart A would: (1) Set forth criteria for determining birds or poultry to be infected
with, exposed to, or free from END; (2) explain how and when we would impose a quarantine; (3) list specific requirements
for moving quarantined birds, poultry, and other items interstate; (4) explain how and when we would remove a quarantine;
and (5) Set forth provisions regarding replacement birds and poultry.

The regulations in proposed subpart B would: (1) set forth general restrictions on the interstate movement of poultry
infected with chlamydiosis and on the interstate movement of other items related to infected poultry; and (2) list
requirements for cleaning and disinfecting premises, vehicles, and other equipment that are or that have been used
in holding or moving poultry infected with chlamydiosis.

We are also proposing many other nonsubstantive and substantive changes to the regulations. These proposed changes,
which are all intended to make the regulations more effective in preventing the interstate spread of 

exotic Newcastle disease

 and chlamydiosis, are discussed individually below. Some of these provisions are similar or identical with regard
to both the END and the chlamydiosis regulations (proposed subparts A and B). Other changes are particular to the END
regulations (proposed subpart A). In this preamble, we discuss first those provisions that are particular to proposed
subpart A. We then discuss those provisions that are similar or identical in proposed subparts A and B.



Provisions Particular to the END Regulations



We are proposing to delete current  82.2(a). This section states that ``poultry, psittacine and mynah birds,
and birds of all other species'' are susceptible to END and, therefore, that ``the provisions of [the regulations]
shall be applicable in relation to such birds in the same manner and to the same extent as such provisions are applicable
in relation to poultry.'' This language is not needed in our proposal, because we clearly specify which requirements
apply to birds, to poultry, or to both birds and poultry.



Task Force



We are proposing to remove or replace all references to ``task force'' and ``Director of the Task Force'' in the regulations.
In order to eradicate specific outbreaks of END, we have sometimes established task forces. However, because we do
not always do so, the current regulations can be confusing.

<TEXT>
 

The only references to task forces in the current regulations are in 
  82.1 and 82.3 (a) and (b). Current  82.1 contains definitions of 

Director of the Task Force

 and 

Task Force

. Current  82.1 also contains, in the definition of 

infected group

, a requirement that the Director of the Task Force determine whether a flock or group of birds or poultry is infected
with END. Paragraphs (a) and (b) of current  82.3 provide that the Director of the Task Force may determine: (1)
Whether birds, poultry, and premises are infected with END; and (2) whether diagnostic tests are necessary to determine
if the birds or poultry are infected. 
We propose to delete the definition of 

infected group

 from current 
 82.1 and, because APHIS conducts its END program under a memorandum of understanding with the States, to provide
in proposed  82.2 that whether birds or poultry are infected with or exposed to END must be determined by either
a Federal or a State veterinarian, rather than by the Director of the Task Force. 


Basis for Determining Infection With END 


In  82.1 of the current regulations, the definition of 

infected group

 describes the methods that may be used to determine whether a flock or group of birds or poultry is infected with END.
Footnotes to that definition describe these methods of determination in greater detail. In 
this document, we are proposing to delete the definition of 

infected group

, to include the basis for determining whether birds or poultry are infected with END in proposed  82.2, and to
describe more specifically the factors that will be considered in making that determination. 
We are proposing that the determination whether birds or poultry are infected with END would be based on one or more
of the following factors: clinical evidence (signs, post-mortem lesions, and history of the occurrence of END);
diagnostic tests; or epidemiological evidence (evaluation of clinical evidence and the degree of risk posed by the
potential spread of END based on population and exposure factors, including evaluation of whether the birds and poultry
have had the opportunity to be in contact with birds or poultry infected with END or with excrement from birds or poultry
infected with END, or if they have shared feed or water with birds or poultry infected with END). 


Basis for Determining Exposure to END 


Under the current and the proposed regulations, birds and poultry determined to be exposed to END, and certain articles
related to those birds and poultry, are subject to certain prohibitions and restrictions regarding their interstate
movement. We are proposing to set forth in proposed  82.2 more specific factors for determining exposure to
END than those set forth in the definition of 

exposed group

 in  82.1 of the current regulations. The determination of whether birds and poultry are exposed to END would
be made by either a Federal or a State veterinarian and would be based on an evaluation of all related circumstances,
including: the proximity of the birds or poultry to birds or poultry infected with END, to excrement from birds or poultry
infected with END, and to other material touched by birds or poultry infected with END; the number of birds or poultry
infected with END to which the birds or poultry were exposed; the species involved; the virulence of the END to which
the birds and poultry were exposed; and the length of time the birds or poultry were in contact with birds or poultry
infected with END, and to material touched by birds and poultry infected with END. Birds or poultry determined to be
exposed to END would continue to be treated as exposed unless they are subsequently determined to be infected with
END or until either a Federal veterinarian or a State veterinarian finds them to be free of END, based on the factors
used to determine that birds or poultry are infected with END. 
We are also proposing to include in  82.1 a definition of 

exposed

 that would read as follows:

 

At risk of developing END because of association with birds or poultry infected with END, excrement from birds or poultry
infected with END, or other material touched by birds or poultry infected with END, or because there is reason to believe
that association has occurred with END or with vectors of END, as determined by either a Federal veterinarian or a State
veterinarian. 




Quarantines 


In current  82.3, we refer to the quarantining of ``premises'' containing birds and poultry that are infected
with or have been exposed to END. However, elsewhere in the regulations, we refer to quarantined ``areas'' rather
than premises. We believe this discrepancy in terms is confusing. The intent of the quarantine provisions in the current
regulations is that areas to be quarantined may include premises, but are not limited to specific premises. In this
proposed rule, we would clarify our intent by referring to quarantined areas, rather than quarantined premises.
Also, rather than providing that premises where either infected or exposed birds or poultry exist will be quarantined,
as in the current regulations, we are proposing to provide that any area where birds or poultry infected with END are
located will be quarantined. We would delineate these areas in such a way that they would be sufficient, as determined
by epidemiological evaluation, to include all known infected and exposed birds. 
Under  82.3 (a)(2) and (b)(3) of the current regulations, there are certain requirements that must be met before
we will remove a quarantine. If we have quarantined premises because of infected birds and poultry, one of the requirements
for removal of the quarantine is the destruction of all the birds and poultry on the premises where the infected birds
or poultry are located. However, if we have quarantined premises because of the presence of exposed birds and poultry,
the exposed birds and poultry do not have to be destroyed. 
Under  82.14 of the proposed regulations, all birds and poultry in an area quarantined because of the presence
of birds or poultry infected with END would not have to be destroyed_rather, only those birds and poultry determined
to be infected with END. Improved testing technology now makes it easier to determine which birds or poultry in a quarantined
area are actually infected with END. Therefore, the total number of birds and poultry that would have to be destroyed
could be lower than under the current regulations. 


Interstate Movement of Various Articles 


Both the current regulations ( 82.4) and the proposed regulations 
(  82.4 through 82.10) restrict the interstate movement of various articles, including birds and poultry,
that could carry and spread the END virus. We are proposing not only to reorganize and rewrite this material to make
it clearer and easier to follow, but we are also proposing to make substantive changes in the restrictions.

Current  82.4 prohibits the interstate movement from any quarantined area of poultry and birds that are not
being moved to a Federally inspected slaughtering establishment, and also prohibits the interstate movement from
any quarantined area of hatching eggs, carcasses, parts of carcasses, and litter. We propose to replace this general
prohibition with a list of specific articles prohibited from being moved interstate from a quarantined area (see
proposed  82.4(a)). We propose to prohibit: (1) live birds and poultry infected with or exposed to END; (2) dead
birds and dead poultry, including any parts of the birds and poultry, that are infected with END; (3) any eggs from birds
or poultry infected with END; (4) hatching eggs from birds or poultry exposed to END; and (5) litter and manure from
birds and poultry infected with END. This list does not include some articles that are prohibited under the current
regulations_

viz

, carcasses and parts of carcasses of birds and poultry in a quarantined area that are not known to be infected with END,
and hatching eggs from birds and poultry in a quarantined area that are not known to be either infected with or exposed
to END. We believe that the restrictions we are proposing to place on the interstate movement of these articles from
a quarantined area (discussed below) would allow them to be moved interstate without significant risk of spreading
END. 

Additionally, we are proposing to specify in  82.4(c) that the regulations would not apply to the interstate
movement of birds, poultry, and other articles from a quarantined area if the interstate movement is made by the United
States Department of Agriculture for purposes of research or diagnosis. We believe this provision is necessary to
allow the Department to efficiently diagnose an outbreak of END and to conduct research relating to END. 



Interstate Movement of Live Birds 



The current regulations in  82.4(c) allow the interstate movement from quarantined areas of birds that are
``personal pets'' and that are not known to be infected with or exposed to any communicable disease of poultry. We are
proposing to set forth these provisions in proposed  82.5(a), with several changes. The current regulations
require in several places that the birds be in the owner's ``possession'' or ``personal possession.'' We believe
this wording does not clearly convey our intent. We do not consider it necessary for the birds to be in physical proximity
to the owner at all times. Rather, we consider it necessary for the owner to be responsible for the location and disposition
of the birds. Therefore, we are proposing to replace the terms ``possession'' and ``personal possession'' with the
requirement that the birds be under the owner's ``ownership and control.'' 

The current regulations require ``immediate'' notification of Federal or State officials if any pet birds that have
been moved interstate from a quarantined area show signs of disease or die. We believe the term ``immediate'' might
be confusing, and, therefore, are proposing that the notification be made within 24 hours of the bird's dying or showing
clinical signs of sickness. We believe that 24 hours allows a reasonable period of time for notification, without
creating a significant risk that the disease will spread during that period. 



Interstate Movement of Live Poultry 



The current regulations restrict the interstate movement of live poultry from a quarantined area (see current  82.4(a)),
and require that they 
be moved to a Federally inspected slaughtering establishment for ``immediate'' slaughter. We are proposing to amend
these requirements (see proposed  82.5) to extend this provision to birds as well as poultry. While in most cases
birds other than poultry would not be moved to slaughter, such movement could occur in the case of ratites (e.g., ostriches),
which can be used commercially after slaughter. 

We are also proposing to require that the birds or poultry be accompanied by a permit and be slaughtered within 24 hours
of arrival at the recognized slaughtering establishment. Shipments of poultry normally arrive at slaughtering
facilities at night or early in the morning. (Currently, birds other than poultry are not being shipped to slaughter.)
They are kept under cover until the facility can handle them in turn. We believe that 24 hours provides the facility
with a reasonable amount of time to slaughter birds or poultry moved there, without posing a significant risk of disease
spread. Allowing a lengthier period of time before slaughter would unnecessarily increase the risk of END contamination
of personnel and equipment at the slaughtering establishment, and thus increase the risk that END would be carried
outside the establishment. 

We are also proposing to require that the shipment of birds or poultry be covered in such a way so as to prevent feathers
and other debris from blowing or falling off the means of conveyance. Additionally, we are proposing to require that,
except for emergencies, the birds and poultry not be unloaded until arrival at the destination listed on the permit.
We would consider events such as accidents, vehicular failure, or natural disasters to be emergencies. We believe
that each of these provisions is necessary to guard against the possibility of disease spread while the birds or poultry
are being transported. 



Interstate Movement of Dead Birds and Dead Poultry

The current regulations in  82.4 prohibit the interstate movement from a quarantined area of carcasses and
parts of carcasses of birds and poultry, including birds and poultry that are not known to be infected with END. We believe
that this provision is unnecessarily restrictive, and that carcasses and parts of carcasses of birds and poultry
not known to be infected with END can be moved interstate under certain conditions without an undue risk of disease
spread. We are therefore proposing to allow such movement, as described below. 

As noted in the preceding paragraph, the current regulations refer to ``carcasses and parts of carcasses.'' We believe
that the term ``carcasses'' might give the impression that only dressed carcasses are being referred to, such as those
handled at slaughtering establishments. In some cases in this proposed rule, that is what we are referring to. In other
cases, however, we are referring to any dead birds or poultry, whether they have been dressed or not. 

To avoid confusion as to what we are referring to, in this proposed rule we use the wording ``dead birds and dead poultry,
including any parts of the dead birds and dead poultry,'' when all dead birds and dead poultry, including dressed carcasses,
are being referred to. We use the term ``dressed carcasses'' when the intent is to limit the provisions to birds and
poultry that have been eviscerated, with heads and feet removed. 

To be moved interstate, dead birds and dead poultry that are not known to be infected with END and that are intended for
disposal, including any parts of the dead birds and dead poultry, would have to be accompanied by a permit, the dead
birds and dead poultry would have to be covered in such a way as to prevent feathers and other debris from blowing or falling
off the means of conveyance, and the dead birds and dead poultry would have to be either moved under official seal or
accompanied by a Federal representative. 

Official seal

 would be defined in  82.1 as a serially numbered metal or plastic strip, consisting of a self-locking device
on one end and a slot on the other end, that forms a loop when the ends are engaged and that cannot be reused if opened, or
a serially numbered, self-locking button that can be used for this purpose. 

The proposed regulations would not allow the unloading of the dead birds and dead poultry until their arrival at the
destination listed on the permit, and the dead birds and dead poultry would have to be moved to the destination listed
on the permit without any stops, except for normal traffic conditions. The dead birds and dead poultry would have to
be disposed of by rendering, incineration, composting, burial, or other methods approved by the Administrator as
being adequate to prevent the dissemination of END, within 24 hours of the loading for shipment of the birds and poultry.
A copy of the permit that accompanied the dead birds and dead poultry interstate would have to be submitted so that it
is received by both the State animal health official and the Veterinarian in Charge in the State of destination within
72 hours of the arrival of the dead birds and dead poultry at the destination listed on the permit. 

The requirements for the interstate movement of dressed carcasses would be largely the same as those for the interstate
movement of other dead birds and dead poultry, with the following differences: (1) The dressed carcasses would have
to be from birds and poultry slaughtered in a recognized slaughtering establishment; (2) the requirement that the
means of conveyance be covered so as to prevent feathers and other debris from blowing or falling off would not apply
to dressed carcasses; and (3) the disposal requirements described above for other dead birds and dead poultry would
not apply to dressed carcasses, which are intended for consumption. 



Interstate Movement of Manure and Litter 



Current  82.4(e) provides for the interstate movement from a quarantined area of manure from poultry or birds
that are not known to be infected with END. These provisions include requirements for heating the manure and sealing
it in an airtight container. Current  82.4(e) also requires the submission to a Federal inspector of a declaration
that provides information regarding the shipment of manure. We are proposing to retain the requirements of current
 82.4(e), and to set them forth in proposed  82.7, with several changes. 

First, we would extend the provisions that currently apply to shipments of manure to include litter as well. In proposed
 82.1, we would define 

litter

 as ``material that is used to collect and absorb bodily wastes from birds or poultry.'' This material, which commonly
consists of wood shavings or a similar material, cannot be easily separated from the bodily wastes. Second, we would
require that shipments of manure and litter be accompanied by a permit. 



Interstate Movement of Hatching Eggs 



The current regulations in  82.4 prohibit the interstate movement of hatching eggs from quarantined areas,
except for specific movements allowed by APHIS upon request and under special conditions. We believe, however, that
it is possible to establish general conditions under which hatching eggs from birds and poultry not known to be infected
with or exposed to END can be moved interstate from a quarantined area without a significant risk of spreading END.
Under these conditions, set forth in proposed  82.9, the hatching eggs would have to be accompanied interstate
by a permit. The proposed regulations would require that a copy of the permit be submitted so that it is received by both
the State animal health official and the Veterinarian in charge for the State of destination within 72 hours of the
arrival of the hatching eggs at premises designated jointly by the Veterinarian in charge and the State animal health
official. The hatching eggs would have to be held at this designated premises from the time of arrival until hatched,
and the birds and poultry from the hatching eggs would have to remain at the designated premises for not less than 30
days following hatching. During this holding period, the eggs and any birds or poultry hatched from the eggs would
be subject to any inspections, disinfections, and tests as may be required by the Administrator to determine their
freedom from END.

Interstate Movement of Eggs Other Than Hatching Eggs 


The regulations currently require table eggs to be washed and sanitized for processing before they are moved interstate
from an area quarantined because of END. (See current  82.4(b).) We propose to clarify 
this requirement in several ways. First, we propose in proposed  82.8 to amend the requirement so that it refers
to eggs, other than hatching eggs, from birds and poultry in a quarantined area that are not known to be infected with
END. Second, we propose to require that the eggs be cleaned and sanitized in accordance with regulations issued by
the Agricultural Marketing Service, as set forth in 7 CFR part 59. These provisions are clearer and more specific than
our current requirement that the eggs be ``washed and sanitized.'' They are the industry standard for cleaning eggs,
and are suitable for eggs from quarantined areas. Also, the provisions in 7 CFR part 59 include a requirement that the
eggs be sanitized using a solution containing available chlorine of between 100 and 200 ppm. This solution would kill
any END virus. 
We would also require that the eggs that are being moved be packed either in flats or cases that have not been used before,
or used plastic flats or cases that were cleaned and disinfected, since last being used, in accordance with the cleaning
and disinfection provisions set forth in 9 CFR part 71. Additionally, we are proposing to require that any containers
intended for reuse after arriving at a facility be cleaned and sanitized before being returned to premises where birds
or poultry are kept. 


Interstate Movement of Equipment 


Current  82.4(d) allows the movement of metal and hard plastic coops interstate from a quarantined area if those
items are first cleaned and disinfected under the supervision of a Federal or State inspector. Based on our experience
enforcing the regulations, we believe it is necessary to enhance our monitoring and tracking capabilities by expanding
the criteria that would have to be met before metal and hard plastic coops may be moved interstate from a quarantined
area. We would set forth these criteria in proposed  82.10. Additionally, in proposed  82.10 we would
extend these requirements to cages, containers, troughs, vehicles, and other equipment used for birds, poultry,
eggs, manure, and litter from a quarantined area. These items can be cleaned and disinfected to destroy the END virus
as effectively as can metal and hard plastic coops, using the same cleaning and disinfecting methods. For such items
to be moved interstate, they would have to be accompanied by a permit; they would have to be cleaned and disinfected
in accordance with 9 CFR part 71; the equipment would have to be inspected by a Federal or State representative after
it was cleaned but before it was disinfected; and it would have to be disinfected in the presence of a Federal or State
representative with a disinfectant listed in 9 CFR part 71. 
We are proposing to add like requirements for cleaning and disinfecting these items after they have been used to move
birds, poultry, eggs, manure, or litter interstate from a quarantined area. Proposed  82.10(b)(1) would require
that the equipment be cleaned and disinfected at the place where it is unloaded or otherwise used, within 2 hours after
unloading or use. This 2 hour time limit is proposed to provide a person with a reasonable time in which to complete the
cleaning and disinfection. We recognize that in some cases such locations may not have the facilities necessary to
readily carry out the required cleaning and disinfection. Therefore, we would provide in proposed  82.10(d),
that if the place where cleaning and disinfection would otherwise be required has no facilities for cleaning and disinfecting,
the items may be moved to a place where facilities are available for cleaning and disinfection, provided a Federal
representative or State representative has determined that such movement would not cause a risk of the spread of END.

Under our proposal, the requirements described in the preceding paragraph would not apply to equipment used by or
to move pet birds moved interstate. We believe that the proposed conditions governing the movement of pet birds interstate
would be adequate to ensure that the pet birds so moved pose an insignificant risk of being infected with END. 


Other Interstate Movements 


The current regulations provide, at  82.4(f), that the Deputy Administrator may allow, under special conditions,
the interstate movement of any poultry not known to be infected with END, even if they could not otherwise be moved under
the regulations. However, the current regulations do not allow for similar movement of articles other than poultry.
We believe that the regulations should allow for the movement of articles other than poultry that could be moved without
risk of spreading END, but that would otherwise be prohibited movement under the regulations. Therefore, we are proposing
to expand this provision to provide for the interstate movement of any restricted articles, if the Administrator
determines that the articles can be moved without spreading END. (See proposed  82.12. See also discussion
in this document under ``Internal Agency Policy.'') For these articles to be moved interstate, they would have to
be accompanied by a special permit, as we explain below under the heading ``Permits and Special Permits.'' 
Current  82.4(f) also contains material pertaining to agency management that the Administrative Procedure
Act does not require us to publish in our regulations. We are therefore proposing to delete the statement that the Deputy
Administrator will notify State officials when a permit is granted.

Removal of Quarantines 


The current regulations (current  82.3(a)(2)(i)) require the disposal of all birds and poultry in the quarantined
area that are infected with END, before we will remove the quarantine. In proposed  82.14, we are proposing that
all infected birds in the quarantined area that have been euthanized, and any other birds and poultry that died of any
other cause other than slaughter, must be disposed of by specified means. This would help ensure that the carcasses
of all birds and poultry infected with END, whether the birds and poultry were euthanized or died of the disease itself,
are disposed of in such a way as to prevent the dissemination of END. 
Current  82.3 requires that the carcasses of the birds and poultry be destroyed, buried, incinerated, or otherwise
properly disposed of as the Deputy Administrator may direct. We are proposing to make several changes in this requirement.
First, we are proposing to allow rendering or composting of the dead birds and poultry. Both rendering and composting
destroy the END virus. Second, we are proposing to delete the words ``otherwise properly disposed of as the Deputy
Administrator may direct.'' The exact meaning of this phrase is not clear. Under the proposed regulations, if a person
wants to dispose of dead birds or poultry, manure, or eggs from infected birds or poultry by using a method the regulations
do not allow, the person may be able to obtain a special permit to do so. (See ``Permits and Special Permits'' below,
regarding proposed  82.12.) 
The current regulations do not include any requirements for disposing of 
eggs, manure, and litter from infected and exposed birds and poultry before we 
remove a quarantine. However, each of these items can potentially spread END. Therefore, we are proposing to amend
the regulations to ensure that these possible sources of END infection are eliminated before we remove a quarantine.
In proposed  82.14(d), we would require either the burial, reduction to ashes by incineration, or rendering
of all eggs from birds and poultry infected with or exposed to END. In proposed  82.14(e), we would require that
all manure and litter from birds and poultry infected with or exposed to END be buried, reduced to ashes by incineration,
composted, or spread on a field and turned under. All of these methods of disposing of eggs, manure, and litter would
destroy the END virus. 
We are proposing to add specific requirements to the regulations for the disposal of articles by burial, composting,
or spreading and turning under. As noted above, burial would be an option for the disposal of birds, poultry, eggs,
manure, and litter. If burial is used for disposal, it would have to be done in the quarantined area in a location that
meets all United States Environmental Protection Agency, State, and local requirements for landfills. The articles
would have to be buried at least 6 feet deep and covered at the time of burial with soil. Requiring burial at least 6 feet
deep would prevent most burrowing animals from coming in contact with the buried material. 
Composting would be an option for the disposal of birds and poultry infected with END, and for the disposal of manure
produced by and litter used by birds or poultry infected with or exposed to END. Because of the difference in the nature
of the material being composted, the procedures for composting birds and poultry would differ from those for composting
manure and litter. 
To compost dead birds and poultry infected with END, the procedures set forth in  82.14(c)(2) of this proposed
rule would have to be followed. These procedures would require the creation of a layered mixture consisting of manure
cake (litter and manure); a carbon source such as straw, peanut hulls, or wood chips; and the birds or poultry. The mixture
would need to sit for two 30-day heating cycles, during which its internal temperature would need to reach at least
140
  F (to kill fly larvae and disease organisms). After the first 30-day heating cycle, the compost pile would have
to be turned over and aerated, to provide the oxygen necessary for the composting bacteria. Following the second 30-day
heating cycle, the mixture would need to be covered with a material that will prevent penetration of air and moisture
for an additional 30-day period. The compost pile would have to be at least 50 yards from any building or pen where poultry
or birds are housed, to guard against wind-borne transmission of material that might be contaminated with END, and
would have to be inaccessible to any poultry and birds. This requirement would also be applied to disposal of manure
and litter by spreading and turning under. 
To compost manure and litter, the procedures set forth in  82.14(e)(2) would have to be followed. The manure
and litter would have to be placed in rows 3 to 5 feet high and 5 to 10 feet at the base, be kept moist, and be kept covered.
The internal temperature of the compost pile would need to rise to at least 140
  F, and the manure or litter would have to be mixed every 10 to 15 days, in order to provide sufficient oxygen to the
composting bacteria. The composted manure or litter could not be utilized for at least 30 days from the time the 140
  F temperature is reached. 
Spreading and turning under would be an option only for the disposal of manure and litter. If the manure and litter is
spread on a field and turned under, the field would have to be in the quarantined area. The manure and litter would have
to be turned over within 24 hours of being spread on the field, and be left undisturbed for at least 30 days after being
turned under, to ensure that the END virus has become inactive. We believe a 24-hour time period for turning the manure
and litter over would be short enough to guard against transmission of the END virus, while providing a practicable
amount of time for completing the process of turning under.

The current regulations do not require cleaning and disinfection of cages, equipment, or similar articles that have
been used for END-infected birds and poultry. Since cages and other equipment that have been used to handle infected
birds and poultry could spread END, we are proposing in proposed 
 82.14(g) that, as a condition of removal of a quarantine, all cages, coops, containers, troughs, and other
equipment used for birds or poultry infected with or exposed to END, or their excrement or litter, must either be reduced
to ashes by incineration, or be cleaned and disinfected in accordance with 
9 CFR part 71. If cleaning and disinfection is chosen, it would be required that the articles be inspected after cleaning,
and before disinfection, by a Federal or State representative, and then be disinfected in the presence of a Federal
or State representative. It would be required that a disinfectant listed in 9 CFR part 71 be used. The same cleaning
and disinfecting procedures would be required for premises where birds or poultry infected with or exposed to END
were located, to prevent the transmission of END from the premises to birds or poultry. 



Miscellaneous 


Footnote 6 to current  82.4 states that we will give pet bird owners a copy of the agreement they sign and that it
will contain the names and addresses of Federal and State officials in the State where they are taking their pet birds.
This footnote also states that we will notify State officials in that State that the pet birds are being brought into
that State. None of this material is necessary as part of the regulations. Addresses of Federal and State officials
are available in local telephone directories. Because the statement that we will notify State officials relates
to agency management, the Administrative Procedure Act does not require us to publish it in our regulations. We are
therefore proposing to delete this material. 

We are proposing to delete current  82.6, which, among other things, requires the banding of certain psittacine
birds moved interstate from 
California. On March 16, 1982, we published an interim rule in the 

Federal Register

 (47 FR 11243-11246, Docket No. 82-019), amending the regulations 
to add  82.6. Then, on April 20, 1982, we published another interim rule in 
the 

Federal Register

 (47 FR 16772-16773, Docket No. 82-037) suspending the section until further notice. The reason for suspending
the section was that we could not provide necessary inspection services. Although this section has been inactive
since April 20, 1982, it has continued to appear in the Code of 
Federal Regulations. We believe this is confusing. In addition, we are still 
not able to provide the inspection services required by  82.6. Therefore, we 
are proposing to delete this section. 



Changes Affecting Both the END and the Chlamydiosis Regulations 


Certain of the substantive changes we are proposing to current part 82, subpart A, apply to both the END and the chlamydiosis
regulations. We discuss these proposed changes in the following paragraphs. 



Permits and Special Permits 


The current regulations in part 82, subpart A, regarding both END and psittacosis/ornithosis (chlamydiosis), do
not require a permit for the interstate movement of restricted items, if the items are moved in accordance with the
regulations. We are proposing to require that a permit accompany such movements (provisions regarding the issuance
of permits are set forth in proposed   82.11 and 82.23), and that a copy of the permit be received by the State
animal health official and the Veterinarian in charge for the State of destination within 72 hours of the arrival of
the shipment at the destination listed on the permit. 

An application for a permit would have to include: (1) The applicant's name and mailing address; (2) the name and mailing
address of the person who would receive the birds, poultry, or other items; (3) the addresses of both the origin and
destination of the shipment; (4) the number and types of birds, poultry, and other items intended for interstate movement;
and (5) the reason for interstate movement. 

In the case of interstate movement under the END regulations, the applicant for a permit would also be required to submit
a declaration or affidavit listing the requirements in the regulations for interstate movement of the items in question,
and stating that the applicant will move the items interstate only if all of the listed requirements are met ( 82.11(b)).
This declaration or affidavit would help us determine whether to issue a permit, by demonstrating whether the applicant
has the knowledge of the regulations necessary to comply with them. Due to the highly infectious nature of END and the
high rate of mortality it causes among birds and poultry, we consider such knowledge a critical condition for the issuance
of a permit. 

We are also proposing in both the END and the chlamydiosis regulations to provide for special permits for the movement
of restricted items interstate in any way or to any destination the regulations do not otherwise allow. Special permits
would be issued in those relatively infrequent occasions when articles could be moved without the risk of disease
spread under safeguards that are not specifically provided for in the regulations. As with permits, in the case of
interstate movements, a copy of the special permit would have to be received by both the State animal health official
and the Veterinarian in charge for the State of destination within 72 hours of the arrival of the shipment at the destination
listed on the special permit. A special permit would also be required for the disposal of items and the cleaning and
disinfection of items, vehicles, and premises using a method not provided in the regulations. (Provisions regarding
the issuance of special permits are set forth in proposed   82.12 and 82.24.) We need to have information
in our files showing when, where, and what restricted items are being moved interstate. We also need to have information
in our files showing what items have been destroyed, or cleaned and disinfected, and the method used. This information
is important in helping us trace disease outbreaks to their source and to enforce the regulations. 

In connection with the proposed permit requirements, we are proposing 
regulations that would allow us to deny an application for a permit or special 
permit and to withdraw a permit or special permit after we have issued it. (See proposed   82.13, and 82.25.)
The Administrator could deny an application if he or she determines that the applicant is not complying with or could
not comply with the regulations or any special conditions needed to prevent the dissemination of END or chlamydiosis,
or, in the case of a special permit, that it is not required under the regulations. 

Under the proposed regulations, the Administrator may withdraw a permit or special permit, orally or in writing,
if he or she determines the person to whom the permit or special permit has been issued is violating either the regulations
or some condition specified in the permit or special permit. The Administrator could withdraw the permit or special
permit without advance notice if he or she determines that the public health, interest, or safety is threatened. The
Administrator would then provide reasons in writing why he or she denied or withdrew the permit or special permit.
The proposed provisions would also provide for an appeals process. In cases where there was a conflict as to any material
fact, the person denied the permit or special permit, or from whom a permit or special permit is withdrawn, would be
given an opportunity for a hearing with respect to the merits or validity of the denial or withdrawal.

Cleaning and Disinfection 


The current regulations regarding both END and chlamydiosis also require the cleaning and disinfection of vehicles,
premises, and accessories for various reasons. (See current   82.3(a)(2)(ii), 82.4(d), and 82.5.)
We propose to make several changes in all of these regulations. (See proposed 
  82.10, 82.14, 82.21, and 82.22.) 

First, we propose to replace the word ``accessories,'' wherever it is used, with the word ``equipment.'' We believe
``equipment'' is clearer. 

Second, we are proposing to clarify which functions may be carried out by an accredited veterinarian. The current
regulations have two provisions concerning cleaning and disinfecting of vehicles, premises, and equipment for
END that specify who must supervise the work. (See current   82.4(d) and 82.5(a).) Section 82.4(d) states
that a Federal or State inspector must supervise. Section 82.5(a) states that a Federal or State inspector, or an accredited
veterinarian, must supervise. There is no reason why these requirements should be different. END is not endemic to
the United States. Should an outbreak occur, we and the States involved will handle it as an emergency, and send all
needed personnel to the scene. Therefore, we are proposing to amend the requirements to provide that only a Federal
or State representative may supervise cleaning and disinfection with regard to END. (See proposed   82.10(c)
and 82.14 (f), (g), and (h).) 

It should be noted that there are similar regulations concerning cleaning and disinfecting for chlamydiosis. These
regulations currently provide that a Federal or State inspector, or an accredited veterinarian, supervise cleaning
and disinfecting. (See current   82.5 (a), (b), and (c).) This difference between the END regulations
and the chlamydiosis regulations exists because chlamydiosis occurs sporadically in the United States, and we handle
outbreaks on a routine basis. This type of program may require that a great number of personnel be available throughout
the country. Therefore, to ensure that personnel are available when and where they are needed, we provide in the proposed
regulations that accredited veterinarians, as well as Federal representatives and State representatives, may
supervise cleaning and disinfecting for chlamydiosis. The proposed regulations clarify what is meant by ``supervise,''
as discussed in the following paragraph, but do not change who can perform the work. 

The current regulations require a Federal or State representative (or, in the case of psittacosis/ornithosis (chlamydiosis),
an accredited veterinarian) to ``supervise'' cleaning and disinfecting. It is not clear what ``supervise'' means.
We believe that requiring a Federal or State representative (or, in the case of chlamydiosis, an accredited veterinarian)
to inspect vehicles, premises, and equipment after they are cleaned, and to be present while they are disinfected,
would ensure that the cleaning and disinfecting are thorough and, therefore, effective. Accordingly, we are including
such provisions in the proposed regulations, instead of using the term ``supervise.'' 


Definitions 



We are also proposing to revise the list of definitions that apply to 
current subpart A of part 82 (current  82.1; proposed  82.1 for proposed subpart A, END; and proposed 82.19
for proposed subpart B, chlamydiosis). We are proposing to revise some of the existing definitions to make them clearer
and more exact. We are also proposing to remove some existing definitions and to add some new definitions to the definitions
already existing in current subpart A. This is necessary because the terms we use in the proposed regulations are not
all the same as the terms in the current regulations. 

We are proposing to remove the definitions of: 

Director of the task force, Deputy Administrator, exposed group, Federal inspector, infected group, psittacosis
or ornithosis, State inspector, 

and 

Task Force. 

In addition to the terms in current subpart A, except as noted above, we are proposing to include in proposed  82.1
definitions of: 

Administrator, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), dressed carcasses, exposed, Federal representative,
Federal veterinarian, hatching eggs, infected, known to be exposed, known to be infected, litter, official seal,
recognized slaughtering establishment, render, State representative, 

and 

State veterinarian. 

In addition to those terms already defined in current  82.1 for use in the psittacosis/ornithosis regulations,
we are proposing to include in proposed  82.19 definitions of: 

Administrator, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), chlamydiosis, Federal representative, Federal
veterinarian, infected,

 and 

State representative.




Internal Agency Policy 


Also, in order to reflect internal agency policy, we refer in this proposal to the ``Administrator'' when discussing
functions ascribed to the ``Deputy Administrator'' in the current regulations. For the same reason, we have replaced
the term ``Veterinary Services'' in this proposal with the term ``Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service.''




Obtaining Information 


The current regulations indicate in various places how to obtain forms, information, and help. In some cases, the
names, addresses, or 
locations given are incorrect. We are therefore proposing to update these 
references, as necessary, to include the correct names, addresses, and 
locations. 


Part 53 


Part 53 of Title 9, Code of Federal Regulations, concerns, among other things, the payment of indemnity for poultry
and materials destroyed because of contamination by or exposure to END. The definition of 

disease

 in 
9 CFR 53.1 refers to exotic Newcastle disease as ``presently existing in the States of California, Florida, New Mexico,
and Texas.'' This reference is outdated. Currently END is not known to exist in any State. Therefore, we are proposing
to revise the definition of 

disease

 in  53.1 to remove this reference.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940628-1-00011 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940628-1-00001 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The definition of 

disease

 in  53.1 also refers to ``lethal avian influenza (a disease of poultry caused by any form of H5 influenza virus
that has been determined by the Administrator to have spread from the 1983 outbreak in poultry in Pennsylvania).''
This description is outdated, and we are proposing to replace it with a description that reflects current understanding
of the disease. We would replace the reference to ``lethal avian influenza'' with a reference to ``highly pathogenic
avian influenza'' and would describe the disease as that caused by any influenza virus that results in not less than
75 percent mortality within 8 days in at least 8 healthy susceptible chickens, 4 to 8 weeks old, inoculated by the intramuscular,
intravenous, or caudal airsac route with bacteria-free infectious allantoic or cell culture fluids. 
We would also revise the definitions of 

person

 and 

State

 in  53.1 to clarify our intent as to their meaning, and make nonsubstantive wording and format changes to the
remainder of the definitions. 
Finally, we would eliminate an unnecessary cross reference in  53.2(b). 


Part 71 


Part 71 of Title 9, Code of Federal Regulations, contains general provisions regarding the interstate transportation
of animals and animal products. The regulations in Part 71 contain a reference to psittacosis or ornithosis. We are
proposing to amend this reference to use the updated name for the disease: chlamydiosis. 
Part 71 also contains regulations concerning cleaning and disinfecting. 
Section 71.7 explains methods of cleaning and disinfecting means of conveyance, facilities, and premises. Section
71.10(a) lists ``substances permitted for use in disinfecting cars, boats, other vehicles, and premises.'' Neither
of these sections covers cages, coops, containers, troughs, and other equipment, although the cleaning and disinfectants
listed are suitable and effective for cleaning and disinfecting them. The current regulations in 
part 82 (  82.4(d), 82.5(b), and 82.5(c)) require coops, containers, troughs, and other ``accessories''
to be cleaned and disinfected with a disinfectant listed in  71.10. We propose to retain this reference to part
71. Therefore, we are proposing to amend  71.10 to state that the disinfectants listed in that section can be
used on cages and other equipment. We are also proposing to amend the cleaning and disinfection instructions in  71.7
to cover cages and other equipment. 


Part 92 


Part 92 of Title 9, Code of Federal Regulations, contains requirements for the importation of certain animals into
the United States. Part 92 contains references to ornithosis. We are proposing to amend those references to use the
updated name for the disease: chlamydiosis.

Also, the current heading for part 92 reads as follows: ``Importation of Certain Animals and Poultry and Certain Animal
and Poultry Products; Inspection and other Requirements for Certain Means of Conveyance and Shipping Containers
Thereon.'' We are proposing to amend this heading to reflect the fact that part 92 also deals with the importation of
birds, and to remove excess wording. As amended, the heading for part 92 would read as follows: ``Importation of Certain
Animals, Birds, and Poultry, and Certain Animal, Bird, and Poultry Products; Requirements for Means of Conveyance
and Shipping Containers.'' 


Executive Order 12866 and Regulatory Flexibility Act 


This proposed rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12866. The rule has been determined to be not significant
for purposes of Executive Order 12866, and, therefore, has not been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget.

In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 603, we have performed an initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis regarding the impact
of this proposed rule on small entities. This proposed action may have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities. However, we do not currently have all the data necessary for a comprehensive analysis of
the effects of this rule on small entities. Therefore, we are inviting comments concerning potential impacts. In
particular, we are interested in determining the number and kind of small entities that may incur benefits or costs
from implementation of this proposed rule. 


Regulatory Authority 


In accordance with 21 U.S.C. 111-113, 114a, 115, 117, 120, 123, and 134a, the Secretary of Agriculture has the
authority to promulgate regulations and take measures to prevent the introduction into the United States and the
interstate dissemination within the United States of communicable diseases of livestock and poultry, and to pay
claims growing out of the destruction of animals. Animal health regulations promulgated by the Department under
this authority include those regarding END and chlamydiosis in 9 CFR part 82, and those regarding payment of claims
in 9 CFR part 53. 


Background 


Chlamydiosis 


Sporadic outbreaks of chlamydiosis in commercial poultry flocks have occurred in the United States over the past
decade. APHIS, working with State cooperators, has successfully eliminated chlamydiosis on each occasion. This
proposed rule includes only minor changes related to chlamydiosis, specifically the addition of a requirement for
a permit or special permit to move certain items interstate. We believe that these documents are necessary to allow
the Department to better monitor the interstate movement of the items moved. However, the economic impact from these
requirements would be negligible. 


Statement of Need for Regulatory Changes Regarding END 


From the time the southern California END emergency eradication program reached its successful conclusion in 1974
(see discussion below), the U.S. poultry and egg industries have become increasingly vertically integrated. This
vertical integration has led to further concentration of poultry and egg production in specific geographic regions
of the United States. With large numbers of poultry facilities operating in close proximity to each other, there is
an increased opportunity for another major END outbreak. Current END regulations were drafted prior to the increased
level of industry concentration, and we believe they require revisions to reflect the changes that have taken place.
Current value of the domestic poultry and egg industry is estimated to be approximately $14.9 billion. Therefore,
we believe the proposed changes to the existing END regulations are necessary due to the dynamic nature of the disease
and its continued potential to devastate an important sector of U.S. agriculture. 
Exotic birds are capable of transmitting the END virus to commercial poultry and egg flocks. Under current provisions,
APHIS routinely euthanizes entire shipments of imported birds when the END virus is detected. In the past two decades,
the domestic exotic bird industry has changed. Domestic production has intensified for those exotic species that
can be readily bred in captivity. Legal importation annually supplies the U.S. bird market with a significant number
of exotic species. The estimated value of this industry ranges between $300,000 to $500,000 annually. The actual
value of the exotic bird industry would be much higher if the value of smuggled shipments could be included in the total.
Illegal importation of exotic bird species continues to be an avenue for the introduction of END into the United States.



Proposed Rule Changes to END Regulations 


In the absence of an END outbreak, the proposed regulatory changes would have a negligible impact on the domestic poultry
and exotic bird industries. Proposed END revisions would strengthen APHIS's ability to prevent the interstate spread
of END in the event of a domestic outbreak, and in some cases relieve certain restrictions. The proposed changes include
new requirements for removing an area from quarantine; specific provisions for moving pet birds that are not known
to be infected with or exposed to END out of a quarantined area; new provisions regarding the interstate movement of
manure and litter from a quarantined area; and new provisions regarding the interstate movement of cages, coops,
and equipment from a quarantined area. A brief overview of the proposed END regulations is as follows:

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940628-1-00013 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940628-1-00001 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 



1.

 Interstate movement from a quarantined area would be prohibited for each of the following: 1) live birds and poultry
infected with or exposed to END; 2) eggs from birds or poultry infected with END; 3) hatching eggs from birds or poultry
exposed to END; 4) litter used by or manure generated by birds and poultry infected with END; and 5) dead birds and poultry,
including any parts of the birds and poultry, infected with END. 



2.

 An area would be removed from quarantine when all: 1) birds and poultry infected with END in the quarantined area have
been euthanized and all dead birds and poultry within the quarantined area have been buried, reduced to ashes by incineration,
reduced to dust by composting, or rendered; 
2) birds and poultry exposed to END have been found to be free of END: 3) eggs produced by birds or poultry infected with
or exposed to END in the quarantined area have been buried, reduced to ashes by incineration, or rendered; 4) manure
produced by or litter used by birds or poultry infected with or exposed to END in the quarantined area has been reduced
to ashes by incineration, or has been buried, composted, or spread on a field and turned under; 5) vehicles with which
birds and poultry infected with or exposed to END or their excrement or litter have had physical contact have been cleaned
and disinfected; 6) cages, coops, containers, troughs, and other equipment used for birds or poultry infected with
or exposed to END, or their excrement or litter, have been reduced to ashes by incineration or have been cleaned and
disinfected in accordance with 9 CFR part 71; and 7) the premises where birds or poultry infected with or exposed to
END were located have been cleaned and disinfected in accordance with 9 CFR part 71. 



3.

 Replacement birds and poultry would not be allowed to be placed in quarantined areas until the Administrator decides
that END has been eradicated and that replacement birds and poultry would not become infected with END. 



4.

 Eggs, other than hatching eggs, from birds and poultry not known to be infected with END could be moved interstate from
a quarantined area under the following conditions: 1) a permit has been obtained and the eggs are accompanied by the
permit; 2) the eggs have been cleaned and sanitized in accordance with 7 CFR part 59; 3) the eggs are packed either in
flats or cases that have not been used before, or in used plastic flats or cases that were first cleaned and sanitized
in accordance with 9 CFR part 71, and any of the flats and cases intended for reuse are cleaned and sanitized in accordance
with 9 CFR part 71 before being moved to a premises where birds or poultry are kept; 4) the eggs are moved interstate to
a processing facility where they are inspected to ensure they are cleaned and sanitized; and 5) a copy of the permit
is submitted to the State animal health official and the Veterinarian in charge for the State of destination. 



5.

 Hatching eggs from birds and poultry not known to be infected with or exposed to END could be moved interstate from a
quarantined area under the following conditions: 1) a permit is obtained and the hatching eggs are accompanied by
the permit; 2) birds or poultry from the eggs are held in the State of destination for not less than 30 days after hatching,
at a premises designated jointly by the Veterinarian in Charge and the State animal health official; and 3) a copy of
the permit accompanying the hatching eggs is submitted so that it is received by both the State animal health official
and the Veterinarian in charge for the State of destination within 72 hours of the arrival of the hatching eggs at the
premises where they are to be held. 



6.

 Pet birds could be moved interstate from a quarantined area provided that, among other provisions: 1) an APHIS permit
has been issued; and 2) the pet birds are not known to be infected with or exposed to END. 



7.

 Interstate movement from a quarantined area would be permitted for each of the following only if specified requirements
are met: 1) live birds and poultry, other than pet birds, that are not known to be infected with or exposed to END; 2) manure
and litter from birds and poultry exposed to END; 3) manure and litter from birds and poultry not known to be infected
with or exposed to END; 4) new or properly disinfected cages, coops, containers, troughs, vehicles, or other equipment
used to handle infected or exposed birds and poultry, and their eggs; 5) dead birds and poultry, including any parts
of the birds and poultry, that are not known to be infected with END. 



Potential Economic Impacts 



The proposed regulations would enhance APHIS's ability to monitor interstate movement of birds and poultry from
areas quarantined because of END. Domestic poultry, egg, and exotic bird operations would be impacted only in the
event of an END outbreak. There has not been a major domestic outbreak of END since an epidemic in southern California
in 1971-74. However, END is periodically detected in isolated pet bird populations. Smuggled shipments of
exotic species are the source of most outbreaks of END. Historically, APHIS has euthanized all pet birds that are found
within a store in which birds are infected with END. The proposed rule changes would enable APHIS to be more selective
and destroy only those birds and poultry that have been diagnosed as being infected with END. We expect that the savings
to the industry from this more selective euthanization would outweigh any additional restrictions that would be
imposed by the proposed rule changes. Domestic entities would not be severely impacted by either the current regulations
or the proposed rule unless an END outbreak occurs.

Estimated Economic Impact of a Major END Outbreak 



Eliminating END requires the detection of the virus in a flock, appraisal, and rapid, humane destruction of the infected
flocks. It also requires that all premises that contained infected or exposed flocks be cleaned and disinfected.
Depopulation would not occur until an appraised value was determined and the owners had signed the appropriate forms.


At the time of the 1971 END outbreak in southern California, there were approximately 1,115 commercial poultry and
bird flocks in that part of the State. Commercial flock populations ranged in size from approximately 1,000 to more
than 3.4 million birds and poultry. The estimated population of birds and poultry in southern California's commercial
operations totaled more than 38.9 million. The average poultry operation contained approximately 55,000 birds.
In southern California, the poultry industry was dominated by layer operations that produced table eggs for markets
in California and neighboring States. In addition to commercial flocks, there were approximately 39,960 backyard
poultry flocks with a total population of approximately 1 million. 

A national animal disease emergency was declared by the Secretary of Agriculture in March 1972, which placed the eight
southernmost counties in California under quarantine. The last case of END was diagnosed in June 1973, and surveillance
programs continued until July 1974. Eradicating END from the area required the destruction of nearly 12 million infected
and exposed birds and poultry. Most of the birds and poultry depopulated were laying hens. The effort cost approximately
$55 million. Approximately half ($27.5 million) was for indemnities paid to flock owners for poultry, birds, eggs,
and supplies destroyed. Approximately 91 percent of the depopulated birds and poultry were commercial layers, followed
by 6 percent for pullets and broilers, 1 percent each for turkeys and breeding poultry, and less than 1 percent each
for pigeons, backyard aviaries, game birds, and exotic birds. 

Between March 1972 and December 1987, the poultry and bird population in the original quarantined area decreased
from approximately 38.9 million to 27.6 million. Conversely, the number of commercial flocks in the 1972 END quarantined
area increased from approximately 1,115 to 1,856. The increased number of bird and poultry flocks since 1972 can be
attributed to expansion of the exotic bird industry. Importers and producers of exotic birds are not as vertically
integrated as poultry producers. More exotic bird operations also helped to account for decreases in average flock
size since 1972. Additionally, increased urbanization in traditional poultry producing sections of southern California
have forced many poultry operations to close or relocate. 

APHIS estimates that if a similar END outbreak were to occur in southern California today, up to 7.8 million birds and
poultry could be required to be depopulated, and indemnities totaling $22.3 million dollars would be paid to producers.
Newly developed diagnostic techniques should enable APHIS to be more selective when euthanizing birds and poultry
in areas quarantined because of END. Although this should result in the destruction of fewer birds and poultry, the
actual potential impact of the proposed regulations is unknown. 



Estimated Economic Impact of an Isolated END Outbreak 



Under APHIS regulations, all imported birds are quarantined for a minimum of 30 days to prevent the introduction of
foreign animal diseases, particularly END. 

Exotic bird species have been imported into the United States primarily for use as pets for several decades. During
fiscal year 1991, approximately 136 lots, totaling approximately 250,000 exotic birds, were legally imported into
the United States. Only three lots were refused entry due to END. Two of these lots, totaling 827 birds, were euthanized,
the third was returned to the country of origin. APHIS estimates that the values of the euthanized lots were approximately
$8,000 and $19,500 respectively. 

In addition to legal importation, exotic bird species are also smuggled into the United States. Birds are smuggled
for a variety of reasons, such as the avoidance of quarantine costs and illegal importation of prohibited species.
The inherent nature of smuggling makes reliable data impossible to obtain. However, APHIS estimates that the number
of smuggled birds entering the United States ranges from 100,000 to 150,000 annually. Smuggling increases the likelihood
that domestic birds and poultry could be exposed to END. 

During fiscal year 1991, an END outbreak resulted in the destruction of approximately 120 birds. APHIS estimated
the value of these euthanized birds to be approximately $40,000. Under the proposed regulations, APHIS would use
updated diagnostic techniques to determine which birds have actually been infected with END. This should permit
APHIS to be more selective when euthanasia is necessary. However, the actual potential effect of the proposed regulations
on domestic exotic bird producers is unknown.

Summary


APHIS estimates that the proposed rule changes for END would, short of a major END outbreak, have a negligible impact
on the daily activities of domestic poultry and egg producers, and on domestic producers and importers of exotic birds.
If a major outbreak occurred and an eradication program were initiated, the proposed rule changes would enable APHIS
to effectively prevent the interstate spread of END and eradicate END. Modern diagnostic techniques would enable
APHIS to determine which birds have been infected by the END virus. This would likely result in smaller quantities
of euthanized birds and poultry in areas quarantined because of END. We believe that revisions to the END regulations
are necessary to ensure that domestic poultry, egg, and exotic bird producers are protected against any potential
END outbreak. APHIS believes that the proposed regulations would effectively deal with a disease outbreak, while
at the same time imposing the minimum possible costs on affected entities.

 82.2

 Criteria for determining birds or poultry to be infected with, exposed to, or free from END.



(a) The determination that birds or poultry are infected with END must be made by either a Federal veterinarian or a
State veterinarian.

1

 They will base that determination on one or more of the following factors: clinical evidence (signs, post-mortem
lesions, and history of the occurrence of END); diagnostic tests;

2

 or epidemiological evidence (evaluation of clinical evidence and the degree of risk posed by the potential spread
of END based on population and exposure factors, including evaluation of whether the birds and poultry have had the
opportunity to be in contact with birds or poultry infected with END or with excrement from birds or poultry infected
with END, or if the birds and poultry have shared feed or water with birds or poultry infected with END).






(b) The determination that birds or poultry are exposed to END must be 
made by either a Federal veterinarian or a State veterinarian. They will base that determination on an evaluation
of all related circumstances, including: the proximity of the birds or poultry to birds or poultry infected with END,
to excrement from birds or poultry infected with END, and to other material touched by birds or poultry infected with
END; the number of birds or poultry infected with END to which the birds or poultry were exposed; the species involved;
the virulence of the END to which the birds or poultry were exposed; and the length of time the birds or poultry were in
contact with birds or poultry infected with END, and to material touched by birds or poultry infected with END. Birds
or poultry determined to be exposed to END will continue to be treated as exposed unless they are subsequently determined
to be infected with END or until either a Federal veterinarian or a State veterinarian finds them to be free of END based
on one or more of the factors listed in paragraph (a) of this section.



 82.3

 Quarantined areas.



(a) Any area where birds or poultry infected with END are located will be designated as a quarantined area. A quarantined
area is any geographical area, which may be a premises or all or part of a State, deemed by epidemiological evaluation
to be sufficient to contain all birds or poultry known to be infected with or exposed to END. Less than an entire State
will be designated as a quarantined area only if the State enforces restrictions on intrastate movements from the
quarantined area that are at least as stringent as this subpart.

(b) Any area designated as a quarantined area because of END will remain designated as a quarantined area until all
of the requirements of  82.14 have been met.

(c) The following areas are quarantined because of END: (Currently, no areas are quarantined because of END.)



 82.4

 General provisions.



(a) 

Prohibitions.

 The following articles may not be moved interstate from a quarantined area:

(1) Dead birds and dead poultry, including any parts of the birds or poultry, that are infected with END;

(2) Litter used by or manure generated by birds or poultry infected with END;

(3) Any eggs from birds or poultry infected with END;

(6) Cages, coops, containers, troughs, vehicles, or other equipment used 
for birds, poultry, eggs, manure, or litter. 

(c) 

Exceptions.

 This subpart does not apply to the interstate movement of birds, poultry, or other articles from a quarantined area
if the interstate movement is made by the United States Department of Agriculture for purposes of research or diagnosis.




 82.5

 82.13 


Denial and withdrawal of permits and special permits.



(a) 

Denial.

 If the Administrator determines that the applicant for a permit or special permit is not complying with or could not
comply with this subpart or any special conditions needed to prevent the dissemination of END, or, in the case of a special
permit, that the special permit is not required under this subpart, the Administrator may deny the request for a permit
or special permit. If the request is denied, the Administrator will send the applicant a written notice explaining
why the permit or special permit was denied.

 (b) 

Withdrawal. 

The Administrator may withdraw a permit or special permit, orally or in writing, if he or she determines the person
to whom the permit or special permit has been issued is violating either this subpart or some condition specified in
the permit or special permit. The Administrator may withdraw the permit or special permit without advance notice
if he or she determines that the person to whom the permit or special permit has been issued is violating either this
subpart or some condition specified in the permit or special permit in a way that threatens the public health, interest,
or safety. The Administrator will send the person to whom the permit or special permit has been issued a written explanation
of why the permit or special permit is to be or was withdrawn.

<TEXT>
 

(1) If the birds and poultry are buried, all birds and poultry infected with END must be buried in the quarantined area.
The birds and poultry must be buried in a location that meets all United States Environmental Protection Agency, State,
and local requirements for landfills. They must be buried at least 6 feet deep and be covered at the time of burial with
soil;

(2) If the birds and poultry are composted, all birds and poultry infected with END must be composted in the quarantined
area. The birds and poultry must be composted according to the following instructions:

(i) Place a 1-foot layer of litter and manure in a free-standing composter bin, unless the compost pile will be covered
in accordance with paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section. Add a 6-inch layer of straw, peanut hulls, or wood chips.
Add a layer of dead birds or dead poultry, leaving 6 inches between the carcasses and the bin walls. Add water sparingly
and cover with 6 inches of a dry mixture of litter and manure. Repeat the layering process two more times and cap with
a double layer of dry manure cake. After the bin is capped off and covered, monitor the temperature in the compost pile
daily, using a 36-inch probe-type thermometer. The temperature of the compost pile must reach at least 140
  F. After 30 days from the date the compost pile is created, turn over to aerate the entire mixture. Allow mixture
to reach at least 140
  F once again. After completion of the second cycle, the mixture must remain covered with any material that prevents
penetration of air and moisture until spread or otherwise utilized. The composted material may not be spread or otherwise
utilized until at least 30 days following completion of the second heating cycle.

(ii) Composting of birds and poultry may be accomplished outside of covered bins by following the layering and temperature
requirements set forth in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section, then covering the compost pile with tarpaulins or
6-mm polyethylene sheets anchored with tires or straw bales. The mixture must be kept moist. The final product may
not be spread or otherwise utilized until at least 30 days following completion of the second heating cycle.

(iii) Composting of birds and poultry must be carried out at least 50 yards from any building or pen where poultry and
birds are housed and be inaccessible to birds and poultry. Composted material may not be commingled with, or otherwise
be brought into contact with, non-composted manure cake.

(d) All eggs produced by birds or poultry infected with or exposed to END in the quarantined area have been buried, reduced
to ashes by incineration, or rendered. If the eggs are buried, the eggs must be buried in the quarantined area in a location
that meets all United States Environmental Protection Agency requirements and all State and local requirements
for landfills. The eggs must be buried at least 6 feet deep and be covered at the time of burial with soil;

(e) All manure generated by or litter used by birds or poultry infected with or exposed to END in the quarantined area
has been reduced to ashes by incineration, or has been buried, composted, or spread on a field and turned under, as follows:

(1) 

Burial. 

If the manure or litter is buried, the manure and litter must be buried at least 6 feet deep and covered at the time of burial
with soil. The manure and litter must be buried in the quarantined area in a location that meets all United States Environmental
Protection Agency and State and local requirements for landfills;

(2) 

Composting. 

If the manure and litter is composted, the manure and litter must be composted in the quarantined area according to
the following method: Place the manure and litter in rows 3 to 5 feet high and 5 to 10 feet at the base. The area where the
manure, litter, and other material used in composting are placed must be such that there is no runoff from the composted
material out of the area, no saturation into the ground, and no moisture, except for that required by this paragraph,
onto the composted material from above. The composting area must be at least 50 yards from any building or pen where
birds or poultry are housed and be inaccessible to birds and poultry. The manure and litter must be mixed so as to attain
a carbon to nitrogen ratio of approximately 30:1, a moisture content of between 40 to 50 percent, and a supply of oxygen
to the composted material. If a carbon source other than manure or litter is needed, wood chips, straw, or peanut hulls
may be used. The manure and litter must be covered with tarpaulin or 6-mm polyethylene sheets, be anchored with tires
or straw bales, and be mixed to ensure adequate ventilation every 10 to 15 days. The composted material must rise to
a temperature of 140
  F, as determined by use of a 36-inch probe-type thermometer. The composted material may not be spread or otherwise
utilized for at least 30 days from the time the 140
  F temperature is reached.

(3) 

Spreading and turning under. 

If the manure or litter is spread on a 
field and turned under, the field must be in the quarantined area, at least 
50 yards away from any building or pen where poultry or birds are housed, and 
inaccessible to birds and poultry. The manure or litter must be turned under within 24 hours of being spread on the field,
and the field must be left undisturbed for at least 30 days;

 Supplemental notice of proposed rulemaking; reopening of comment period. 






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document revises an earlier proposed airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to certain Canadair Model CL-600-1A11,
-2A12, and -2B16 series airplanes, that would have required a test of the engine throttle quadrant to determine
if the throttle lever bypasses the idle stop into the shut-off position, and modification of the throttle quadrant
or replacement of the throttle quadrant with a modified unit. That proposal was prompted by reports of unintentional
engine shutdown on certain of these airplanes. This action revises the proposed rule by requiring a different test
and eventual replacement of the throttle quadrant. The actions specified by this proposed AD are intended to prevent
inadvertent shutdown of an engine while the airplane is taxiing or in flight.

Availability of NPRMs 



Any person may obtain a copy of this NPRM by submitting a request to the FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate, ANM-103,
Attention: Rules Docket No. 93-NM-207-AD, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington 98055-4056.
Discussion 

A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) to add an airworthiness directive (AD),
applicable to certain Canadair Model CL-600-1A11, -2A12, and -2B16 series airplanes, was
published as a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) in the 

Federal Register

 on February 9, 1994 (59 FR 5966). That NPRM would have required a test of the engine throttle quadrant to determine if
the throttle lever bypasses the idle stop into the shut-off position, and modification of the throttle quadrant or
replacement of the throttle quadrant with a modified unit. That NPRM was prompted by reports of unintentional engine
shutdown on Model CL-600-2A12 and -2B16 series airplanes. That condition, if not corrected, could
result in inadvertent shutdown of an engine while the airplane is taxiing or in flight. 

Subsequent to the issuance of that NPRM, Transport Canada Aviation, which is the airworthiness authority for Canada,
advised the FAA of an additional unsafe condition that may exist on these, and additional, airplanes. While performing
a test of the engine throttle quadrant, one operator discovered that a quick, sharp pull of the throttle lever, combined
with contamination of the surfaces of the idle stop plate and pawl, could result in inadvertent run-through of the
lever past the idle stop and through the shut-off position. If this were to occur while the airplane was in flight or
while taxiing, it could result in the inadvertent shutdown of the engines. 

Canadair has issued Challenger Service Bulletins 600-0629 (for Model CL-600-1A11 series airplanes)
and 601-0410 (for Model CL-601-2A12 and -2B16 series airplanes), both dated November 1, 1993.
These service bulletins contain new procedures for conducting a check of the idle stop function of the throttle quadrant
and procedures for cleaning, retesting, and/or replacement of the throttle quadrant, if necessary. These service
bulletins also contain instructions for installing a modified throttle quadrant. Operators that have previously
accomplished the check and/or modification of the throttle quadrants in accordance with Canadair Challenger Service
Bulletin A600-0615, dated June 10, 1992 (for Model CL-600-1A11 series airplanes), and Service
Bulletin A601-0374 (for Model CL-600-2A12 and -2B16 series airplanes), Revision 1, dated
September 30, 1992, must re-check and replace in accordance with the new service bulletins. The new service bulletins
list part numbers of additional affected throttle quadrants, and serial numbers of additional (Model CL-600-2B16)
airplanes that may also be subject to the addressed unsafe condition. 

Transport Canada Aviation classified these service bulletins as mandatory and issued Canadian Airworthiness Directive
CF-92-23R1, dated March 31, 1994, in order to assure the continued airworthiness of these airplanes in
Canada. 

This airplane model is manufactured in Canada and is type certificated for operation in the United States under the
provisions of section 21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.29) and the applicable bilateral airworthiness
agreement. Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, Transport Canada Aviation has kept the FAA informed
of the situation described above. The FAA has examined the findings of Transport Canada Aviation, reviewed all available
information, and determined that AD action is necessary for products of this type design that are certificated for
operation in the United States. 

Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes of the same type
design registered in the United States, the proposed AD would require a check of the idle stop function of the throttle
quadrant, and repair or replacement of the throttle quadrant if the check fails. In addition, this proposed AD would
require the eventual replacement of the throttle quadrant with a new model. The proposed actions would be required
to be accomplished in accordance with the new service bulletins described previously. Additionally, the applicability
of the proposed rule would be expanded to include additional airplanes that are subject to the addressed unsafe condition.


Since these changes expand the scope of the originally proposed rule, the FAA has determined that it is necessary to
reopen the comment period to provide additional opportunity for public comment. 

The FAA estimates that 150 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD. 

The proposed functional check of the throttle quadrant would take approximately 1 work hour per airplane to accomplish,
at an average labor rate of $55 per work hour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed functional
check on U.S. operators is estimated to be $8,250, or $55 per airplane. 

The proposed installation of a modified throttle quadrant would take approximately 10 work hours per airplane to
accomplish, at an average labor rate of $55 per work hour. Required parts would be provided by the manufacturer at no
cost to operators. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed installation on U.S. operators is
estimated to be $82,500, or $550 per airplane. 

Based on the figures discussed above, the total cost impact of this proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be
$90,750, or $605 per airplane. This total cost impact figure is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished
any of the proposed requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future
if this AD were not adopted. 

The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 

For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action''
under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44
FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative,
on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft
regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting
the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption

Interested parties are invited to participate in this proposed rulemaking by submitting such written data, views
or arguments as they may desire. Comments that provide the factual basis supporting the views and suggestions presented
are particularly helpful in developing reasoned regulatory decisions on the proposal. Comments are specifically
invited on the overall regulatory, aeronautical, economic, environmental, and energy-related aspects of the proposal.
Communications should identify the airspace docket number and be submitted in triplicate to the address listed under


ADDRESSES

. Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments on this notice must submit with those comments
a self-addressed, stamped postcard on which the following statement is made: ``Comments to Airspace Docket No. 94-ANE-29.''
The postcard will be date/time stamped and returned to the commenter. All communications received on or before the

in this notice may be changed in the light of comments received. All comments submitted will be available for examination
in the Rules Docket, FAA, New England Region, Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel, 12 New England Executive Park,
Burlington, Massachusetts, both before and after the closing date for comments. A report summarizing each substantive
public contact with FAA personnel concerned with this rulemaking will be filed in the docket. 


Availability of NPRM's 


Any person may obtain a copy of this Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) by submitting a request to the Office of the
Assistant Chief Counsel, ANE-7, Federal Aviation Administration, 12 New England Executive Park, Burlington,
MA 01803-5299. Communications must identify the notice number of this NPRM. Persons interested in being placed
on a mailing list for future NPRM's should also request a copy of Advisory Circular No. 11-2A which describes
the application procedure. 


The Proposal 


The FAA is considering an amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to amend the East
Coast Low Control Area in the vicinity of Nantucket, MA. The intended effect of this action is to allow aircraft executing
the Runway 6 Back Course Instrument Approach at the Nantucket Memorial Airport, Nantucket, MA (ACK) to remain in controlled
airspace at lower altitudes. This change would allow air traffic control to avoid unnecessary vectoring of aircraft
using the Runway 6 Back Course approach to keep those aircraft in controlled airspace. Since approximately 22% of
aircraft arriving at ACK use the Runway 6 approach, this change would result in improved air traffic control services
to over 6,000 aircraft per year. The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Designations
for Low Control Areas are published in Paragraph 6007 of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective September
16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1. The Offshore Airspace Area designation listed in this
document would be published subsequently in the Order. 
The FAA has determined that this proposed regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations
for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore (1) Is
not a ``Significant Regulatory Action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT
Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory
evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic
procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule, when promulgated, will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

ACTION: 

Extension of comment period.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Securities and Exchange Commission is extending the public comment period from June 15, 1994, to July 15, 1994,
for proposed amendments to Rule 10b-10 and a new rule, Rule 15c2-13, which would require brokers, dealers,
and municipal securities dealers to make certain disclosures on their customer confirmations.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

On March 9, 1994, the Commission proposed for public comment amendments to Rule 10b-10 and a new rule, Rule 15c2-13
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33743, 59 FR 12767). Those proposals
expanded the information that brokers, dealers, and municipal securities would be required to disclose on a customer
confirmation. The proposals are designed to aid investors in monitoring their securities transactions and update
the Commission's confirmation requirements to reflect changes in the securities markets.


At the time these proposals were published, the Commission established a 90-day comment period that expired on June
15, 1994. The Commission has received several requests from interested persons to extend the comment period. In light
of the complex issues raised by these proposals and the need to solicit the views of as many persons who will be affected
by the proposals as possible, the Commission is extending the comment period 30 days. Accordingly, the comment period
is extended to July 15, 1994.




Dated: June 22, 1994.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

I. Background on the Pennsylvania Plan



On July 31, 1982, the Secretary of the Interior approved the Pennsylvania Plan. Background information on the Pennsylvania
Plan, including the Secretary's findings, the disposition of comments, and the approval of the plan can be found in
the July 30, 1982, 

Federal Register

 (47 FR 33079). Subsequent actions concerning the conditions of approval and amendments to the Plan can be found at
30 CFR 938.20 and 938.25.



II. Discussion of the Proposed Amendment



By letter dated December 24, 1992, (Administrative Record No. PA-815.00), Pennsylvania submitted a proposed
amendment to its Plan pursuant to SMCRA. The amendment revised the Pennsylvania Plan to assume responsibility for
a State-administered emergency reclamation program. The amendment, as submitted, added a new Part F to the current
Plan.

On March 23, 1993, OSM published a notice in the 

Federal Register

 (58 FR 15456) announcing receipt of Pennsylvania's proposed amendment to the Pennsylvania Plan and inviting public
comment on its adequacy. On April 26, 1993, OSM published a notice in the 

Federal Register

 (58 FR 21965) extending the public comment period.

By letter dated June 13, 1994, (Administrative Record No. PA-815.34), Pennsylvania withdrew its December
24, 1992, submission of the proposed Plan amendment.

Inspection/Maintenance Program Requirements_Provisions for Redesignation



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Environmental Protection Agency.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of proposed rulemaking.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The proposed revisions include additions and modifications to subpart S, part 51, title 40, Code of Federal Regulations,
regarding State Implementation Plan submissions for purposes of redesignation. The proposed revisions specify
SIP requirements only for areas that are subject to the basic Inspection/Maintenance program requirement and that
otherwise qualify for redesignation from nonattainment to attainment for the carbon monoxide or ozone national
ambient air quality standards. This rule proposes to allow such areas to defer adoption and implementation of some
of the otherwise applicable requirements established in the original promulgation of the Inspection/Maintenance
rule. This proposed rule applies only to areas that by virtue or their air quality classification are required to implement
a basic I/M program and that submit, and otherwise qualify for, a redesignation request.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Section 107(d)(3)(E) of the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1990 (the Act), states that an area can be redesignated to attainment
if the following conditions are met: EPA has determined that the national ambient air quality standards have been
attained; EPA has fully approved the applicable implementation plan under section 110(k); EPA has determined that
the improvement in air quality is due to permanent and enforceable reductions in emissions due to the implementation
plan and other permanent and enforceable reductions; the State has met all applicable requirements of section 110
and part D; and, EPA has fully approved a maintenance plan for the area under section 175A of the Act. Section 175A in
turn requires states that submit a redesignation request to submit a plan, and any additional measures if necessary,
for maintenance of the air quality standard, for a least a 10 year period following EPA's approval of the redesignation.
It also requires the plan to include contingency provisions to ensure prompt correction of any violation of the standard
which occurs after redesignation. The contingency measures must include a provision requiring the state to implement
measures which were contained in the State Implementation Plan (SIP) prior to redesignation as an attainment area.




The purpose of this document is to propose amendments to the rules in subpart S of part 51 of title 40 of the Code of Federal
Regulations (subpart S) to address Inspection/Maintenance (I/M) program requirements for basic areas that qualify
for and will ultimately obtain approval by EPA of redesignation requests to attainment. This notice proposes to add
a new paragraph to the regulation pertaining to State Implementation Plan (SIP) submissions for areas required to
implement a basic I/M program that are submitting and otherwise qualify for approval of a redesignation request.
 There are basic areas that will be submitting redesignation requests that do not currently have I/M programs, or have
either a basic program implemented pursuant to the 1977 amendments to the Act or a basic program upgraded to meet the
requirements of EPA's I/M regulations. This rule applies only to areas that by virtue of their air quality classification
are required to implement a basic I/M program and that submit, and otherwise qualify for a redesignation request.





In a May 6, 1994 decision, the D.C. Court of Appeals held that EPA did not have authority to construe section 110(k)(4)
to authorize conditional approval of an I/M committal SIP that contains no specific enforceable measures, but a promise
to adopt specific enforceable measures within a year. Merely, section 110(k)(4) states that: The Administrator
may approve a plan revision based on a commitment of the State to adopt specific enforceable measures by a date certain,
but not later than one year after the date of approval of the plan revision. Any such conditional approval shall be treated
as a disapproval if the State fails to comply with such commitment.

This decision was based on the premise that the statute required all areas required to implement an I/M program to have
adopted regulations.
The authority for this rulemaking is not based on section 110(k)(4), but on sections 182(a)(2)(B)(i) and 182(b)(4),
which applies only to areas required to submit basic I/M programs.
Pursuant to sections 182(a)(2)(B)(i) and 182(b)(4) of the Act, basic I/M areas must submit a SIP revision that includes
any ``provisions necessary to provide for a vehicle inspection and maintenance program'' of no less stringency than
either the program that was in the SIP at the time of passage of the Act or the minimum basic program requirements, whichever
is more stringent. Basic areas have a nominal requirement only for a schedule for implementation pursuant to section
172(b)(11)(B) of the 1977 Amendments and sections 182(a)(2)(B)(i) and 182(b)(4) of the 1990 Amendments, plus any
other requirements established by EPA in guidance. The statutory language of section 182(a)(2)(B)(i) and section
182(b)(4) provides a degree of flexibility compared with the statutory language in section 182(c)(3), which requires
enhanced I/M areas to submit a SIP revision ``to provide for an enhanced program''.
Although for most purposes EPA will continue to interpret ``provisions to provide for'' a basic I/M program to require
full adoption and expeditious implementation of such a program, EPA believes based on this flexible language, that
it is appropriate to revise the SIP revisions requirements applicable to basic I/M areas that ultimately will qualify
for redesignation. For states which have attained the ambient standard with the benefit of only the current program,
or no program at all, EPA does not believe it is necessary to revise or adopt new regulations and undertake other significant
planning efforts which are not essential for clean air, and which would not be implemented after redesignation occurred
because they are not necessary for maintenance. It would be a wasteful exercise to force the state to go through full
adoption of regulations only to have these regulations converted to a contingency measure the moment the redesignation
is approved. EPA believes that such states need not submit an actual I/M program as long as there are ``provisions necessary
to provide'' for an I/M program as required by statute. For areas that qualify for redesignation to attainment and
ultimately are redesignated, EPA is proposing to amend Subpart S to interpret that statutory phrase to allow such
areas to be redesignated if they otherwise qualify for redesignation and submit a SIP that contains the following
four elements: (1) Legal authority for a basic I/M program (or an enhanced program if the state chooses to opt up), meeting
all of the requirements of Subpart S such that implementing regulations can be adopted without further legislation;
(2) a request to place the I/M plan or upgrades (as applicable) in the contingency measures portion of the maintenance
plan upon redesignation as described in the fourth element below; (3) a contingency measure consisting of a commitment
by the Governor or the Governor's designee to adopt regulations to implement the I/M program in response to a specified
triggering event; and (4) a commitment that includes an enforceable schedule for adopting and implementing the I/M
program, including appropriate milestones, in the event the contingency measure is triggered (milestones shall
be defined by states in terms of months since the triggering event). EPA believes that for areas that otherwise qualify
for redesignation a SIP meeting these four requirements would satisfy the obligation to submit ``provisions to provide''
for a satisfactory I/M program, as required by the statute.
Without these amendments states that are being redesignated to attainment would have to adopt a full I/M program for
the purpose of obtaining full approval of their SIPs as meeting all applicable SIP requirements, which is a prerequisite
for approval of a redesignation request. Once redesignated these states could discontinue implementation of this
program as long as it was converted to a contingency measure.

With these amendments the determination of whether a state fulfills the SIP requirements will depend, for the purposes
of redesignation approval only, on whether the state meets the four requirements listed above. EPA believes that
this flexibility is built into the basic I/M requirement and should apply only for the limited purpose of considering
a redesignation request to attainment.
It should be understood, however, that, pursuant to section 175A(c), while EPA considers the redesignation request,
the state continues to be required to meet all the requirements of this subpart. This would include the submission
of another SIP revision meeting the existing requirements for fully adopted rules and the specific implementation
deadline applicable to the area as required under 40 CFR 51.372 or the I/M rule. If the state does not comply with these
requirements it could be subject to sanctions pursuant to section 179. Because the possibility for sanctions exists,
states which do not have a solid basis for approval of the redesignation request and maintenance plan should proceed
to fully prepare and plan to implement a basic I/M program that meets all the requirements of Subpart S.

The SIP revision must demonstrate that the performance standard in either 40 CFR 53.351 or 51.352 will be met using
an evaluation date (rounded to the nearest January for carbon monoxide and July for hydrocarbons) seven years after
the trigger date. Emission standards for vehicles subject to an IM240 test may be phased in during the program but full
standards must be in effect for at least one complete test cycle before the end of the five year period. All other requirements
shall take effect within 24 months of the trigger date. Furthermore, a state may not discontinue implementation of
an I/M program until the redesignation request and maintenance plan (that does not rely on reductions from I/M) are
finally approved. If the redesignation request is approved, any sanctions already imposed, or any sanctions clock
already triggered, would be terminated.

There are four possible scenarios under which an area might present a redesignation request.

1. Areas Without Operating I/M Programs_Section 182(b)(4) of the Act expanded the requirement for submission of
a schedule for a basic 


I/M program to all moderate ozone nonattainment areas. As a result, about 25 new cities were affected by the I/M requirement.
Since passage of the Act however, some of these areas have experienced no violation of the standard and are in a position
to submit a request to redesignate. Some of these areas may be able to demonstrate maintenance of the standards without
implementation of an I/M program.



The proposed changes to Subpart S would allow a state to avoid having to prepare a detailed I/M plan and adopt regulations
at this time. EPA would require a detailed implementation plan and regulations would be required by EPA to be submitted
and incorporated into the previous SIP within 12 months and implemented within 24 months from the triggering event
as specified by the State. Section 175A(d) requires that each maintenance plan revision contain contingency provisions
necessary to assure that the State will ``promptly correct'' any violation of the standard which occurs after the
redesignation of an area to attainment. Given the time needed for states to submit and incorporate these measures
into the previous SIP and then implement them, EPA believes that these 12 and 24 month time periods are the minimum amount
of time in which states can ``promptly correct'' the violation which triggered the contingency measure. These time
periods are based on EPA's interpretation of a reasonable amount of time to allow the State to submit and implement
a new SIP after the triggering event.

2. Basic areas With Operating I/M Programs_Continued Operation Without Upgrades. Section 182(a)(2)(B)(ii) of
the Act requires EPA to ``review, revise, update, and republish'' I/M guidance. EPA did so on November 5, 1992 (as reflected
in subpart S) and established new requirements for basic and enhanced I/M programs. These regulations require improved
administration of the I/M program in a variety of ways and to meet the performance standard established for basic programs.
Some of these areas may be in a position to redesignate to attainment based on a maintenance plan which does not implement
these upgrades. EPA believes that its broad authority under section 182(a)(2)(B)(ii) of the Act to revise the guidance
for basic I/M areas allows it to structure subpart S such that a redesignation request could be approved for such areas
that continue to operate I/M programs provided that the state has the legal authority and regulations necessary to
make the upgrade, and submits as a contingency measure a commitment to implement the upgrade in the event of a violation,
according to an enforceable schedule, including milestones. The maintenance plan could not, however, claim the
full credit provided by the MOBILE model unless the upgrade was implemented. The purpose of the upgrade is to ensure
that the emission reduction benefits projected by the MOBILE model are in fact achieved in practice. The MOBILE model
is used to determine emission level targets and whether the local I/M program design meets the performance standard
as described in 40 CFR 51.351 or 51.352 of subpart S. Areas which continue operation of I/M programs as part of their
maintenance plan without an implemented upgrade shall be assumed to be 80% as effective as an implemented upgraded
version of the same I/M program design, unless a state can demonstrate using operating information that the I/M program
alone is more effective than the implemented upgraded version. The 80% benefit assumption is based on a 20% discount
for the lack of administrative requirements, especially quality assurance and quality control, not modeling factors.
The model does not include inputs for quality control and quality assurance.

3. Areas With Operating I/M Programs_Continuing Operation With Upgrades. If an area chooses to upgrade the I/M program
to meet the requirements of subpart S rather than to take advantage of the amendment proposed today, then a full SIP
submission as specified in  51.372 of subpart S shall be made that addresses those requirements. In this case,
a state can claim full MOBILE model credit for the implemented upgrade in the maintenance plan as of its effective date.

4. Areas With Operating I/M Programs_Discontinuing Operation.

Areas which receive approval of the redesignation request may cease operation of the I/M program after this approval
if and only if the following requirements are met. First, a modeling demonstration must be included in the maintenance
plan which shows the standards can be maintained without the program, and second, the I/M program must be transferred
by SIP revision to the contingency measures portion of the maintenance plan and implemented as a contingency measure
in the event of a triggering condition. Emission reduction credit cannot be claimed in the maintenance plan if an I/M
program is to cease operation.

This proposal does not affect redesignation requests submitted for serious or worse ozone or carbon monoxide areas,
moderate CO areas above 12.7 ppm, and for areas claiming full maintenance plan credits for an 


I/M program without supporting evidence of emission reduction credits. Those areas must meet all the requirements
of subpart S. This is because section 182(c)(3) of the Act does not provide the flexibility granted under section 182(b)(4)
and explicitly requires areas subject to the enhanced I/M requirement to submit a full I/M program including regulations
and implementation requirements.



Public Participation



EPA desires full public participation in arriving at final decisions in this rulemaking action. EPA solicits comments
on all aspects of today's proposal from all interested parties. Wherever applicable, full supporting data and detailed
analysis should also be submitted to allow EPA to make maximum use of the comments. All comments should be directed
to the Air Docket, Docket No. A-93-21.



Paperwork Reduction Act



Today's rule places no information collection or recordkeeping burden on respondents. Therefore, an information
collection request has not been prepared and submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the 

Paperwork Reduction Act

 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq.



Administrative Designation and Regulatory Analysis



Pursuant to section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Administrator certifies that
this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities and, therefore, not
subject to the requirement of a Regulatory Impact Analysis. A small entity may include a small government entity or
jurisdiction. A small government jurisdiction is defined as ``governments of cities, counties, towns, townships,
villages, school districts, or special districts, with a population of less than 50,000''. This certification is
based on the fact that the I/M areas impacted by the rule do not meet the definition of a small government jurisdiction,
that is, ``governments of cities, counties, towns, townships, villages, school districts, or special districts,
with a population of less than 50,000''. It has been determined that this rule is not a significant regulatory action
under the terms of Executive Order 12866 and is therefore not subject to OMB review. This rule would only relieve states
of some regulatory requirements, not add costs or otherwise adversely affect the economy.

(c) 

Redesignation requests

. Any nonattainment area that EPA determines would otherwise qualify for redesignation from nonattainment to attainment
may receive full approval of a State Implementation Plan (SIP) submittal under sections 182(a)(2)(B) or 182(b)(4)
if the submittal contains the following elements:
(1) Legal authority to implement a basic I/M program (or enhanced if the state chooses to opt up) as required by this
subpart. The legislative authority for an I/M program shall allow the adoption of implementing regulations without
requiring further legislation.
(2) A request to place the I/M plan (if no I/M program is currently in place or if an I/M program has been terminated) or
the I/M upgrade (if the existing I/M program is to continue without being upgraded) into the contingency measures
portion of the maintenance plan upon redesignation.
(3) A contingency measure consisting of a commitment by the Governor or the governor's designee to adopt regulations
to implement the required I/M program in response to a specified triggering event. Such contingency measures must
be implemented on the trigger date, which is a date determined by the State to be no later than the date EPA notifies the
state that it is in violation of the ozone or carbon monoxide standard.
(4) A commitment that includes an enforceable schedule for adoption and implementation of the I/M program, and appropriate
milestones, including the items in paragraphs (a)(1)(ii) through (a)(1)(vii) of this section. In addition, the
schedule shall include the date for submission of a SIP meeting all of the requirements of this subpart, excluding
schedule requirements. Schedule milestones shall be listed in months from the trigger date, and shall comply with
the requirements of paragraph (e) of this section. SIP submission shall occur no more than 12 months after the trigger
date as specified by the State.
(d) Basic areas continuing operation of I/M programs as part of their maintenance plan without implemented upgrades

state can demonstrate using operating information that the I/M program is more effective than the 80% level.
(e) 

SIP Submittals to Correct Violations.

 SIP submissions required pursuant to a violation of the ambient ozone or CO standard (as discussed in paragraph (c)
of this section) shall address all of the requirements of this subpart. The SIP shall demonstrate that performance
standards in either  51.351 or  51.352 shall be met using an evaluation date (rounded to the nearest January
for carbon monoxide and July for hydrocarbons) seven years after the trigger date. Emission standards for vehicles
subject to an IM240 test may be phased in during the program but full standards must be in effect for at least one complete
test cycle before the end of the 5-year period. All other requirements shall take effect within 24 months of the trigger
date. The phase-in allowances of  51.373(c) shall not apply.

<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Proposed rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposes to approve the State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision submitted
by the State of Oregon for the contingency measure plan for carbon monoxide (CO). The implementation plan was submitted
by the state to satisfy certain Federal Clean Air Act requirements for Grants Pass, Medford, Portland, and Klamath
Falls, Oregon. In the Final Rules Section of this 

Federal Register

, the EPA is approving the state's SIP revision as a direct final rule without prior proposal because the Agency views
this as a noncontroversial revision amendment and anticipates no adverse comments. A detailed rationale for the
approval is set forth in the direct final rule. If no adverse comments are received in response to that direct final
rule, no further activity is contemplated in relation to this proposed rule. If the EPA receives adverse comments,
the direct final rule will be withdrawn and all public comments received will be addressed in a subsequent final rule
based on this proposed rule. The EPA will not institute a second comment period on this notice.

This proposed regulation was requested by Olin Corp.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Olin Corp., 350 Knotter Drive, P.O. Box 586, Cheshire, CT 06410-0586, submitted pesticide petition (PP) 4E4325 to
EPA requesting that the Administrator, pursuant to section 408(e) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA)
(21 U.S.C. 346a(e)), propose to amend 40 CFR 180.1001(c) by establishing an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance
for residues of poly(oxyethylene/oxypropylene) monoalkyl(C

)ether-sodium fumarate adduct (CAS Reg. No. 102900-02-7) when used as an inert ingredient (surfactant) in pesticide
formulations applied to growing crops or to raw agricultural commodities after harvest under 40 CFR 180.1001(c).



Inert ingredients are all ingredients that are not active ingredients as defined in 40 CFR 153.125, and include, but
are not limited to, the following types of ingredients (except when they have a pesticidal efficacy of their own):
solvents such as alcohols and hydrocarbons; surfactants such as polyoxyethylene polymers and fatty acids; carriers
such as clay and diatomaceous earth; thickeners such as carrageenan and modified cellulose; wetting, spreading,
and dispersing agents; propellants in aerosol dispensers; microencapsulating agents; and emulsifiers. The term
``inert'' is not intended to imply nontoxicity; the ingredient may or may not be chemically active. 

The data submitted in the petition and other relevant material have been evaluated. As part of the EPA policy statement
on inert ingredients published in the 

Federal Register

 of April 22, 1987 (52 FR 13305), the Agency set forth a list of studies which would generally be used to evaluate the risks
posed by the presence of an inert ingredient in a pesticide formulation. However, where it can be determined without
that data that the inert ingredient will present minimal or no risk, the Agency generally does not require some or all
of the listed studies to rule on the proposed tolerance or exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for an inert
ingredient. The Agency has decided that no data, in addition to that described below, for poly(oxyethylene/oxypropylene)
monoalkyl(C

6

-C

10

)ether-sodium fumarate adduct will need to be submitted. The rationale for this decision is described below:
In the case of certain chemical substances that are defined as ``polymers,'' the Agency has established a set of criteria
which identify categories of polymers that present low risk. These criteria (described in 40 CFR 723.250) identify
polymers that are relatively unreactive and stable compared to other chemical substances as well as polymers that
typically are not readily absorbed. These properties generally limit a polymer's ability to cause adverse effects.
In addition, these criteria exclude polymers about which little is known. The Agency believes that polymers meeting
the criteria noted above will present minimal or no risk. Poly(oxyethylene/oxypropylene) monoalkyl(C

6

-C

10

)ether-sodium fumarate adduct conforms to the definition of a polymer given in 40 CFR 723.250(b)(11) and meets the
following criteria that are used to identify low-risk polymers: 
1. The minimum number-average molecular weight of poly(oxyethylene/oxypropylene) monoalkyl(C

6

-C

10

)ether-sodium fumerate adduct is 1,900. Substances with molecular weights greater than 400 generally are not absorbed
through the intact skin, and substances with molecular weights greater than 1,000 generally are not absorbed through
the intact gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Chemicals not absorbed through skin or GI tract generally are incapable
of eliciting a toxic response.
2. Poly(oxyethylene/oxypropylene) monoalkyl(C

6

-C

10

)ether-sodium fumarate adduct is not a cationic polymer, nor is it reasonably anticipated to become a cationic polymer
in a natural aquatic environment.
3. Poly(oxyethylene/oxypropylene) monoalkyl(C

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Public Health Service (PHS) proposes to issue rules requiring Institutions that apply for research funding from
the PHS to assume responsibility for ensuring that the financial interests of the employees of the Institution do
not compromise the objectivity with which such research is designed, conducted, or reported. 


Under the proposed rules, investigators are required to disclose to an official(s) designated by the Institution
a listing of Significant Financial Interests. The institutional official(s) will review these disclosures in accordance
with an administrative process to be established by each institution. Following this review, the institutional
official(s) will determine the acceptability of the reported financial interests and act to protect PHS-funded
research from any bias that is reasonably expected to arise from those interests. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Technology Transfer and Conflict of Interest 


Effective interaction between PHS-funded Institutions conducting research and industry is essential to ensure
the rapid application of scientific discoveries to the health needs of the Nation and to maintain the international
competitiveness of domestic industry. Nonetheless, prudent stewardship of public funds includes protecting Federally
funded research from being compromised by the conflicting financial interests of any Investigator responsible
for the design, conduct, or reporting of PHS-funded research. 
Numerous statutes and programs demonstrate the Federal interest in the promotion of interactions among Government,
academia and industry. For example, the Stevenson-Wydler Technology Innovation Act of 1980 (Public Law (P.L.) 96-480)
encourages technology transfer, particularly through industrial-academic collaborations. The Patent and Trademark
Act Amendments of 1980 (P.L. 96-517) allow universities and other funding recipients to apply for patents developed
with Federal funding, and expressly promote collaboration between commercial concerns and nonprofit organizations.
The Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 (P.L. 97-34) is aimed at fostering research and development by small companies
and associated university partners. The Federal Technology Transfer Act of 1986 (P.L. 99-502), which amended
P.L. 96-480, and Executive Order 12592 provide similar patent and licensing authority to Federal laboratories,
and encourage them to participate in cooperative research and development agreements with the private sector and
nonprofit organizations, including universities. 
These legal authorities facilitate the movement of intellectual capital between the Federal Government, academic
institutions, and the private sector. This kind of cross-fertilization is critical to the development of the U.S.
biotechnology industry. However, these and other inducements for collaboration, as well as the rapid growth of the
biotechnology industry, have created a climate in which the stewardship of public funding for biomedical and behavioral
research is increasingly complex and challenging. 
The value of the results of PHS-funded research to the health and the economy of the Nation must not be compromised by
any financial interest that will, or may be reasonably expected to, bias the design, conduct or reporting of the research.
The proposed regulations seek to maintain a reasonable balance between these competing interests, give applicants
for PHS research funding responsibility and discretion to identify and manage financial interests that may bias
the research, and minimize reporting and other burdens on the applicants. 


Background 


The proposed regulations are the result of a lengthy process of consideration. Throughout that process, the PHS has
carefully considered and changed its approach in response to public comments. 
On June 27 and 28, 1989, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Alcohol, Drug Abuse, and Mental Health Administration
(ADAMHA) sponsored an open meeting to discuss issues related to financial conflict of interest. At that meeting there
was general agreement that an Institution that receives research funds from a PHS Awarding Component should develop
policies to identify and manage any financial conflict of interest in the funded research. 
On September 15, 1989, the NIH and ADAMHA published a Request for Comment on Proposed Guidelines for Policies on Conflict
of Interest in the 

NIH Guide for Grants and Contracts

 (Volume 18, Number 32). Seven hundred fifty-one responses were received from individuals associated with medical
schools, other academic and research institutions, biotechnology companies, local governments, and non-profit
organizations; venture capitalists; attorneys; biomedical journal editors; Federal employees and contractors
at Government facilities; and others. In general, those submitting comments were concerned that the proposed guidelines
imposed undue burdens on funded institutions and would impede mutually beneficial research collaboration between
universities and industry. In response to these comments, the Secretary determined that regulations should be developed
that would address those concerns. 
A public meeting was held at NIH on November 30, 1990, to discuss further the regulation of financial conflict of interest
by the PHS. The 18 written comments received at that time reflected views similar to those received earlier.

Many respondents to earlier proposals stated that the primary responsibility for setting guidelines and maintaining
compliance should rest with each awardee Institution. The present proposed rule, like PHS policy in other areas involving
protection of the public interest (such as the protection of human subjects in research and the investigation of alleged
scientific misconduct), sets standards for performance and assigns the primary responsibility for procedural
development and compliance to the Institution. 

Many of those commenting on prior proposals agreed with the importance of disclosure, but thought that the requirement
to disclose all financial interests, as set forth in the previously proposed guidelines, should be reduced in scope
to prevent needless invasion of privacy and creation of paperwork burdens. The proposed regulations achieve this
end by limiting the disclosures that must be made to ``Significant Financial Interests,'' any interest of monetary
value exceeding a defined threshold of value ($5,000) or percentage of ownership (five percent or more) that would
reasonably appear to be directly and significantly affected by the research funded by PHS or proposed for funding.
PHS specifically requests public comment on whether the minimum threshold for disclosure is appropriate to ensure
that PHS-funded research projects are not biased by conflicting financial interests of those responsible for the
design, conduct, or reporting of the research. 

There was a wide range of opinion among those commenting on previous proposals regarding which types of financial
interest should be permissible. In these proposed rules a Significant Financial Interest (defined in  50.603)
of the type specified in  50.605(a) must be managed as provided in  50.605(b) and the existence and management,
reduction, or elimination of that financial interest must be certified in the application. The PHS may at any time
request submission of, or review on site, all records pertinent to the certification. This procedure gives Institutions
broad discretion in determining how to manage Significant Financial Interests that reasonably appear to directly
and significantly affect the design, conduct, or reporting of the research while providing for appropriate PHS oversight.
PHS may undertake periodic reviews of the records in order to assess the reliability of institutional and investigator
certifications, and to determine whether institutional safeguards do, in fact, protect the integrity of PHS-funded
research. In undertaking any such review HHS will coordinate, to the extent feasible, with the National Science Foundation
(NSF) to ensure that institutions are not unnecessarily subjected to multi-agency reviews. 

Managing potential conflicts carefully; avoiding unnecessary burden and useless paperwork; and preserving appropriate
incentives for productive research represent challenges individually and collectively. Even after we issue a final
rule some unforeseen problems will certainly emerge. Therefore, approximately one year after the final rule is issued
we plan to initiate an evaluation, to include a conference and other mechanisms to consult with investigators and
institutions. Based on that evaluation, we would revise these rules if and as appropriate. 



Basis and Purpose. 

A more detailed discussion of the proposed regulations and their basis and purpose follows.

I. Applicability



a. Types of Research 



The proposed regulations implement section 493A of the PHS Act, added by Public Law 103-43, which mandates the
issuance of regulations defining, and setting standards for, the management of financial interests that will, or
may be reasonably expected to, bias a clinical research project whose purpose is to evaluate the safety or effectiveness
of a drug, medical device, or treatment. In addition, the proposed regulations implement section 924 of the PHS Act,
as amended by Public Law 102-410, which requires the Administrator of the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research
(AHCPR) to issue regulations defining the financial interests that will, or may be reasonably expected to, create
a bias in the health care services research projects funded by the AHCPR. The proposed regulations are not limited
to the implementation of these statutory authorities, however. Pursuant to the Secretary's authority to issue regulations
governing those who seek or receive PHS funding, they apply broadly to all research funded by the PHS, whether under
the authority of the PHS Act or other statutes, except Phase I projects under the Small Business Innovation Research
(SBIR) Program. Very limited amounts of funding are provided under Phase I of the SIBR Program to plan and determine
the feasibility of the research project for further funding under Phase II. Because potentially biasing financial
interests will be assessed at the time of the Phase II application, it would be burdensome and unproductive to require
such a review for Phase I applications. With this exception, it is believed that financial interests can create a bias
in all types of research, although the likelihood of such a bias may diminish if the outcome of the research would have
little effect on the commercial potential of any product, device, or other property in which the Investigator may
have a financial interest. However, this distinction can not be so clearly drawn that the need to protect the integrity
of all PHS-funded research uniformly is alleviated. 



b. 

Individual vs. Institutional Financial Interests 



The proposed regulations provide for the disclosure and consideration of the financial interests of individuals
involved in the design, conduct, and reporting of the research. Section 493A of the PHS Act, added by Public Law 103-43,
refers to financial interests of entities (e.g., institutions), as well as individuals, in clinical research projects.
We are considering the following alternatives with respect to the coverage of institutions that apply for clinical
research funding under the PHS Act: 



(1) Exempting Institutional Financial Interests That Would Not Bias the Project 



Under the statute, adoption of this alternative would be based on a determination that the exempted institutional
financial interests would not be reasonably expected to bias the design, conduct, or reporting of PHS-funded research.
This conclusion might be based on a finding that the limited size of the interest would preclude any biasing effect,
or a finding that the institutional financial interest would have only an indirect and unpredictable effect on the
project, in the absence of a personal financial interest on the part of those responsible for the design, conduct or
reporting of the research. There would, of course, have to be a reasonable factual basis for such findings. 



(2) Requiring Institutional Applicants To Certify Whether They Have Significant Financial Interests 



Adoption of this alternative would involve establishing a procedure for institutions similar to the procedure in
the proposed regulation for individuals. This option would be based on the same rationale as the preceding option,
i.e. that there is no need to regulate institutional financial interests that aren't reasonably expected to bias
the conduct of the research. Significant Financial Interest might be defined for institutions as limited only to
direct financial interests (such as a patent application on, or a financial arrangement with a company regarding,
the product of the research). 



(3) Requiring Full Disclosure to the PHS of the Financial Interests of Institutions 



This alternative would impose a reporting burden upon the institutions, but would ensure a complete PHS review of
any potential conflict of interest prior to a funding decision. 



(4) Other Alternatives



We will also consider combinations of these three alternatives and other alternatives that may be suggested in the
public comments. We will choose an alternative based on the requirements of the statute, and, to the extent consistent
with the statute, based upon our weighing of the burdens on the institutions, the potential that institutional financial
interests will bias PHS-funded research, and the potential adverse effect of the alternative upon technology transfer.




c. Types of Interests



The proposed regulations require disclosure of ``significant financial interests'' of the Investigator that would
reasonably appear to be directly and significantly affected by the research funded by PHS or proposed for funding
or of the investigator in an entity whose financial interest would reasonably appear to be directly and significantly
affected by the PHS research. The following are examples of the types of significant financial interests that would
fall within the categories in  50.605: ownership of stock, stock options, or any equity, debt, security, capital
holding, salary or other remuneration, or financial consideration, or thing of value for services as an employee,
consultant, officer, or board member in (1) any business enterprise, including the applicant for PHS funds (except
SBIR applicants are not included), that owns or has applied for the patent, manufacturing or marketing rights to a
drug, vaccine, device, procedure or any other product involved in or that will predictably result from the research
described in the application or (2) a business enterprise that is known by the investigator to own or have applied for
such rights in any product that can reasonably be expected to compete with the product or procedure that will predictably
result from the research described in the application. We request comments on a range of disclosures that would on
the one hand, include interests that may threaten objectivity; and, on the other exclude those interests that cannot
reasonably be regulated or that are so obvious as not to warrant regulations. We also request comments on whether specific
examples of biasing significant financial interests, such as those set forth above, should be included in the regulations.


In particular, we request comments on whether interests in a business enterprise that is known by the investigator
to have an interest in a product that competes with the product involved in the application should fall within the categories
of significant financial interests described in  50.605. There may not be any reasonable way for an investigator
either to identify all competing products or to determine what companies own them. For example, for most medical devices
there may be dozens of competing products, many made by subsidiaries of ``Fortune 500'' conglomerates. How would
an investigator determine just what products were ``competing''? Should we be concerned if an investigator owns
$5,000 of stock in a company in which only a small fraction of revenues and profits derive from the competing product?
We request comments on whether, and how best, to cover interests in competing products.

<TEXT>
 

We also request comments on whether an employee's stock or other non-salary financial interests in the applicant
institution should be covered. This is of particular relevance when the grant or contract is with a for-profit enterprise.
Specifically, should we be concerned, and how could we expect the company to ``manage'' against conflict, when the
company's employees obviously stand to benefit if the product is a commercial success? The proposed rule includes
an exemption for an ownership interest in the institution if it is a Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) applicant.
Can we justify exempting SBIR awards and not all other awards to both large and small profit-making enterprises? Should
we exempt from disclosure any equity or ownership interest in the applicant institution? Should we exempt disclosure
of interests other than bonuses or other compensation tied to the outcome of the research? 



II. Burdens Upon Applicants



The proposed regulation is intended to minimize reporting and other burdens upon applicants to the maximum extent
feasible. Certain types or amounts of financial interests that cannot be reasonably expected to bias the research
are excluded from the requirements for disclosure by investigators. Such interests are also excluded from the certification
of whether these are Significant Financial Interests that must accompany each application. Even when there is a Significant
Financial Interest of the type specified in the proposed rule, the institutions are given broad discretion in managing
the conflict; details of the interest need not be reported to the PHS awarding component. It is the responsibility
of that component to determine whether to review the institutional records relating to the disclosure and management
of that interest. 

The Department will also seek to reduce burdens upon applicants by being available to provide advice and assistance
as applicants establish the policies and procedures required by this subpart. The PHS Awarding Components will be
available to respond to general inquiries regarding compliance with this subpart. 

Another way of reducing burdens upon applicants is to exempt certain types of applicants from the requirements or
to impose different, less burdensome requirements on them. The proposed  50.602 provides that the regulations
do not apply to SBIR Phase I applications and that where the applicant for a research grant is an individual, determinations
of the procedures to be followed to ensure the objectivity of the research will be made on a case-by-case basis. The
National Science Foundation (NSF) exempts from its Investigator Financial Disclosure Policy that is being published
in this issue of the 

Federal Register

 grantees employing fifty persons or less. Comment on whether HHS should adopt a similar exclusion is requested. Our
experiences with conflict of interest situations indicate that investigators working for small entities may be
just as subject to conflicts of interest as investigators working at large institutions. The interests of appropriate
coverage and of reducing burdens might both be served by determining the procedures to be followed by small entities
on a case-by-case basis as is proposed for individuals.

III. Uniform Federal Policy 



We have been working closely with the National Science Foundation (NSF) to ensure that this Notice of Proposed Rulemaking
and the policy published by NSF in this issue of the 

Federal Register

 will be consistent, and will impose the same obligations on funding recipients. In addition, HHS has been working
with the Office of Science and Technology Policy, the Office Management and Budget, NSF, and other interested agencies
to develop and propose a common Federal policy on investigator conflicts of interest. It is expected that this policy,
when completed, will ensure consistent treatment of investigator conflicts issues by all Federal funding agencies.


However, the statutes described above have necessitated some inconsistencies between these proposed regulations
and the policy being published by the NSF. Unlike the NSF policy, there is no provision permitting institutions to
waive the management, reduction, or elimination of an actual or potential conflicting interest when such action
would be either ineffective or inequitable, and the potential negative impacts that might arise from the conflicting
interest are outweighed by interests of scientific progress, technology transfer, or the public health and welfare.
Because section 493A of the Public Health Service Act requires institutions conducting PHS-funded clinical research
projects to manage or eliminate financial interests that would potentially bias the project, we do not believe HHS
has the discretion to permit institutions to waive this requirement. Similarly, section 493A necessitates the requirements
for institutional notification of the PHS Awarding Component in  50.604(a)(7)(ii) and (8). In addition, the
statute specifically requires the announcement, with each public presentation of the research, of a conflicting
financial interest that was not managed, reduced, or eliminated, as set forth in  50.606(d). This requirement
is limited to PHS-funded clinical research projects, but the requirements of institutional notification to the
PHS have not been so limited, because we believe that such notification serves a useful purpose for all PHS-funded
research, and that disparate reporting requirements for different types of research would cause confusion and create
burdens for the institutions. 

The Department notes that ``management of a financial interest that could potentially bias a project'' may include
recognition by the institution that a potential conflict exists, and monitoring progress of the research to insure
that the financial interest does not bias the project. The Department specifically requests comment on whether this
interpretation maximizes consistency between this NPRM and the NSF's final policy, in the light of the statutory
distinctions discussed above. The Department seeks comment on whether this expansion of the statutory requirement
is appropriate in the context of PHS-funded research and the need to minimize burden on institutions. 



IV. Relationship to Other Laws



Many Institutions funded by the PHS Awarding Components are State Institutions whose employees are subject to State
laws designed to prevent financial conflict of interest. The proposed rules would not supplant these requirements
and are intended to be applied in addition to other applicable Federal and State restrictions related to potential
financial conflicts of interest, including Federal statutes and regulations that prohibit trading in securities
with knowledge of privileged or non-public information. 



V. Enforcement 



The proposed regulations provide for enforcement remedies both against researchers that fail to comply with institutional
policies issued under the regulation and Institutions that fail to comply with the regulation. The proposed rules
specifically state that the requirements constitute a condition of award and as such could be enforced through the
suspension or termination of a grant or cooperative agreement. A Termination for Convenience or a Stop Work Order
could be issued in accordance with the FAR if a contractor fails to enforce the Special Standards. Each contractor
would be required to meet the specified responsibility requirements prior to award of a contract. PHS awarding components
will work diligently with applicants to resolve compliance problems informally, to avoid the need for formal enforcement
action.

E.O. 12866/Regulatory Flexibility Act Analysis 



Executive Order 12866 requires us to prepare an analysis for any rule that meets one of the E.O. 12866 criteria for a
significant regulatory action, that is, that may_

Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector
of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal
governments, and communities; 

Create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; 

Materially alter the budgetary impact of grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients
thereof; or 

Raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set
forth in E.O. 12866. 

In addition, we prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis, in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act, if
the rule is expected to have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. 

For reasons outlined below, we do not believe this rule is economically significant nor do we believe that it will have
a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. In addition, this rule is not inconsistent with the
actions of any other agency. However, we recognize that there are potential inconsistencies depending on what other
agencies may later propose. Several agencies are now considering issuing policies on what circumstances are likely
to lead to bias in research that is funded or relied upon by the Federal Government. 

Any rule in this area has the potential to inhibit socially beneficial research, and to hamper the technological progress
so essential to the American economy and to the advance of science. We are further mindful of the importance of the requirements
in Executive Order 12866 that any new regulatory system be based on a showing that there is a significant problem requiring
regulation, that regulatory priorities be based on the degree and nature of risks, and that regulations be designed
to be cost-effective. Moreover, the Regulatory Flexibility Act requires us to minimize adverse effects not only
on small businesses and individual entrepreneurs, but also on almost all non-profit entities including universities.


In the hearings that preceded enactment of the requirement in the NIH Revitalization Act, known cases were described
in which scientists have stood to make large sums of money contingent on the positive outcome of research on a particular
product, where this fact was not known to those reviewing the research, and where bias did occur. 

We have drafted this rule to address these instances of abuse, while minimizing unnecessary burden to researchers.
We did not consider any option that would routinely require all researchers to list all of their significant assets
(unrelated to the research project), that would encourage searches for hypothetical or speculative conflicts,
that would require divestiture of ownership of a product undergoing research, or that would discourage in any way
funding grants or contracts to scientists to develop products with significant profit potential. We have not inhibited
research in any way, other than requiring that it be managed to assure that potential bias is minimized. Such management
methods are common in the sciences and impose no undue burden. 

We request comment on whether there are any provisions of the proposed rule that might inadvertently hamper socially
desirable research. For example, we have proposed allowing institutions to require that researcher employees divest
themselves of stock in companies owning products undergoing research. Conversely, if there are other types of situations
in which a financial conflict of interest has a substantial risk of biasing research results, we will consider expanding
the scope of the rule. We ask that commenters provide evidence as to magnitude and frequency of any claimed adverse
effects or loopholes. 

We do not believe that the annual costs of implementing this rule will reach as much as $1,000 an institution in staff
time, or as much as $1 million a year across all institutions. Most of the cost will arise from the several seconds or
minutes spent certifying the absence of significant financial interests for individual awards. Spread across thousands
of grantee and contractor institutions, these costs are infinitesimal. Therefore, we have determined that this
rule would not create an ``unfunded mandate'' imposed on state-owned institutions and would not trigger the requirements
of Executive Order 12875, on ``Enhancing the Intergovernmental Partnership.'' 

For these same reasons, we certify that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities, and that a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is not required. 



2. Paperwork Reduction Act 



The proposed rules contain information collection requirements that are subject to review by the Office of Management
and Budget (OMB) under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980. Appropriate instructions for making certifications
to the PHS Awarding Components will be issued as an addendum to the instructions for applications for PHS research
funding. It is contemplated that the certification will be provided by checking a box on the application. The title,
description, and respondent description applicable to the information collection are shown below with an estimate
of the annual reporting and record-keeping burden. Included in the estimate is the time for reviewing instructions,
searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection
of information. 

Title: Responsibility of Applicants for Promoting Objectivity in Research for which Public Health Service (PHS)
Funding is Sought.

Description: The regulations would require each applicant/offeror Institution to establish procedures to avoid
the inappropriate financial interest of an Investigator involved in the design, conduct or reporting of the research
for which PHS funding is sought. 

Description of Respondents: Public and private non-profit 
institutions, small businesses, and other for-profit organizations.

Subpart F_Responsibility of Applicants for Promoting Objectivity in Research for Which PHS Funding Is Sought



Authority:

 42 U.S.C. 216, 289b-1, 299c-3. 



 50.601 


Purpose. 



This subpart promotes objectivity in research by requiring that each Institution that applies for PHS grants or cooperative
agreements for research ensure there is no reasonable expectation that the design, conduct, and reporting of the
research to be funded pursuant to the application will be biased by any Significant Financial Interest of an Investigator
responsible for the design, conduct, or reporting of the research. 



 50.602 


Applicability. 



This subpart is applicable to each Institution that applies for PHS grants or cooperative agreements for research
and, through the implementation of this subpart by each Institution, to each Investigator participating in research
covered by this subpart; provided, that this subpart does not apply to SBIR Program Phase I applications. In those
few cases where an individual, rather than an institution, is an applicant for PHS grants or cooperative agreements
for research, PHS Awarding Components will make case-by-case determinations on the steps to be taken to ensure that
the design, conduct, and reporting of the research will not be biased by any Significant Financial Interest of the
individual.

the Investigator's reporting responsibilities, and of this subpart. 

(2) Designate an institutional official(s) to solicit and review financial disclosure statements from each Investigator
who is 
planning to participate in PHS-funded research. 

(3) Ensure that Investigators have provided to the designated official(s) a listing of Significant Financial Interests
that ensures disclosure of all Significant Financial Interests of the type described in  50.605(a) prior to
the time an application is submitted to PHS. All financial disclosures must be updated during the pendency of the award,
either on an annual basis, or as new reportable Significant Financial Interests are obtained. 

(4) Provide guidelines consistent with this subpart for the designated official(s) to identify Significant Financial
Interests of the type described in  50.605(a) and take such actions as necessary to ensure that any such financial
interest 
will be managed, reduced, or eliminated. 

(5) Maintain records, identifiable to each award, of all financial disclosures and all actions taken by the Institution
with respect to each Significant Financial Interest of the type described in  50.605 for at least three years
beyond the termination or completion of the award, or until resolution of any action by the HHS involving the records,
whichever is longer. 

(6) Establish procedures for resolving any alleged violation of the financial conflict of interest policy of the
Institution and establish appropriate enforcement action for failure to comply. 

(7) Certify, in each application for the funding to which this subpart applies, that; 

(i) There is in effect at that Institution a written and enforced administrative process to identify and manage, reduce
or eliminate Significant Financial Interests of the type described in  50.605(a) with respect to all research
projects for which funding is sought from the PHS, 

(ii) The Institution either has, or has not found a Significant Financial Interest of the type described in  50.606
and, where such interest is found, certify that actions will be taken prior to the award of funding to manage, reduce
or eliminate that interest in accordance with this subpart; and that the Institution will notify the PHS Awarding
Component of such action prior to issuance of the Notice of Grant Award. 

(iii) The Institution agrees to make information available, upon request, to the HHS regarding all Significant Financial
Interests identified by the Institution of the type described in  50.605 and how those interests have been managed,
reduced, or eliminated to protect the research from bias; 

(iv) The Institution will otherwise comply with this subpart. 

(8) (i) Notify the PHS Awarding Component of the identification and management, reduction or elimination of any Significant
Financial Interest of the type described in  50.605 that originates or becomes known to the institution after
the grant or cooperative agreement has been awarded, within sixty days of its becoming aware of that interest.

(ii) The HHS may at any time request submission of, or review on site, all records pertinent to these certifications.
To the extent permitted by law, all records of financial interests will be maintained confidentially. 

(iii) An investigator may participate in a PHS-funded research project that is being simultaneously supported by
an organization that has a commercial interest in the finding of the research project. However, the research support
must be provided through the PHS awardee Institution. Any direct compensation or payment to the Investigator under
that support is considered a financial interest under this subpart. 



 50.605



Management of Significant Financial Interests. 



(a)(1) Institutions applying for PHS funding for research shall ensure that the following types of Significant Financial
Interests attributable to an Investigator are managed, reduced, or eliminated, in accordance with paragraph (b)
of this section, prior to award of the grant: 

(i) Any Significant Financial Interest of the Investigator that would reasonably appear to be directly and significantly
affected by the research funded by PHS, or proposed for funding; and 

(ii) Any Significant Financial Interest of the Investigator in an entity whose financial Interest would reasonably
appear to be directly and significantly affected by the research funded by PHS, or proposed for funding. 

(2) In addition to the types of Significant Financial Interests described in this paragraph that must be managed,
an Institution may require the management of other financial interests as the Institution deems appropriate. 

(b) The designated official(s) must review all financial disclosures, determine whether Significant Financial
Interests could affect the design, conduct, or reporting of the research activities funded by PHS, or proposed for
such funding, and determine what conditions or restrictions, if any, should be imposed by the institution to manage
such interests. 
Examples of conditions or restrictions that might be imposed to manage actual or potential conflicts of interest
include: 

(1) Public disclosure of significant financial interests; 

(2) Monitoring of research by independent reviewers; 

(3) Modification of the research plan; 

(4) Disqualification from participation in all or a portion of the research funded by the PHS; 

(5) Divestiture of significant financial interests; or

(6) Severance of relationships that create actual or potential conflicts. 



 50.606



Remedies. 



(a) Each Institution that applies for research funding from the PHS must include in its policy for the identification
and management of Significant Financial Interest procedures for enforcement action against employees who do not
comply with the Institution's policy. If the failure of an employee to comply with the policy of the Institution has
biased the design, conduct, or reporting of the PHS-funded research, the Institution must promptly notify the PHS
Awarding Component of the corrective action taken. The PHS Awarding Component will consider the situation and, as
necessary, take appropriate action, or refer the matter to the Institution for further action, which may include
directions to the Institution on how to maintain appropriate objectivity in the funded project. 

(b) The HHS may inquire into the Institutional procedures and actions regarding financial interests in PHS-funded
research, including the disposition of a particular financial interest. Such inquiry may be initiated based on information
obtained by the HHS under this subpart, from an award-related document (application, progress report, publication
of results), or any other source. Based on a specific inquiry, the HHS may decide that a particular Significant Financial
Interest of the type described in  50.606 will bias the objectivity of the PHS-funded research to such an extent
that further corrective action is needed or that the Institution has not managed a Significant Financial Interest
described in  50.606 in accordance with this subpart. The PHS may determine that suspension of funding is necessary
until the matter is resolved. 

(c) In any case in which the Department determines that a PHS-funded project of clinical research whose purpose is
to evaluate the safety or effectiveness of a drug, medical device, or treatment has been designed, conducted, or reported
by an Investigator with a Significant Financial Interest that was not disclosed or managed as required by this subpart,
the Institution must require disclosure of the financial interest in each public presentation of the results of the
research.

Acreage Limitation Rules and Regulations



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Bureau of Reclamation, Interior.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of proposed rulemaking.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Reclamation Reform Act of 1982 (RRA), as amended, requires landholders (landowners and lessees) to meet certain
requirements in order to be eligible to receive irrigation water from Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) projects.
The purposes of the proposed rule are to improve compliance with the form submittal requirements of the RRA and the
Acreage Limitation Rules and Regulations (43 CFR Part 426), help ensure that irrigation water is delivered only to
eligible landholders, and recoup administrative costs Reclamation incurs in conjunction with noncompliance with
these requirements. The proposed rule revises the existing rules by adding a section that will impose fees on districts
when statutory and regulatory requirements concerning the submittal of forms are not met.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The RRA limits the amount of owned land on which a landholder can receive irrigation water and places a limit on the amount
of leased land that can receive such water at a subsidized water rate. In order to ensure compliance with the ownership
limitations and the limitations on subsidies, certain statutory and regulatory requirements must be met.



One of these requirements applies to all landholders whose landholdings in districts subject to the acreage limitation
provisions total more than 40 acres. These landholders must complete RRA certification or reporting forms prior
to receipt of irrigation water. The forms must be completed annually and submitted to each district in which the landholder
receives irrigation water. Landholders must disclose on the forms all the land they own and lease directly or indirectly
in Reclamation projects that are subject to the acreage limitation provisions. The forms must be resubmitted whenever
a landholding change occurs. If a landholding does not change, a verification statement to that effect must be submitted
each year.

While the RRA and 43 CFR Part 426 set limits on the receipt of irrigation water and establish requirements that must
be met in order to receive such water, the current rules do not address situations in which water has been delivered
to landholders who failed to meet all the requirements. These situations were not addressed because the RRA does not
contemplate such deliveries.

Districts, rather than Reclamation, generally control the deliveries of irrigation water to landholders. Pursuant
to their contracts with the United States, the districts are legally obligated not to deliver irrigation water to
landholders who do not meet the eligibility requirements in the RRA.

With respect to the form requirements discussed previously, 43 CFR 426.10(k) specifically states that failure by
landholders to submit the required certification or reporting form(s) will result in loss of eligibility to receive
irrigation water. However, during its water district reviews, Reclamation has found that in some instances, districts
have delivered irrigation water to landholders who had failed to meet the form requirements and other requirements
of the law and rules.

In 1988, Reclamation adopted a compensation policy whereby full-cost charges were assessed for irrigation water
that had been delivered to ineligible landholders. This policy is based on the legal theory that when irrigation water
is delivered to ineligible recipients, it is an unlawful conversion of the Government's property interest in the
water, and the Government is therefore entitled to be compensated for the conversion. Since Reclamation cannot recover
the water that was delivered to the ineligible recipients, it has been Reclamation's position that it is entitled
to recover the value of its property interest in that water and that the full-cost water rate prescribed in the RRA is
an appropriate measure of the water's value.

When the new administration came into office in 1993, Reclamation decided to review certain agency policies, one
of which was the full-cost compensation policy for RRA form violations. The Commissioner of Reclamation asked the
Department of the Interior's Office of the Solicitor whether Reclamation is permitted to impose charges other than
full-cost compensation charges for such violations. In a July 23, 1993, memorandum, the Associate Solicitor, Division
of Energy and Resources, advised the Commissioner that several laws ``* * * authorize Reclamation
to promulgate regulations necessary to carry out its mission, including those which would assess fees. This means
that Reclamation may, by regulation, impose administrative fees or other charges designed to recover the costs it
incurs for processing improperly submitted forms or for collecting forms from those who have not submitted them.''
The Associate Solicitor further concluded that ``* * * Reclamation has considerable discretion
in determining how to calculate those costs, so long as the charges imposed bear a demonstrable relationship to the
costs incurred by the agency and have the intended effect of improving compliance with the Act and achieving congressional
objectives.''

Based on the Associate Solicitor's conclusions, Reclamation decided to consider the imposition of assessments
to recover its administrative costs. Under this approach, an assessment would be established based on the costs incurred
by Reclamation for additional actions the agency must take to correct instances of noncompliance. An average cost
per violation would be determined and applied uniformly throughout Reclamation projects. The assessments would
provide an equitable method for addressing RRA violations and result in charges that are reasonable, while recovering
the incremental costs Reclamation incurs. In addition, even though such assessments would be applied after a violation
had taken place, they would provide an incentive for landholders and districts to comply in upcoming water years.
Thereby, the assessments would help to ensure that ineligible landholders do not receive irrigation water.

After reviewing the concept of assessments for administrative costs, Reclamation decided to revise the current
rules to provide for such assessments. However, before initiating the rulemaking, Reclamation notified the public
of its intent and asked for their comments. (See 

58 FR 59427,

 Nov. 9, 1993.)



Summary of Comments



During the comment period, 32 responses were received. Most responses were submitted by district personnel or attorneys
representing districts or other water user organizations; some individual landholders also submitted comments.
Approximately 50 percent of the respondents approved of Reclamation's intent to establish the proposed assessments.
The remaining 50 percent were either opposed to the concept or did not express a strong position on the matter.

The most frequently expressed comment was that the assessments should not be based on the full-cost water rate as that
term is defined in the RRA. Many respondents gave suggestions for establishing the proposed assessments; they are
summarized in the following list.

The respondents thought the assessments should be:




1. fair;

2. reasonable;

3. uniform throughout Reclamation projects;

4. related to



(a) the severity of the violation,

(b) the number of acres involved in the violation,

(c) the costs incurred by the Government to enforce the RRA,

(d) the purposes of the RRA,

(e) the number of previous offenses by landholders and districts,

(f) costs other than Reclamation's audit costs;



5. minimal because



(a) the RRA is complex,

(b) sometimes Reclamation is at least partially responsible for the offense;



6. limited to cases where



(a) water is delivered to landholders that failed to submit RRA forms,

(b) water is delivered to excess land, (c) water users are pumping more water than Reclamation law or the district contract
allows;



7. applied



(a) prospectively only,

(b) only after landholders and districts have been given a grace period in which to correct the problem,

(c) only if an error was intentional,

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940628-1-00060 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940628-1-00011 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(d) within a reasonable amount of time after the 
offense occurred; 



8. subject to an appeals and/or hearing process; 
9. assessed to the districts; 
10. assessed to the involved landholders; 
11. collected by Reclamation; 
12. credited to districts' contract obligations.




In addition to the above comments, some respondents questioned Reclamation's authority to impose assessments for
administrative costs. A few respondents also questioned whether the assessments will have the intended effect of
improving compliance with the requirements of the RRA. One respondent commented that Reclamation should not use
the assessments to replace the current requirement that landholders must submit an RRA form as a condition for receipt
of irrigation water. Another stated that RRA compliance levels would improve if Reclamation conducted water district
reviews and district training sessions more frequently. Two respondents requested Reclamation to increase the
40-acre threshold for exemption from the RRA form requirements, while another requested that the current class 1
equivalency provisions be revised. 

Reclamation received several suggestions for establishing the amount of the assessments. Two respondents thought
the assessment should be $100 for instances where RRA forms contain minor errors. One suggested that in cases where
form errors are more significant; for example, failure to disclose land held in excess of a non-full-cost entitlement,
the full-cost rate plus a $2,000 fee should be charged. Another suggestion was that Reclamation should ask Congress
to pass legislation authorizing the agency to charge twice the full-cost rate if irrigation water is delivered to
excess land. 

All comments were considered during preparation of the proposed rule except for those relating to the forms exemption
threshold, equivalency provisions, deliveries to excess land, water district reviews, and RRA training. These
topics are outside the scope of the subject rulemaking. 



Summary of Proposed Rule 



The proposed rule provides for the imposition of assessments for administrative costs incurred by Reclamation in
conjunction with noncompliance with the form requirements. A district will be assessed for administrative costs
when RRA forms are not submitted prior to receipt of irrigation water. The assessment will be applied on a yearly basis
in each district for each direct and indirect landholder that failed to comply with the form requirements. A district
will also be assessed for administrative costs when corrections to RRA forms are not provided within a 45-day grace
period. The assessment will be applied on a yearly basis in each district for each direct and indirect landholder for
which corrected forms are not provided within the grace period. These assessments for administrative costs will
replace the full-cost charges that Reclamation currently assesses for form violations pursuant to its compensation
policy. The administrative cost assessments will not be subject to the underpayment interest component as set forth
in  426.23. 

The assessment for administrative costs is initially set at $260 per form violation. The amount is based on a review
of the costs Reclamation incurred in 1991, 1992, and 1993 performing activities to address RRA form violations. The
assessment reflects the average direct and indirect costs incurred Reclamation-wide for: (1) communicating with
district representatives or landholders to obtain missing or corrected forms, (2) assisting landholders in completing
certification or reporting forms for the period of time 
they were not in compliance with the form requirements, 
(3) performing onsite visits to determine if irrigation water deliveries have been terminated to landholders that
failed to submit the required forms, and (4) performing other activities necessary to address form violations. The
assessment will be reviewed at least once every 5 years and, if needed, will be adjusted to reflect new cost data. 

As with other assessments, districts will be held responsible for payment of the assessments because of their contractual
obligation with the United States. As required by 31 U.S.C. 3302, charges collected through the imposition of assessments
for administrative costs will be credited to the general fund of the Treasury as miscellaneous receipts. 

Payment of the assessments set forth in the proposed rule does not exempt districts and landholders from the form requirements
of the RRA or Acreage Limitation Rules and Regulations. Districts are not permitted to continue water deliveries
to ineligible recipients simply because they are willing to pay the assessments. Reclamation will take all necessary
actions to prevent the delivery of irrigation water to ineligible land. 

The Department of the Interior has determined that the proposed rule does not constitute a significant regulatory
action under Executive Order 12866 because it will not: (1) have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more
or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment,
public health or safety, or State, local or tribal governments or communities; (2) create a serious inconsistency
or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially alter the budgetary impact
of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients thereof; or (4) raise
novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth
in the executive order.

2. Section 426.24 is redesignated as  426.25, and new section 426.24 is added to read as follows: 



 426.24 

Assessments of administrative costs. 



(a) 

Forms submittal. 

A district will be assessed for the administrative costs described in paragraph (e) of this section when irrigation
water has been delivered to landholders that did not submit certification or reporting forms prior to the receipt
of irrigation water in accordance with  426.10(e). The assessment will be applied on a yearly basis in each district
for each direct and indirect landholder that received irrigation water but failed to comply with  426.10(e).


(b) 

Forms corrections. 

Where corrections are needed on certification or reporting forms, the requirements of 
 426.10(a) will be deemed to have been met so long as the district provides corrected forms to the Bureau of Reclamation
within 45 days of the date of the Bureau's written request for corrections. A district will be assessed for the administrative
costs described in 
paragraph (e) of this section when corrected forms are not provided within this 45-day time period. The assessment
will be applied on a yearly basis in each district for each direct and indirect landholder for whom corrected forms
are not provided within the applicable 45-day time period. 

(c) 

Parties responsible for paying assessments. 

Districts shall be responsible for payment of the assessments described in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.


(d) 

Disposition of assessments. 

The administrative costs assessed and collected pursuant to paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section will be deposited
to the general fund of the United States Treasury as miscellaneous receipts. 

(e) 

Assessment for administrative costs. 

The assessment for administrative costs shall initially be set at $260. This is based on an average of the direct and
indirect costs the Bureau of Reclamation incurs performing activities to obtain certification or reporting forms
from landholders that failed to submit such forms prior to receipt of irrigation water and form corrections that are
not submitted by the designated due date. This initial $260 assessment for administrative costs will be reviewed
at least once every 5 years and adjusted, if needed, to reflect new cost data based upon the Bureau's costs for communicating
with district representatives and landholders to obtain missing or corrected forms; assisting landholders in completing
certification or reporting forms for the period of time they were not in compliance with the form requirements; performing
onsite visits to determine if irrigation water deliveries have been terminated to landholders that failed to submit
the required forms; and performing other activities necessary to address form violations. Notice of the revised
assessment for administrative costs will be published in the 

Federal Register

 in December of the year the data are reviewed.

Revision to NASA FAR Supplement Coverage on Precontract Costs



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Office of Procurement, Procurement Policy Division, National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of proposed rulemaking.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This rule proposes to amend the regulations pertaining to precontract costs to specify the content of letters to contractors
which authorize the incurrence of precontract costs, make clear the circumstances when precontract costs would
be appropriate, and clarify that precontract costs are not allowable unless the clause ``Precontract Costs'' is
included in the contract. In addition, the proposed rule revises the prescription for the clause to allow its use in
other than cost-reimbursement contracts. Also, the rule proposes to change the title of that clause from ``Date of
Incurrence of Costs'' to ``Precontract Costs'' to more accurately reflect its purpose.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 




Background



Although NASA has used authorization letters for precontract costs for many years, there has been little standardization
in the contents of the letters. In addition, the current NASA FAR Supplement coverage at 1831.205-32 does not
make it clear when the use of precontract costs would be appropriate, or that the clause at 1852.231-70 is required
to be in the contract in order for precontract costs to be allowable. In addition, the clause prescription incorrectly
states that the clause only should go in cost-reimbursement contracts. The clause would also be applicable to fixed-price
incentive or redeterminable contracts and to terminated firm-fixed price contracts, as the cost principles at (FAR)
48 CFR Subpart 31.2 would be applicable. The proposed rule specifies the information to be included in precontract
cost authorization letters to contractors, identifies when the use of precontract costs would be appropriate, as
well as requires the clause at 1852.231-70 be used for precontract costs to be allowable. The proposed rule also
retitles the clause at 1852.231-70 from the ``Date of Incurrence of Costs'' to ``Precontract Costs'' to more
accurately reflect the purpose of the clause.



Impact



NASA certifies that this regulation will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities
under Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq.

). This rule does not impose any reporting or record keeping requirements subject to the Paperwork reduction Act.

2. Section 1831.205-32 is revised to read as follows:



1831.205-32 

Precontract costs.



(a) The authorization of precontract costs is not encouraged and shall be granted only when there will be a sole source
award or a single offeror has been selected for negotiations as the result of a competitive procurement, the criteria
at (FAR) 48 CFR 31.205-32 are met, and a written request and justification has been submitted to and approved
by the procurement officer. The justification shall (1) substantiate the necessity for the contractor to proceed
prior to contract award, (2) specify the start date of such contractor effort, (3) identify the total estimated time
of the advanced effort, and (4) specify the cost limitation.

(b) Authorization to the contractor to incur precontract costs shall be in writing and shall (1) specify the start
date of incurrence of such costs, (2) specify a limitation on the total amount of precontract costs which may be incurred,
(3) state that the costs are allowable only to the extent they would have been if incurred after the contract had been
entered into, and (4) state that the Government is under no obligation to reimburse the contractor for any costs unless
a contract is awarded.

(c) Precontract costs shall not be allowable unless the clause at 1852.231-70, Precontract Costs, is included
in the contract.

3. Section 1831.205-70 is revised to read as follows:



1831.205-70 

Contract clause.



The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 1852.231-70, Precontract Costs, in contracts for which
specific coverage of precontract costs is authorized under 1831.205-32.

4. Section 1852.231-70 is revised to read as follows:



1852.231-70 

Precontract costs.



As prescribed in 1831.205-70, insert the following clause:



Precontract Costs



(XXX 19XX)



The contractor shall be entitled to reimbursement for costs incurred on or after 

XXXXXXX

 in an amount not to exceed $ 

XXXX

 that, if incurred after this contract had been entered into, would have been reimbursable under this contract.

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 As part of its comprehensive efforts to address the 
problem of light vehicle rollover, this agency is proposing a 
new consumer information regulation that would require that 
passenger cars and light multipurpose passenger vehicles and 
trucks be labeled with information about their resistance to 
rollover. This information would enable prospective 
purchasers to make choices about new vehicles based on 
differences in rollover risk; motivate manufacturers to give 
more priority to rollover stability in designing their 
vehicles; and inform motorists that they can reduce the risk 
of injury in a rollover by wearing their safety belts. NHTSA 
believes that this would reduce the number of injuries and 
fatalities from rollover accidents.

I. The Rollover Crash Problem 


Rollover crashes occur for many reasons, and involve the 
interaction of a variety of factors including the driver, the 
roadway, the vehicle, and environmental conditions. The 
relationship of these various factors to rollover crashes can 
be examined by analyzing data from various sources. 
The agency estimates that there were 220,000 rollover 
crashes involving passenger cars, and multipurpose passenger 
vehicles and trucks under 4,536 kilograms (10,000 pounds) 
gross vehicle weight rating (collectively, ``light trucks'') in 
1991. These resulted in 9,186 fatalities; 56,000 occupants of 
these vehicles received serious, incapacitating injuries. 
These numbers have remained relatively constant over the past 
six years. Ejections are responsible for 63 percent of the 
fatalities. Safety belts are used by only 13 percent of the 
fatally injured occupants. 
Of the 220,000 rollover crashes, 207,000, or 94 percent, 
were single vehicle crashes and 192,000 of these, or 93 
percent, occurred off the road. Various accident studies have 
indicated that loss of vehicle directional control is a 
prelude to rollover in 50 percent to 80 percent of all 
rollover crashes. 
For the years 1985-1991, small cars had the greatest 
number of rollover fatalities, followed by standard-size 
pickup trucks. However, pickup trucks and sport utility 
vehicles have fatality rates per million registered vehicles 
between two and three times as great as that of passenger 
cars. The difference between the numbers of rollover 
fatalities and the rollover fatality rates for particular 
vehicle types is a result of the relative proportions of 
various types of vehicles in the fleet. There are currently 
many more small cars than pickup trucks and sport utility 
vehicles on the road today. 
(A more extensive discussion of rollover statistics, and 
the sources for this information, can be found in the 
``Addendum to Technical Assessment Paper,'' NHTSA 1994, which 
is in Docket No. 91-68, Notice 03.)

A. Agency Efforts To Address the Rollover Crash Problem 



The agency believes that no single type of rulemaking or other agency action could solve all, or even a majority of,
the problems associated with rollover. Accordingly, it is pursuing a broad range of actions to address those problems.


First, NHTSA has published an NPRM to reduce the potential for injuries to the head from contact with upper interior
components (58 FR 7506, February 8, 1993). The comment period was reopened to December 1, 1993 (58 FR 54099, 
October 20, 1993) and a public hearing was held on November 15, 1993. As explained in the Addendum to Technical Assessment
Paper, NHTSA's research indicates that head injuries are the most prevalent type of injury associated with rollovers.
The agency expects to issue a final rule on this subject in late 1994. 

Second, with respect to anti-lock brake systems, the agency has published an advance notice of proposed rulemaking
(ANPRM) for light duty vehicles (January 4, 1994, 59 FR 281). (``Light duty vehicles'' include cars, vans, pickup
trucks and sport utility vehicles with a gross vehicle weight rating of 
4,536 kilograms (10,000 pounds) or less.) Since most vehicles involved in rollovers lose their longitudinal stability
before leaving the roadway, where they then trip and roll over, and since anti-lock brake systems are designed to enhance
the longitudinal stability of a vehicle, a requirement for anti- 
lock brakes could reduce the number of rollovers. NHTSA's preliminary evaluation of rear-wheel anti-lock brake
systems, the type of anti-lock brakes most often found on light trucks, indicates that anti-lock brakes on light trucks
are effective in reducing the number of nonfatal single vehicle accident rollovers for almost every type of truck,
under any type of road condition. Reductions of single vehicle accident rollovers were typically in the range of 30
percent to 40 percent. NHTSA is continuing to analyze the data and a comprehensive report of the findings will be published
at a later date. (The preliminary evaluation is available in Docket No. 70-27-GR-026.) 

Third, as noted above, ejections are a frequent occurrence in fatal rollover crashes. To attempt to reduce the frequency
of ejections, the agency is conducting research on glass/plastic side windows and improved door latches. Preliminary
research results should be available within the next year to enable NHTSA to determine if rulemaking should be pursued
in these areas. 

Fourth, the agency is conducting research on improvements to vehicles' roof strength that could reduce head and neck
injuries. A decision whether to begin rulemaking on this subject is expected in 1994. 

Fifth, as noted above, safety belt use is very low among persons fatally or seriously injured in rollover crashes.
NHTSA promotes increased use of safety belts through public awareness and education efforts and by supporting the
implementation and enforcement of state safety belt use laws. Agency occupant protection awareness and education
activities include national media campaigns; outreach through national health, medical, civic, and intergovernmental
organizations; and, administration of Section 402 state highway safety program funds. The agency promotes effective
state safety 
belt usage laws by conducting evaluation studies and demonstration projects, training law enforcement personnel,
and by administering the Section 153 state incentive grant program. 

In addition, NHTSA has contracted with the Advertising Council to prepare two ``Vince and Larry

SM

'' (the agency's safety belt ``spokespersons'') public service announcements (PSAs) for television, and one ``Vince
and Larry

SM

'' PSA for radio, on the specific benefits of safety belts in rollover crashes. One of the television PSAs and the radio
PSA were available at the end of March, 1994. The other television PSA will be 
available approximately six months later. These safety belt initiatives will supplement the other actions to address
the rollover problem. 

Sixth, it is well known that rollover crashes have a high incidence of alcohol involvement. The agency has numerous
programs and activities aimed at reducing alcohol-related crashes, injuries, and fatalities, which follow two

fundamental strategies: information-education (such as Advertising Council PSAs on television) and laws-enforcement-sanctions
(such as .08 BAC, sobriety checkpoints, and increasingly severe sanctions for repeat offenders). Section 
410 grants to states provide incentives to states to use these strategies. These combined strategies have been effective
as alcohol-related fatalities have decreased 30 percent over the past 10 years. 

Seventh, and finally, the agency is issuing this notice regarding vehicle stability requirements and consumer information.




B. Consumer Information Activities 



NHTSA believes that consumer and manufacturer behavior can be affected through the provision of consumer information
regarding vehicle safety. The agency's experience with the New Car Assessment Program (NCAP) demonstrates the power
of consumer information. Under the NCAP Program, the agency tests the ability of vehicles to protect their front seat
occupants in frontal crash tests. The tests are similar to those conducted under Standard No. 208, 

Occupant Protection,

 to determine whether vehicles meet the Standard's injury criteria, except that the Standard's tests are conducted
at 30 mph, while NCAP tests are conducted at 35 mph. Several manufacturers have informed the agency that they view it
as important to perform well in the NCAP tests, even though there is no regulatory requirement to do so. The decline
in the 
injury scores in NCAP tests over time for all manufacturers, as reported in ``Report on the Historical Performance
of Different Auto Manufacturers in the New Car Assessment Program Tests,'' NHTSA, August 1993, can also be attributed
partially to NCAP.

<PARENT> FR940628-1-00014 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The agency believes that further safety improvements could be gained through providing consumers with information
about additional aspects of new vehicle safety performance. NHTSA recently conducted a series of 15 focus groups,
comprised of members of the public, to examine the type and format of desired consumer information about vehicle safety.
(See ``Focus Groups on Traffic Safety Issues: Public Response to NCAP,'' S.W. Morris & Company, Inc., August
1993, which can be found in Docket No. 79-17, Notice 01, or ``New Car 
Assessment Program_Response to the NCAP FY 1992 Congressional Requirements,'' Report to the Congress, December
1993, which can be found in Docket No. 97-17, Notice 39). One of the topics examined was the current NCAP and how
it could be improved. In response to the results of the focus group work, the agency has changed the format for NCAP test
results. The new format responds to consumer demand for reporting results in a way that is less technical and easier
to understand. 

The focus groups also indicated that the agency's consumer safety information activities should be expanded to include
additional kinds of crashes, including side impacts and rollovers. The potential importance of providing broader
safety information about new light duty vehicle performance 
can be seen from figures regarding the proportion of fatalities in each of the three most important types of crashes.
In 1991, frontal crashes accounted for 39 percent of all fatalities involving light duty vehicle occupants, rollover
crashes for 30 percent, and side impact crashes for 25 percent. Together, these three types of crashes account for
94 percent of all fatalities. Information on performance in all three types of crashes could provide consumers with
a comprehensive, balanced picture of the safety of new vehicles. 

As part of its efforts to expand its consumer safety information programs, NHTSA has sought participation and guidance
from the general public on the types and format of safety information to be provided to consumers. On January 3, 1994,
the agency published a request for comments on whether to supplement the agency's efforts by holding a public meeting
to discuss, among other items, the expansion of the NCAP program to other crash modes (59 FR 104). 

Based on the foregoing, the agency plans to supplement this rollover proposal with a future proposal for requiring
that each new vehicle have a window sticker providing information not only on vehicle rollover resistance, but also
on frontal and side impact crash performance. 



III. Background 



A. Statutory Requirement for Rulemaking 



The NHTSA Authorization Act of 1991 (the Act) (part of the Intermodel Surface Transportation Efficiency Act) requires
the agency to address several vehicle safety subjects through rulemaking. One of the subjects, set forth in section
2503(1), is protection against unreasonable risk of rollovers of passenger cars, multipurpose passenger vehicles,
and trucks with a gross vehicle weight rating of 8,500 pounds or less and an unloaded vehicle weight of 5,500 pounds
or less. 

Section 2502(b)(2)(A) of the Act required that NHTSA publish, no later than May 31, 1992, an ANPRM or a notice of proposed
rulemaking (NPRM) on this subject. The January 3, 1992, ANPRM fulfilled this mandate. 

Section 2502(b)(2)(B)(i) of the Act provides that the agency must complete a rulemaking action on rollover within
26 months of publishing the ANPRM. The ANPRM was published on January 3, 1992; thus, this rulemaking action was to have
been completed by March 3, 1994. Section 2502(b)(2)(B)(ii) of the Act provides that this rulemaking will be considered
completed when NHTSA either publishes a final rule or decides and announces that it is not promulgating a rule. 



B. ANPRM and Planning Document 



NHTSA announced in its January 3, 1992 ANPRM on the rollover problem that it was considering various regulatory actions
to reduce the frequency of vehicle rollovers and/or the number and severity of injuries resulting from vehicle rollovers
(57 FR 242). The agency requested comments on potential regulatory actions in the areas of: (1) Improved stability;
(2) improved crashworthiness; and (3) consumer information. NHTSA said that it might issue a rule or rules in any one
of these three categories, or in any combination of 
them.

The ANPRM discussed the agency's statistical analyses of the interaction of driver characteristics, vehicle stability
metrics, roadway and environmental conditions. The notice described the following vehicle stability metrics as
having a potentially significant role in vehicle rollover: center of gravity height; static stability factor; tilt
table ratio; side pull ratio; wheelbase; critical sliding velocity; rollover prevention metric; braking stability
metric; and percent of total vehicle weight on the rear axle. A vehicle stability metric is a measured vehicle parameter
that presumably is related to the vehicle's likelihood of rollover involvement. To supplement the ANPRM, a Technical
Assessment Paper that discussed testing activities, testing results, accident data collection, and analysis of
the data was placed in the docket on January 6, 1992. A description of the individual metrics can be found in the Technical
Assessment Paper. 




(

Note:

 For the remainder of this notice, ``tilt table angle'' is used in place of ``tilt table ratio,'' regardless of the term
used in any other document. NHTSA is using ``tilt table angle'' because the agency is proposing tilt table angle as
one of the possible measurements to be used in the proposed consumer information regulation. Tilt table angle is the
angle at which the last uphill tire of a vehicle lifts off a tilting platform. Tilt table ratio is the tangent of the tilt
table angle and is believed to be harder for the average consumer to understand.) 




During the development of the ANPRM and subsequent to receiving and analyzing comments to the ANPRM, it became obvious
that no single type of rulemaking could solve all, or even a majority of, the problems associated with rollover. This
view was strengthened by the agency's review and analysis 
of the comments on the ANPRM. To emphasize this conclusion and inform the public further about the complicated nature
of the light duty vehicle rollover problem, the agency released a document titled ``Planning Document for Rollover
Prevention and Injury Mitigation'' at a Society of Automotive Engineers meeting on rollover on September 23, 1992.
The Planning Document gave an overview of the rollover problem and a list of alternative actions that NHTSA was examining
to address the problem. Alternatives for regulatory action and a schedule for decisions on each were included. The
current status of the presented alternative actions was discussed earlier in this notice. The document was placed
in Docket No. 91-68; Notice 02, on the same day. NHTSA published a notice in the 

Federal Register

 announcing the availability of the Planning Document and requesting comment (September 29, 1992; 57 FR 
44721).

Forty-two comments concerning the ANPRM and the Planning Document were received. A Summary of Comments was placed
in the docket on September 15, 1993. Ten commenters addressed the Planning Document, eight of whom had also commented
on the ANPRM. Responses to the Planning Document, for the most part, 
were abridged forms of the commenters' responses to the ANPRM. 

All the commenting vehicle manufacturers asserted that, while stability metrics are statistically related to the
rates with which single vehicle accidents result in rollovers, they are not causally related to rollover. Therefore,
the manufacturers asserted, the agency cannot issue a regulation 
based on any one of these metrics solely because of its statistical correlation with accident data. Automotive Testing,
BMW, Ford, GM, the American Automobile Manufacturers Association (AAMA, then known as the Motor Vehicle Manufacturers
Association), and VW claimed that stability metrics are insufficient by themselves to explain a vehicle's degree
of involvement in rollover crashes. These commenters stated that driver and environmental factors outweigh the
contributions of vehicle factors to the likelihood of a single vehicle accident becoming a rollover. Nevertheless,
most commenters addressed the relevancy of several of the individual metrics the agency considered for a vehicle
stability rulemaking. 

Tilt table angle, one of the metrics being proposed in this notice, appeared to be more acceptable to the commenters
than the other stability metrics. While side pull ratio was favored by Automotive Testing, Chrysler, GM, and Nissan,
all these commenters also commented favorably on aspects of tilt table angle. Static stability factor was favored
by only Perrone Forensic Consulting, who also commented favorably on tilt table angle. All other commenters who indicated
a preference among the metrics discussed in the ANPRM favored tilt table angle. However, Chrysler, Ford, GM, Isuzu,
and VW claim vehicle changes made to improve a vehicle's tilt table performance may degrade a vehicle's control and
handling attributes. Chrysler said that the repeatability of results from the tilt table procedure was unknown.
On the other hand, Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety, the International 
Organization of Motor Vehicle Manufacturers, and GM stated they believe that the procedure is repeatable. Chrysler
and AAMA also commented that the tilt table test is not a standard practice and its measurement error has not been established.


Commenters did not respond directly to the idea of using critical sliding velocity, which is also being proposed for
use in this notice. However, most manufacturers commented that center of gravity height (a measurement necessary
to calculate critical sliding velocity) is difficult to measure and that the measurement is not repeatable. Therefore,
according to these commenters, any metric which uses center of gravity height would be impracticable. 

The commenters also focussed on crashworthiness improvements. By far the most favorable crashworthiness countermeasure
cited by the commenters was increased seat belt use to prevent ejections. In general, commenters believe that more
benefits could be gained through increased seat belt use than through any vehicle related crashworthiness or crash
avoidance countermeasure. Some commenters also favored improved roof structures including roll bars or cages,
but Ford, GM, Nissan, and VW believe the installation of a roll 
bar or cage raises the vehicle's center of gravity and decreases rollover stability. Other suggestions were for improved
glazing, improved latch/lock/hinge systems for doors, anti-lock brakes, bumper height regulations, removal of
drunk and otherwise impaired drivers from the road, stricter enforcement of speed limits, and improved public awareness
of the causes of rollover crashes as ways to reduce rollover casualties. 

Finally, Chrysler, GM, AAMA, and Toyota claimed that labeling vehicles with a stability metric would be simplistic
and could mislead consumers, giving them a false sense of security in a vehicle labeled with a high stability metric
(i.e., a metric indicating comparatively high resistance to 
rollover). These commenters believe that consumers could consider the metric to be an absolute measure of rollover
likelihood, regardless of driver behavior or roadway conditions.

IV. Summary 




A. Summary of Agency Decision Not To Propose a Vehicle Standard 




In analyzing whether to proceed with a vehicle stability rulemaking, the agency identified several criteria that
had to be met before proposing a safety standard. First, the identified vehicle metrics had to have a causal relationship
to the likelihood of rollover. For example, center of gravity height affects rollover likelihood; the color of the
vehicle does not. Second, the metric had to have a statistical relationship to rollover frequency. Third, improvement
in the metric should result in significant safety benefits at a reasonable cost without having the effect of necessitating
the radical redesigning of one or more types of vehicles. As discussed below, the agency identified two metrics that
met the first two criteria, but not the third. 

To determine whether it was appropriate to propose a new vehicle safety standard, NHTSA examined the complex interactions
between driver behavior, vehicle properties, and roadway characteristics which result in rollovers. The suitability
of a vehicle safety standard based on rollover stability depends on the importance of rollover stability, as represented
by a vehicle metric, relative to other rollover influences, such as vehicle handling properties, vehicle condition,
the nature of the roadway and shoulder terrain, and driver behavior. The agency sought to determine whether vehicle
stability metrics are significant variables in a statistical model of the risk of rollover. If they are, then a standard
regulating stability might be justified, depending on the results of a comparison of benefits and costs for such a
standard. 

After analyzing a number of static and dynamic rollover metrics, the agency concluded that two vehicle metrics, tilt
table angle and critical sliding velocity, can account for about 50 percent of the variability in rollover risk in
single vehicle accidents, after considering driver, roadway, and environmental factors. (Rollover risk is the
number of single vehicle rollovers involving a particular make/model divided by the number of single vehicle crashes
of all types involving the same make/model.) This statistical analysis was conducted on all light duty vehicles treated
as a group. However, analysis of accident data indicated that certain subgroups of light duty vehicles are more likely
to roll over than other subgroups. For example, sport utility vehicles and compact pickup trucks tend to be the most
likely vehicles to roll over. Large passenger cars tend to be the least likely to roll over. The importance of this difference
is that if significant benefits are to be achieved, then changes in the metric should be made that affect passenger
cars since nearly 60 percent of rollover fatalities occur in those vehicles. 

The agency's analysis showed that setting a performance level high enough to affect passenger cars, would require
redesign of nearly all sport utility vehicles, vans, and pickup trucks. Using a single value of one of these metrics
as the performance standard for all light duty vehicles would have resulted in the radical redesign of the characteristics
many, and in some cases all, vehicles of certain classes. That degree of redesign would have raised issues of public
acceptance and possibly even the elimination of certain classes of vehicles as they are known today. 

To avoid this consequence, the agency then examined whether several values for these metrics, each applying to a different
class of vehicles (e.g., one value for passenger cars and a different value for light trucks) would be feasible. Since
the statistical analyses discussed above were conducted on all light duty vehicles treated as a group, it was necessary
to determine whether either of the stability metrics exhibited sufficiently high levels of correlation to assure
the agency that a requirement applying to only one class of vehicle would be expected to reduce the incidence of rollovers
for vehicles in that class. As explained later in this notice, the agency found that the statistical correlations
of the metrics with rollover accident data within a class of vehicles was not so consistent as for all vehicles grouped
together. This weakening of the predictive ability of the metric is, to some extent, the result of the smaller range
of the metric within any class of vehicles together with the inherent variability in the data. Based on this analysis,
and the general analysis of costs and benefits discussed later, the agency determined that proposing a standard specifying
one minimum stability value for cars and others for various classes of light trucks could not be justified. 

The agency also determined that, considering the costs and benefits involved, proposing a safety standard specifying
a single minimum stability value for both cars and light trucks could not be justified. While light trucks have lower
stability measurements than cars do, the greatest number of rollover-related deaths and injuries occur in passenger
cars because of their larger population size. Therefore, if the agency wished to set a stability minimum high enough
to realize significant reductions in the number of fatalities in all light duty vehicles, it would have to set the minimum
above the stability number of most light trucks. The costs of such a standard, in terms of the cost of vehicle redesign
and the loss of consumer-desired attributes, were determined to be very high, as entire classes of light trucks would
probably need to be substantially redesigned to meet such a standard. This redesign could result in the elimination
of some vehicle types, e.g., sport utility vehicles, as they are known today.

Based on this analysis, NHTSA has decided not to propose a vehicle stability rule, and is deferring any further action
on this subject until such time as information becomes available demonstrating the cost effectiveness of such a rule.
The agency may reinitiate such a rulemaking upon receipt of such information. This termination of rulemaking on vehicle
stability fulfills the statutory mandate of section 2502(b)(2)(B)(i). However, through the consumer information
proposal being published today, and the other actions mentioned above, NHTSA is continuing to take a comprehensive
approach to reducing rollover casualties. 



B. Summary of Proposed Consumer Information Regulation 



While NHTSA is terminating rulemaking on a vehicle stability standard, NHTSA believes that the correlation between
stability and rollover risk is significant enough to justify proposing a consumer information regulation to relieve
the possibility of uninformed risk. The agency believes that informing consumers of the relative resistance of different
vehicles to rollover will influence consumers to purchase more stable vehicles and encourage manufacturers to improve
the stability of their vehicles. The agency believes that these results are possible based on its assessment of how
consumers and manufacturers reacted to the provision of frontal crashworthiness information through the New Car
Assessment Program. 

The consumer information regulation being proposed by the agency would require manufacturers of passenger cars
and light trucks to label their vehicles with information relating to rollover stability. To that end, manufacturers
would be required to report a stability metric for each vehicle make/model to NHTSA by January 1 of each year. Manufacturers
would decide how to group vehicle make/models for the purpose of reporting stability metrics for those groups. To
ensure that the information is neither understated nor overstated, the reported stability metric would be measured
with a specified procedure and an accuracy tolerance on reported data would be required. NHTSA would use the information
reported by manufacturers to provide the manufacturers with the ranges of metrics for both passenger cars and light
trucks by April 1 of each year. For comparison purposes, these ranges would be included on vehicle labels. 

New vehicles manufactured after September 1, 1996 would be required to have a prescribed window label listing the
metric of the labeled vehicle, the range of that metric for cars and the range for light trucks. In addition, prescribed
language on the label would explain the significance of the metric, warn consumers that all vehicles can and do roll
over, and remind consumers to always wear seat belts. The proposed regulation would also require manufacturers to
include the information on the vehicle label in the vehicle's owner's manual. 

The agency requests comment on whether or not the proposed vehicle label should be a permanent sticker, in addition
to the window label which would be removed after first sale. If a commenter believes the label should be permanent,
NHTSA requests comment on whether the permanent sticker should be required on all vehicles, or only some subset of
vehicles with lower rollover stability. Finally, NHTSA requests suggestions on placement and size of a permanent
sticker. A permanent sticker would be useful to purchasers of used vehicles and drivers of rental vehicles. 

NHTSA is considering two metrics for providing information regarding rollover stability: critical sliding velocity
and tilt table angle. Critical sliding velocity is a measure of the minimum lateral (sideways) vehicle velocity required
to initiate rollover when the vehicle is tripped by something in the roadway environment, e.g., a curb. Tilt table
angle is the angle at which the last uphill tire of the vehicle lifts off a platform as the platform is increasingly tilted.


NHTSA is proposing two different options for specifying stability information using these metrics. First, NHTSA
may select one of the two metrics to appear on the label. For example, if the agency selected tilt table angle, it would
require that the specific angle for each vehicle be shown on its label. Second, NHTSA may require the label to include
a nonquantitative statement concerning the vehicle's rollover resistance based on one or both of the metrics. For
example, instead of stating a specific angle, the label might use symbols such as one, two, or three stars. 



V. Agency Analysis of the Vehicle Stability Metrics

The agency has concluded that the two metrics with the best correlation to accident statistics are tilt table angle,
a static measurement, and critical sliding velocity, a metric calculated from static and dynamic vehicle measurements
and expressed as velocity, i.e., units of feet per second, miles per hour, or kilometers per hour. 

Tilt table angle includes the influences of the vehicle's mass, center of gravity height, track width, and suspension
movement, all of which are physically related to rollover stability. Because it does not require an independent measurement
of center of gravity height, it is more practicable, less costly, and more repeatable than most static rollover metrics.


Critical sliding velocity includes the roll moment of inertia as well as the various static factors mentioned above
in its calculation. The Technical Assessment Paper found critical sliding velocity alone to have less correlation
with rollover accident statistics than tilt table angle, but found it to be a statistically significant addition
to a model already containing tilt table angle. However, an error in the computation of critical sliding velocity
was made in the Technical Assessment Paper. When the logistic regression was repeated with the correct critical sliding
velocity values and data for more vehicle make/models and additional accident years, NHTSA found the correlation
of critical sliding velocity to accident statistics for all light duty vehicles grouped together and for the light
truck and passenger car categories to be better than that for tilt table angle. The Addendum to Technical Assessment
Paper contains the corrected analysis. 



B. Analysis of Importance of Factors 



1. Additional Analyses Since the ANPRM


Since the ANPRM, new vehicles have been added to the data base and their metrics measured. Several make/models have
been tested in different configurations to determine the range of metrics within a make/model, given the different
available original equipment options. Also included are several make/models of trucks and vans with anti-lock brakes
as standard equipment and several make/models of high sales volume passenger cars equipped with anti-lock brakes.
A complete list of all vehicles measured to date, their tilt table angles and critical sliding velocities, and the
ratio of the number of rollovers involving a particular vehicle model to the number of single vehicle accidents involving
the same model (RO/SVA) in Michigan from 1986 through 1990 can be found in Docket 91-68, Notice 2. 



2. Predictive Power of the Metrics 



The agency performed two types of analyses attempting to separate the influence of driver characteristics, road,
and environmental variables in the accident data so that the effect of vehicle rollover stability could be isolated.
A logistic regression analysis individually considered every accident in a very large data base. Make/models represented
in a great number of accidents influenced the results more than make/models with fewer accidents. A linear regression
analysis was also done on the rollover risk of make/models, adjusted for differences in driver and road characteristics
within their individual accident data bases, but not weighted by differences in accident numbers. The two analyses
are discussed in detail in the Addendum to Technical Assessment Paper. 

These analyses were conducted using three statistical models: (a) A model containing only driver, roadway, and environmental
characteristics; (b) a model containing driver, roadway, and environmental characteristics, and critical sliding
velocity; and (c) a model containing driver, roadway, and environmental characteristics, and tilt table angle.
For the purposes of comparison, the analyses were limited to accidents involving those make/models for which the
agency had both tilt table angle and critical sliding velocity data. This results in an equal number of accidents,
or observations (88,397), in each statistical model. 

The logistic regression predicts whether a single vehicle accident will be a rollover based on the factors in a particular
model. Then the predicted outcomes of the individual accidents are compiled to predict a rollover risk (rollovers
per single vehicle accident) for each of the 128 make/models for which the agency has data on both metrics. This predicted
risk is then compared to the actual risk known from accident data on these make/models. Two numbers are presented in
the table below for each of the statistical models. The first is the percent variability explained by the comparison
of the rollover risk predicted by the logistic regression model and the actual rollover risk. The second number is
the percentage of the variability unexplained by the model containing only driver, roadway, and environmental characteristics
which is explained by the addition of either tilt table angle or critical sliding velocity. For example, the driver/road/environmental
model leaves 77 percent of the variability in the data unexplained; 23 percent is explained. When tilt table angle
was added to the model to represent vehicle stability, 65 percent of the variability in rollover risk was explained.
The difference between the 77 percent unexplained variability in the driver/road variable model and the 35 percent
unexplained variability of the driver/road variable plus tilt table angle model is 42 percent, which is 55 percent
of the unexplained variability in the driver/road variable model (42 percent/77 percent). Slightly more than half
of the variability unaccounted for by driver and road characteristics was explained by the addition of tilt table
angle. Thus, the logistic regression analysis indicates that stability, as measured by tilt table angle, is an important
predictor of the likelihood of a single vehicle accident becoming a rollover. Substitution of critical sliding velocity
produced similar results. A complete discussion of the results of these analyses can be found in the Addendum to Technical
Assessment Paper in the docket.

The linear regression analysis also demonstrates the predictive power of tilt table angle and critical sliding velocity.
This analysis showed that tilt table angle accounts for about 53 percent of the variability in rollover risk remaining
after adjustment for differences in driver and road characteristics. The analysis showed that critical sliding
velocity accounts for about 66 percent of the variability in rollover risk remaining after adjustments for driver
and road characteristics. These compare to the 55 percent and 68 percent values found by logistic regression. These
figures demonstrate that the two analytic methods are essentially in agreement regarding the statistical significance
of stability metrics to the prediction of rollover. 

The results of both the logistic and linear regression analyses performed by the agency suggest that a vehicle stability
metric alone can account for approximately 50 percent of the variability in rollover risk in single vehicle accidents,
for the population of make/models studied. While ideally it would be desirable to have these variables explain 100
percent of the remaining variability, such statistical correlations are almost never achieved. The agency views
these analyses as demonstrating sound statistical and causal relationships between these variables and the likelihood
of rollover. At the same time, the analyses show that other factors in addition to those analyzed are affecting rollover
risk, as 35 percent to 25 percent of the variability in rollover risk is still unexplained after accounting for the
driver, roadway, and tilt table angle or critical sliding velocity, respectively. 

The above analyses used a Michigan accident data base combining passenger cars, pickup trucks, vans, and sport utility
vehicles. As explained in section I, the rate of rollover fatalities and injuries per million registered vehicles
is higher for sport utility vehicles and compact pickup trucks, but the absolute majority of harm occurs in passenger
cars, because of their large numbers in use. In the current vehicle fleet, passenger cars generally have higher measured
stability than light trucks. Thus, a safety standard requiring a minimum level of stability appropriate for all light
duty vehicles would not be expected to affect many present or future small cars and therefore would not result in significant
safety benefits. (For a further discussion of the problems associated with a minimum standard, see the section below
entitled, ``Estimate of the Costs of a Standard.'') 

Hence, the agency also examined the relative predictive capability of the stability metrics to rollover risk for
passenger cars and light trucks separately, to investigate the possibility of setting a higher minimum level of stability
for passenger cars. The results are shown in the table below, including a comparison to the results for all vehicles
considered as a single group (see Table 1). As with the analysis of all vehicles considered as a single group, these
analyses were limited to make/models for which both tilt table angle and critical sliding velocity were known.

These results show that, while a good proportion of the variability remaining in the driver/road/environmental
model is explained by either metric for the group containing all vehicles, when the vehicles are divided into classes,
the results are not consistent. The inconsistency seen in the model results by vehicle class is, to some extent, the
result of the smaller range of the metric within any subgroup of vehicles together with the inherent variability in
the data. These analyses and the analyses of benefits and costs discussed later, indicate that different minimum
standards for passenger cars and light trucks cannot be supported using either tilt table angle or critical sliding
velocity. 



VI. Decision Not To Propose a Vehicle Stability Standard

As discussed previously, NHTSA concluded that both of the vehicle metrics, tilt table angle and critical sliding
velocity, were statistically and causally related to the likelihood of rollover in a single vehicle crash. To determine
whether to propose a vehicle stability standard, NHTSA next compared the benefits and costs of such a standard. A detailed
discussion of the benefits analysis can be found in ``Potential Reductions in Fatalities and Injuries in Single Vehicle
Rollover Crashes as a Result of a Minimum Rollover Stability Standard,'' which has been placed in Docket No. 91-68,
Notice 03. A detailed discussion of the cost estimates can be found in the Preliminary Regulatory Evaluation, which
has also been placed in Docket No. 91-68, Notice 03. 



A. Estimate of the Benefits of a Standard 



The agency made two basic estimates of benefits of a minimum standard for rollover stability. One was based on the reductions
in RO/SVA predicted by the logistic regression model for increases in critical sliding velocity. The other was based
on reductions in RO/SVA predicted for increases in tilt table angle. All other factors being equal, it is reasonable
to expect an inverse relationship between rollover risk and either critical sliding velocity or tilt table angle.
Thus, the higher the lateral sliding velocity necessary to trip a vehicle, the less likely it is to roll over, and vice
versa. Similarly, the greater the angle necessary to tip a vehicle from the tilt table, the less likely it is to roll
over, and vice versa. 

To quantify the benefits of potential minimum standards for rollover stability, NHTSA examined the net prevention
of fatalities and serious injuries associated with various minimum levels of critical sliding velocity and tilt
table angle. Fatality and injury levels were estimated by using: 

1. The reduction of the rollover risk predicted for increases in critical sliding velocity or tilt table angle; 

2. The number of single vehicle accidents per registered vehicle expected to occur; and 

3. The reduction in fatalities and/or injuries if a single vehicle accident does not result in a rollover. 

The estimate of the benefits of a minimum stability safety standard incorporated several simplifying assumptions.
First, the agency assumed that the severity of the accidents would be reduced but that the accidents would not be prevented.
Because single vehicle rollover accidents are more severe than single vehicle non-rollover accidents, prevention
of rollover reduces the number of serious injuries and fatalities. However, under this scenario, the total number
of single vehicle accidents is assumed to remain constant. This assumption is somewhat pessimistic, because an unknown
number of crashes would most likely be avoided. But the remaining assumptions used may tend to overestimate the benefits
since NHTSA also assumed: 

1. The numbers of rollover injuries and fatalities prevented would be proportional to the number of rollovers prevented,
and 

2. The fatality and injury rates of the late 1980s for the make/models which would be affected by a minimum standard
will remain representative in the future. 

The second assumption may overstate the benefits if increased safety belt use in the 1990s, as is the goal of NHTSA,
reduces the overall harm from rollover accidents. That is, as belt use increases, rollover casualties decrease,
even though the number of rollover crashes remains constant. 



1. Rollover Risk Reduction 



To estimate the reduction in the rollover risk that would be obtained by changing a vehicle metric, the agency used
logistic regression to determine the sensitivity of rollover risk to changes in critical sliding velocity or tilt
table angle. The outcome of each accident of the subject make/model in the data base was re-evaluated individually
changing the stability metric but retaining the other vehicle, driver, and road characteristics present in the actual
crash. A new RO/SVA ratio was determined on the basis of the predicted outcome of each accident. 

To examine the sensitivity of the model to a change in critical sliding velocity, the agency divided the range of critical
sliding velocities from 14.26 to 16.73 kilometers per hour (kph). The low end of this range is representative of vehicles
in NHTSA's database with the lowest critical sliding velocity. The high end of this range is representative of a critical
sliding velocity equivalent to the 1.20 value for static stability factor recommended in the Wirth petition (also
equivalent to a tilt table angle of 46.4 degrees). (A discussion of the Wirth petition can be found in the ANPRM, 57 FR
242, 244-45.) The highest value in the range is greater than the proposed European tilt table angle limit of 44.3
degrees, and in the agency's judgement represents the highest practicable standard. A standard at the upper limit
of the range would affect 1,648,000 vehicles manufactured in 1991, including 87 percent of compact sport utility
vehicles, 100 percent of standard vans, and 31 percent of compact pickups. 

The agency then divided this range into six even increments and calculated the RO/SVA for each increment for various
classes of vehicles. Each successively higher increment represents an increase in critical sliding velocity of
0.41 kph. The agency then predicted the decrease in single vehicle accident rollovers for each incremental increase
in critical sliding velocity. (See Table 3.)

As an example, for vehicles with a critical sliding velocity between 14.26 and 16.73 kph, an increase of 12 percent
in critical sliding velocity was predicted to decrease single vehicle accident rollovers of compact sport utility
vehicles by about 13 percent, standard sport utility vehicles by about 15 percent, compact pickups by about 15 percent,
and minivans by about 16 percent. There is only one standard van with a critical sliding velocity below 16.73 kph. Its
rollover risk is predicted to decrease 17 percent if its critical sliding velocity were to increase 12 percent. A 12
percent increase in critical sliding velocity represents a change of 1.65 kph, or four increments. A complete discussion
of these analyses can be found in the paper ``Potential Reductions in Fatalities and Injuries in Single Vehicle Crashes
as a Result of a Minimum Stability Standard'' in the docket.

A similar analysis was done using tilt table angle. For tilt table angle, each increment was approximately equivalent
to 0.75 degrees. For vehicles with a tilt table angle between 42 and 46.4 degrees (the equivalent of the critical sliding
velocity range), an increase of 11 percent (also four increments, or 3.00 degrees) in tilt table angle was predicted
to decrease single vehicle accident rollovers among compact sport utility vehicles by about 15 percent, standard
sport utility vehicles by about 19 percent, compact pickups by about 17 percent, minivans by about 20 percent, and
standard vans by about 22 percent. (See Table 4.)





2. Predicted Single Vehicle Accident Rate 


To estimate the number of single vehicle accidents in a hypothetical future vehicle population, NHTSA assumed that
the future population would have the same proportion of vans, pickups, and sport utility vehicles as the 1991 production,
and that the population would have the same proportion of high and low critical sliding velocity and tilt table angle
vehicles within these categories. 
NHTSA then distributed the numbers of serious injuries by vehicle category (as tabulated by Data Link Inc., under
contract to NHTSA) among the 1991 example vehicles on the basis of relative production volume, relative single vehicle
accident involvement rate, and relative rollover risk per single vehicle accident. (The Data Link reports are available
in Docket 91-68, Notice 2.) Data Link reported injuries and fatalities by vehicle types: pickup truck, van,
sport utility vehicle (called MPV in Data Link reports), and car. NHTSA further divided the vehicle types into subcategories
of compact and standard to make average accident rate and rollover risk more meaningful. 
NHTSA also divided injuries and fatalities between compact and standard versions of each vehicle type. To do this,
NHTSA assumed that rollover harm was proportional to the number of rollover accidents within a vehicle type. The numbers
of rollover accidents among compact vehicles relative to those among their standard counterparts were estimated
by multiplying their 1991 production ratios by their single vehicle accident per registered vehicle ratios and their
RO/SVA ratios. The total number of injuries and fatalities was then divided proportionally.

The reduction in rollover harm for each type/size category is a summary of the reductions in injuries and fatalities
for each example vehicle within the category if the tilt table angle for the category were increased a specified level.
The reduction in harm associated with each affected vehicle is assumed to be proportional to its projected reduction
in rollover risk. A minimum tilt table angle standard of 42.8 degrees, an increase of one increment explained above,
would be expected to reduce serious rollover injuries by 13 and rollover fatalities by 8. A minimum tilt table angle
standard of 46.4 degrees, the highest measurement in the range studied, would be expected to reduce serious rollover
injuries by 233 and rollover fatalities by 121, if rollover avoidance were viewed as crash avoidance. A parallel exercise
was done using the rollover risk predicted using critical sliding velocity as the stability metric in the logistic
regression model. 




3. Injury/Fatality Rate Reduction 




Because the agency assumed that a single vehicle accident would still occur even though a rollover was prevented,
it reduced these estimates of benefits based on a comparison of the relative harm of single vehicle accidents with
rollover to that of similar accidents without rollover. The comparison indicated that the overall fatality rate
for single vehicle rollover accidents was 2.07 times the fatality rate for single vehicle accidents without rollover.
When only accidents occurring on roads with speed limits of 40-50 mph are considered, the rollover accidents
are 2.3 times as likely to result in fatality. When accidents on 55-65 mph roads are considered, the fatality
rate of rollover accidents is 1.6 times that for other accidents. These statistics suggest that rollover prevention
is equivalent to about a 50 percent reduction in fatalities for the number of accidents in which rollovers would be
prevented. 


Likewise, the injury data indicate an overall relative rate of serious injuries (AIS 3+) 1.36 times greater for single
vehicle accidents with rollover than without rollover. The ratio of AIS 3+ injuries in non-rollover to AIS 3+ injuries
in rollovers was 1.38 for accidents occurring on roads with speed limits of 40-50 mph and 1.47 for accidents occurring
on 55-65 mph roads. These statistics suggest that rollover prevention is roughly equivalent to a 25 percent
reduction in serious injuries for the number of accidents in which rollovers would be prevented. 


Viewing rollover prevention as roughly a 50 percent mitigation of fatalities and a 25 percent mitigation of serious
injuries leads to an estimate of net benefits resulting from the reduction in harm from rollover accidents. Net reductions
of 3 to 61 serious injuries and 4 to 63 fatalities would be expected for a minimum tilt table angle standard in the range
of 42.8 to 46.4 degrees. Net reductions of 3 to 68 serious injuries and 2 to 68 fatalities would be expected for a minimum
critical sliding velocity standard in the range studied, i.e., 14.68 to 16.73 kph. 


Minimum rollover stability requirements at the levels examined would have minimal impact on the annual single vehicle
accident rollover fatality toll, because the vehicles affected would be less than 20 percent of the total light duty
vehicle fleet and the vehicles' stability would only be improved by a marginal amount. 


The great majority of rollover fatalities would be unaffected by a minimum stability standard set at any of these levels,
because they occur in cars, which greatly outnumber light trucks in use, and which, with few exceptions, have significantly
higher rollover stability than sport utility vehicles, pickup trucks, and vans. 




B. Estimate of the Costs of a Standard 




As explained above, the agency's analyses predicted a saving of 63 lives for a minimum tilt table angle of 46.4 degrees.
This level would necessitate the modification of an estimated 87 percent of present compact sport utility vehicles
and virtually all present standard vans. A minimum tilt table angle of 45 degrees, which is higher than the tilt table
angle of 69 percent of present compact sport utility vehicles, could save 23 lives. Similarly, a minimum critical
sliding velocity standard of 16.73 kph would affect 89 percent of present compact sport utility vehicles, 38 percent
of standard sport utility vehicles, and 38 percent of compact pickups, while saving 68 lives. A critical sliding velocity
minimum standard of 15.91 kph would affect 71 percent of compact sport utility vehicles and 31 percent of compact pickups,
while saving 34 lives. 


Unfortunately, inexpensive vehicle changes, such as offset wheels or modified tire and rim width combinations,
cannot be counted on to improve stability without producing handling or steering problems. An increase in track width,
derived from frame or suspension alterations, or a decrease in center of gravity height are the only methods of improving
stability without potential safety liabilities. Such changes would require large initial costs related to the design
and development of major vehicle components, if not the entire vehicle. 


These costs do not take into account the cost of the tests necessary to determine the tilt table angle or critical sliding
velocity. Because these costs will also be associated with the proposed consumer information regulation, the testing
costs are discussed later in this notice.

<TEXT>
 

Some of the changes necessary to comply with a minimum standard may also be incompatible with some of the vehicle characteristics
many consumers seek in vehicles such as sport utility vehicles, vans, motor homes, and campers. For example, in the
case of sport utility vehicles, the capability to operate in off-road conditions may require both high ground clearance
(necessitating a relatively high center of gravity) and narrow width to maneuver in wooded or rocky areas (necessitating
a relatively narrow track width). Section 103(f)(3) of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act provides
that a Federal motor vehicle safety standard must be reasonable and appropriate for each vehicle type to which it applies,
and therefore NHTSA could not mandate a stability requirement incompatible with certain types of vehicles. In addition,
the manufacturers of many of these types of vehicles would be considered small businesses, and a standard could raise
concerns under the Regulatory Flexibility Act. 

Another possible cost of a minimum rollover standard is decreased fuel economy. Compact sport utility vehicles have
become popular, in part, because the original sport utility vehicles, which were larger, heavier, and more stable
against rollover, were also more difficult to park and maneuver and had very poor fuel mileage. The compact sport utility
vehicles with higher stability tend to be the larger vehicles in the class, or open vehicles with less mass in the top.
A stability standard would be expected to cause a growth in size and weight of compact sport utility vehicles and a reduction
in fuel mileage. 



C. Conclusions



Based on these estimates of the benefits and costs of a minimum stability standard, NHTSA believes that the benefits
would not be sufficient to justify the expected costs. Therefore, as noted above, NHTSA has decided to defer any further
action on this subject until information becomes available demonstrating the cost effectiveness of such a rule.
The agency may reinitiate such a rulemaking upon receipt of such information. This termination of rulemaking on vehicle
stability fulfills the statutory mandate of Section 2502(b)(2)(B)(i). 

While the agency is terminating rulemaking on a vehicle stability standard, NHTSA believes that the correlation
between stability and rollover risk is significant enough to justify proposing a consumer information regulation
to relieve the possibility of uninformed risk. The agency's decision to propose such a regulation is explained below.




VII. Proposed Consumer Information Regulation



A. Rationale 



NHTSA is proposing a new consumer information regulation requiring manufacturers to report the stability metric
of cars and light trucks to enable consumers to make more informed choices concerning the trade-offs of vehicle attributes
and rollover stability. NHTSA believes that a consumer information regulation would inform drivers of general differences
in stability between light trucks and cars, and among vehicles in those classes so that consumers can make an informed
choice concerning relative rollover risk. This regulation would inform drivers who still chose a less stable vehicle
that they may wish to drive more cautiously in certain circumstances and that the higher risk of driving low stability
vehicles can be greatly reduced by using safety belts. In addition, NHTSA believes that a consumer 
information regulation would motivate manufacturers to give more priority to rollover stability in the design of
new vehicles. NHTSA believes these goals can be accomplished with a minimum burden on industry and consumers. 

NHTSA believes that consumer and manufacturer behavior can be affected through the provision of consumer information.
The agency's experience with the New Car Assessment Program (NCAP) demonstrates the power of consumer information.
Several manufacturers have informed the agency that they have internal goals of performing well in these 35 mph frontal
crash tests, even though there is no regulatory requirement to do so. The lowering of the injury scores over time for
all manufacturers, as reported in ``Report on the Historical Performance of Different Auto Manufacturers in the
New Car Assessment Program Tests'', NHTSA, August 1993, can also be attributed partially to NCAP. The attention of
the media to the program and the more than 20,000 calls annually to NHTSA's Hotline, the most for any NHTSA consumer
information activity, speak to the consumer's interest in relevant consumer safety information. As to whether consumers
want information on rollover, recent agency focus groups indicate they would (``Focus Groups on Traffic Safety Issues:
Public Response to NCAP,'' S.W. Morris & Company, Inc., August 1993, which can be found in Docket No. 79-17,
Notice 01). The consensus of the focus groups was that the agency's consumer safety information activities should
be expanded to include additional kinds of crashes, including rollover. Consumers also desired point of sale information,
which would be satisfied with the proposed vehicle sticker requirement.

NHTSA does not agree with those manufacturers who believe that labeling vehicles with stability information will
mislead consumers or that consumers would consider the metric an absolute measure of the likelihood of rollover,
regardless of driver behavior or roadway conditions. It has never been shown that improvements in safety or availability
of information regarding safety increase risk-taking. In addition, the proposed label not only contains the stability
information, it contains the statements: ``All vehicles roll over! Always wear seat belts! In a rollover crash, an


unbelted

 person is 6 to 9 times more likely to die than a person wearing a seat belt.'' These statements emphasize to the consumer
that a vehicle with a higher stability rating can still roll over. 

NHTSA is considering two possible options for specifying the stability metric. Under option one, NHTSA would select
one of two metrics, critical sliding velocity or tilt table angle, and require the metric to be stated for each vehicle.
NHTSA requests comments on which metric is preferable if NHTSA selects only one metric. (Note: The proposed regulatory
text in this notice illustrates this option first for critical sliding velocity, and then for tilt table angle.) Under
option two, NHTSA would not require a metric to be stated. Instead, the agency would require vehicles to be labeled
with a statement concerning the rollover stability (e.g., one, two, or three stars) based on vehicle performance
when tested for one or both of the metrics. 



B. Proposed Label 



NHTSA is proposing to require three types of information on the label and in owner's manuals. First, manufacturers
would be required to include the stability metric for that vehicle. This information would either be the same as that
reported by the manufacturer to NHTSA (for option one) or the ``rating'' provided by NHTSA (for option two). This metric
would be required to be reported ``accurate to the nearest kilometer per hour'' for critical sliding velocity and
``accurate to the nearest degree'' for tilt table angle. As explained in the discussion of the two metrics in this notice,
NHTSA believes that the test procedure for both metrics produces results repeatable to this degree of accuracy. Manufacturers
would be allowed to choose which models and configurations could be grouped together, because they have the same metric,
for the purpose of reporting metrics. However, for each metric reported by a manufacturer, the manufacturer would
have to fully describe the vehicles to which the metric applies. 

Second, the label would be required to contain the metric or rating ranges provided by NHTSA for both passenger cars
and light trucks. The purpose of this requirement is to emphasize to consumers that there are significant differences
between the stability of the average passenger car and that of the average truck-based vehicle. This information
would allow consumers to make an informed choice in purchasing a passenger car or a truck-based vehicle and to compare
a vehicle they are considering to other vehicles in its class. 

Third, NHTSA is proposing to require a warning to inform consumers that all vehicles can, and do, roll over and that
the best protection against injury or fatality, should a rollover occur, is wearing seat belts. 



C. Stability Metrics 



As noted above, NHTSA's analyses indicate that there are two metrics, critical sliding velocity and tilt table angle,
which correlate well with rollover accident data. Either of these metrics could be used in a stability labeling regulation.
Each has its advantages and disadvantages. 

Critical sliding velocity, a dynamic metric, includes the influence of roll moment of inertia as well as the various
static factors included by the static metrics such as tilt table angle. The advantage of critical sliding velocity
is that it more consistently predicts rollover risk for light trucks. The disadvantage is that calculation of critical
sliding velocity requires knowledge of the vehicle's center of gravity height and roll mass moment of inertia. These
two parameters are difficult to measure on complete vehicles and require specialized equipment to obtain accurate
results. However, these parameters can be measured on vehicle components and manufacturers of complete vehicles
could calculate center of gravity height and roll mass moment of inertia of complete vehicles from data they have on
component parameters. However, the agency is unsure whether final stage manufacturers and alterers of specialty
vehicles are provided enough information from incomplete vehicle manufacturers to do this. 

Tilt table angle, a static metric, is simple and inexpensive to measure. The nature of the test is easy for the consumer
to understand. The disadvantage of this metric stems from the statistical relationship between tilt table angle
and accident data. The correlation between tilt table angle and accident data breaks down if passenger cars are analyzed
separately from light trucks. Further, statistical models containing tilt table angle data consistently overestimate
the rollover risk for standard vans.

Critical sliding velocity, in kilometers per hour, is determined from the equation:

TW = the average of the front and rear track width of the vehicle, in kilometers. 




Calculation of critical sliding velocity requires knowledge of the vehicle's mass, track width, center of gravity
height, and roll moment of inertia. NHTSA agrees with commenters that the center of gravity height and roll moment
of inertia are complicated measurements. To address comments on the repeatability of center of gravity height measurement,
NHTSA reviewed two reports.

The study ``Center of Gravity Height: A Round-Robin Measurement Program,'' sponsored by the Motor Vehicle Manufacturers
Association and conducted by the University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute (UMTRI-91-4)
compared the test facilities, procedures, and results of center of gravity height measurements at four laboratories.
Each of the four laboratories used different test equipment and procedures. The study concluded that different measurement
procedures can produce significantly different results. However, the study also concluded that for each laboratory
and test procedure, repeatability was very good. 

Another study, ``Vehicle Inertial Parameters_Measured Values and Approximations,'' by Garrott 

et al.

 (Society of Automotive Engineers 

#

881767) shows the coefficient of variation of center of gravity height at the Vehicle Research and Test Center (VRTC)
facility to be 0.8 percent. The measurements used in the analyses of the relationship of critical sliding velocity
and single vehicle rollover accidents came from the VRTC facility. 

Based on these studies, NHTSA believes that measurements of center of gravity height and roll moment of inertia are
repeatable within an individual laboratory using a specified procedure. NHTSA also believes that these measurements
would be repeatable among different laboratories if all were using the same test procedure. The agency has data on
a group of six make/models of light trucks and one make/model of car for which tests were run on identical vehicles,
or repeated tests were run on the same vehicle. The results for all of these tests show the repeatability of critical
sliding velocity to be well within the required accuracy of one kilometer per hour. Therefore, NHTSA tentatively
concludes that the test procedure proposed in this notice would produce repeatable results. The proposed regulatory
text does not include language for either the test equipment or the test procedure. The test equipment to be used in
the procedure is VTRC's Inertial Parameter Measuring Device (IPMD). The equipment is described in United States
Patent No. 5,177,998. VRTC is in the process of refining the test procedure for use with the IPMD, which is described
in the report, ``Vehicle Inertial Parameters_Measured Values and Approximations,'' by Garrott 

et al.

 of NHTSA's VRTC. Copies of both the patent and the report have been placed in Docket No. 91-68, Notice 03. 



2. Tilt Table Angle 



Some commenters to the ANPRM stated that the tilt table procedure is not standard practice and its repeatability is
not known. Other commenters stated that the procedure was repeatable. 

NHTSA examined two studies which concluded that the tilt table test is a simple, repeatable method of estimating the
static roll stability of a vehicle. ``Sensitivity Analysis of the Tilt Table Test Methodology'' is a study sponsored
by the Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association and conducted by the University of Michigan Transportation Research
Institute (UMTRI-91-48 December 1991). UMTRI found the tilt table test to be repeatable in their laboratory
and found nothing to prevent site-to-site reproducibility. The other study is a NHTSA study which found the following
parameters to be critical to achieving an accurate tilt table angle: slow, steady lift rate, minimal platform deflection,
platform angle measurement accurate to 0.1 degree, and accuracy of measurement of the point at which the last tire
leaves the table (DOT HS 807 747 May 1991). 

Based on these studies, NHTSA believes that the tilt table test would result in repeatable measurements if conducted
under specified conditions. The agency's results for either tests on identical vehicles or multiple tests on the
same vehicle show the repeatability of tilt table angle to be within the required accuracy of one degree. To ensure
repeatability, NHTSA has included specific test conditions in the tilt table angle test procedure. 



D. Timing of Information Provided by the Manufacturers and NHTSA 



By each January 1st, each manufacturer would be required to report to NHTSA the stability metric for each vehicle to
be manufactured on or after the next September 1 and on or before the first August 31 following that September 1st. Thus,
the information for ``1997 model year'' vehicles (vehicles manufactured between September 1, 1996 and August 31,
1997) would have to be reported by January 1, 1996. NHTSA recognizes that not all manufacturers change to production
of a new model year on the same date. If a manufacturer changes production on a date after September 1, and the difference
between model years affects the stability metric, the manufacturer would have to report a metric for two ``vehicles''
for a single make/model. NHTSA requests comments on these proposed dates. NHTSA would consider changing the beginning
and ending date of the annual production period specified in this regulation if there was a different date that coincides
with a majority of manufacturers' ``model year.'' 

If option one, which is a quantitative measure based on vehicle metric calculations, were chosen for a final rule,
NHTSA would use the information provided by the manufacturers to supply manufacturers with ranges for all passenger
cars and light trucks for the upcoming model year by April 1 of that year (i.e., in the above example, NHTSA would provide
manufacturers ranges for 1997 model year vehicles by April 1, 1996.) If option two were chosen, NHTSA would use the
information provided to provide manufacturers with the ``rating'' which must be labeled on the vehicle. Since there
is a possibility that this information could not be provided by April 1, the agency requests comments on how much leadtime
manufacturers would need to place the information on labels and in owner's manuals on all vehicles manufactured on
or after September 1.

<TEXT>
 

NHTSA is proposing to make this new regulation effective on January 1, 1996, based on the presumption that this would
give manufacturers at least one year to complete testing necessary to report the tilt table angle and/or critical
sliding velocity for all vehicles following publication of a final rule. 



E. Benefits 



As stated previously, NHTSA anticipates that this consumer information regulation will result in a more informed
public which, through purchasing and/or driving decisions, could improve motor vehicle safety. Similarly, consumer
purchasing behavior could affect manufacturers' design and/or marketing of vehicles. The agency is unable to quantify
at this time the benefits of this rulemaking. A more detailed discussion of the possible benefits of this rulemaking
can be found in the Preliminary Regulatory Evaluation. 



F. Costs 



The costs associated with the proposed consumer information regulation would arise from three different activities:
generating the stability metric for the label, printing the labels, and affixing labels to the vehicles. This rule
would not require manufacturers to make vehicle changes. While such modifications are desirable, they are not mandated,
and if they occurred, would be the indirect result of market forces and not a direct result of this rulemaking. 

As explained in detail in the Preliminary Regulatory Evaluation, NHTSA estimates that the total testing and labeling
costs of a regulation based on critical sliding velocity would range from $4.71 to $6.35 million and the total cost
of a regulation based on tilt table angle would range from $3.93 to $5.57 million. 



VIII. Final Stage Manufacturers and Alterers 



NHTSA requests comments on how final stage manufacturers and alterers would comply with the proposed consumer information
regulation. Would final stage manufacturers and alterers have sufficient information on upcoming model year vehicles
to report the tilt table angle and/or critical sliding velocity of the vehicles they will be producing by January 1
as required? How much information can incomplete vehicle manufacturers pass on to final stage manufacturers to assist
them in predicting the tilt table angle or critical sliding velocity of the final vehicle, and when? 

NHTSA also asks for comment on how many vehicles in this category would have a GVWR of 4,536 kilograms or less. 

Given that many of these vehicles are manufactured for special uses, NHTSA requests comments on whether certain types
of vehicles (e.g., walk-in van-type vehicles, campers, and motor homes) should be excluded from the consumer information
requirement. Would consumer choice for these special-use vehicles be affected by the information provided by this
proposed regulation?

IX. Rulemaking Analyses and Notices



A. Executive Order 12866 and DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures



NHTSA has examined the impact of this rulemaking action and determined that it is ``significant'' within the meaning
of E.O. 12866 and the Department of Transportation's regulatory policies and procedures. This rulemaking was reviewed
under E.O. 12866. The agency's detailed analysis of the economic effects can be found in the Preliminary Regulatory
Evaluation available in the docket for this rulemaking. The agency estimates that the proposed regulation would
cost $3.93 to $6.35 million annually.



B. Regulatory Flexibility Act



NHTSA has also considered the impacts of this notice under the Regulatory Flexibility Act. I hereby certify that this
proposed rule would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. As explained
above, NHTSA does not expect any significant economic impacts from this proposed rule. While the agency has asked
questions regarding the availability of data to certain manufacturers who could be small businesses (final stage
manufacturers and alterers), NHTSA believes that these manufacturers will be able to obtain sufficient information
on the vehicles they complete or alter that this proposed regulation will not impose a significantly different burden
on these manufacturers.

D. National Environmental Policy Act



NHTSA has also analyzed this proposed rule under the National Environmental Policy Act and determined that it would
not have a significant impact on the human environment.



E. Executive Order 12612 (Federalism)



NHTSA has analyzed this proposal in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in E.O. 12612, and has determined
that this proposed rule would not have significant federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism
Assessment.



F. Civil Justice Reform



This proposed rule would not have any retroactive effect. There is no express statutory intent to preempt any State
law. Section 105 of the Safety Act (15 U.S.C. 1394) sets forth a procedure for judicial review of final rules. That section
does not require submission of a petition for reconsideration or other administrative proceedings before parties
may file suit in court.



X. Effective Date of Final Rule



If adopted, the proposed amendments would become effective on January 1, 1996.



XI. Submission of Comments



Interested persons are invited to submit comments on the proposal. It is requested but not required that 10 copies
be submitted.

All comments must not exceed 15 pages in length. (49 CFR 553.21). Necessary attachments may be appended to these submissions
without regard to the 15-page limit. This limitation is intended to encourage commenters to detail their primary
arguments in a concise fashion.

If a commenter wishes to submit certain information under a claim of confidentiality, three copies of the complete
submission, including purportedly confidential business information, should be submitted to the Chief Counsel,
NHTSA, at the street address given above, and seven copies from which the purportedly confidential information has
been deleted should be submitted to the Docket Section. A request for confidentiality should be accompanied by a cover
letter setting forth the information specified in the agency's confidential business information regulation.
49 CFR part 512.

All comments received before the close of business on the comment closing date indicated above for the proposal will
be considered, and will be available for examination in the docket at the above address both before and after that date.
To the extent possible, comments filed after the closing date will also be considered. Comments received too late
for consideration in regard to the final rule will be considered as suggestions for further rulemaking action. Comments
on the proposal will be available for inspection in the docket. The NHTSA will continue to file relevant information
as it becomes available in the docket after the closing date, and it is recommended that interested persons continue
to examine the docket for new material.

Those persons desiring to be notified upon receipt of their comments in the rules docket should enclose a self-addressed,
stamped postcard in the envelope with their comments. Upon receiving the comments, the docket supervisor will return
the postcard by mail.

in place. The rear trip rail is moved until it is just touching the driver's side rear tire of the test vehicle, then locked
in place. 

(2) 

Testing

. (i) Each tilt table test consists of six tilts. The positioning of the test vehicle on the tilt table and the contents
of the vehicle are not adjusted between tilts. 

(ii) For each tilt, the platform is rotated from the horizontal until all of the uphill tires on the test vehicle have
lifted off the platform, as indicated by the contact switches under the uphill tires. 

(iii) The platform angle at which the last tire lifts off the platform is the TTA of the vehicle for that tilt. The vehicle
shall then be returned to the horizontal position at a rate not to exceed 0.25 degrees per second. 

(iv) The lowest TTA of the last three tilts in the six-tilt series is the TTA for the tested vehicle.

Limited Access Management of Federal Fisheries In and Off of Alaska 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule; request for comments.

 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 NMFS issues a proposed rule to implement Amendment 31 to the Fishery Management Plan (FMP) for the Groundfish Fishery
of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands Area (BSAI), Amendment 35 to the FMP for Groundfish of the Gulf of Alaska (GOA),
and a regulatory amendment affecting the fishery for Pacific halibut in and off the State of Alaska (Alaska or State).
This action is being proposed to implement the Modified Block Proposal, to clarify the transfer process for the Individual
Fishing Quota (IFQ) program, and to prevent excessive consolidation of the Pacific halibut and sablefish fisheries
off Alaska. If approved, these FMP and regulatory amendments would require the issuance of quota share (QS) blocks
for QS resulting in less than 20,000 lb (9 mt) of IFQ for halibut or sablefish, based on the 1994 total allowable catch
(TAC) for fixed gear in those fisheries, allow the combination of QS blocks that are less than 1,000 lb (0.5 mt) of IFQ
for halibut and less than 3,000 lb (1.4 mt) of IFQ for sablefish, restrict the number of blocks that may be held by a person
in any IFQ regulatory area, and clarify the transfer process for QS and IFQ. It is intended to ensure that small part-time
operators and diversified operations can continue to participate profitably in the IFQ fisheries.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Background 


The Sitka Block proposed amendment, the Full/Partial Block proposed amendment, the Modified Block proposed amendment,
and the status quo alternative for the IFQ program for fixed-gear sablefish fisheries off Alaska and for the fixed-gear
Pacific halibut fisheries in and off Alaska are described in the EA/RIR/IRFA dated December 17, 1993. Language amending
the BSAI and the GOA FMPs was developed for the Modified Block Proposal, the North Pacific Fishery Management Council's
(Council) chosen alternative. The amendments to the FMPs affect the sablefish fisheries in the exclusive economic
zone (EEZ) off Alaska, which are managed in accordance with the BSAI and the GOA groundfish FMPs. The Council prepared
both FMPs under authority of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson Act). The BSAI FMP is
implemented by regulations appearing at 50 CFR 611.93 for the foreign fishery and 50 CFR part 675 for the U.S. fishery.
The GOA FMP is implemented by regulations appearing at 50 CFR 611.92 for the foreign fishery and at 50 CFR part 672 for
the U.S. fishery. General regulations that also pertain to the U.S. groundfish fisheries appear at 50 CFR part 620.


The Council does not have an FMP for halibut. The domestic fishery for halibut in and off Alaska is managed by the International
Pacific Halibut Commission (IPHC), as provided by the Convention between the United States and Canada for the Preservation
of the Halibut Fishery of the Northern Pacific Ocean and the Bering Sea (Convention), signed at Washington, DC, 
March 29, 1979, and the Halibut Act. The Convention and the Halibut Act authorize the Regional Fishery Management
Councils established by the Magnuson Act to develop regulations that are in addition to, but not in conflict with,
regulations adopted by the IPHC affecting the U.S. halibut fishery. Under this authority, the Council may develop,
for approval by the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary), limited-access policies for the Pacific halibut fishery
in Convention waters in and off Alaska. ``Convention waters'' means the maritime areas off the west coast of the United
States and Canada, as described in Article I of the Convention (see 16 U.S.C. 773(d)). 

The Council acted under these authorities in recommending changes to the IFQ program for the halibut and sablefish
fisheries. These recommended changes would be implemented by this proposed action and are intended by the Council
to promote the conservation and management of sablefish and halibut resources, and to further the objectives of the
Magnuson Act and the Halibut Act. 



QS Block Proposals

Concern over the potential for excessive consolidation of fishing privileges under the IFQ program was the impetus
for the QS block proposals. The Council asked its staff to analyze the first of the QS block proposals, the Sitka Block
proposal, at its April 1992 meeting. The Sitka Block proposal provided that (1) initial QS for each IFQ regulatory
area would be allocated in blocks, (2) QS in a block could not be separated and would have to be transferred as a block,
and (3) the ``maximum block size'' allowed in each IFQ regulatory area would be one-half the most restrictive QS use
limit for an area. 

The Full/Partial Block proposal was considered at the January 1993 Council meeting. It provided that (1) initial
QS for each IFQ regulatory area would be allocated in blocks, (2) QS in a block could not be separated and would have to
be 
transferred as a block, (3) QS that represented 20,000 lb (9 mt) or more of IFQ in the implementation year would be issued
as a ``full block'' for that IFQ regulatory area, and (4) QS that represented less than 20,000 lb (9 mt) would be issued
as a ``partial block'' for that IFQ regulatory area. 

The Modified Block proposed amendment was passed after the Council took public testimony and discussed the other
two block proposals at its September 1993 meeting. The Modified Block 
Proposal retained most of the features of the current IFQ program, including the same ownership constraints and the
same vessel size categories. The Modified Block Proposal also provided that (1) only initial allocations of QS that
represented less than 20,000 lb (9 mt) of IFQ in the implementation year would be issued as a block, (2) QS that represented
20,000 lb 
(9 mt) or more of IFQ in the implementation year would be ``unblocked'' QS, and (3) QS in a block could not be separated
and would have to be transferred as a block. For each species in each IFQ regulatory area, a person who did not hold any
unblocked QS could hold up to two QS blocks for that area, but the sum of the two QS blocks could not exceed use limits in
50 CFR 676.22 (e) and (f). A person who held unblocked QS for an IFQ regulatory area could hold only one QS block for that
area, provided that the total QS held, blocked and unblocked, for that IFQ regulatory area did not exceed use limits
referenced above. The Modified Block Proposal also provided that QS blocks resulting in less than 1,000 lb (0.5 mt)
of IFQ for halibut (or 3,000 lb (1.4 mt) of IFQ for sablefish) in the implementation year could be combined. The QS block
resulting from this combination could not exceed 1,000 lb (0.5 mt) for halibut or 3,000 lb (1.4 mt) for sablefish. This
``sweeping-up'' provision was designed to allow very small QS allocations to be combined into ``fishable'' amounts.


All three block proposals, the Sitka Block Proposal, the Full/Partial Block Proposal, and the Modified Block Proposal,
were designed to reduce the maximum potential consolidation relative to the current IFQ program. The EA/RIR/IRFA
indicated that, if actual consolidation is proportional to the estimates of maximum potential consolidation, more
QS holders likely would remain in the halibut and sablefish fisheries under any of the three block proposals than under
the current IFQ program. 

The Council adopted the Modified Block Proposal because it prevented excessive consolidation of QS by blocking any
QS allocation for an IFQ regulatory area that would have represented less than 20,000 lb (9 mt) of IFQ in the implementation
year (1994). Also, it did not unnecessarily interfere with the opportunities currently available under the IFQ program
for larger operations, because QS allocations for an IFQ regulatory area that would have represented 20,000 lb (9
mt) or more of IFQ in 1994 would remain unblocked. The Council decided that the Modified Block Proposal would achieve
the objectives of the other block proposals (

i.e.

, protect small producers, part-time participants, and entry level participants that may tend to disappear because
of excessive consolidation under the current IFQ program), with fewer restrictions on the flexibility and the economic
efficiency of the IFQ program as a whole. 

Whether QS is blocked or unblocked would be determined by the QS pools for each IFQ regulatory area as they exist on October
17, 1994. Using a specific date to calculate whether to block QS ensures that all persons would be treated in a similar
manner, regardless of when their QS is issued. October 17, 1994, was chosen as the date to calculate QS because it was
long enough after the application period (ends July 15, 1994) to allow the QS pools to achieve QS amounts reflective
of their eventual range, but long enough before the 1995 fishing season to allow for transfers of QS for that fishing
season. 




Transfer of QS Blocks 



Blocked and unblocked QS would be transferable subject to the approval of the Regional Director, Alaska Region, NMFS,
and compliance with the transfer regulations found in 50 CFR part 676. The Modified Block Proposal creates the potential
that some QS blocks would become non-transferable, because their size would exceed the QS use limits in 50 CFR 676.22
(e) and (f). This potential was addressed in the EA/RIR/IRFA dated December 17, 1993. Since there was only a slight
potential of having a QS block that would be non-transferable, and only a few regulatory areas were affected, an alternative
was developed to solve the issue of non-transferability, rather than totally abandoning the Modified Block Proposal.


 This alternative would permit the transfer of a QS block that exceeded the QS use limits by dividing the block into two
blocks. The sizes of the resulting blocks would depend on the QS use limit preventing the transfer_one block would
be the maximum size allowable under the QS use limit, the other block would contain the residual QS. Dividing a block
to allow its transfer when it would be otherwise non-transferable because it exceeded the QS use limit is an exception
to the proposed rule 
( 676.21(d)(1)). Under any other circumstance, a QS block could not be divided.

<PARENT> FR940628-1-00015 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Furthermore, this alternative does not waive any of the other use limits under the existing IFQ program or under the
changes proposed to the program by this action. For example, a person may only hold two QS blocks for an IFQ regulatory
area, or one QS block if any unblocked QS is held. Also, a person cannot exceed the QS use limit by transfer. These limits
would prevent a person from receiving, by transfer, the two blocks created by dividing a block because its size exceeded
the QS use limit. If a person held any QS for an IFQ regulatory area, blocked or unblocked, the most he/she would be able
to receive by transfer would be one block. If a person did not hold any QS for an IFQ regulatory area, he/she would still
be prevented from receiving both blocks, because the sum of the QS in both blocks would exceed the QS use limit for that
regulatory area. 



Other Changes to the IFQ Regulatory Language 



This action proposes changes to the transfer procedure in 50 CFR part 676 to accommodate the Modified Block Proposal,
and to further clarify the transfer process. First, a definition of transfer of QS or IFQ would be included in the introductory
paragraph of  676.21. Second,  676.21(e) would be revised and placed at  676.21 (a), (b), and (c).
Third, procedures designed specifically for transferring QS blocks would be placed in 
 676.21(d). Fourth, procedures for transfers of QS or IFQ resulting from court orders, operation of law, or
as part of security agreements would be clarified and placed in  676.21(e). Fifth, transfer restrictions specific
to regulatory areas would be expanded and placed in  676.21(f). Making the transfer process easier to understand
is the impetus for these proposed changes. NMFS is particularly interested in public comments regarding these changes
to the existing transfer process for QS and IFQ, which was published in the 

Federal Register

 on November 9, 1993 (58 FR 59375). 

Section 304(a)(1)(D) of the Magnuson Act requires the Secretary to publish regulations proposed by a Council within
15 days of receipt of the FMP amendments and regulations. At this time, the Secretary has not determined that the FMP
amendments these regulations would implement are consistent with the national standards, other provisions of the
Magnuson Act, and other applicable laws. The Secretary, in making final determinations about the FMP amendments
and in promulgating final rules under both the Magnuson and Halibut Acts, will take into account the data, views, and
comments received during the comment period. 



Classification 



The Council prepared an IRFA as part of the RIR, which describes the impact this proposed rule would have on small entities,
if adopted. The analysis in the IRFA indicates that by reducing consolidation, the Modified Block Proposal may increase
the total cost of harvesting the fishery resource, thereby decreasing the net economic benefits of the IFQ program
and increasing harvesting costs to small entities. The analysis also indicates that by reducing consolidation,
the Modified Block Proposal may result in higher levels of harvesting employment. Higher levels of harvesting employment
and the maintenance of diversity in fishing operations participating in the IFQ program are the main goals of the Modified
Block Proposal. A copy of the analysis is available from the Council (see 

ADDRESSES

). 

This proposed rule has been determined to be not significant for purposes of E.O. 12866.

(a) 

Initial allocation of quota share.

 The Regional Director shall initially assign to qualified persons, on or after October 18, 1994, halibut and sablefish
fixed gear fishery QS that are specific to IFQ regulatory areas and vessel categories. QS will be assigned as a block
in the appropriate IFQ regulatory area and vessel category if that QS would have resulted in an allocation of less than
20,000 lb (9 mt) of IFQ for halibut or sablefish based on: 

(1) The 1994 TAC for fixed gear in those fisheries for specific IFQ regulatory areas, and 

(2) The QS pools of those fisheries for specific IFQ regulatory areas as of October 17, 1994. 



* * * * * 



(f) * * * The Regional Director shall assign halibut or sablefish IFQs to each person holding unrestricted
QS for halibut or sablefish, respectively, up to the limits prescribed at 
 676.22 (e) and (f). * * *



* * * * * 



4. Section 676.21 is revised to read as follows: 




 676.21 

Transfer of QS and IFQ. 



Transfer of QS or IFQ means any transaction requiring QS, or the use thereof in the form of IFQ, to pass from one person
to another, permanently or for a fixed period of time, except that transactions requiring IFQ cards to be issued in
the name of a vessel master employed by an individual or a corporation are not transfers of QS or IFQ. 

(a) 

Transfer procedure.

 A person who receives QS by transfer may not use IFQ resulting from that QS for harvesting halibut or sablefish with
fixed gear until an Application for Transfer of QS/IFQ (Application for Transfer) is approved by the Regional Director.
The Regional Director shall provide an Application for Transfer form to any person on request. Persons who submit
an Application for Transfer to the Regional Director for approval will receive notice of the Regional Director's
decision to approve or disapprove the Application for Transfer, and, if applicable, the reason(s) for disapproval,
by mail posted on the date of that decision, unless another communication mode is requested on the Application for
Transfer. QS or IFQ accounts affected by an Application for Transfer approved by the Regional Director will change
on the date of approval. Any necessary IFQ permits will be sent with the notice of the Regional Director's decision.


(b) 

Application for Transfer approval criteria.

 Except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section, an Application for Transfer will not be approved until the Regional
Director has determined that: 

(1) The person applying for transfer received the QS or IFQ to be transferred: 

(i) By initial assignment by the Regional Director as provided in  676.20(a); or 

(ii) By approved transfer; 

(2) The person applying to receive the QS or IFQ meets the requirements of eligibility in paragraph (c) of this section;


(3) The person applying for transfer and the person applying to receive the QS or IFQ have their notarized signatures
on the Application for Transfer; 

(4) There are no fines, civil penalties, or other payments due and owing, or outstanding permit sanctions, resulting
from Federal fishery violations involving either person; 

(5) The person applying to receive the QS or IFQ currently exists; 

(6) The transfer would not cause the person applying to receive the QS or IFQ to exceed the use limits in  676.22
(e) or (f); 

(7) The transfer would not violate the provisions of paragraph (f) of this section; and 

(8) Other pertinent information requested on the Application for Transfer has been supplied to the satisfaction
of the Regional Director. 

(c) 

Eligibility to receive QS or IFQ by transfer.

 All persons applying to receive QS or IFQ must submit an Application for Eligibility to Receive QS/IFQ (Application
for Eligibility), containing accurate information, to the Regional Director. The Regional Director will not approve
a transfer of IFQ or QS to a person until the Application for Eligibility for that person is approved by the Regional
Director. The Regional Director shall provide an Application for Eligibility form to any person on request. 

(1) A person must indicate on the Application for Eligibility whether the eligibility sought is as: 

(i) An individual; or 

(ii) A corporation, partnership, or other entity.

<TEXT>
 

(2) A person may submit the Application for Eligibility with the Application for Transfer or file the Application
for Eligibility prior to submitting the Application for Transfer. If a person, as described in paragraph (c)(1)(ii)
of this section, files the Application for Eligibility prior to submitting the Application for Transfer, and that
person's status subsequently changes, as described in  676.22, that person must resubmit an Application for
Eligibility before submitting, or with, the Application for Transfer. 

(3) The Regional Director's approval of an Application for Eligibility will be mailed to the person by certified mail.


(4) The Regional Director will notify the applicant if an Application for Eligibility is disapproved. This notification
of disapproval will include: 

(i) The disapproved Application for Eligibility; and 

(ii) An explanation why the Application for Eligibility was not approved. 

(5) Reasons for disapproval of an Application for Eligibility may include, but are not limited to: 

(i) Fewer than 150 days of experience working as an IFQ crew member; 

(ii) Lack of compliance with the U.S. citizenship or corporate ownership requirements specified by the definition
of ``person'' at  676.11; 

(iii) An incomplete Application for Eligibility; or 

(iv) Fines, civil penalties, or other payments due and owing, or outstanding permit sanctions, resulting from Federal
fishery violations. 

(d) 

Transfers of QS blocks. 

(1) A QS block must be transferred as an undivided whole, unless the size of the QS block exceeds the use limits specified
at  676.22. If the QS block to be transferred exceeds the use limits specified at 
 676.22, the Regional Director will divide the block into two blocks, one block containing the maximum amount
of QS allowable under the QS use limits and the other block containing the residual QS. 

(2) QS blocks representing less than 1,000 lb (0.5 mt) of IFQ for halibut or less than 3,000 lb (1.9 mt) for sablefish,
based on the factors listed in  676.20(a), for the same IFQ regulatory area and vessel category, may be consolidated
into larger QS blocks, provided that the consolidated QS blocks do not represent greater than 1,000 lb (0.5 mt) of IFQ
for halibut or greater than 3,000 lb (1.4 mt) of IFQ for sablefish based on the factors listed in  676.20(a). A
consolidated QS block cannot be divided and is considered a single block for purposes of use and transferability.


(e) 

Transfer of QS or IFQ with restrictions. 

If QS or IFQ must be transferred as a result of a court order, operation of law, or as part of a security agreement, but
the person receiving the QS or IFQ by transfer does not meet all of the eligibility requirements of this section, the
Regional Director will approve the Application for Transfer with restrictions. The Regional Director will not assign
IFQ resulting from the restricted QS to any person. IFQ with restrictions may not be used for harvesting halibut or
sablefish with fixed gear. The QS or IFQ will remain restricted until: 

(1) The person who received the QS or IFQ with restrictions meets the eligibility requirements of this section and
the Regional Director approves an Application for Eligibility for that person; or 

(2) The Regional Director approves the Application for Transfer from the person who received the QS or IFQ with restrictions
to a person who meets the requirements of this section. 

(f) 

Transfer restrictions.

 (1) Except as provided in paragraph (e) or paragraph (f)(2)) of this section, only persons who are IFQ crew members,
or that were initially assigned catcher vessel QS, and meet the other requirements in this section may receive catcher
vessel QS. 

(2) Except as provided in paragraph (f)(3) of this section, only persons who are IFQ crew members may receive catcher
vessel QS in IFQ regulatory area 2C for halibut or in the IFQ regulatory area east of 140 
 W. long. for sablefish. 

(3) Catcher vessel QS initially assigned to an individual may be transferred to a corporation that is solely owned
by the same individual. Such transfers of catcher vessel QS in IFQ regulatory area 2C for halibut or in the IFQ regulatory
area east of 140 
 W. long. for sablefish will be governed by the use provisions of  676.22(i); the use provisions pertaining
to corporations at  676.22(j) shall not apply. 

(4) The Regional Director will not approve an Application for Transfer of catcher vessel QS subject to a lease or any
other condition of repossession or resale by the person transferring QS, except as provided in paragraph (g) of this
section, or by court order, operation of law, or as part of a security agreement. The Regional Director may request
a copy of the sales contract or other terms and conditions of transfer between two persons as supplementary information
to the transfer application. 

(g) 

Leasing QS (applicable until January 2, 1998).

 A person may not use IFQ resulting from a QS lease for harvesting halibut or sablefish until an Application for Transfer
complying with the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section and the lease agreement are approved by the Regional
Director. A person may lease no more than 10 percent of that person's total catcher vessel QS for any IFQ species in any
IFQ regulatory area to one or more persons for any fishing year. After approving the Application for Transfer, the
Regional Director shall change any IFQ accounts affected by an approved QS lease and issue all necessary IFQ permits.
QS leases must comply with all transfer requirements specified in this section. All leases will expire on December
31 of the calendar year for which they are approved. 

5. Section 676.22 is amended by revising paragraph (g) to read as follows: 



 676.22 

Limitations on the use of QS and IFQ. 



* * * * * 



(g) 

Limitations on QS blocks.

 No person, individually or collectively, may hold more than two blocks for each species in any IFQ regulatory area,
except that if that person, individually or collectively, holds unblocked QS for a species in an IFQ regulatory area,
such person may only hold one QS block for that species in that IFQ regulatory area. For purposes of this section, holding,
or to hold, blocks of QS means being registered by NMFS as the person who received QS by initial assignment or approved
transfer.

Fresh Cut Flowers and Fresh Cut Greens Promotion and Information Order 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Agricultural Marketing Service, USDA. 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule. 






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The U.S. Department of Agriculture (Department) is seeking comments on a proposal for a national, industry-funded
promotion and information program for fresh cut flowers and fresh cut greens (cut flowers and greens). An order for
the proposed program_the Fresh Cut Flowers and Fresh Cut Greens Promotion and Information Order_was submitted to
the Department by the Promoflor Organizing Group, Inc. The Department is also seeking comments on proposals submitted
by the Florists' Transworld Delivery Association and the Produce Marketing Association which cover only one portion
of the proposed order. Under the proposed order, handlers would pay an assessment based on their gross sales of cut
flowers and greens, regardless of the country of origin, to the proposed National PromoFlor Council. Composed of
handlers, growers, importers, and retailers, the Council would use the assessments collected to conduct a generic
promotion and information program to maintain, expand, and develop markets for cut flowers and greens. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 This proposed order is issued under the Fresh Cut Flowers and Fresh Cut Greens Promotion and Information Act of 1993
[Pub. L. 103-190] approved December 14, 1993, hereinafter referred to as the Act. 



The Department of Agriculture is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866, and the Office of Management
and Budget has determined that it is a ``significant regulatory action.''

This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. It is not intended to have retroactive
effect. This rule would not preempt any State or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable
conflict with this rule. 

The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under  8
of the Act, after an order is implemented, a person subject to the order may file a petition with the Secretary stating
that the order or any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order, is not in accordance
with law and requesting a modification of the order or an exemption from the order. The petitioner is afforded the opportunity
for a hearing on the petition. After such hearing, the Secretary will make a ruling on the petition. The Act provides
that the district courts of the United States in any district in which a person who is a petitioner resides or carries
on business are vested with jurisdiction to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, if a complaint for that
purpose is filed within 20 days after the date of the entry of the ruling. 



Regulatory Flexibility Act 



Pursuant to requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural
Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this proposed action on small entities. 

The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small
businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. 

Only those wholesale handlers, retail distribution centers, producers, and importers who have annual sales of $750,000
or more of cut flowers and greens and sell those products to exempt handlers, retailers, or consumers would be considered
to be qualified handlers and assessed under the order. There are approximately 900 wholesalers, 150 importers, and
200 domestic producers who would be qualified handlers. 

The majority of these qualified handlers would be classified as small businesses. As defined by the Small Business
Administration [13 CFR 121.601] small agricultural service firms, which would include the qualified handlers who
would be required to pay assessments under the order, have been defined as those having annual receipts of less than
$5,000,000. 

Statistics reported by the National Agricultural Statistics Service show that 1993 sales at wholesale of domestic
cut flowers and greens total approximately $535 million while the value of imports during 1993 was approximately
$382 million. The leading States in the United States producing cut flowers and greens, by wholesale value, are California,
which produces approximately 60 percent of the domestic crop, followed by Florida, Colorado, Washington, New York,
Hawaii, and Pennsylvania. Major countries exporting cut flowers and greens into the United States, by value, are
Colombia, which accounts for approximately 60 percent, followed by The Netherlands, Mexico, and Costa Rica. 

During the first three years the order is in effect, the rate of assessment may not exceed 0.5 percent of the gross sales
of cut flowers and greens. After the order has been in effect for three years, the assessment rate may be increased or
decreased by no more that 0.25 percent each year when recommended by two-thirds of the members of the National PromoFlor
Council (Council) and approved by the Secretary. However, at no time may the assessment rate exceed 1.0 percent of
gross sales of cut flowers and greens. Notice and comment rulemaking would be required to change the assessment rate.


Although the maximum assessment collection is expected to total about $10 million annually, the economic impact
of a 1.0 percent or less assessment on each qualified handler would not be significant. 

While the proposed order would impose certain recordkeeping requirements on qualified handlers, information required
under the proposed order could be compiled from records currently maintained. Thus, any added burden resulting from
increased recordkeeping would not be significant when compared to the benefits that should accrue to such businesses.
The proposed order's provisions have been carefully reviewed, and every effort has been made to minimize any unnecessary
recordkeeping costs or requirements. 

Although the order would impose some additional costs and requirements on qualified handlers, it is anticipated
that the program under the proposed order would help to increase the demand for cut flowers and greens. Therefore,
any additional costs should be offset by the benefits derived from expanded markets and sales benefiting all segments
of the floral industry. Accordingly, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that the provisions of the proposed
order would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. 



Paperwork Reduction Act 



In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 [44 U.S.C. Chapter 35] the forms, reporting, and recordkeeping
requirements included in this action have been submitted for approval to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB).
Information collection requirements that are included in this proposal include: 

(1) 

A periodic report by each qualified handler who handles cut flowers and greens.

 The estimated maximum number of respondents is 1,250, each submitting an average of 12 responses per year, with an
estimated average reporting burden of 10 minutes per response. 

(2) 

An application requesting postponement of assessment payments.

 The estimated maximum number of respondents is 25, each submitting an average of 4 responses per year, with an estimated
average reporting burden of 20 minutes per response. 

(3) 

A refund application form for persons who desire a refund of their assessments.

 The estimated maximum number of respondents is 210, each submitting 1 response prior to the initial referendum, or
an annual average of 70 respondents, with an estimated average reporting burden of 15 minutes per response. 

(4) 

An exemption application for wholesale handlers, retail distribution centers, producers, and importers of cut
flowers and greens with gross annual sales under $750,000 and would be exempt from assessments and recordkeeping
requirements.

 The estimated number of respondents for this form is 500, each submitting one response per year, with an estimated
average burden of 15 minutes per response. 

(5) 

A referendum ballot to be used to determine whether qualified handlers favor continuance of the order.

 The estimated number of respondents completing this ballot would be 1,250, each submitting one response approximately
every 3 years, or an annual average of 417 respondents, with an estimated average reporting burden of 15 minutes per
response. 

(6) 

A nominee background statement form for Council member and alternate member nominees.

 The estimated number of respondents for this form is 50 for the initial nominations to the Council and approximately
17 respondents annually thereafter. Each respondent would submit one response per year, with an estimated average
reporting burden of 30 minutes per response.

(7) 

A requirement to maintain records sufficient to verify reports submitted under the order.

 The estimated maximum number of recordkeepers necessary to comply with this requirement is 1,750 each of whom would
have an estimated annual burden of 15 minutes. 

Comments concerning the information collection requirements contained in this action should also be sent to the
Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs; Office of Management and Budget; Washington, DC 20503. Attention:
Desk Officer for Agricultural Marketing Service, USDA. 



Background 



The Act authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture (Secretary) to establish a national cut flowers and greens promotion
and consumer information program. The program would be funded by an assessment levied on qualified handlers not to
exceed 1 percent of their gross sales of cut flowers and greens. 

The Act provides for the submission of proposals for a cut flowers and greens promotion and consumer information order
by industry organizations or any other interested person affected by the Act. The Act requires that such a proposed
order provide for the establishment of a National PromoFlor Council. The Council would be composed of 25 voting members:
14 members representing qualified wholesale handlers of domestic and imported cut flowers and greens; 3 members
representing producers who are qualified handlers of cut flowers and greens; 3 members representing importers who
are qualified handlers of cut flowers and greens; 3 members representing traditional retailers of cut flowers and
greens; and 2 members representing persons who produce cut flowers and greens. Each member shall have an alternate.


The Department issued a news release on February 17, 1994, requesting proposals for an initial order or portions of
an initial order. 



Proposal I 



An entire proposed order was submitted by the PromoFlor Organizing Group, Inc. (PromoFlor). PromoFlor is an industry
group created and sponsored by 68 floral industry organizations and more than 700 floral businesses solely for the
purpose of developing and implementing a promotion and consumer information order for cut flowers and greens. PromoFlor
represents a substantial number of industry members who would be assessed under the proposed order. Once the order
is established, PromoFlor would no longer exist. 

The Department is publishing PromoFlor's proposed order as Proposal I. The Department has modified PromoFlor's
proposed text (1) to make it consistent with the Act and other similar national research and promotion programs supervised
by the Department, (2) to simplify the language and format of some provisions, and (3) to add certain sections necessary
for proper administration of the Order by the Department.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940628-1-00099 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940628-1-00016 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The proposed order submitted by PromoFlor is summarized as follows: 

Sections 1208.1-1208.22 of the proposed order define certain terms, such as floral products, qualified handler,
producer, and retailer, which are used in the proposed order. 

Sections 1208.30-1208.37 include provisions relating to the establishment, membership, nomination procedures,
appointment, terms of office, and reimbursement of members of the Council. Also PromoFlor would be designated as
an election committee for the initial nomination of members to the Council. After the Council is appointed, the Council
would be the election committee. 

Sections 1208.40-1208.43 include powers and duties of the Council, which would be the body organized to administer
the order through the implementation of plans, projects, budgets, and contracts to promote and disseminate information
about cut flowers and greens, under the supervision of the Secretary. Further, the Council would be authorized to
incur expenses necessary for the performance of its duties. 

Sections 1208.50-1208.57 would authorize the collection of assessments, specify who pays them and how, set
forth procedures for granting a postponement of the payment of an assessment for any qualified handler who is financially
unable to pay such assessment, set forth procedures for the handling of a one-time refund should the order fail to be
approved in referendum, authorize the Council to make determinations as to who are qualified handlers and who are
exempt handlers, and for establishing an operating monetary reserve. 

The initial assessment rate would be 0.5 percent of a qualified handler's gross sales during the first three years
the order is in effect. Thereafter, the rate may be increased or decreased by no more than 0.25 percent per year. A uniform
factor would be used for determining the assessment due on 
non-sale transfers to retailers and sales by importers who are qualified handlers directly to consumers. Another
uniform factor would be used for determining the assessment due on sales directly to consumers by producers who are
qualified handlers. Sales of cut flowers and greens to export markets would be exempt from assessment. 

The assessment sections also outline the procedures to be followed by qualified handlers for remitting assessments;
establish a 1.5 percent per month interest charge for unpaid or late assessments; and provide for refunds of assessments
paid if the program does not continue after the initial referendum. 

Sections 1208.60-1208.62 authorize the Secretary to suspend or terminate the order when deemed appropriate,
and prescribes proceedings after suspension or termination. 

Sections 1208.70-1208.72 concern reporting and recordkeeping 
requirements for persons subject to the order and protect the confidentiality of information obtained from such
books, records, or reports. 

Sections 1208.80-1208.85 are miscellaneous provisions including the provisions involving authority of
the Secretary; personal liability of Council members and employees; separability of order provisions; handling
of intellectual property, such as patents, arising from funds collected by the Council; and amendments to the order.


In addition to the proposal from PromoFlor, the Department received proposals addressing the nomination of the Council's
retailer members from Florists' Transworld Delivery Association (FTD) (see Proposal II) and the Produce Marketing
Association (PMA) (see Proposal III). 



Proposal II 



FTD's proposal specifies that one of the three retailer members be appointed from nominations submitted by the American
Floral Marketing Council (AFMC) in accordance with the Act, that one retailer member be appointed from nominations
submitted by FTD, and that one retailer member be appointed from nominations submitted by a coalition of traditional
retail florist organizations. The FTD proposal also defines ``traditional retail florist organization'' as an
organization having membership exceeding 1,000 of which 75 percent would be traditional cut flowers and greens retailers
and such organization spends a portion of its revenue on marketing cut flowers and greens. The FTD proposal defines
``traditional cut flowers and greens retailer'' as small business establishments that operate from owned or leased
premises and derive 40 percent of their total volume of sales from cut flowers and greens. This definition would not
allow for mass-market retailers such as supermarket chains to be eligible to nominate candidates as members on the
Council. The FTD proposal further states that no traditional retail florist organization, including AFMC, would
be eligible to nominate members for more than one of the three retailer member positions. It is FTD's position that
it is the largest traditional retail florist organization in the industry and that it should be entitled to one member
and alternate on the Council. 



Proposal III 



The Produce Marketing Association (PMA) also submitted proposed definitions of ``traditional retailer'' and ``traditional
retail florist organization'' which would be used in determining eligibility to nominate retailer members for the
Council. PMA is the national trade association that represents the mass-market floral industry though its division,
the Floral Marketing Association. It is PMA's position that the definition of the term ``traditional'' should be
very broad and include any retailer whose primary business is the sale of floral products, including cut flowers and
greens or has a specific department dedicated to the sale of floral products including cut flowers and greens. Also,
PMA recommended that nominations be limited to national organizations. Further, PMA is in favor of keeping the two
retailer seats that were not designated for AFMC open to as large a segment of the floral industry as possible.

In addition to these proposals, the Department has received letters from several other floral industry groups regarding
qualifications for the retailer member seats on the Council. They include American Floral Services, Inc., Redbook
Floral Services, Teleflora, and Wholesale Florists and Florist Suppliers of America. Copies of these letters will
be available for public inspection in addition to the comments received in response to this proposed rule. 

The Department will analyze all written views received to date as well as written comments on the three proposals published
below before issuing a final order.

and greens as it finds appropriate. The Council may disburse such funds as necessary for these purposes after such
plans or projects have been submitted to, and approved by, the Secretary.

(c) The Council shall submit to the Secretary, for approval before implementation, any contracts for development
of plans and projects, as well as such plans and projects as may be developed by or approved by the Council for advertising,

in  1208.16(a); bouquet manufacturers as described in  1208.16(b); manufacturers of floral articles,
as described in  1208.16(c); auction houses that clear sales of cut flowers and greens, as described in  1208.16(d);
distribution centers owned or controlled by retailers if the principal business activity is floral sales, as described
in  1208.16(e); importers that are qualified handlers as defined in  1208.16(f); producers that are
qualified handlers as defined in  1208.16(g)_shall pay to the Council an assessment in an amount determined
in accordance with this subpart, on each sale of cut flowers and greens to a retailer or an exempt handler (as defined
in  1208.8) and on each non-sale transfer of cut flowers and greens to a retailer by a qualified handler that is
a distribution center; as well as each direct sale of cut flowers and greens to a consumer by a producer that is a qualified
handler, or by an importer that is a qualified handler. Such assessments shall be remitted by each qualified handler
to the Council or its agent within 60 days after the end of the month in which the sale or non-sale transfer subject to
assessment under this subpart took place. Such assessments shall be paid at the following rates:

(1) During the first three years after the effective date of this subpart:

(i) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section, the rate shall be one-half of 1 (0.5) percent of the
gross sales price of the cut flowers and greens sold;

(ii) In the case of non-sale transfers to a retailer by a qualified handler that is a distribution center and in the case
of direct sales by importers or producers, the rate shall be one-half of 1 (0.5) percent of the amount of each transaction's
valuation for assessment as provided in paragraph (b);

(2) After the first three years that this subpart is in effect, the uniform assessment rate may be increased or decreased
annually by not more than one-quarter of 1 (0.25) percent of the gross sales price of a product sold; or in the case of
other transactions the amount of such transactions, except that the assessment rate may not exceed 1 percent of the
gross sales price or the transaction amount. Changes in the rate of assessment may only be made if such changes are adopted
by a two-thirds majority vote of the Council and approved by the Secretary (after public notice and opportunity for
comment as provided in the Act) as being necessary to carry out the objectives of the Act. Any such change so approved
by the Secretary may be put into effect without a referendum but shall be announced not less than 30 days prior to the
beginning of a fiscal year.

(b) Each non-sale transfer of cut flowers and greens to a retailer from a qualified handler that is a distribution center
shall be treated as a sale of cut flowers and greens to a retailer and shall be assessable. Each direct sale of cut flowers
and greens to a consumer by a producer or an importer who is a qualified handler shall be assessable. These transactions
shall be determined to have the following valuations for assessment purposes:

(1) In the case of a non-sale transfer of cut flowers and greens from a distribution center that is a qualified handler
and each direct sale of cut flowers and greens to a consumer by an importer that is a qualified handler, the amount of
the valuation of the cut flowers and greens for assessment purposes shall be the price paid by the distribution center
or importer to acquire the cut flowers and greens, and determined by multiplying the acquisition price by a uniform
factor of 1.43 to represent the markup of a wholesale handler on a sale to a retailer.

(2) In the case of a direct sale to a consumer by a producer who is a qualified handler, the valuation of the cut flowers
and greens for assessment purposes shall be equal to an amount determined by multiplying the price paid by the consumer
by a uniform factor of 0.50 to represent the cost of producing the article and the markup of a wholesale handler on a sale
to a retailer.

(3) The Council may consider and adopt changes in the uniform factors specified in subparagraphs (1) and (2) above.
Any such change shall not become effective until it has been adopted by a majority vote of the Council and approved by
the Secretary after public notice and opportunity to comment on such change as provided in the Act. Changes so adopted
and approved shall become effective at the beginning of the next fiscal year.

(c) The collection of assessments shall commence on or after a date established by the Secretary, and shall continue
until terminated by the Secretary. If the Council is not constituted on the date the first assessments are to be remitted,
the Secretary shall have the authority to receive assessments on behalf of the Council and may hold such assessments
in an interest bearing account until the Council is constituted, and the funds may be transferred to the Council.

(d) No assessments may be levied on any sale of cut flowers and greens for export from the United States. The Council
is authorized to establish procedures for the verification of exports.

(e) In general, assessment funds (less refunds, if any) shall be used:

(1) For payment of costs incurred in implementing and administering this subpart;

(2) To provide for a reasonable reserve to be maintained from assessments to be available for contingencies; and

No funds collected by the Council shall in any manner be used for the purpose of influencing legislation or government
action or policy, except to develop and recommend to the Secretary amendments to this subpart.


 1208.52 

Charges for late payments.


Any assessment due the Council pursuant to  1208.50 that is not paid on time shall be increased 1.5 percent each
month it remains unpaid beginning with the day following the date such assessment was due. If not paid in full, any remaining
amount due, which shall include any unpaid charges previously made pursuant to this section, shall be increased at
the same rate on the corresponding day of each month thereafter until paid. For the purpose of this section, any assessment
that was determined at a date later than prescribed by this subpart because of a failure to submit a report when due shall
be considered to have been payable by the date it would have been due if the report had been filed when due. The timeliness
of a payment to the Council shall be based on the applicable postmark date or the date actually received by the Council,
whichever is earlier.


 1208.53 

Adjustment of accounts.


Whenever the Council or the Secretary determines through an audit of a person's reports, records, books, or accounts
or through some other means that additional money is due the Council or that money is due such person from the Council,
such person shall be notified of the amount due. The person shall then remit any amount due the Council by the next date
for remitting assessments. Overpayments shall be credited to the account of the person remitting the overpayment
and shall be applied against amounts due in succeeding months.


 1208.54 

Refunds of assessments and escrow account.


(a) Any qualified handler may demand and receive from the escrow account, subject to the limitation on such payments
provided in paragraph (c), a one-time refund of any assessments paid by or on behalf of the handler if the handler requests
the refund before the initial referendum on this subpart is held and this subpart is rejected by the voters when it is
submitted to the referendum in accordance with  1208.60(a). Such a refund will be paid only if all of the following
conditions are met:
(1) The handler has paid the assessments sought to be refunded and has submitted proof of such payment;
(2) The handler does not support the program established under this subpart and so states in the handler's demand for
a refund;
(3) The handler's demand for a refund is made on a form specified by the Council and filed not less than 10 days prior to
the date when the initial referendum, conducted pursuant to  1208.60(a) to ascertain whether this subpart
shall remain in effect, is scheduled to begin; and
(4) This subpart is not approved by a simple majority of the votes cast by qualified handlers in the initial referendum.
(b) The Council shall establish an escrow account to be used for assessment refunds, as needed, and shall place into
the account an amount equal to 10 percent of the total amount of assessments collected during the period beginning
on the date this subpart becomes effective and ending on the date the results of the initial referendum are issued and
the initial referendum is completed.
(c) If the amount in the escrow account is not sufficient to refund the total amount of assessments demanded by all qualified
handlers determined eligible for refunds and this subpart is not approved in the referendum, the Council shall prorate
the amount of all such refunds among all eligible qualified handlers that demand the refund. If there is any amount
in excess of the amount needed to pay refunds and expenses, it shall be returned pro rata to those who paid assessments.
If this subpart is approved in the referendum, there shall be no refunds made, and all funds in the escrow account shall
be returned to the Council for use by the Council in accordance with the other provisions of this subpart.


 1208.55 

Postponement of collections.


(a) The Council may grant a postponement of the payment of an assessment under this subpart for any qualified handler
that establishes that it is financially unable to make the payment. In order that a qualified handler that is financially
unable to pay an assessment may have the opportunity to petition the Council to postpone payment of such an assessment,
as provided in the Act, the Council shall develop forms and procedures for this purpose as expeditiously as possible
and submit them to the Secretary for approval and issuance after notice and an opportunity for public comment thereon.
Such procedures shall, among other things, require that the handler demonstrate the handler's inability to pay through
the submission of an opinion prepared by an independent certified public accountant (at the handler's expense) and
any other documentation specified therein to the effect that the handler is insolvent or will be unable to continue
to operate if the handler is required to pay the assessment when due.
(b) The procedures for obtaining a postponement of payment to be developed by the Council for submission to the Secretary
shall also include provisions with respect to the period of postponement, the conditions of payment that may be imposed
and the basis, if any, on which further extensions of the time for payment will be granted so as to appropriately reflect
the demonstrated needs of the qualified handler.


 1208.56 

Determinations.


(a) The Council is authorized to make the determinations required by this subpart as to the status of persons as qualified
handlers and exempt handlers including determinations of the status of persons as qualified wholesale handlers,
distribution centers that are qualified handlers, producers that are qualified handlers, importers that are qualified
handlers, as well as such other determinations of status and facts as may be required for the effective administration
of this subpart. Based on such determinations, the Council from time to time shall publish lists of exempt handlers
who are not required to pay assessments, and lists of qualified handlers who are required to pay assessments under
this subpart.
