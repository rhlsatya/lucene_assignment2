Record of Decision for United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service
(APHIS), Animal Damage Control (ADC), Gull Hazard Reduction Program, John F. Kennedy International Airport; Final
Environmental Impact Statement, Introduction



This decision concludes a complex evaluation process that explores alternatives which reduce or eliminate the hazard
to aviation and human safety at John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFKIA) posed by the presence and activities
of gulls, especially laughing gulls. The EIS identifies the severity and nature of the hazards created by gull-aircraft
collisions at JFKIA. Until approximately the mid-1980s the hazards posed by gulls could, for the most part, be effectively
controlled by conventional bird management activities on JFKIA: insect, water, vegetation, and sanitation management
programs, and conduct of the Port Authority's bird Control Unit (BCU). Throughout the late 1980s, the hazard to aviation
grew as the presence of laughing gulls increased substantially concurrent with the growth of the laughing gull nesting
colony in Jamaica Bay. In 1991, an experimental on-airport shooting program was initiated to augment the conventional
control methods already in place at JFKIA. The shooting program was also conducted in 1992 and 1993.

Although an annual shooting program is quite effective in reducing gull-aircraft strikes, especially when it is
conducted in combination with on-airport non-lethal approaches, its desirability as a long-term solution may be
limited due to the large number of gulls killed. Accordingly, the EIS process was commenced in 1992 for the purpose
of exploring alternatives to dealing effectively with the gull hazard situation at JFKIA in a way that takes into account
all interests.

The Council on Environmental Quality's (CEQ) regulations implementing the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA)
tell the decision maker what information must be included in records of decision. Section 1505.2 of the CEQ Regulations
provides that records of decision contain:




_A statement of the decision;

_The identification of all alternatives considered by the agency, including the environmentally preferable alternative(s);

_A discussion of all factors_economic, technical, and mission-related as well as considerations of national policy
balanced in the decision making process and how each factor weighs in the decision; and

_An explanation of whether the decision is designed to avoid or minimize environmental harm and, if not, why not.



Alternatives Considered



The EIS explores a wide variety of alternative approaches, that would occur both on JFK and off JFK property, including:
the No Action alternative, On-Airport Shooting, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey's (Port Authority)
On-Airport Program, and other alternatives that are either lethal or nonlethal. The Integrated Management Program
(IMP) includes the following components:




1. Continued Development of JFK's On-Airport Program

2. Reduction of Off-Airport Attractants

3. On-Airport Shooting of Gulls

4. Laughing Gull Nest/Egg Destruction in Jamaica Bay

5. On-Colony Shooting of Adult Laughing Gulls

6. Display of Gull Models to Harass Gulls




A total of 29 separate alternative methods are described and analyzed. Alternatives include those that would occur
on JFK, on the Gateway National Recreation Area (GNRA), and at other off-airport sites. Both lethal and nonlethal
methods of gull hazard control are contained in those alternatives. Major categories of alternatives are as follows:
nesting habitat modifications, discouraging use of the nesting colony site through harassment, reduction of off-airport
attractants, expansion of JFKIA's on-airport bird control program, airport operational strategies, aircraft
engineering, laughing gull population reduction, and on-airport gull shooting and harassment.



Roles and Responsibilities



Decisions regarding the selection and conduct of alternatives are complicated by the fact that the cooperating Federal
and New York State agencies have very different roles and responsibilities. In the past, APHIS, the Federal lead agency,
has provided services (gull hazard control) to the Port Authority upon their request. APHIS' jurisdiction (and its
choice among alternatives) is limited to deciding what wildlife control activities, if any, it should conduct when
requested to assist public and private entities. On-airport gull control activities would be done at the request
of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. The on-airport gull shooting program, a component of the IMP, would
require the acquisition of permits from the USFWS and the DEC. The reduction of off-airport attractants would require
the approval of the entities controlling those sites. On-colony activities would require the approval of NPS. The
EIS considers all feasible alternatives, and among those alternatives, indicates which are the environmentally
preferable alternatives. However, ADC does not alone have the jurisdiction to select or implement any of those alternatives.

The USFWS has permitting authorities regarding the taking of Federally-protected migratory birds, and identifies
conditions under which permits may be issued. The USFWS would evaluate permit applications for the following components
of the IMP: on-airport shooting of gulls, on-colony shooting of adult laughing gulls, and laughing gull egg/nest
destruction. The USFWS may identify conditions under which permits are issued.

The National Park Service (NPS) is responsible for managing GNRA pursuant to applicable laws, policies, and regulations.
The NPS has decision-making authority regarding conduct of IMP components that would occur on NPS lands in Jamaica
Bay. Those components of the IMP that would require authorizations from the NPS are: laughing gull nest/egg destruction,
on-colony shooting of adult laughing gulls, and display of gull models to harass gulls.

The DEC has permitting authority for the taking of migratory birds pursuant to New York State law. The DEC has decision-making
authority regarding permitting of IMP components that would include taking of gulls: on-airport shooting of gulls,
laughing gulls nest/egg destruction, and on-colony shooting of adult laughing gulls.

The United States Department of the Interior's (USDI) recent statement of policy (Section 6.4.2 of the EIS) declares
that IMP components 1-3 must first be conducted and proven ineffective before the USDI would initiate any components
that would be conducted on NPS property and directed at relocating the Jamaica Bay laughing gull nesting colony away
from its present location. Past experience with component 1-3 activities between 1991-93 indicates
that these three components are effective in reducing bird-strikes at JFKIA.


Decision


The circumstances identified above require that the APHIS decision be bifurcated.
 I will treat actions that must be taken in the near term separately from those that would be taken in the longer term.




Based upon the analysis contained in the environmental impact statement, I have determined that an integrated gull
hazard control program at JFKIA is clearly superior. I have decided, in the context of the relationship between ADC
and the Port Authority, that when ADC personnel determine, with the concurrence of the FAA and the Port Authority,
that the number of gulls entering JFKIA airspace has reached an unacceptable level, ADC will begin an on-airport gull
shooting program as described in Chapter 3 of the EIS, once the requisite Federal and New York State permits are issued
to ADC. ADC will work with the Port Authority among others to enhance JFKIA's on-airport bird control program, improve
the functioning of the Bird Hazard Task Force (BHTF), and reduce off-airport attractants. These non-lethal components
will contribute to the reduction of gull mortality over the long term, but will not be as effective in achieving that
objective as would be the relocation of the Jamaica Bay laughing gull nesting colony through conduct of IMP components
4-6. ADC believes such relocation is feasible and would be in the best interest of air travelers and the laughing
gull population.


Short-Term:

 I have determined that the IMP represents the best available means of addressing the expected immediate need to reduce
the potential for large numbers of gull-aircraft collisions at JFKIA in 1994. When ADC personnel determine, with
the concurrence of the FAA and the Port Authority, that the number of gulls entering JFKIA airspace has reached an unacceptable
level, ADC will begin an on-airport gull shooting program as described in Chapter 3 of the EIS, once the requisite Federal
and New York State permits are issued to ADC. Whenever possible, ADC will continue to assist the Port Authority in implementing
and improving the nonlethal components of the IMP, including the conduct and enhancement of: On-airport vegetation,
water, insect, and sanitation management programs, improved operational functioning of the Port Authority BCU
and the BHTF, and, wherever possible, the identification and reduction of off-airport bird attractants. Conduct
of these activities will minimize the number of gulls taken in the on-airport shooting program.
The overriding factor that weighed in making this decision is human safety. Other considerations, including the
minimization of adverse environmental impacts have been factored into this short-term decision to the fullest extent
possible. Although I would have preferred a decision that included immediate efforts to relocate the laughing gull
colony, the current circumstances do not favor those alternatives. Based upon past experience, the timing and nature
of the gull-aircraft strike hazard will likely dictate that management action will be immediately necessary to protect
human safety; other alternatives could not be fully implemented and still address this immediate need.


Long-Term: 

APHIS ADC supports the implementation of the six components of the IMP, with the long-term objective of relocating
the laughing gull colony away from its present location. For the long term, reducing the potential for gull-aircraft
collisions at JFKIA should be achieved through the IMP, with emphasis on non-lethal alternatives and on those alternatives
that would accomplish relocation of the Jamaica Bay laughing gull colony away from its present location. Conduct
of the 6-component IMP provides a more complete opportunity to strike a balance between human safety and other public
policies. The EIS adequately analyzes all alternatives, including those which APHIS and the State and Federal cooperating
agencies would authorize. Although APHIS cannot authorize or pursue the alternatives that would occur on NPS property,
it should be emphasized that the important factors of human safety and protection of wildlife can be achieved only
through implementation of 

all 

components of the IMP.
The nature and extent of APHIS' role in JFKIA's Gull Hazard Reduction Program will be examined annually by APHIS ADC,
which will report its findings to me and make them available to the public. The Port Authority's efforts to conduct
non-lethal gull control methods and USDI's progress towards the conduct of the components that would occur on NPS
property will be among the most important factors APHIS will consider. To reiterate, the environmentally preferred
long term approach is the relocation of the laughing gull colony away from its present location at the end of the runway,
in order to reduce the long term mortality of gulls, and so substantially reduce the potential for gull-aircraft collisions
at JFKIA.


Minimizing Environmental Harm


The primary adverse environmental impact of the gull hazard reduction program is the mortality of gulls. The continued
development and conduct of the Port Authority's on-airport program that emphasizes non-lethal bird hazard control
approaches, will contribute to the reduction of gull mortality. Conduct of the three IMP components that would occur
on NPS property would reduce the need to conduct on-airport shooting programs, and would reduce over the long-term
the mortality rate of gulls. The Port Authority and the USDI are encouraged to conduct these activities in order to
reduce gull mortality in the short and long terms.
Chapter 7 of the FEIS identifies mitigation and monitoring strategies to be conducted to minimize the adverse impacts
of alternatives. All APHIS-conducted gull hazard control activities will be conducted in such a manner that minimizes
adverse environmental impacts and seeks to maximize human and aircraft safety at JFK. During the course of the shooting
program, APHIS ADC will monitor the situation at the airport, including mitigation strategies, and report periodically
(at least bi-weekly) to me. All such reports will be available to the public.

Re: JFKIA Gull Hazard Reduction Program EIS Process



Dear Mr. Sanderson: This is to advise that anticipated public safety considerations require that we seek a reduction
in the 30-day period (between notification of availability of the final environmental impact statement and issuance
of records of decision) required by 40 CFR 1506.10(b) in the above-referenced matter. The 45-day comment period on
the draft environmental impact statement closed on March 28, 1994. We now anticipate that the notice of availability
of the final environmental impact statement will be published in the May 6th issue of the 

Federal Register

. It appears, however, that decisions may have to be made before June 5, 1994, the earliest a decision could be issued
consistent with the provisions of 40 CFR 1506.10(b)(2).
The environmental impact statement_the process for which has to date fully involved the public and included an on-site
``public information meeting''_explores alternatives to reduce the gull hazard to aircraft at John F. Kennedy International
Airport. During each of the past three years beginning in mid-May the potential for gull-aircraft interactions has
tended to increase dramatically. We reasonably expect that the potential for gull-aircraft interactions will reach
an unacceptable level before June 5, 1994. Thus, a reduction of the required 30-day period between notification of
availability of the final environmental impact statement and issuance of the records of decision by the Animal and
Plant Health Inspection Service, lead agency in the EIS process, and the United States Fish and Wildlife Service,
a cooperating agency in the EIS process, is hereby requested.
If additional information is needed or you have questions concerning this matter, please call me at (301) 436-8565.
Thank you for your consideration of this request.

Re: JFKIA Gull Hazard Reduction Program EIS Process




Dear Mr. Sanderson: This amends my letter of April 19, 1994 in the above-referenced matter for the purpose of seeking
a specific waiver period. The facts and circumstances as described in my previous letter have not changed. In fairness
to the public, however, a fixed date by which a decision is to be made should be provided. Accordingly, a 16-day waiver
of the 30-day period prescribed in 40 CFR  1506.10(b)_allowing a decision to be made on May 20, 1994_is hereby
requested. We still anticipate that the notice of availability of the final environmental impact statement will
be published in the May 6th issue of the 

Federal Register

.

If you have questions concerning this amendment or if additional information is needed, please contact me directly.
Thank you for your cooperation in this matter.

Dear Mr. Bausch: I have received and reviewed your request dated April 19, 1994 and the amendment dated April 25, 1994,
asking for a 16-day waiver of the review period for the Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) Gull Hazard Reduction
Program, John F. Kennedy International Airport, Queens County, New York. The request has been carefully reviewed
pursuant to Section 1506.10(d) of the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) regulations implementing the National
Environmental Policy Act.

Based on my review of the request, I find reasons of compelling national policy have been substantiated. Therefore
a 16-day waiver has been approved for the above mentioned FEIS.

As required by  1506.10(d), CEQ will be notified of your request and my subsequent approval. You will be provided
with a copy of the notice once it appears in the 

Federal Register

<USDEPT>COMMODITY FUTURES TRADING COMMISSION</USDEPT>



<DOCTITLE>Proposed Amendments Relating to the CME's Domestic Stock Index </DOCTITLE>
Futures Contracts 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Commodity Futures Trading Commission. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of Proposed Contract Market Rule Changes. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) has submitted proposed rule amendments to the opening price limit provisions
in its domestic stock index futures contracts. Under the proposal, each domestic stock index futures contract's
opening price limit would not be in effect on any day when the closing price of the preceding Globex trading session
is outside the price range that would be permitted under that contract's opening price limit provisions.
 




In accordance with Section 5a(a)(12) of the Commodity Exchange Act and acting pursuant to the authority delegated
by Commission Regulation  140.96, the Director of the Division of Economic Analysis (Division) on behalf of
the Commission has determined that publication of the proposal is in the public interest and will assist the Commission
in considering the views of interested persons. On behalf of the Commission, the Division is requesting comment on
this proposal. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The overnight Globex session in the S&P 500 futures contract ends at 9:00 a.m. Eastern time.
 The following regular trading session begins at 9:30 a.m. The price limit in effect at the end of the Globex session
is 12 S&P 500 points above or below the previous day's settlement price. (Twelve S&P 500 points are equivalent
to about 100 points in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA).) The opening price limit in effect at the beginning
of the regular trading session is five S&P 500 points above or below the previous day's settlement price (equivalent
to about 40 points in the DJIA). This price limit remains in effect until 9:40 a.m. Thus, the price limit in the S&P
500 futures contract during the preceding Globex session is wider than that in effect during the open of the following
regular trading session. 




The CME proposes that the S&P 500 futures contract's opening price limit not be in effect on any day that the closing
price of the preceding Globex trading session is more than five points above or below the previous day's settlement
price. According to the CME, this proposal will improve coordination between the opening and Globex price limits
on days when the closing price on Globex exceeds the opening price limit. 
Copies of the proposed amendments will be available for inspection at the Office of the Secretariat, Commodity Futures
Trading Commission, 2033 K Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20581. Copies of the proposed rule amendments can be obtained
through the Office of the Secretariat by mail at the above address or by phone at (202) 254-6314. 
The materials submitted by the CME in support of the proposed amendments may be available upon request pursuant to
the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) and the Commission's regulations thereunder (17 CFR Part 145 (1987)).
Requests for copies should be made to the FOI, Privacy and Sunshine Act Compliance Staff of the Office of the Secretariat
at the Commission's headquarters in accordance with 17 CFR 145.7 and 145.8. 
Any person interested in submitting written data, views, or arguments on the proposed amendments should send such
comments to Jean A. Webb, Secretary, Commodity Futures Trading Commission, 2033 K Street, NW, Washington, DC 20581
by the specified date.

required to provide service to the Tuscarora Pipeline Project. From the standpoint of the environmental analysis,
the important changes to the PGT Expansion II Project are: 

 The elimination of the additional compression originally proposed at the Sandpoint, Idaho and Rosalia, Washington
Compressor Stations; 
 The removal from the above proceedings of three meter runs inside PGT's existing Malin Meter Station in southern
Oregon; the meter runs will still be necessary to serve the Tuscarora Pipeline Project, but will now be proposed under
section 157.208(a) of the Commission's regulations (18 CFR 157.208(a)). 
 The elimination of one meter station proposed in Klamath Falls, Oregon; 
 The addition of two service taps on the Medford Extension Lateral; 

 Route realignments that increase the total miles of the Medford Extension Lateral (pipeline) to be constructed
from 84.17 miles to 86.5 miles (see Table 1)

1

; and 





 Route realignments that increase the total miles of the Coyote Springs Extension Lateral (pipeline) to be
constructed from 17.71 miles to 18.5 miles (see Table 1). 

Prior to this amendment, the PGT Expansion II and the Tuscarora Pipeline Projects were being processed concurrently
because of the inclusion in Docket No. CP93-618-000 of additional system compression and the meter runs
at Malin needed to deliver gas to the Tuscarora Pipeline Project. However, the proposed amendment to eliminate the
compression and the proposal to build the meter runs under separate authority make the PGT Expansion II Project a stand-alone
proposal which can be considered separately from the Tuscarora Pipeline Project. 

Based on the above changes, we have determined that an environmental assessment (EA), rather than an environmental
impact statement, is the appropriate document for analyzing the potential environmental impacts associated with
the PGT Expansion II Project. We are now preparing this document. Since the PGT facilities will be located outside
the State of California, the SLC will not be a cooperating agency in the preparation of this EA. We are proceeding with
a joint EIR/EIS with the SLC for the Tuscarora Pipeline Project. The three meter runs inside PGT's existing Malin Meter
Station will be addressed as a related facility in that joint EIR/EIS. 



The EA Process 




The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) requires the Commission to take into account the environmental impacts
that could result from a major Federal action whenever it considers the issuance of a Certificate of Public Convenience
and Necessity. The EA we are preparing will give the Commission the information it needs to do that. If the EA concluded
that the project would result in significant environmental impacts, the Commission would prepare an environmental
impact statement. Otherwise a Finding of No Significant Impact would be produced. 


NEPA also requires us to discover and address concerns the public may have about proposals. We call this ``scoping''.
The main goal of the scoping process is to focus the analysis in the EA on the important environmental issues, and to
separate these from issues that are insignificant and do not require detailed study. Although the scoping of the original
project has already been completed, we are now asking for any additional comments only on the relocated or new portions
of the project as currently proposed. Local scoping meetings have already been conducted for the original project.
Additional scoping meetings are not anticipated. 


The EA will discuss impacts that could occur as a result of the construction and operation of the proposed projects
under these general subject headings: 



 Geology and paleontology.
 Endangered and threatened species.
 Visual resources.
 Water resources.
 Vegetation.
 Land use.
 Air quality and noise.
 Wetland and riparian habitat.
 Cultural resources.
 Fish and wildlife.
 Socioeconomics.
 Soils.


We will also evaluate possible alternatives to the project, or portions of the project, and make recommendations
on how to lessen or avoid impacts on the various resource areas. 


Our independent analysis of the issues will result in the publication of the EA which will be mailed to Federal, state,
and local agencies, public interest groups, interested individuals, affected landowners, newspapers, libraries,
and the Commission's official service list for these proceedings. 




Public Participation 




You can make a difference by sending a letter with your specific comments or concerns about the projects. You should
focus on the potential environmental effects of the new portions of the proposal (see Table 1). You do not need to re-submit
comments if you have already done so in this proceeding. We are particularly interested in alternatives to the proposals
(including alternative routes), and measures to avoid or lessen environmental impact. The more specific your comments,
the more useful they will be. Please follow the instructions below to ensure that your comments are received and properly
recorded: 


 Address your letter to: Lois Cashell, Secretary, 
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 
825 North Capitol St., NE., 
Washington, DC 20426; 
 Reference Docket No. CP93-618-001; 
 Send a copy of your letter to: 
Ms. Alisa Lykens, Project Manager, 
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 
825 North Capitol St., NE., Room 7312 
Washington, DC 20426; and 

 Mail your comments so they will be received in Washington DC on or before July 28, 1994. 



Becoming an Intervenor 



In addition to involvement in the EA scoping process, you may want to become an official party to the proceedings or
an ``intervenor''. Among other things, intervenors have the right to receive copies of case-related Commission
documents and filings by other intervenors. Likewise, each intervenor must provide copies of its filings to all other
parties. If you want to become an intervenor you must file a Motion to Intervene according to Rule 214 of the Commission's
Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.214) which is attached as appendix 1
. You do not need intervenor status to have your scoping comments considered. 




Environmental Mailing List 



If you don't want to send comments at this time but still want to receive a copy of the EA, please return the Information
Request (appendix 2)
. If you have previously returned the Information Request you need not do so again. 





Additional information about the proposed project is available from Ms. Alisa Lykens, EA Project Manager, at (202)
208-0766.

<DOCTITLE>Tuscarora Gas Transmission Co.; Supplemental Notice of Intent To Prepare an Environmental Impact Report/Environmental
Impact Statement </DOCTITLE>
for the Tuscarora Pipeline Project 



June 22, 1994.



On November 17, 1993 the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC or Commission) issued a Notice of Intent to Prepare
a Joint Draft Environmental Impact Report/Environmental Impact Statement (EIR/EIS) with the California State
Lands Commission (SLC) for the above proposed Tuscarora Pipeline Project and a related project proposed by Pacific
Gas Transmission Company in Docket CP93-618-000 (PGT Expansion II Project). The purpose of the Notice
was to request comments on environmental issues. On May 31, 1994, PGT filed an amendment to its original application.
In a June 8, 1994 response to an FERC staff data request, PGT confirmed that no expansion of its mainline facilities
is required to provide service to the Tuscarora Pipeline Project. 


Prior to this amendment, the Tuscarora Pipeline and the PGT Expansion II Projects were being processed concurrently
because of the inclusion in Docket No. CP93-618-000 of additional system compression and three meter
runs at Malin needed to deliver gas to the Tuscarora Pipeline Project. However, PGT's proposed amendment to eliminate
the compression and their proposal to build the meter runs under separate authority make the Tuscarora Pipeline Project
a stand-alone proposal which can be considered separately from the PGT Expansion II Project. 


Based on the above changes, we are proceeding with the joint EIR/EIS with the SLC for the Tuscarora Pipeline Project.
The three meter runs at Malin will still be addressed as a related facility in the joint EIR/EIS. 



Public Participation and Scoping 




NEPA also requires us to discover and address concerns the public may have about proposals. We call this ``scoping''.
The main goal of the scoping process is to focus the analysis in the EIR/EIS on the important environmental issues,
and to separate these from issues that are insignificant and do not require detailed study. Since scoping of the original
project has already been completed, and no new facilities are being proposed, we are not seeking additional comments.
Local scoping meetings have already been conducted for the original project. Additional scoping meetings are not
anticipated. The purpose of this notice is to inform you that the PGT compression facilities are no longer within the
scope of the joint EIR/EIS. 


Additional information about the proposed project is available from Ms. Alisa Lykens, EIR/EIS Project Manager,
at (202) 208-0766.

<DOCTITLE>TSCA Chemical Testing; Receipt of Test Data </DOCTITLE>





<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 




</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This notice announces the receipt of test data on N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP) (CAS No. 872-50-4), submitted
pursuant to a testing consent order under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA). Publication of this notice is in
compliance with section 4(d) of TSCA. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Under 40 CFR 790.60, all TSCA section 4 consent orders must contain a statement that results of testing conducted pursuant
to these testing consent orders will be announced to the public in accordance with section 4(d).



I. Test Data Submissions



Test data for NMP were submitted by the NMP Producers Group, on behalf of the test sponsors and pursuant to a testing
consent order at 40 CFR 799.5000. They were received by EPA on May 24, 1994. The submissions describe the subchronic
oral toxicity 28-day feeding study in rats and a repeated dose toxicity study in B6C3F1 Mice: Administration in the
diet for 4 weeks (range finding study) with NMP. This chemical is an inert, stable, polar solvent that is used in a wide
variety of processes. Its commercial uses result from its strong and frequently selective solvent power. One of the
major uses of NMP is the extraction of aromatics from lubricating oils. It is also used as a medium for polymerization
and as a solvent for finished polymer. It is the preferred solvent in a variety of chemical reactions and the manufacture
of numerous chemical intermediates and end products such as plastics, surface coatings, and pesticides. An important
new use of this chemical is as a substitute for methylene chloride in paint strippers. NMP is also used in the recovery
and purification of acetylene, olefin, and diolefins, in the removal of sulfur compounds from natural and refinery
gases, and in the dehydration of natural gas. 
EPA has initiated its review and evaluation process for these data submissions. At this time, the Agency is unable
to provide any determination as to the completeness of the submissions. 




II. Public Record



EPA has established a public record for this TSCA section 4(d) receipt of data notice (docket number OPPTS-44610).
This record includes copies of all studies reported in this notice. The record is available for inspection from 12
noon to 4 p.m., Monday through Friday, except legal holidays, in the TSCA Public Docket Office, Rm. B-607 Northeast
Mall, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460.

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This is a notice of the Presidential declaration of a major disaster for the District of Columbia (FEMA-1030-DR),
dated June 17, 1994, and related determinations.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Notice is hereby given that, in a letter dated June 17, 1994, the President declared a major disaster under the authority
of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5121 

et seq.

), as follows:




I have determined that the damage in certain areas of the District of Columbia, resulting from a severe winter ice storm
on January 17-21, 1994, is of sufficient severity and magnitude to warrant a major disaster declaration under
the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (``the Stafford Act''). I, therefore, declare
that such a major disaster exists in the District of Columbia.

In order to provide Federal assistance, you are hereby authorized to allocate from funds available for these purposes,
such amounts as you find necessary for Federal disaster assistance and administrative expenses.

You are authorized to provide Public Assistance in the designated area. Consistent with the requirement that Federal
assistance be supplemental, any Federal funds provided under the Stafford Act for Public Assistance will be limited
to 75 percent of the total eligible costs.




The time period prescribed for the implementation of section 310(a), Priority to Certain Applications for Public
Facility and Public Housing Assistance, 42 U.S.C. 5153, shall be for a period not to exceed six months after the date
of this declaration.

Notice is hereby given that pursuant to the authority vested in the Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency
under Executive Order 12148, I hereby appoint Robert J. Gunter of the Federal Emergency Management Agency to act as
the Federal Coordinating Officer for this declared disaster.

I do hereby determine the following areas of the District to have been affected adversely by this declared major disaster:

Spark International Trading, Inc. v. Danzas Corporation, Nordstar Line, S.A. and Great Eastern Shipping, Inc.;
Filing of Complaint and Assignment 



Notice is given that a complaint filed by Spark International Trading, Inc. (``Complainant'') against Danzas Corporation
(``Danzas''), Nordstar Line, S.A. (``Nordstar'') and Great Eastern Shipping, Inc. (``Great Eastern'') was served
June 22, 1994. Complainant alleges that: (1) Respondents Danzas violated section 10(d)(1) of the Shipping Act 1984
(``the Act''), 46 U.S.C. app. 1709(d)(1), 

inter alia,

 by holding itself out as an ocean common carrier and an ocean freight forwarder for the transportation of Complainant's
cargo from Baltimore to St. Petersburg, Russia, failing to provide such transportation, having no intention of ever
providing such transportation, failing to use reasonable care in selecting Nordstar/Great Eastern, alleged non-vessel
operating common carriers, to arrange such transportation, failing to verify that Nordstar/Great Eastern had filed
the agreed upon rate, and failing to take necessary steps to arrange and supervise the transport and timely delivery
of complainant's cargo; and (2) Respondents Nordstar and Great Eastern violated sections 10(b)(1) and (5) and 10(d)(1)
of the Act, 46 U.S.C. app. 1709(b)(1) and (5) and (d)(1), by failing to take steps reasonably necessary to arranging
and supervising the transport and timely delivery of Complainant's cargo, holding cargo pending payment of new,
higher freight charges not shown in Nordstar's tariff, and retaliating Complainant by demanding a higher than agreed
upon rate because Complainant sought the assistance of legal counsel. 

This proceeding has been assigned to the office of Administrative Law Judges. Hearing in this matter, if any is held,
shall commence within the time limitations prescribed in 46 CFR 502.61, and only after consideration has been given
by the parties and the presiding officer to the use of alternative forms of dispute resolution. The hearing shall include
oral testimony and cross-examination in the discretion of the presiding officer only upon proper showing that there
are genuine issues of material fact that cannot be resolved on the basis of sworn statements, affidavits, depositions,
or other documents or that the nature of the matter in issue is such that an oral hearing and cross-examination are necessary
for the development of an adequate record. Pursuant to the further terms of 46 CFR 502.61, the initial decision of the
presiding officer in this proceeding shall be issued by June 22, 1995, and the final decision of the Commission shall
be issued by October 20, 1995.

<DOCTITLE>Idaho National Engineering Laboratory Environmental Dose Reconstruction Project: Public Meeting</DOCTITLE>



The National Center for Environmental Health (NCEH), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), announces
the following meeting.




Name: Idaho National Engineering Laboratory Environmental Dose Reconstruction Project.

Time and Date: 10 a.m.-3 p.m., July 13, 1994.

Place: Weston Plaza Hotel and Convention Center, 1350 North Blue Lakes Boulevard, Twin Falls, Idaho 83301.

Status: Open to the public for observation and comment, limited only by space available.

Purpose: Under a Memorandum of Understanding with the Department of Energy (DOE), the Department of Health and Human
Services (HHS) has been given the responsibility and resources for conducting analytic epidemiologic investigations
of residents of communities in the vicinity of DOE facilities and other persons potentially exposed to radiation
or to potential hazards from non-nuclear energy production and use. HHS delegated program responsibility to CDC.

An initial step in an analytic epidemiologic study for persons living off site of a given DOE facility is the reconstruction
of radiation doses due to releases from that facility. CDC has begun such an environmental dose reconstruction for
DOE's Idaho National Engineering Laboratory near Idaho Falls, Idaho. A contractor, Sanford Cohen and Associate
(SC&A), is gathering the data necessary to perform the dose reconstruction and to provide for logistics of public
involvement in this project. The purpose of this public meeting is: SC&A will discuss project progress and responses
to public concerns. Members of the public will be asked to provide individual input on technical issues and decisions
faced by SC&A's project team.

Agenda items are subject to change as priorities dictate.

Contact Person for More Information: Leeann Denham, Radiation Studies Branch, Division of Environmental Hazards
and Health Effects, NCEH, CDC, 4770 Buford Highway NE., (F-35), Atlanta, Georgia, 30341-3724, telephone
404/488-7040.

Miles, Inc., et al.; Withdrawal of Approval of NADA's


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Food and Drug Administration, HHS.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is withdrawing approval of two new animal drug applications (NADA's). One
NADA is held by Miles, Inc., and provides for use of febantel-trichlorfon paste as an equine anthelmintic and boticide.
The other NADA is held by Nutra-Blend Corp. and provides for use of a tylosin concentrate to manufacture a Type A medicated
article and Type B medicated feeds. In a final rule published elsewhere in this issue of the 

Federal Register

, FDA is amending the regulations by removing the entries which reflect approval of the NADA's.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Miles, Inc., Agriculture Division, Animal Health Products, P.O. Box 390, Shawnee Mission, KS 66201, is the sponsor
of NADA 131-412 that provides for use of Combotel/Negabot-Plus (febantel-trichlorfon) Paste in horses as
an anthelmintic and boticide. In a letter dated December 20, 1993, Miles, Inc., requested that FDA withdraw approval
of NADA 131-412 because it no longer manufactures or distributes the product.


Nutra-Blend Corp., P.O. Box 485, Neosho, MO 64850, is the sponsor of NADA 122-158 that provides for the manufacture
of Type B medicated feeds containing 4, 5, 10, and 20 grams per pound (g/lb) of tylosin and a Type A medicated article
containing 40 g/lb of tylosin. Currently, Nutra-Blend Corp. is purchasing the 40-gram-per-pound article to manufacture
the 10-gram-per-pound feed. Because this arrangement no longer requires that Nutra-Blend Corp. hold an approved
NADA, the firm requested in its letter of December 15, 1993, that FDA withdraw approval of NADA 122-158.
Therefore, under authority delegated to the Commissioner of Food and Drugs (21 CFR 5.10) and redelegated to the Center
for Veterinary Medicine (21 CFR 5.84), and in accordance with  514.115 

Withdrawal of approval of applications

 (21 CFR 514.115), notice is given that approval of NADA's 122-158 and 131-412, and all supplements and
amendments thereto is hereby withdrawn, effective July 8, 1994.
In a final rule published elsewhere in this issue of the 

Federal Register

, FDA is removing 21 CFR 520.903c and amending 21 CFR 558.625 to reflect the withdrawal of approval of these NADA's.

<DOCTITLE>Estrogen Drug Product Labeling; Labeling Guidance Texts; Availability</DOCTITLE>


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Food and Drug Administration, HHS.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is announcing the availability of informal labeling guidance texts for professional
and patient labeling for estrogen drug products that were last revised in 1992. The texts provide information to assist
manufacturers and other persons in preparing supplemental applications to meet labeling requirements. The revisions
reflect updated scientific information. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

FDA is announcing the availability of the 1992 revised informal labeling guidance texts for professional and patient
labeling for estrogen drug products. The 1992 revisions reflect updated scientific information, particularly
pertaining to the relationship between estrogen replacement therapy and reduction of cardiovascular risk. Although,
the agency has distributed copies of the 1992 labeling guidance on a case-by-case basis, it is announcing its availability
now to ensure more widespread distribution.


Under 21 CFR 314.70(c), a holder of an approved application for a new drug is required to submit a supplemental application
to obtain approval for the following changes, among others, in the text of professional or patient labeling: to add
or strengthen contraindications, warnings, precautions, or adverse reactions, or to add or strengthen dosage and
administration instructions to increase the safe use of the product. Manufacturers and other persons can refer to
the labeling guidance texts for assistance in preparing supplemental applications to meet the labeling requirements
of 21 CFR 310.515 for estrogen drug products and 21 CFR 201.56, 201.57, and 201.100 for professional labeling of prescription
drug products. In the 

Federal Register

 of May 4, 1990 (55 FR 18761), the agency announced the revocation of guideline texts of professional and patient labeling
for estrogen drug products. The agency determined that the time period to finalize and announce revised guidelines
prevented the agency from providing the most current medical information to manufacturers and others. Therefore,
in place of guidelines, the agency announced that it would provide assistance in meeting labeling requirements in
the form of informal labeling guidance texts. 
Labeling guidance texts are informal documents. They do not bind or otherwise obligate the agency or a person referring
to them and are not formal agency opinions. The agency does not require manufacturers printing professional and patient
package inserts to follow the labeling guidance texts. Manufacturers and others are free to use an alternative or
modified approach, although they are encouraged to consult with the Division of Metabolism and Endocrine Drug Products
(address above) before drafting alternative labeling so that any differences can be resolved prior to the submission
of a supplemental application, if such an application is required under 21 CFR 314.70. 
Interested persons may submit written comments concerning the informal labeling guidance texts to the Dockets Management
Branch (address above). Two copies of any comments are to be submitted, except that individuals may submit one copy.
Comments are to be identified with the docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document. Received comments
may be seen in the office above between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.

<DOCTITLE>Availability of an Environmental Assessment and Receipt of an Application for an Incidental Take Permit for a Residential
Development in Brevard County, FL. </DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Fish and Wildlife Service, Interior.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 O.C. Mendes, owner of Balmoral Subdivision (Applicant), is seeking an incidental take permit from the Fish and Wildlife
Service (Service) pursuant to Section 10(a)(1)(B) of the Endangered Species Act (Act). The proposed permit would
authorize for a period of 2 years, the incidental take of a threatened species, the Florida scrub jay, 

Aphelocoma coerulescens coerulescens, 

incidental to construction of Balmoral subdivision, a development consisting of 5 single family residences and
necessary infrastructure on approximately 4.05 acres (Project). The Project is located along State Road A1A south
of the city of Melbourne, in the Coconut Point area of Brevard County, Florida. 



The Service also announces the availability of an environmental assessment (EA) and habitat conservation plan (HCP)
for the incidental take application. Copies of the EA or HCP may be obtained by making a request to the Regional Office
address below. This notice also advises the public that the Service has made a preliminary determination that issuing
the incidental take permit is not a major Federal action significantly affecting 
the quality of the human environment within the meaning of Section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy
Act of 1969, as amended. The Finding of No Significant Impact is based on information contained in the EA and HCP. The
final determination will be made no sooner than 30 days from the 
date of this notice. This notice is provided pursuant to 
Section 10(c) of the Act and National Environmental Policy Act Regulations (40 CFR 1506.6).

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

Aphelocoma coerulescens coerulescens

 is geographically isolated from other subspecies of scrub jays found in Mexico and the Western United States. The
scrub jay is found almost exclusively in peninsular Florida and is restricted to scrub habitat. The total estimated
population is between 7,000 and 11,000 individuals. Due to habitat loss and degradation throughout the State of Florida,
it has been estimated that the scrub jay population has been reduced by at least half in the last 100 years. 


The scrub jay survey provided by the Applicant indicates that one family currently uses the site and surrounding suitable
habitat areas. The Applicant proposes to impact a portion of the territory of this family. Initial construction of
roads and utilities and subsequent development of individual homesites may therefore result in death of, or injury
to, scrub jays incidental to the carrying out of these otherwise lawful activities. Habitat alteration associated
with property development may reduce the availability of feeding, shelter, and nesting habitat. 

To minimize and mitigate the impacts of the loss of 1.35 acres of scrub jay habitat, the Applicant will purchase 3.0
acres of scrub habitat known to support the scrub jay, deed the property to Brevard County, and provide a management
endowment of $3,000 to ensure management of the site in perpetuity. Other measures proposed by the Applicant include
siting of individual building footprints to minimize additional scrub habitat alteration, and protection of active
nests, if discovered, during the nesting season. 

The EA considers the environmental consequences of three alternatives, including acceptance of the HCP as submitted,
consideration of management of surrounding publicly-owned lands as mitigation in lieu of offsite purchase, and
no action.

 Notice.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Brandon Capital Corporation (Applicant) is seeking an incidental take permit from the Fish and Wildlife Service
(Service) pursuant to Section 10(a)(1)(B) of the Endangered Species Act (Act). The proposed permit would authorize
for a period of 2 years, the incidental take of a threatened species, the Florida scrub jay, 

Aphelocoma coerulescens coerulescens, 

incidental to construction of the Villages of Tramore, consisting of 20 patio homes and associated infrastructure
on 3.78 acres (Project). The Project is located along State Road A1A south of the city of Melbourne, in the Coconut Point
area of Brevard County, Florida. 


The Service also announces the availability of an environmental assessment (EA) and habitat conservation plan (HCP)
for the incidental take application. Copies of the EA or HCP may be obtained by making a request to the Regional Office
address below. This notice also advises the public that the Service 
has made a preliminary determination that issuing the incidental take permit is not a major Federal action significantly
affecting the quality of the human environment within the meaning of Section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental
Policy Act of 1969, as amended. The Finding of No Significant Impact is 
based on information contained in the EA and HCP. The final determination will be made no sooner than 30 days from the

date of this notice. This notice is provided pursuant to 
Section 10(c) of the Act and National Environmental Policy Act Regulations (40 CFR 1506.6). 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Aphelocoma coerulescens coerulescens 

is geographically isolated from other subspecies of scrub jays found in Mexico and the Western United States. The
scrub jay is found almost exclusively in peninsular Florida and is restricted to scrub habitat. The total estimated
population is between 
7,000 and 11,000 individuals. Due to habitat loss and degradation throughout the State of Florida, it has been estimated
that the scrub jay population has been reduced by at least half in the last 100 years. 


The scrub jay survey provided by the Applicant indicates that one family currently uses the site and surrounding suitable
habitat areas. The Applicant proposes to impact a portion of this family's territory. Initial construction of roads
and utilities and subsequent development of individual homesites may therefore result in death of, or injury to,
scrub jays incidental to the carrying out of these otherwise lawful activities. Habitat alteration associated with
property development may reduce the availability of feeding, shelter, and nesting habitat. 
To minimize and mitigate the impacts of the loss of 3.78 acres of scrub jay habitat, the Applicant will purchase 7.0
acres of scrub habitat known to support the scrub jay, deed the property to Brevard County, and provide a management
endowment of $7,500 to ensure management of the site in perpetuity. Other measures proposed by the Applicant include
siting of individual building footprints to minimize additional scrub habitat alteration, and protection of active
nests, if discovered, during the nesting season. 
The EA considers the environmental consequences of three alternatives, including acceptance of the HCP as submitted,
consideration of management of surrounding publicly-owned lands as mitigation in lieu of offsite purchase, and
no action.

<DOCTITLE>Burro Management Plan, Lake Mead National Recreation Area; Notice of Availability of Draft Environmental Impact
Statement </DOCTITLE>


Summary: 

Pursuant to Section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (P.L. 91-90 as amended), the
National Park Service, Department of the Interior, has prepared a draft environmental impact statement (DEIS) assessing
the potential impacts of the proposed Burro Management Plan for Lake Mead National Recreation Area (NRA), Mohave
County, Arizona, and Clark County, Nevada. Once approved, the plan will guide the management of burros within the
NRA over the next several years. 


The proposed action, designated in the DEIS as 

Alternative B: Resource Based Management, 

would establish burro-free areas within designated areas of the NRA and accommodate a certain amount of burro use
in other areas. Burro use would not be permitted to expand to new areas and the animals would be removed from areas where
they pose a resource threat or public safety hazard. 
Four alternatives are evaluated in the DEIS, including 

No Action/Status Quo, No Management of Burros, Managing a Population of Burros for Perpetuity, and Total Removal
of All Burros. 



<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Written comments on the draft burro management plan and DEIS should be directed to the Superintendent, Lake Mead NRA,
601 Nevada Highway, Boulder City, NV 89005. Comments will be accepted until August 31, 1994. 


Inquiries on the draft burro management plan and DEIS and requests for copies of the draft plan should be directed to
Lake Mead NRA at the address given above, or by telephone at (702) 293-8949. Copies of the plan will be available
for public inspection at the NRA and at area libraries.

ACTION: 

Notice of Finding of No Significant Impact.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

Based on an environmental assessment prepared by Quisto Energy Corporation (Quisto) to construct, operate, and
maintain a gas well located on the Main Floodway of the Lower Rio Grande Flood Control Project (LRGFCP), the United
States Section, International Boundary and Water Commission, United States and Mexico (USIBWC) finds that the proposed
action to issue a license to Quisto for such works is not a major federal action that would have a significant adverse
effect on the quality of the human environment. Therefore, pursuant to section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental
Policy Act of 1969; the Council on Environmental Quality Final Regulations (40 CFR parts 1500 through 1508); and the
U.S. Section's Operational Procedures for Implementing Section 102 of NEPA, published in the 

Federal Register

 September 2, 1981 (46 FR 44083-44094); the USIBWC hereby gives notice that an environmental impact statement
will not be prepared for the proposed action.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 



Proposed Action



The action proposed is for the USIBWC to issue a license to Quisto to construct, operate, and maintain a gas well and
install related features within Meyerhoff No. 3 Drilling Unit, Lot 271, Kelly-Pharr Subdivision, Hidalgo County,
Texas. The gas well is proposed to be located on privately owned land within the Main Floodway of the USIBWC LRGFCP approximately
8 kilometers (5 miles) southeast of the town of Pharr. Access to the drilling site is by way of existing county and private
roads.



Alternatives Considered



Three alternatives were considered in the Environmental Assessment (EA):

The Proposed Action Alternative is for Quisto to construct, operate, and maintain a gas well in a cultivated field
within the Main Floodway of the USIBWC LRGFCP. This proposed action will require the USIBWC to issue a license to ensure
that such works do not cause an obstruction to flood flows within the floodway or interfere with the operation and maintenance
of the LRGFCP.

The No Action Alternative is for Quisto to not construct, operate, and maintain a gas well within the Main Floodway
of the LRGFCP. The no action alternative will not require the USIBWC to issue a license since no work will be done within
the LRGFCP. The no action alternative will result in the denial of access to the mineral owner to rightfully owned minerals,
loss of tax revenues to the State of Texas, and result in an unrecoverable clean energy source.

The Directional Well Alternative is for Quisto to drill a well from outside the Main Floodway to a depth below the proposed
surface location. The directional well alternative will not require the USIBWC to issue a license since no work will
be done within the LRGFCP. The directional well alternative is considered not workable because of a lack of an available
surface drillsite outside the Main Floodway and technical problems associated with a bottomhole location some 610
meters (2,000 feet) or more from the surface location.

Environmental Assessment




The USIBWC received on June 3, 1994, from Quisto a completed Environmental Assessment (EA) for the proposed gas well
and related features. The EA is currently available for review and comment.




Finding of the Environmental Assessment





The EA finds that the proposed action for Quisto to construct, operate, and maintain a gas well within the Main Floodway
of the USIBWC LRGRCP (and the USIBWC to issue a license for such work) does not constitute a major federal action which
would cause a significant local, regional, or national adverse impact on the environment based on the following facts:




1. The United States Army Corps of Engineers has determined that no waters of the United States including wetlands
will be impacted by the proposed gas well and related features.


2. The United States Fish and Wildlife Service has determined that federally listed endangered or threatened species
are unlikely to be adversely affected by the proposed gas well and related features.


3. The Texas Historical Commission and Department of Antiquities Protection have determined that no survey is required
and the project may proceed.




4. The USIBWC Water Resources Investigations Division has determined that the proposed gas well and related features
will have no significant effect upon the flood carrying capacity of the Main Floodway.


On the basis of the Quisto EA, the USIBWC has determined that an environmental impact statement is not required for
the issuance of a license to Quisto to construct, operate, and maintain a gas well and install related features within
the Main Floodway of the USIBWC LRGFCP and hereby provides notice of finding of no significant impact (FONSI). An environmental
impact statement will not be prepared unless additional information which may affect this decision is brought to
our attention within thirty (30) days of the date of this Notice. A limited number of copies of the EA and FONSI are available
to fill single copy requests at the above address.

Apache International Division of Apache Corporation Houston, TX; Negative Determination Regarding Application
for Reconsideration


By an application dated May 26, 1994, one of the petitioners requested administrative reconsideration of the subject
petition for trade adjustment assistance. The denial notice was signed on May 18, 1994 and published in the 

Federal Register

 on June 1, 1994 (59 FR 28428).
Pursuant to 29 CFR 90.18(c) reconsideration may be granted under the following circumstances:
(1) If it appears on the basis of facts not previously considered that the determination complained of was erroneous;
(2) If it appears that the determination complained of was based on a mistake in the determination of facts not previously
considered; or
(3) If in the opinion of the Certifying Officer, a misinterpretation of facts or of the law justified reconsideration
of the decision.
The Department's denial was based on the fact that Apache Corporation, the parent company, acquired another company
resulting in some of Apache International's responsibilities being transferred to the parent company's new subsidiary.
Also, the decreased sales or production requirement of the Group Eligibility Requirements of the Trade Act was not
met. Corporate-wide sales of crude oil and natural gas at Apache International increased in 1993 compared to 1992.
The petitioner states that Apache purchased another company (Hadson Energy in Perth, Australia) in 1993 and had it
not been for the addition of Hadson's sales, the workers would have met the decreased sales criterion. The petitioner
also states that jobs were shifted offshore.
The findings show that Apache International has no domestic operations but is responsible for a portion of Apache
Corporation's exploration and production outside of the United States. The remaining portion of the company's international
operations are performed by the newly acquired firm_Hadson Energy Limited, headquartered in Perth, Australia.
Following the Hadson acquisition, some of Apache International's responsibilities were transferred to Hadson
Energy causing some worker separations in the United States.
Other findings show that Apache International's operation is for the export market and as such would not form a basis
for a worker group certification. U.S. imports of crude oil would not affect Apache's sales in a foreign market.
Also, the elimination of domestic jobs because of corporate changes in the export market would not provide a basis
for a worker group certification.


Conclusion


After review of the application and investigative findings, I conclude that there has been no error or misinterpretation
of the law or of the facts which would justify reconsideration of the Department of Labor's prior decision. According,
the application is denied.

Control Techniques (USA) Inc. (E.C.S.) Fairmont, WV; Negative Determination Regarding Application for Reconsideration





By an application dated April 18, 1994, Local #702 of the International Union of Electrical Workers (IUE) requested
administrative reconsideration of the subject petition for trade adjustment assistance. The denial notice was
signed on March 23, 1994 and published in the 

Federal Register

 on April 7, 1994 (59 FR 16663).


Pursuant to 29 CFR 90.18(c) reconsideration may be granted under the following circumstances:

(1) If it appears on the basis of facts not previously considered that the determination complained of was erroneous;

(2) if it appears that the determination complained of was based on a mistake in the determination of facts not previously
considered; or

(3) if in the opinion of the Certifying Officer, a misinterpretation of facts or of the law justified reconsideration
of the decision.


Investigation findings show that the workers produced electronic control equipment. The subject firm was known
as Electronic Control Systems, Inc., (ECS) until it was purchased by Control Techniques Worldwide, a British firm,
on February 14, 1991.


The Department's denial was based on the fact that the ``contributed importantly'' test of the Group Eligibility
Requirements of the Trade Act was not met. After the purchase in February 1991, Control Techniques Worldwide, the
parent company, began to consolidate all of Fairmont's production to other domestic locations. The major portion
of layoffs occurred in 1991. Layoffs prior to November 16, 1992 cannot be considered under this petition since Section
223(b)(1) of the Trade Act does not permit the certification of workers prior to one year of the date of the petition.

The union states that components and instruments from the U.K. replaced products produced at Fairmont. The union
also states that parts originally made at ECS began to be prefabricated in Mexico. 


Investigation findings show that no production at Fairmont was displaced by foreign production since Control Techniques
Worldwide purchased ECS in 1991. Some SCR power paks, however, were brought over from the U.K. but they were not sold.
The power paks from the U.K. were found to be inadequate for the U.S. market and were returned.




Conclusion




After review of the application and investigative findings, I conclude that there has been no error or misinterpretation
of the law or of the facts which would justify reconsideration of the Department of Labor's prior decision. Accordingly,
the application is denied.

<DOCTITLE>Western Geophysical Company a/k/a Halliburton Company, Houston, TX; </DOCTITLE>
Amended Certification Regarding Eligibility To Apply for Worker Adjustment Assistance


In accordance with Section 223 of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 USC 2273) the Department of Labor issued a Notice of Certification
Regarding Eligibility to Apply for Worker Adjustment Assistance on May 31, 1994. The notice will soon be published
in the 

Federal Register.
At the request of some of the workers and the company, the Department reviewed the certification for workers of the
subject firm. The investigation findings show that Western Geophysical Company purchased the Geophysical Services
Division of the Halliburton Company in January 1994 whose workers were certified for TAA under an earlier certification,
TA-W-27, 776. As a result, some of the former Halliburton workers laid off from Western Geophysical do
not have the required 26 weeks to meet their personal eligibility requirement. Accordingly, the Department is amending
the subject certification to show that Western Geophysical is a successor-in-interest firm to Halliburton Geophysical
Services.
The amendment notice applicable to TA-W-29, 802 is hereby issued as follows:



``All workers of Western Geophysical Company, Houston, Texas, the successor-in-interest firm to Halliburton Geophysical
Services, Houston, Texas, engaged in seismic activities related to oil and gas exploration who became totally or
partially separated from employment on or after April 25, 1993 are eligible to apply for adjustment assistance under
Section 223 of the Trade Act of 1974.''

<DOCTITLE>Records Schedules; Availability and Request for Comments</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

National Archives and Records Administration, Office of Records Administration.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of availability of proposed records schedules; request for comments.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The National Archives and records Administration (NARA) publishes notice at lest once monthly of certain Federal
Agency requests for records disposition authority (records schedules). Records schedules identify records of
sufficient value to warrant preservation in the National Archives of the United States. Schedules also authorize
agencies after a specified period to dispose of records lacking administrative, legal, research, or other value.
Notice is published for records schedules that (1) propose the destruction of records not previously authorized
for disposal, or (2) reduce the retention period for records already authorized for disposal. NARA invites public
comments on such schedules, as required by 44 U.S.C. 3303a(a).



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Each year U.S. Government agencies create billions of records on paper, film, magnetic tape, and other media. In order
to control this accumulation, agency records managers prepare records schedules specifying when the agency no longer
needs the records and what happens to the records after this period. Some schedules are comprehensive and cover all
the records of an agency or one of its major subdivisions. These comprehensive schedules provide for the eventual
transfer to the National Archives of historically valuable records and authorize the disposal of all other records.
Most schedules, however, cover records of only one office or program or a few series of records, and many are updates
of previously approved schedules. Such schedules also may include records that are designated for permanent retention.




Destruction of records requires the approval of the Archivist of the United States. This approval is granted after
a thorough study of the records that takes into account their administrative use by the agency of origin, the rights
of the Government and of private persons directly affected by the Government's activities, and historical or other
value.



This public notice identifies the Federal agencies and their subdivisions requesting disposition authority, includes
the control number assigned to each schedule, and briefly describes the records proposed for disposal. The records
schedule contains additional information about the records and their disposition. Further information about the
disposition process will be furnished to each requester.

<DOCTITLE>Investigator Financial Disclosure Policy </DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 National Science Foundation.

 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of changes to award conditions and proposal content.


 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The National Science Foundation (NSF) is issuing revised award conditions and revised requirements for proposal
submission in order to require that institutions maintain written and enforced policies on investigator conflicts
of interest. 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Paperwork Reduction Act Control Number 3145-0149 


NSF favors and has actively encouraged increased involvement of academic researchers and educators with industry
and with private entrepreneurial ventures. However, such involvements create an increased risk of conflict between
the private interests of individuals, or of the companies with which they are involved, and the public interest that
NSF funding should serve. These risks have aroused concern in the scientific and engineering communities, in the
public media, in Congress, and at NSF. 

In response to this concern, NSF developed a proposed Investigator Financial Disclosure Policy requiring financial
disclosure by investigators and professional employees at grantee institutions who are involved in NSF-funded
research and educational activities. On July 16, 1992, NSF published its proposed Policy in the 

Federal Register

, and invited public comment. 57 FR 31540 (July 16, 1992). NSF received seventy-two written comments from universities,
research institutions and various associations. The primary issues raised by commenters, and NSF's responses,
are described below. 


Comments 
Uniform Federal Policy 


Most commenters recommended either that the Federal Government adopt a uniform, government-wide investigator
conflicts policy with a single point of contact for conflict of interest and financial disclosure issues, or that
NSF coordinate with other agencies to ensure that agency policies are consistent. 
NSF agrees that a uniform, government-wide approach to the conflicts issue is advisable_it would eliminate the possibility
of inconsistent agency policies, and reduce the bureaucratic burdens associated with compliance with different
conflicts policies. NSF has been working closely with the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to ensure
that this Policy and the proposed rule issued by HHS in this edition of the 

Federal Register

 will be consistent, and will impose the same obligations on grantees. In addition, NSF has been working with the Office
of Science and Technology Policy, the Office of Management and Budget, HHS and other interested agencies to develop
and propose a common Federal policy on investigator conflicts of interest. It is expected that this policy, when completed,
will ensure consistent treatment of investigator conflicts issues at all Federal funding agencies. 


Financial Disclosure to NSF 


The proposed Investigator Financial Disclosure Policy required grant applicants to disclose to NSF the significant
financial ties their investigators have with parties whose financial interests might be affected by the work to be
funded. It also required applicants to describe the measures, if any, that would be taken to minimize the risks associated
with actual or potential conflicts of interest. 
Most commenters felt that universities and research institutions, and not NSF, should have primary responsibility
for collecting and reviewing investigator financial information, and for managing conflicts. They objected to
the requirement that each grant proposal be accompanied by financial disclosures, and offered a variety of reasons
for doing so. These included privacy concerns; a belief that NSF's review of financial disclosures would be inconsistent
with an emphasis on institutional responsibility; a belief that the requirement imposed an unjustified paperwork
and staff burden on institutions; and a concern that this disclosure requirement could have a chilling effect on university-industry
collaborations and on the submission of grant proposals. 
As an alternative, some commenters suggested that NSF require institutional certifications that appropriate policies
and procedures had been implemented, and that actual or potential conflicts were resolved to the satisfaction of
the institution. NSF could then conduct periodic reviews of grantee financial disclosure/conflict of interest
records to assure itself that institutions had complied with NSF's minimum requirements. Some commenters also suggested
that financial disclosure to NSF would be appropriate if institutions are unable to satisfactorily resolve conflicts
issues that they identify. 
NSF recognizes the fact that many institutions and investigators are concerned about the possible ramifications
of providing financial information to NSF. While NSF does not necessarily agree with all of the conclusions reached
by those institutions and investigators, the final Policy has been revised so that disclosure to NSF is not required
unless institutions find that they are unable to satisfactorily resolve a conflict issue. Instead, NSF's final Policy
requires an institutional representative to certify with each grant proposal that the required conflict of interest
policy has been implemented; that, to the best of his or her knowledge, all required financial disclosures were made;
and that there are no actual or potential conflicts of interest, or, if such conflicts exist, they were, or prior to
funding of the award, they will be managed in a manner satisfactory to the institution or disclosed to NSF. Individual
investigators also must certify that each has read and understood the institution's conflict of interest policy;
to the best of his/her knowledge, all financial disclosures required by the institution's policy were made; and he/she
will comply with any conditions or restrictions imposed by the institution to manage actual or potential conflicts
of interest. 
The final Policy also requires that institutions maintain records of financial disclosures, and records relating
to the management of actual and potential conflicts of interest, until three years after the later of the termination
or completion of the award to which they relate, or the resolution of any government action involving the records.
NSF may undertake periodic reviews of the records in order to assess the reliability of institutional and investigator
certifications, and to determine whether institutional safeguards do, in fact, protect the integrity of NSF-funded
research. In undertaking any such reviews, NSF will coordinate with HHS, to the extent feasible, to ensure that institutions
are not unnecessarily subjected to multi-agency reviews.

Timing of Disclosure 


Several commenters questioned the proposed Policy's timing for required financial disclosures. Seven believed
the required certifications and/or disclosures should be made at the time of an award, not when the proposal is submitted,
and one suggested that institutional review take place within 90 days of submission of the grant proposal to NSF. Two
commenters believed the proposed Policy required grantee institutions to collect financial disclosures on a periodic
basis, and also prior to the submission of each grant proposal. These commenters felt the two requirements might be
inconsistent. 
In order to provide the required certifications, institutions will have to collect all required disclosures and
resolve actual or potential conflicts prior to the time an award is funded. In addition, the final Policy requires
that, during the pendency of any NSF award, institutions either solicit financial disclosures on an annual basis
or require updates as investigators obtain new reportable financial interests. 


Overly General and/or Ambiguous Terms 


Some commenters were troubled by the proposed Policy's lack of definitions for various terms, including ``entrepreneurial
venture'', ``significant financial ties'', ``significant conflict of interest'', ``routine small holdings'',
``direct relevance'', ``directly and significantly'', ``immediate family'', ``close business associate'',
``adequate enforcement mechanisms'', ``professional employee'' and ``relevant consulting arrangements''.

These terms were left undefined in the proposed Policy so that institutions would be able to tailor definitions and
conflicts policies to the particular conditions existing on their campuses. This remains NSF's basic philosophy,
but the final Policy provides more guidance on the types of financial interests that must be disclosed, the types that
need not be disclosed, and the individuals who must make financial disclosures. 


Contents of Institutional Conflict of Interest Policies 


A few commenters believe institutions should establish conflict of interest policies, but that NSF should not prescribe
the details of those policies. Three suggested that NSF establish ``outcome'' or ``performance'' criteria for institutional
disclosure policies, rather than requiring disclosure of specific categories of financial interests. 
NSF agrees that institutions should have some latitude to develop policies that fit local circumstances. For this
reason, NSF's Policy requires institutions to solicit financial disclosures, but does not prohibit any particular
financial interest or mandate specific rules for managing conflicts of interest. NSF believes that its system, in
which institutions will have primary responsibility for collecting and reviewing financial disclosures, establishes
the minimum requirements necessary to protect the integrity of NSF-funded research. 


Scope of Required Disclosure 


Most commenters agree that limited and targeted financial disclosure is a cornerstone of an effective conflict of
interest policy. However, many believe the proposed Policy required more information than was necessary to effectively
manage actual and potential conflicts of interest, and some suggested that disclosure be required only where financial
ties are directly related to NSF-supported research. Two commenters from state institutions in Connecticut believe
that their local Freedom of Information Act will essentially make these disclosures public information. 
NSF has narrowed the Policy's disclosure requirements so that they now apply only to those individuals who are responsible
for the design, conduct or reporting of research or educational activities funded or proposed for funding by NSF.
In addition, the categories of disclosable financial interests have been limited to so that they now must relate to
research funded or proposed for funding by NSF.

Disclosure of Ties of Immediate Family and Close Business Associates 


Five commenters believe the Policy should not require disclosure of the financial interests of an investigator's
immediate family, and nineteen thought it should not require disclosure of the financial interests of close business
associates. These commenters cited privacy concerns, and, for close business associates, argued that it is inappropriate
to require confidential information from these individuals, it might not be possible to elicit it in any event, and
it is too difficult to determine what constitutes a close business associate. 
NSF's Policy is meant to ensure that institutions have enough information to determine whether conflicts exist,
and to impose appropriate safeguards. Clearly, financial interests of individuals other than the investigators
themselves can, under certain circumstances, affect the objectivity with which the investigators conduct their
research. This is particularly true where there is a close personal or business relationship between the investigator
and another individual. However, NSF recognizes that requiring financial disclosure from all such persons presents
certain difficulties and raises privacy concerns. NSF believes it reasonable to require disclosure of the relevant
financial ties of an investigator's spouse and dependent children, but the relationship between an investigator
and his or her ``close business associate'' is more attenuated. As a result, in light of concerns raised by commenters,
the final Policy does not require that their financial interests be disclosed. 


Miscellaneous Comments 


One state institution pointed out that its institutional conflict of interest rules must be part of the state's administrative
code, and this would require new legislation. The effective date for NSF's Policy will be one year following the date
of its publication in the 

Federal Register

. NSF hopes that this will provide institutions with sufficient time to implement required policies. 
Two commenters believe institutions do not have sufficient expertise to conduct the types of investigations necessary
to assure the reliability of investigator financial disclosure. NSF does not expect institutions to undertake herculean
efforts to verify the accuracy of all disclosures. However, institutional policies should include viable and reasonable
methods for enforcing those policies. 
Two commenters asked whether NSF's Policy applies to subrecipients of grant funds. It does not. 
One commenter asked whether the disclosure requirements apply to current financial ties, or to those which existed
over some period of time. The requirements apply to current ties, but institutions must maintain records of disclosures
until three years after the later of the termination or completion of the award to which they relate, or the resolution
of any government action involving the records. 
One commenter suggested that the disclosure requirements might conflict with consulting arrangements that prevent
investigators from disclosing the name of companies for whom they consult. In such cases, in order to receive Federal
funds, investigators would have to obtain permission to make the required disclosures, or discontinue the consulting
arrangements. Investigators who enter into consulting arrangements that prevent disclosure could seek agreements
with their institutions to maintain the confidentiality of arrangements they disclose to those institutions. 
One commenter felt the guidelines for product evaluations should differ from those for basic research. NSF's Policy
allows institutions to develop differing guidelines if they believe it appropriate. 
Many comments specifically related to the proposed Policy's requirement of financial disclosure to NSF. Because
this disclosure is not required by the final Policy, these comments are not discussed individually. 


Paperwork and Recordkeeping Burden 


In the proposed Policy, NSF estimated that it would take each investigator listed on a grant proposal 20 minutes to
prepare the required financial disclosures. Many commenters believed this seriously underestimated the actual
paperwork burden associated with Policy, and several pointed out that it did not take into account the institutional
burden associated with reviewing the disclosures. Few commenters provided suggestions for formulating a more accurate
estimate. However, NSF has revised its estimate of the annual reporting and recordkeeping burden to take into account
changes from the proposed Policy. NSF's revised estimates are as follows:

The Investigator Financial Disclosure Policy 



NSF's Investigator Financial Disclosure Policy has the following primary features: 

A. A requirement that any NSF grantee employing more than fifty persons maintain ``an appropriate written and enforced
policy on conflict of interests''. 

B. Minimum requirements for what must be in an institution's policy. These include (a) limited and targeted financial
disclosure, (b) designation of a person(s) to review the disclosures and resolve actual or potential problems revealed,
(c) enforcement mechanisms, and (d) arrangements for informing NSF of conflicts issues that are not resolved to the
satisfaction of the institution. 

Changes made to NSF issuances to establish and communicate the Policy are described below. Copies of the NSF Grant
General Conditions and the NSF publication Grant Proposal Guide may be obtained from the contact listed above. Copies
of the NSF Grant Policy Manual may be obtained from the Government Printing Office. 



WHAT WOULD BE REQUIRED IN INSTITUTIONAL POLICIES 



Grant General Conditions 



Insert a new subparagraph 23(b):

 


Records of investigator financial disclosures and of actions taken to manage actual or potential conflicts of interest
(see Grant Policy Manual Section 310), shall be retained until 3 years after the later of the termination or completion
of the award to which they relate, or the resolution of any government action involving those records. 

Renumber subsequent subparagraphs accordingly.




Insert a new paragraph 33: 




If the grantee employs more than fifty persons, the grantee shall maintain an appropriate written and enforced policy
on conflict of interest consistent with the provisions of Grant Policy Manual Section 310. 

Renumber subsequent paragraphs accordingly. 



Grant Policy Manual 



In GPM 516.3 ``Consulting and Other Outside Activities of Principal Investigators Under NSF Awards'', add to subparagraph
``a.'': 

However, see GPM 310 on Conflict of Interest Policies. 

Strike all after subparagraph ``a.'', including Exhibits V-1 and V-2.




Add a new GPM 310 ``Conflict of Interest Policies'': 




a. NSF requires each grantee institution employing more than fifty persons to maintain an appropriate written and
enforced policy on conflict of interest. Guidance for such policies has been issued by university associations and
scientific societies.

b. An institutional conflict-of-interest policy should require that each investigator disclose to a responsible
representative of the institution all significant financial interests of the investigator (including those of
the investigator's spouse and dependent children) (i) that would reasonably appear to be directly and significantly
affected by the research or educational activities funded or proposed for funding by NSF; or (ii) in entities whose
financial interests would reasonably appear to be directly and significantly affected by such activities. 
The term `investigator' means the principal investigator, co-principal investigators, and any other person at
the institution who is responsible for the design, conduct, or reporting of research or educational activities funded
or proposed for funding by NSF. 
The term `significant financial interest' means anything of monetary value, including, but not limited to, salary
or other payments for services (e.g., consulting fees or honoraria); equity interests (e.g., stocks, stock options
or other ownership interests); and intellectual property rights (e.g., patents, copyrights and royalties from
such rights). 
The term does not include: 
 salary, royalties or other remuneration from the institution; or any ownership interests in the institution,
if the institution is an applicant under the Small Business Innovation Research Program or Small Business Technology
Transfer Program; 
 income from seminars, lectures, or teaching engagements sponsored by public or nonprofit entities; 
 income from service on advisory committees or review panels for public or nonprofit entities; or 
 financial interests in business enterprises or entities if the value of such interests do not exceed $5,000
or represent more than a 5% ownership interest for any one enterprise or entity when aggregated for the investigator
and the investigator's spouse and dependent children. 
c. An institutional policy must ensure that investigators have provided all required financial disclosures at the
time the proposal is submitted to NSF. It must also require that those financial disclosures are updated during the
pendency of the award, either on an annual basis, or as new reportable significant financial interests are obtained.


d. An institutional policy must designate one or more persons to review financial disclosures, determine whether
an actual or potential conflict of interest exists, and determine what conditions or restrictions, if any, should
be imposed by the institution to manage, reduce or eliminate such conflict of interest. An actual or potential conflict
of interest exists when the reviewer(s) reasonably determine that a significant financial interest could affect
the design, conduct, or reporting of the research or educational activities funded or proposed for funding by NSF.

Examples of conditions or restrictions that might be imposed to manage, reduce or eliminate actual or potential conflicts
of interest include: 
 public disclosure of significant financial interests; 
 monitoring of research by independent reviewers; 
 modification of the research plan; 
 disqualification from participation in the portion of the NSF-funded research that would be affected by the
significant financial interests; 
 divestiture of significant financial interests; or 
 severance of relationships that create actual or potential conflicts. 
If the reviewer(s) determines that imposing conditions or restrictions would be either ineffective or inequitable,
and that the potential negative impacts that may arise from a significant financial interest are outweighed by interests
of scientific progress, technology transfer, or the public health and welfare, then the reviewer(s) may allow the
research to go forward without imposing such conditions or restrictions. 
e. The institutional policy must include adequate enforcement mechanisms, and provide for sanctions where appropriate.

f. The institutional policy must include arrangements for keeping NSF appropriately informed if the institution
finds that it is unable to satisfactorily manage an actual or potential conflict of interest.

g. Institutions must maintain records of all financial disclosures and of all actions taken to resolve actual or potential
conflicts of interest until at least 3 years after the later of the termination or completion of the award to which they
relate, or the resolution of any government action involving those records. 

Renumber GPM Sections 310-40 accordingly.

Philadelphia Electric Company


The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an exemption from the requirements
of Sections III.D.2.(a) and III.D.3 of Appendix J to 10 CFR Part 50, to Philadelphia Electric Company, Public Service
Electric and Gas Company, Delmarva Power and Light Company, and Atlantic City Electric Company (the licensee), for
the Peach Bottom Atomic Power Station (PBAPS), Unit 2, located at the licensee's site in York County, Pennsylvania.



Environmental Assessment 


Identification of Proposed Action


The proposed action would grant an exemption from10 CFR Part 50, Appendix J, Sections III.D.2.(a) and III.D.3. Section
III.D.2.(a) states, in part: ``Type B tests, except tests for air locks, shall be performed during reactor shutdown
for refueling, or other convenient intervals, but in no case at intervals greater than 2 years.'' Section III.D.3
states: ``Type C tests shall be performed during each reactor shutdown for refueling but in no case at intervals greater
than 2 years.'' The exemption would allow a one-time 60-day extension of the 2-year requirement. Hence, this one-time
exemption would allow the licensee to perform the testing in Sections III.0.2.(a) and III.
d.3 during Unit 2's Cycle 10 refueling outage scheduled to begin no later than September 24, 1994.
The proposed action is in accordance with the licensee's application for exemption dated April 18, 1994.


Need for the Proposed Action




BAPS, Unit 2 is utilizing a new core design which allows the intervals between reactor shutdowns for refueling to extend
the maximum allowable 2-year interval. Prior to the current operating cycle, local leak rate tests were performed
in conjunction with an operating cycle of 18 months. Use of extended cycle core designs has been recognized as a growing
trend in the industry as discussed in the staff's Generic Letter 91-04, ``Changes in Technical Specification
Surveillance Intervals to Accommodate a 24-Month Fuel Cycle,'' dated April 2, 1991. The staff previously granted
the licensee license amendments to allow PBAPS, Unit 2 to perform selected surveillances on a 24-month interval (see
Amendment 169 dated August 19, 1992, and Amendment 179 dated August 2, 1993). However, the regulations cited by the
licensee in the exemption request have not been revised to reflect the use of a 24-month operating cycle. Therefore,
the licensee has requested an exemption in order to avoid a premature shutdown which would be needed to accomplish
the testing and to properly schedule the testing during the refueling outage. 


Environmental Impacts of the Proposed Action 


The Commission has completed the evaluation of the proposed exemption and concludes that this action would not significantly
increase the probability or amount of expected primary containment leakage; hence, the containment integrity would
be maintained. 
Based on the information presented in the licensee's application, the proposed extended test interval would not
result in a non-detectable leakage rate in excess of the value established by 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix J, or in any changes
to the containment structure or plant systems. Consequently, the probability of accidents would not be increased,
nor would the post-accident radiological releases be greater than previously determined. Neither would the proposed
exemption otherwise affect radiological plant effluents. Accordingly, the Commission concludes that this proposed
action would result in no significant radiological environmental impact. 
With regard to potential non-radiological impacts, the proposed exemption does not affect non-radiological plant
effluents and has no other environmental impact. Therefore, the Commission concludes that there are no significant
non-radiological environmental impacts associated with the proposed exemption.


Alternatives to the Proposed Action


Since the Commission concluded that there are no measurable environmental effects that would result from the proposed
action, any alternatives with equal or greater environmental impacts need not be evaluated. 
The principal alternative would be to deny the requested exemption. This would not reduce environmental impacts
of plant operation and would result in reduced operational flexibility.


Alternate Use of Resources


This proposed action does not involve the use of any resources not previously considered in the final Environmental
Statements for the Peach Bottom Atomic Power Station, Units 2 and 3, dated April 1973. 


Agencies and Persons Consulted


The staff consulted with the State of Pennsylvania regarding the environmental impact of the proposed action. 


Finding of No Significant Impact


The Commission has determined not to prepare an environmental impact statement for the proposed exemption. 
Based upon the foregoing environmental assessment, the Commission concludes that the proposed action will not have
a significant effect on the quality of the human environment. 
For further details with respect to this action, see the application for exemption dated April 18, 1994, which is available
for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, The Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington,
DC 20555, and at the local public document room located at Government Publications Section, State Library of Pennsylvania,
(Regional Depository) Education Building, Walnut Street and Commonwealth Avenue, Box 1601, Harrisburg, Pennsylvania
17105.

ACTION: 

Notice.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (title 44, U.S. Code, chapter 35), this notice announces a request
for a reclearance of an information collection. SF 3104, Application for Death Benefits (FERS), is needed for the
Office of Personnel Management to determine whether death benefits should be paid, to whom, and in what amount. SF
3104A (attached to SF 3104), requests information from the survivor which is used by OPM to determine entitlement
to a survivor annuity supplement (supplementary annuity). SF 3104B is used by the deceased employee's former employing
agency in death-in-service cases, to supply the survivor's application for death benefits (SF 3104).


Approximately 3,546 SF 3104s are completed annually. We estimate that it takes 60 minutes to fill out the form. The
annual burden is 3,546 hours. Approximately 2,766 SF 3104Bs are completed annually. We estimate that it takes 60 minutes
to fill out the form. The annual burden is 2,766 hours. The combined total annual burden is 6,312 hours.
For copies of this proposal, contact C. Ronald Trueworthy on (703) 908-8550.

<USDEPT>SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION</USDEPT>






Self-Regulatory Organizations; Notice of Filing of Proposed Rule Change by the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc.
Relating to its Order and Decorum Regulations



June 22, 1994.



Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby
given that on March 10, 1994, the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Phlx'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (``Commission'' or ``SEC'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I and II below,
which Items have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization. On March 31, 1994, the Exchange submitted to
the Commission Amendment No. 1 to the proposed rule change.
 On June 22, 1994, the Exchange submitted to the Commission Amendment No. 2 to the proposed rule change.
 The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons.






I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change



The Exchange proposes to amend Regulation 4 (``Order'') as follows: (1) to adopt paragraph (b) permitting two Floor
Officials to refer particularly egregious or repetitive violations to the Exchange's Business Conduct Committee;
(2) to renumber the existing provisions as (a)(i)_(iii); (3) to add to the general prohibition against disorderly
conduct a proscription against acting in an indecorous manner which is disruptive to the conduct of business on the
trading floor; and (4) to adopt paragraph (a)(iv) imposing a fine ranging from $500 to $1,000 for each instance of abusive,
derisive or harassing treatment directed at any person while on the floor, which, in the view of two Floor Officials,
could constitute a public embarrassment to the Exchange.






II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose
of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text
of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The self-regulatory organization has
prepared summaries, set forth in Sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.



A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



(a) 

Purpose



</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940628-2-00091 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940628-2-00069 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Regulation 4 (``Order'') is the most fundamental of the Exchange's order and decorum regulations, which are adopted
pursuant to Phlx Rule 60 (``Assessments for Breach of Regulations''). Rule 60 permits Exchange officials and Floor
Officials to assess fines, not exceeding $1,000, for violations of regulations pertaining to order, decorum, health,
safety and welfare (``order and decorum'') on the Exchange, or to refer such violations to the Exchange's Business
Conduct Committee where higher fines or other sanctions may be imposed, in accordance with Phlx Rule 960.
 Rule 60 also enumerates the procedural aspects of order and decorum fines, including the ability to contest a fine
and request a hearing. The Exchange has adopted seven regulations of order and decorum pursuant to Rule 60, including
regulation 4.







In summary, Regulation 4 governs conduct on the trading floors of the Exchange by prohibiting disorderly conduct
and imposing fines for violations thereof. In addition to a general prohibition against disorderly behavior, specific
fines are also imposed for abuse of the paging system, possession of firearms, and various degrees of fighting, including
inciting physical abuse, minor acts of physical abuse and major acts of physical abuse.

At this time, the Exchange proposes to add a new paragraph (b) Stating that any acts described in paragraph (a) which
are deemed particularly egregious, or where an individual has established a pattern or order violations, may be referred
by two Floor Officials to the Business Conduct Committee where additional fines and other sanctions may be imposed
pursuant to Phlx rule 960.
 As a result of this proposed language, similar language which currently follows the paragraph addressing physical
abuse is proposed to be deleted in order for the new paragraph to apply to all violations of Regulation 4.





In addition to adopting new paragraph (b), the proposal would also renumber the existing provisions of the regulation.
The following language in the introductory paragraph is proposed to be deleted as redundant: instances determined
by a Floor Official as violative of the ``Order'' requirement may result in fines as described below. The first paragraph
would be renumbered as (a), with the abuse of paging system, firearms and physical abuse provisions numbered (i)_(iii),
respectively.

The following prohibition is proposed to be added to paragraph (a) to expand upon the general prohibition against
disorderly conduct: acting in an indecorous manner which is disruptive to the conduct of business on the trading floor.
The new language explicitly prohibits behavior that results in a disruption of trading and provides a gauge by which
a Floor Official may determine whether a certain act was disorderly (if an act caused floor traders to divert their
attention from trading, the act could be construed as disorderly).

The Exchange also proposes to adopt new paragraph (a)(iv) to prohibit instances of abusive, derisive or harassing
treatment directed at any person while on the floor, which in the view of two Floor Officials, could constitute a public
embarrassment to the Exchange, and impose a fine ranging from $500 to $1,000 for such violations. The Exchange believes
that because such behavior is indecorous but not disruptive to trading in each case, it warrants a separate fine between
$500 and $1,000 and direct prohibition. This provision is intended to specifically implement Exchange Rule 708 (``Acts
Detrimental to the Interest or Welfare of the Exchange'').
 Specifically, Rule 708, Commentary .01(e) prohibits misconduct on the trading floor, in violation of the Exchange's
Order and Decorum Regulations, that is repetitive, egregious of a publicly embarrassing nature to the Exchange rule
708 would specifically enable the Exchange's Business Conduct Committee to pursue formal disciplinary action for
disorderly conduct on the trading floor. The purpose of the present proposal is to provide an established procedure
by which referrals of such floor misconduct would be made to the Business Conduct Committee by Floor Officials.





(b) Statutory Basis



The proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6 of the Act in general, and in particular, with Section 6(b)(5),
in that it is designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade, and protect investors and the public interest
by ensuring an orderly and decorous environment on the trading floor for Exchange business to be conducted. The proposal
is also consistent with Section 6(b)(6), in that Regulation 4, as amended, would continue to provide that members
of the Exchange be appropriately disciplined for violations of the rules of the Exchange.



B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition



The Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any inappropriate burden on competition.



C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received from Members, Participants
or Others.



The Exchange has neither solicited nor received written comments on the proposed rule change.

III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action



Within 35 days of the publication of this notice in the 

Federal Register

 or within such other period (i) as the Commission may designate up to 90 days of such date if it finds such longer period
to be appropriate and publishes its reasons for so finding or (ii) as to which the self-regulatory organization consents,

(A) by order approve the proposed rule change, or

(B) institute proceedings to determine whether the proposed rule change should be disapproved.



IV. Solicitation of Comments



Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements

to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying at the Commission's
Public Reference Room, 450 Fifth Street NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the filing will also be available for

 </SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
supplementary information:

 The following is a summary of the application. The complete application may be obtained for a fee from the SEC's Public
Reference Branch. 

 

Applicant's Representations 

 

1. The Trust is an unit investment trust organized under the laws of the State of New York. The Trust offered shares in
two series (``Series 1'' and ``Series 2''). On July 6, 1989, the Trust registered under the Act pursuant to section
8(a). On August 4, 1989, the Trust filed a registration statement under section 8(b) of the Act, and registered an indefinite
number of units of Series 1 under the Securities Act of 1933. The registration statement was declared effective, and
the public sale of units of Series 1 commenced on October 23, 1989. On November 30, 1989, the Trust filed a registration
statement to register an indefinite number of units of Series 2. The registration statement was declared effective,
and the public sale of units of Series 2 commenced, on January 22, 1990. 

 2. Pursuant to their respective indentures, the termination date for Series 1 and Series 2 was October 23, 1990 and
January 22, 1991, respectively. Each termination date was disclosed as the Mandatory Termination Date of that series
in its respective Prospectus. The purpose of the Trust was to assemble a portfolio of common stocks that over a year
period was designed to outperform indices of market performance. 

 3. Upon termination of the Trust, Security Pacific National Trust Company (the ``Trustee'') sold the securities
held in each series and credited the monies derived from such sales to the income and capital accounts of the respective
series. The Trustee then deducted fees and expenses of the Trust as well as amounts payable into a reserve account for
taxes, and distributed to each unitholder his or her 

pro rate

 share of the income and capital accounts. 

 4. In their final year of operation, Series 1 incurred $24,642 and Series 2 incurred $20,690 in expenses and Trustee's
fees. The Trustee's fees were paid to the Trustee. The principal expense of the Trust and of the shareholder servicing
agent of each series that were paid by the Trust were for postage, printing, and professional fees. 

 5. The net asset value of Series 1 on October 23, 1990 was $13.35 per unit, for an aggregate value of $15,955,947. The
net asset value of Series 2 on December 31, 1990 was $14.47 per unit for an aggregate value of $4,080,670. 

 6. At the time of filing of the application, the Trust had no assets or liabilities. The Trust has no shareholders and
is not a party to any litigation or administrative proceeding. The Trust is not now engaged, nor does it propose to engage,
in any business activities other than those necessary for the winding up of its affairs.

ACTION: 

Notice and solicitation of public comment with respect to the eligibility of Armenia for the GSP program.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This notice announces the initiation of a review to consider the designation of Armenia as a beneficiary developing
country under the GSP program and solicits public comment relating to the designation criteria. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The Trade Policy Staff Committee (TPSC) has initiated a review to determine if Armenia meets the designation criteria
of the GSP law and should be designated as a beneficiary developing country for purposes of the GSP, which is provided
for in the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2461-2465). The designation criteria are listed in sections
502(a), 502(b), and 502(c) of the Act. Interested parties are invited to submit comments regarding the eligibility
of Armenia for designation as a GSP beneficiary. The designation criteria mandate determinations related to participation
in commodity cartels, preferential treatment provided to other developed countries, expropriation without compensation,
enforcement of arbitral awards, support of international terrorism, and protection of internationally recognized
worker rights. Other practices taken into account relate to the extent of market access for goods and services, investment
practices and protection of intellectual property rights. 



Comments must be submitted in 14 copies, in English, to the Chairman of the GSP Subcommittee, Trade Policy Staff Committee,
600 17th Street, NW., Room 517, Washington, DC 20506. Comments must be received no later than 5 p.m. on Wednesday, August

<DOCTITLE>Tariff Classification of Imported Magnets </DOCTITLE>


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 U.S. Customs Service, Department of Treasury.

 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed change of position; solicitation of comments. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This notice advises the public that Customs proposes a change of position regarding the classification of imported
articles consisting of small metal or barium ferrite magnets placed in a plastic, textile or ceramic housing (sometimes
referred to as refrigerator or household magnets), under the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS).



Customs has ruled in the past that based on the composition of the magnet, it was classified either as an article of metal
under heading 7323, HTSUS, or as an article of ceramic (barium ferrite) under heading 6912, HTSUS. 
After intensive review, Customs now believes that because composite goods consisting of magnets and a textile, plastic
or ceramic housing or shell, have the essential character of magnets, they are properly classifiable as such under
heading 8505, HTSUS. The result of this proposed change of position would be a small decrease in the rate of duty on the
subject merchandise. 
By this action, those rulings which are inconsistent with our current position would be revoked. Before adopting
this proposed change, consideration will be given to any written comments timely submitted in response to publication
of the document.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Background 


Classification of merchandise under the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS) is in accordance
with the General Rules of Interpretation (GRI's). GRI 1 provides that classification shall be determined according
to the terms of the headings and any relative section or chapter notes. 
Magnets are specifically provided for in heading 8505, HTSUS. In several rulings, we have held that articles consisting
of a magnet placed within a decorative housing or shell made of plastic, ceramic, or textile (sometimes referred to
as refrigerator or household magnets), were composite goods. Classification was considered under the following
subheadings and duty rates:

 

6912.00.50: Ceramic tableware, kitchenware, other household articles * * *: [o]ther 


The general, column one rate of duty is 7 percent ad valorem. 


7323.99.90: Table, kitchen or other household articles and parts thereof, of iron or steel .* * *:
[o]ther: [o]ther: [n]ot coated or plated with precious metal: [o]ther: [o]ther. * * *. 


The general, column one rate of duty is 3.4 percent ad 

valorem. 


8505.19.00: Electromagnets; permanent magnets and articles intended to become permanent magnets after magnetization.
* * *: [p]ermanent magnets and articles intended to become permanent magnets after magnetization:
[o]ther. * * *


The general, column one rate of duty is 4.9 percent ad valorem.

 

Because the article was a composite good consisting of metal, ceramic, textile, and/or plastic, it was prima facie
classifiable under two or more headings. Customs would then apply GRI 3(b) to determine the essential character of
the article. 
The Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System Explanatory Notes (EN) constitute the Customs Cooperation
Council's official interpretation of the HTSUS. While not legally binding, the ENs provide a commentary on the scope
of each heading of the HTSUS and are generally indicative of the proper interpretation of these headings. See 

T.D. 89-80, 54 Fed. Reg. 35127, 35128 (August 23, 1989). EN VIII to GRI 3(b) states as follows:

 

[T]he factor which determines essential character will vary as between different kinds of goods. It may, for example,
be determined by the nature of the material or component, its bulk, quantity, weight or value, or by the role of a constituent
material in relation to the use of the goods.

 

In the rulings issued, Customs concluded that the magnet imparts the essential character to the article. The plastic,
textile or ceramic portion of the article merely embellished the article and acted as a decorative selling feature.

However, Customs precluded classification of the article under heading 8505, HTSUS, which specifically provides
for permanent magnets based upon a portion of EN 85.05. EN 85.05, page 1341, states in pertinent part as follows:

 

[T]his heading does not cover: [e]lectro-magnets, permanent magnets or magnetic devices of this heading, when presented
with machines, apparatus, toys, games, etc., of which they are designed to form part (classified with those machines,
apparatus, etc.)

 

Based upon this portion of EN 85.05, we held that the magnets were designed to form part of the article. It was concluded
that because the magnets are presented with and incorporated into a textile, ceramic or plastic article (i.e., a hook,
fruit caricature or advertising slogan), they are precluded from classification in heading 8505, HTSUS. Because
the essential character of the article is the magnet, the article would then be classified based upon the composition
of the magnet as an article of metal under heading 7323, HTSUS, or as an article of ceramic (barium ferrite) under heading
6912, HTSUS. 
Several rulings were issued following this rationale. 

See 

HQs 082500, 083130, 083133, 083134, 089332, 089333, 089760; NYs 860370, 862523. This list may not be exhaustive.
There may be others issued by Customs in New York or in the various Customs districts under the pre-entry classification
procedures. 


Proposed Change of Position 


After intensive analysis, we believe that EN 85.05 has been misinterpreted. The exclusion in EN 85.05 is designed
to cover only those articles in which the magnet is merely an insignificant part of a larger article (

i.e.

, kitchen cabinets with a magnet to keep the doors closed). In such cases, the magnet portion is ignored for classification
purposes, and the article (

i.e.

, kitchen cabinet) is classified as if the magnet were not present. 
In regards to articles consisting of a metal or barium ferrite magnet and a plastic, textile or ceramic shell or housing
(i.e., a hook, fruit caricature or an advertisement slogan), Customs believes that they are a composite good. Customs
will continue to apply an essential character analysis pursuant to GRI 3(b) to find the essential character of the
merchandise. If the shell or housing portion of the article merely embellishes the product and acts as a decorative
selling feature, and the essential character is imparted by the magnet, then the article is properly classifiable
in heading 8505, HTSUS, as a permanent magnet. This change in position only relates to how Customs interprets the exclusion
stated in EN 85.05. 


Authority 


This notice is published in accordance with section 177.10, Customs Regulations (19 CFR 177.10). 


Comments 


Before adopting this proposed change in position, consideration will be given to any written comments timely submitted
to Customs. Comments submitted will be available for public inspection in accordance with the Freedom of Information
Act (5 U.S.C. 552), section 1.4, Treasury Department Regulations (31 CFR 103.11(b)), on regular business days between
the hours of 9:00 and 4:30 p.m. at the Office of Regulations and Rulings, Franklin Court, 1099 14th Street NW., Suite

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This notice advises the public that Customs proposes to amend the general drawback rate for crude petroleum and petroleum
derivatives to permit first-in-first-out (FIFO) accounting for exports and drawback deliveries of petroleum products
with different drawback factors which are commingled in inventory. Currently, such accounting is required on the
basis of lower-to-higher drawback factors, and is not consistent with recent changes to the Customs Regulations
in this regard or commercial accounting procedures. 
Additionally, Customs proposes to revoke a published ruling and any unpublished rulings to the same effect under
which identification of merchandise and articles for drawback purposes is permitted on a higher-to-lower basis.
This change is consistent with the Customs Regulations, commercial accounting procedures, and efficient administration
and will result in revenue neutrality when drawback claimants choose to commingle merchandise or articles and to
identify them by an accounting procedure.

Customs has issued a number of rulings on the accounting procedures which may be used to identify merchandise or articles
for drawback purposes. In a memorandum dated September 3, 1981 (File: 213253), all Regional Commissioners were directed
to permit the use of FIFO in place of lower-to-higher identification and 19 CFR 22.4(f) (requiring lower-to-higher
identification) was waived pending the promulgation of  191.22(c) in the proposed revision of the Customs
Regulations pertaining to drawback. The reason given for this action was to ``. . . create
savings for both Customs and industry by eliminating an antiquated procedure which is not cost effective.'' 

In Customs Service Decision (C.S.D.) 79-252, Customs held that fungible merchandise commingled in storage
or manufacture could be identified on a FIFO basis for purposes of 19 U.S.C. 1313(b) (see also C.S.D.'s 79-301
and 79-448). In C.S.D. 82-35, Customs held that when fungible merchandise belonging to several persons
is commingled in storage, each person could identify for drawback purposes his withdrawals on a FIFO basis, considering
only his inputs and withdrawals. In C.S.D. 83-54, Customs held that when fungible drawback and non-drawback
products were commingled in storage, withdrawals for drawback purposes may be identified against the drawback material
in the order of its receipt into the commingled storage facility. In C.S.D. 84-82, Customs held that when fungible
drawback and non-drawback input was placed in commingled storage, withdrawals for drawback purposes could be identified
on a ``higher-to-lower'' basis against the drawback input commingled therein. 

In C.S.D. 88-1, Customs held that the use of FIFO for drawback purposes, as provided for in the above-described
rulings, required that the products be actually commingled in the same tank and that the FIFO procedure must be applied
on a date-by-date basis, as illustrated in the ruling. (Section 484A, Customs and Trade Act of 1990 (Pub. L. 101-382;
104 Stat. 629, 707; 19 U.S.C. 1313(p)), provided alternative monthly accounting procedures for certain crude petroleum
and petroleum derivative products in certain conditions. In its directive implementing this statute (Customs Directive
3740-006, March 17, 1992), Customs stated that the legal principles set forth in C.S.D. 88-1 would continue
to apply to articles not provided for in  484A.) 

In 1965 (see T.D. 56487, published in the 

Federal Register

 on September 25, 1965 (30 FR 12280)), Customs published a general drawback rate for substitution manufacturing drawback
under 19 U.S.C. 1313(b) for crude petroleum and petroleum derivatives. General rates are manufacturing drawback
contracts describing standardized procedures (e.g., steel, provided for in T.D. 81-74, or piece goods, provided
for in T.D. 83-73). Because the procedures covered in general rates are standardized, a manufacturer or producer
who can comply with the terms and conditions of the general rate may seek application of the general rate to its operations
through a Customs regional office instead of having to apply for and obtain approval from Customs headquarters, as
is true of specific substitution manufacturing drawback contracts (see 19 CFR Part 191, Subparts D and B, respectively).
Because of its extreme complexity, the general drawback rate for crude petroleum and petroleum derivatives is an
exception to this practice, requiring application to Customs headquarters for approval. 

T.D. 56487 promulgated the general drawback rate for crude petroleum and petroleum derivatives by adding it to the
Customs Regulations then pertaining to drawback (19 CFR 22.6(g-1);  22.6 then contained the general
drawback rates). (When Part 22 of the Customs Regulations was revised into Part 191, the general drawback rates were
not included in the revised regulations, as not being of sufficient general applicability for such inclusion. Thereafter,
general drawback rates were published separately as T.D.'s. The general drawback rate for crude petroleum and petroleum
derivatives, formerly in 19 CFR 22.6(g-1), was published, without substantive change, as T.D. 84-49.)
T.D. 56487 provided for a monthly period of manufacture, unless a different period was authorized. T.D. 56487 was
issued after very thorough review by the government and after the public was given an opportunity to comment (see Notice
of Proposed Rule Making, published in the 

Federal Register

 on June 16, 1965 (30 FR 7756)). 

In the Notice of Proposed Rule Making for T.D. 56487, the reasons given for promulgation of the general drawback rate
were to meet the complex problems of refiners who produce large groups of widely diversified petroleum products and
to provide a better basis for the proper allowance of drawback on such products, and to ensure compliance with the applicable
statutory provision (19 U.S.C. 1313(b)). Although the T.D. permitted the designation for drawback of imported crude
petroleum or petroleum derivatives used at one refinery of a refiner as the basis for the allowance of drawback on petroleum
products manufactured or produced at another refinery of the same refiner, the T.D. applied to manufacture or production
of the latter, or substitute merchandise, on a refinery-by-refinery basis.

A basic feature of T.D. 56487 was that refiners could, at their option, attribute to designated imported crude petroleum
or petroleum derivatives a quantity of an exported petroleum product in excess of the quantity of that petroleum product
actually produced from either the designated imported crude petroleum or petroleum derivative or the crude petroleum
or petroleum derivative that was substituted for the designated import. This feature, called ``producibility,''
permits drawback to be claimed on a given quantity of designated imported crude petroleum or petroleum derivatives
up to the quantity of an exported petroleum product which 

could 

have been produced from the designated imported crude petroleum or petroleum derivatives. Under the producibility
concept, as provided for in T.D. 56487, a refiner is not required to establish that the exported articles were actually
produced from the substituted crude petroleum or petroleum derivatives; the refiner need only show that the exported
articles 

could 

have been produced from the designated imported crude petroleum or petroleum derivative. 

The application of the producibility concept to petroleum refinery operations is illustrated in the following example,
quoted from the ruling published as T.D. 78-419.

 


Suppose that 100 barrels of crude petroleum are refined into 10 products in equal amounts, including 10 barrels of
motor gasoline. One half of the crude is imported duty-paid, which can be designated for drawback, and one half (50
barrels) is domestic of the same kind and quality. Only the motor gasoline is exported.

The production standards for petroleum, unlike those for most chemicals, are subject to variation at the election
of the refiner. In other words, the refiner could have produced 91 barrels of motor gasoline from 100 barrels of crude
[i.e. Class III], had he wanted to. 

To require the refiner to designate a quantity of imported crude sufficient to have produced concurrently each product
actually produced, whether or not exported, would either require him to designate more than the 50 barrels of imported
crude that was used, or to accept drawback on only 5 barrels (one-half) of the total quantity of motor gasoline exported.


On the other hand, disregarding the nonexported products for the purpose of determining the quantity of imported
crude to designate, it is clear that up to 91 percent of the 50 barrels of imported crude could have been refined into
motor gasoline. Therefore, the refiner would have to designate only slightly more than 10 barrels of imported crude
to cover all of the motor gasoline exported. This is the Treasury Department position.

 


The quantity of a given petroleum product which could have been produced from a given quantity of crude petroleum or
petroleum derivative is determined on the basis of ``Industry Standards of Potential Production on a Practical Operating
Basis.'' These standards were published in T.D. 66-16. The standards listed the quantity of 17 petroleum products
which could have been produced from four classes of crude petroleum and 12 petroleum derivatives (e.g., the producibility
percentages for class III crude petroleum for motor gasoline and aviation gasoline are 91 and 40 respectively, meaning
that 91 gallons of motor gasoline or 40 gallons of aviation gasoline could be produced from 100 gallons of class III
crude petroleum). 

In addition to establishing procedures for the use of the concept of producibility for the refining of crude petroleum
and petroleum derivatives, T.D. 56487 divided crude petroleum and petroleum derivatives into classes for purposes
of determining same kind and quality. (In order to claim drawback under 19 U.S.C. 1313(b) on the exportation of articles
manufactured from domestic or other merchandise substituted for designated imported merchandise, the designated
imported merchandise and the substituted merchandise must be of the same kind and quality.) Four classes, based on
API gravity, were established. Crude petroleum in any one class would be considered as being of the same kind and quality
as any other crude petroleum included in the same class and any named petroleum derivative in any class would be considered
as being of the same kind and quality as the same named derivative in the same class. As stated above, under T.D. 56487,
a refiner was not required to establish that 

the 

crude petroleum or petroleum derivative used to produce the exported article was of the same kind and quality as the
designated imported crude petroleum or petroleum derivative; the refiner was required to establish that this 

could 

have been the case. (I.e., If a refiner used different classes of crude petroleum during a production period subject
to different standards of producibility, the refiner was required to establish only that a sufficient quantity,
taking into consideration the applicable standards of producibility, of crude petroleum of the same class as the
designated imported crude petroleum was used in the refinery during the period; not that it was actually used for the
production of exported article.) 

Distribution of drawback among the products produced during a production period under T.D. 56487 is based on the relative
values of all products manufactured or produced during the production period, as of the time of separation of the products.
(The time of separation of the products is considered to be the monthly period of production.) Relative values are
stated in terms of drawback factors, which attach to each of the products manufactured or produced during the production
period. (E.g., If, under T.D. 56487, crude petroleum was used to produce 50 barrels of motor gasoline valued at $30
per barrel, 25 barrels of distillate oils valued at $20 per barrel, and 25 barrels of all other petrochemical products
valued at $80 per barrel, the drawback factors would be: motor gasoline_.75; residual oils_.5; and all other petrochemical
products_2.) The quantity of crude petroleum which may be designated for the exportation of a particular product
is determined by multiplying the quantity of the article exported by the drawback factor. (E.g., In the above example
if 10 barrels of motor gasoline were exported, 7.5 barrels of crude petroleum could be designated; if 10 barrels of
petrochemical products were exported, 20 barrels of crude petroleum could be designated.)

<TEXT>
 

T.D. 56487 emphasized the statutory requirement that the total amount of drawback allowed may never exceed 99 percent
of the duty paid on the designated imported merchandise. To ensure compliance with this requirement, the T.D. provided
that the exportation of a given quantity of a manufactured product affords a proper basis for the allowance of drawback
only to the extent that the product could have been produced in that quantity (together with the quantities of related
products produced concurrently) from the designated imported crude petroleum or petroleum derivatives. The T.D.
provided that this requirement meant that such concurrent production must be practicably possible by ordinary manufacturing
techniques. 

T.D. 56487 contained explicit accounting procedures for manufactured articles. When the inventory of a particular
product contained product with different drawback factors (e.g., if the inventory of motor gasoline was from more
than one month's production, each month's quantity could have a different drawback factor), withdrawals from the
inventory for exports were required to be ``[f]rom lowest [factor] on hand'', withdrawals for drawback deliveries
(i.e., for further manufacture resulting in a product on which drawback could be claimed) were required to be ``[from]
lowest on hand after exports are deducted'', and withdrawals for domestic (non-drawback) shipments were required
to be ``[f]rom earliest on hand after [withdrawals for export and drawback deliveries] are deducted.'' 

The basis for the above accounting procedures is explained in the Notice of Proposed Rule Making for T.D. 56487, in
which it is stated, ``[t]he total amount of drawback allowable * * * shall be computed by multiplying
the quantity of product exported by the drawback factor for that product, 

with due consideration for the `lower-to-higher' principle established in [19 CFR 22.4(f)]

.'' (Emphasis added.) 

Customs has been requested to amend T.D. 84-49 (as stated above, when the Customs Regulations pertaining to
drawback were revised in 1983, the general drawback rate for crude petroleum and petroleum derivatives was not included
in the revised regulations but was subsequently published, without substantive change from its initial publication
as T.D. 56487, as T.D. 84-49) to permit the accounting for withdrawals for export and for drawback deliveries
from the inventory of a particular product containing product with different drawback factors on the basis of FIFO
or higher-to-lower. The basis for this request is stated to be that when T.D. 56487 was published, Customs permitted
such accounting only on a lower-to-higher basis but now other bases of accounting, including FIFO and higher-to-lower
are permitted. 

It is Customs position that the above-described rationale for amending T.D. 84-49 to permit the accounting
on a FIFO basis in the described situation has merit (although, in the interest of administrative simplicity, Customs
believes that the order of such withdrawals should continue to be the same; i.e., first exports, then drawback deliveries,
then domestic shipments). The reasons given for the introduction of FIFO to accounting procedures for drawback still
apply; i.e., that FIFO is less difficult to administer and is consistent with commercial accounting procedures (see,
e.g., 

Miller's Comprehensive GAAP Guide

 (1985), page 2401 

et seq

., Inventory Pricing and Methods). The basis for requiring use of the lower-to-higher accounting procedure in this
situation was that that was the only accounting procedure permitted to be used for drawback at the time. Customs position
has now changed. Furthermore, we note that under T.D. 84-49, there are procedures guaranteeing that the total
amount of drawback allowed may never exceed 99 percent of the duty paid on the designated imported merchandise, as
required by the drawback law. 

However, it is Customs position that T.D. 84-49 should not be amended to permit the accounting on a higher-to-lower
basis and, furthermore, that C.S.D. 84-82, the only published Customs ruling permitting higher-to-lower
accounting for drawback purposes, as well as any unpublished Customs rulings to the same effect, should be revoked.
As described above, when the Customs Regulations on drawback were revised in 1983 and the use of FIFO, or any other accounting
procedure approved by Customs, was authorized, the applicable provision (19 CFR 191.22(c)) was modified from that
proposed in the Notice of Proposed Rule Making for the revision. In the Notice of Proposed Rule Making, only FIFO would
have been permitted. In the Final Revision it was explained that this change was in response to a comment which was found
to have merit, and therefore other accounting procedures could be used. Illustrations of these other accounting
procedures were given. The illustrative accounting procedures (``low-to-high'', ``identification'', and ``blanket
identification'') are either as conservative as the lower-to-higher procedure then permitted or consist of direct
identification without recourse to an accounting system.

Each of the illustrative accounting procedures referred to in the Final Revision of the Customs Regulations on drawback
is either revenue neutral or favors the Government. When a drawback claimant uses an accounting system to identify
merchandise or articles for drawback purposes, it does so for its own convenience (i.e., to avoid having to physically
identify the merchandise or articles). It is Customs position that any accounting procedure authorized under 19
CFR 191.22(c) must be revenue neutral or favorable to the Government. Furthermore, it is Customs position that any
such authorized accounting procedure must be consistent with commercial accounting procedures, as is true of FIFO,
must be consistent with the accounting procedures generally used by the drawback claimant, and must be consistent
with ease of administration.

Activities/tasks to be funded.

 The grantees selected for funding under this NOFA shall perform the following tasks: 
(i) 

Task 1_Public Housing Police Department Upgrades.

 The following subtasks are to be performed in 11 designated cities that have both municipal police and housing authority
police departments serving public housing residents. In addition, the grantee will be required to hold a briefing,
for up to three representatives from each designated city, of the tasks to be accomplished under this grant. The briefing
is to be conducted in the Washington, DC area immediately after completion and approval of the management and work
plan under section (j)(4) of this NOFA. The Department conducted a study to identify housing authority (HA) police
departments that met the following criteria: they were moving towards national or State accreditation; their officers
were State or local commissioned police officers and/or had completed police academy training; and they had operations
and salaries that were funded with HUD operating subsidies or other HUD funds. Based upon this study the Department
determined that the HAs listed below had their own HA police departments which met these criteria. The 11 housing authorities
(HA) and cities for Task 1 are: 



Baltimore HA and Community Development, Baltimore, MD 
Boston HA, Boston, MA 
Buffalo HA, Buffalo, NY 
Chicago HA, Chicago, IL 
Cuyahoga Metropolitan HA, Cleveland, OH 
HA of the City of Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA 
HA of the City of Oakland, Oakland, CA 
HA of the City of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA 
Newark HA, Newark, NJ 
Philadelphia HA, Philadelphia, PA 
HA of the City of Waterbury, Waterbury, CT 



The New York City Housing Authority has a housing authority police department. This department has already been accredited
as of March 27, 1994 and 

therefore will not be

 included in this NOFA. 
(A) 

Task 1 Subtask 1_Law Enforcement Services Agreements.

 The grantee shall facilitate law enforcement service agreements, for additional law enforcement services beyond
the HA cooperation agreement, between housing authorities and local government. The grantee shall work with public
housing officials and local governments in the 11 cities with public housing police departments to negotiate and
implement additional law enforcement service agreements between local police and public housing officials. The
anticipated agreements would relate to the provision of police services to public housing residents by municipal
police and public housing police, access to emergency services, baseline services provided to public housing residents,
reporting of crimes city-wide and in public housing, and other items that may be of mutual interest to the city and/or
housing authority. 
(B) 

Task 1 Subtask 2_Policy and Procedures Manual.

 The grantee shall work with public housing police departments in 11 cities to develop and implement a state of the art
police policy and procedures manual. Where a manual exists, the manual should be edited to the point that relevant
policies, procedures and general orders are clearly defined for public housing services. 
(C) 

Task 1 Subtask 3_Personnel Management System.

 The grantee shall work with public housing police departments in 11 cities to develop and implement a modern police
personnel management system to include recruitment, selection, initial and continuing training, evaluation,
compensation, job descriptions, and promotional systems. The grantee shall also, through focus groups and/or needs
assessment, identify topics for a core curriculum for continuing HA police officer training in areas specific to
HAs, such as vertical patrols, investigative techniques, and sensitivity training. 
(D) 

Task 1 Subtask 4_Fiscal Tracking System.

 The grantee shall work with public housing authorities and housing police departments in 11 cities to develop a consistent
fiscal tracking system that incorporates modern financial management systems into the way the authorities and police
justify and track expenditures. Fiscal planning should be incorporated into the fiscal system so that a procedure
exists to reflect anticipated costs five years into the future. In addition, the grantee shall work with housing authority
officials in 11 cities to identify the source of funding for police and security upgrades and establish timelines
for completion of upgrades. 
(E) 

Task 1 Subtask 5_Emergency Dispatch System.

 The grantee shall work with public housing police departments and municipal police departments in 11 cities to develop
a state of the art emergency dispatch system for public housing residents that reflects the most expeditious way to
provide residents in each of the 11 cities with emergency police response. This task is to include developing recommendations
for assuring communications between public housing police departments and municipal police departments, 911 services,
non-emergency calls, anticipated expenditures by authority for technical upgrades, and training requirements
for officers and dispatchers. 
(F) 

Task 1 Subtask 6_Records Management.

 The grantee shall work with public housing police departments in 11 cities to develop a records management system
that represents state of the art practices in collecting, coding, filing, analyzing and accessing police information.

II. Other Matters




Environmental Impact.

 A grant under this program is categorically excluded from review under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969
(NEPA) in accordance with 24 CFR part 50.20(p). However, prior to an award of grant funds, HUD will perform an environmental
review to the extent required by HUD's environmental regulations at 24 CFR part 50, including the applicable related
authorities at 24 CFR 50.4. 


Federalism Impact.

 The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under section 6(a) of Executive Order 12612, Federalism, has determined
that the policies contained in this notice will not have substantial direct effects on States or their political subdivisions,
or the relationship between the Federal government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities
among the various levels of government and, therefore, the provisions of this notice do not have ``federalism implications''
within the meaning of the Order. The notice implements a program that encourages HAs to develop a plan for addressing
the problem of drug-related crime, and makes available grants to HAs to help them carry out their plans. As such, the
program would help HAs combat serious drug-related crime problems in their developments, thereby strengthening
their role as instrumentalities of the States. In addition, further review under the Order is unnecessary, since
the notice generally tracks the statute and involves little implementing discretion. 


Family Impact. 

The General Counsel, as the Designated Official for Executive Order 12606, 

the Family

, has determined that the provisions of this grant have the potential for a positive, although indirect, impact on
family formation, maintenance and general well-being within the meaning of the Order. As such, this grant is intended
to improve the quality of life of public and Indian housing development residents, including families, by reducing
the incidence of drug-related crime. 


Section 102 HUD Reform Act_Documentation and Public Access Requirements; Applicant/Recipient Disclosures 




Documentation and public access. 

HUD will ensure that documentation and other information regarding each application submitted pursuant to this
NOFA are sufficient to indicate the basis upon which assistance was provided or denied. This material, including
any letters of support, will be made available for public inspection for a five-year period beginning not less than
30 days after the award of the assistance. Material will be made available in accordance with the Freedom of Information
Act (5 U.S.C. 552) and HUD's implementing regulations at 24 CFR part 15. In addition, HUD will include the recipients
of assistance pursuant to this NOFA in its quarterly 

Federal Register

 notice of all recipients of HUD assistance awarded on a competitive basis. (See 24 CFR 12.14(a) and 12.16(b), and the
notice published in the 

Federal Register

 on January 16, 1992 (57 FR 1942), for further information on these requirements.) 


Disclosures. 

HUD will make available to the public for five years all applicant disclosure reports (HUD Form 2880) submitted in
connection with this NOFA. Update reports (also Form 2880) will be made available along with the applicant disclosure
reports, but in no case for a period less than three years. All reports_both applicant disclosures and updates_will
be made available in accordance with the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) and HUD's implementing regulations
at 24 CFR part 15. (See 24 CFR subpart C, and the notice published in the 

Federal Register

 on January 16, 1992 (57 FR 1942), for further information on these disclosure requirements.)

Section 103 HUD Reform Act 


HUD's regulation implementing section 103 of the Department of Housing and Urban Development Reform Act of 1989 was
published May 13, 1991 (56 FR 22088) and became effective on June 12, 1991. That regulation, codified as 24 CFR Part
4, applies to the funding competition announced today. The requirements of the rule continue to apply until the announcement
of the selection of successful applicants. 
HUD employees involved in the review of applications and in the making of funding decisions are limited by Part 4 from
providing advance information to any person (other than an authorized employee of HUD) concerning funding decisions,
or from otherwise giving any applicant an unfair competitive advantage. Persons who apply for assistance in this
competition should confine their inquiries to the subject areas permitted under 24 CFR Part 4. 
Applicants who have questions should contact the HUD Office of Ethics (202) 708-3815. (This is not a toll-free
number.) The Office of Ethics can provide information of a general nature to HUD employees, as well. 


Section 112 HUD Reform Act 


Section 13 of the 
Department of Housing and Urban Development Act contains two provisions dealing with efforts to influence HUD's
decisions with respect to financial assistance. The first imposes disclosure requirements on those who are typically
involved in these efforts_those who pay others to influence the award of assistance or the taking of a management action
by the Department 

and 

those who are paid to provide the influence. The second restricts the payment of fees to those who are paid to influence
the award of HUD assistance, if the fees are tied to the number of housing units received or are based on the amount of
assistance received, or if they are contingent upon the receipt of assistance. 
Section 13 was implemented by final rule published in the 

Federal Register

 on May 17, 1991 (56 FR 22912). If readers are involved in any efforts to influence the Department in these ways, they
are urged to read the final rule, particularly the examples contained in Appendix A of the rule. 


Prohibition Against Lobbying Activities 


The use of funds awarded under this grant is subject to the disclosure requirements and prohibitions of section 319
of the Department of Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 1990 (31 U.S.C. 1352) (The ``Byrd
Amendment'') and the implementing regulations at 24 CFR part 87. These authorities prohibit recipients of federal
contracts, grants, or loans from using appropriated funds for lobbying the Executive or Legislative branches of
the federal government in connection with a specific contract, grant, or loan. The prohibition also covers the awarding
of contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, or loans unless the recipient has made an acceptable certification
regarding lobbying. 
Under 24 CFR part 87, applicants, recipients, and subrecipients of assistance exceeding $100,000 must certify that
no federal funds have been or will be spent on lobbying activities in connection with the assistance.

1993. The proposed rule on Emergency Shelter Grants Program; Set-Aside Allocation for Indian Tribes and Alaskan
Native Villages, published in the 

Federal Register

 on April 5, 1993, describes the method for allocating these funds. These grants will be governed by all provisions
applicable to the ESG program, including the provisions in the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 (Pub.
L. 102-550, approved October 28, 1992) that became effective upon the enactment of the law. 



Within the context of moving toward a ``continuum of care'' system designed to combat homelessness, eligible activities
include the rehabilitation or conversion of buildings for use as emergency shelters for the homeless, payment of
certain operating and essential services expenses, and homeless prevention activities.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

Paperwork Reduction Act Statement 



The information collection requirements contained in this notice have been approved by the Office of Management
and Budget, under section 3504(h) of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501-3520), and assigned
OMB control number 2506-0135. 



I. Purpose and Substantive Description 



A. Authority and Purpose
 


The ESG program was first established in section 101(g) of Public Law 99-500 (approved October 18, 1986, 100
Stat. 1783-242), making appropriations for FY 1987 as provided in H.R. 5313. The program was reauthorized with
amendments in the Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act (Pub. L. 100-77, approved July 22, 1987, sections
411-417) (as amended, ``McKinney Act''). Section 832(f) of the National Affordable Housing Act (Pub. L. 101-625,
approved November 28, 1990, 42 U.S.C. 11371-11378) (NAHA), provided for the explicit eligibility of Indian
tribes for ESG program assistance and established a set-aside allocation for Indian tribes that is equal to 1 percent
of the amounts appropriated for the ESG Program. Funding was provided for this program in the Department's appropriation
acts for fiscal years 1991 (Pub. L. 101-507, approved November 5, 1990), 1992 (Pub. L. 102-139, approved
October 29, 1991), and 1993 (Pub. L. 102-389, approved October 6, 1992). Regulations governing the Emergency
Shelter Grants (ESG) program are found at 24 CFR 576, except where superseded by statutory amendments under NAHA and
the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 (Pub. L. 102-550, approved October 28, 1992) (1992 Act), as
discussed below. 

Assistance provided to Indian tribes and Alaskan Native villages under this NOFA will be used to help improve the quality
of existing emergency shelters for the homeless, make available additional emergency shelters, meet the costs of
operating emergency shelters and of providing essential social services to homeless individuals, and help prevent
homelessness. The term ``emergency shelter'' is defined in 24 CFR 576.3. This ESG set-aside allocation will increase
the availability and expedite receipt of program funds to Native American communities. 

(1) 

Definition of ``Indian tribe.'' 

Section 832(f)(1) of NAHA provides that the definition of the term ``Indian tribe'' has the same meaning given that
term in section 102(a)(17) of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974. An Indian tribe means any Indian tribe,
band, group, or nation, including Alaska Indians, Aleuts, and Eskimos and any Alaskan Native village, of the United
States, that is considered an eligible recipient under Title I of the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance
Act (25 U.S.C. 450) or was considered an eligible recipient under the State and Local Fiscal Assistance Act of 1972
(31 U.S.C. 6701) before repeal of that Act. Eligibility for assistance under the Indian Self-Determination and Education
Assistance Act is determined by the Bureau of Indian Affairs. 

(2) 

Emergency shelter 

means any facility, the primary purpose of which is to provide temporary or transitional shelter for the homeless
in general or for specific populations of the homeless.

Continuum of Care

. This program makes possible the first steps in a ``continuum of care'' system designed to assist homeless persons
find permanent housing and regain independent living. Outreach/assessment activities, drop-in centers, and essential
life-saving services may be funded through this program. Funds may also be used to prevent homelessness through short-term
rental assistance, legal assistance, and other services related to individuals and families remaining in their
own housing. The program facilitates the creation, improvement, and operation of emergency shelters and transitional
housing as well as the provision of services such as case management, substance abuse treatment, and job training.
For projects serving families, the projects and activities should serve the family together and work to strengthen
the family structure. 

A continuum of care system consists of three basic components: 
(a) A prevention plan and outreach activities designed to bring homeless persons into a system and assess their needs;

(b) Transitional housing combined with rehabilitative services; and 
(c) Placement into permanent housing. 



B. Statutory Amendments 


This notice addresses section 832 of the NAHA (104 Stat. 4359), which contains numerous amendments to the McKinney
Act, and several amendments to the ESG program in the 1992 Act. These statutory amendments supersede applicable provisions
of the program regulations found at 24 CFR 576. The Department is publishing in this notice a description of the statutory
changes to assist Indian tribes in complying with program requirements, including the NAHA and 1992 Act amendments.


National Affordable Housing Act Amendments: The NAHA changes are described in the following Sections I.B (1)-(6)
of this NOFA. 

(1) 

Extension of eligibility to Indian tribes. 

Section 832(f) of NAHA expressly extends eligibility for assistance under the ESG program to Indian tribes, and has
the effect of applying the same formula as used in the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program for determining
the amount of ESG funds to be set-aside for Indian tribes. The one percent figure for the Indian tribe set-aside is dictated
by sections 832(f)(3) and 913(b) of NAHA. 

(2) 

Administrative costs. 

Section 832(b)(1) of NAHA permits recipients to use up to 5% of an ESG Program grant for administrative purposes. This
amount equals 5% of the total of amounts of ESG funds requested for all other eligible activities. Administrative
costs include: costs of accounting for the use of grant funds; preparing reports for submission to HUD or to the State;
obtaining program audits; conducting environmental reviews; coordinating program activities; and similar costs
related to administering the grant. These costs do not include the costs of carrying out other activities eligible
under the ESG program. 

(3) 

Use of funds for essential services. 

Section 832(c) of NAHA increased from 20% to 30% the percentage of a grant that may be used to provide essential services.
Consistent with this amendment, the Department will apply its waiver authority in section 414(b) of the McKinney
Act to the new, higher 30% limitation. As with the previous 20% cap, the 30% limit is to be measured against the aggregate
amount of each emergency shelter grant to an Indian tribe. Section 832(f)(6) of NAHA makes the limitations on the provision
of essential services applicable to Indian tribes. 

(4) 

Use of funds for prevention of homelessness. 

Homelessness prevention was added as a category of eligible activities by section 423 of the Stewart B. McKinney Homeless
Assistance Amendments Act (Pub. L. 100-688, approved November 7, 1988), which also treated these activities
as ``essential services.'' However, section 832(d) of NAHA withdraws homelessness prevention activities from
categorization as ``essential services'', and imposes a separate limit of 30% of the aggregate amount of assistance
to any recipient, including an Indian tribe, that may be used for efforts to prevent homelessness. 

Thus, under NAHA, essential services and homelessness prevention are now each subject to a 30% cap. However, unlike
the category of essential services, there is no statutory authority to permit a waiver of the cap on the amount of assistance
that may be used for homelessness prevention activities. By its express terms, the statutory waiver is available
only in the category of essential services.

(5) 

Confidentiality of records for family violence services. 

Section 832(e) of NAHA requires each recipient to certify that it will develop and implement procedures to ensure
the confidentiality of records pertaining to any individual provided family violence prevention or treatment services
with ESG Program assistance. In addition, the address or location of any ESG-assisted housing used as a family violence
shelter may not be made public without the written authorization of persons responsible for the operation of the shelter.
This new certification is included in the application kit, as provided in Section III of this NOFA. 

(6) 

Establishes habitability standards. 

Section 832(g) of NAHA requires the Secretary to prescribe the minimum standards of habitability appropriate to
ensure that emergency shelters assisted by this program are environments that provide appropriate privacy, safety,
and sanitary and other health-related conditions for homeless persons and families. A description of the Minimum
Habitability Standards and the required certification is included in the application kit, as provided in Section
III of this NOFA. The Habitability Standards that have been developed under section 832(g) of NAHA to apply to emergency
shelters are as follows: 

(a) 

Structure and materials. 

The shelter shall be structurally sound so as not to pose any threat to the health and safety of the occupants and so as
to protect the occupants from the environment. 

(b) 

Access. 

The shelter shall be accessible and capable of being utilized without unauthorized use of other private properties.
The building shall provide an alternate means of egress in case of fire. 

(c) 

Space and security. 

Each occupant shall be afforded adequate space and security for the occupant's person and belongings. Each occupant
shall be provided an acceptable place to sleep. 

(d) 

Interior air quality. 

Every room or space shall be provided with natural or mechanical ventilation. The shelter shall be free of pollutants
in the air at levels that threaten the health of the occupants. 

(e) 

Water supply. 

The water supply shall be free from contamination at levels that threaten the health of the recipients. 

(f) 

Sanitary facilities. 

Shelter occupants shall have access to sanitary facilities that are in proper operating condition, can be used in
privacy, and are adequate for personal cleanliness and the disposal of human waste. 

(g) 

Thermal environment. 

The shelter shall have adequate heating and cooling facilities in proper operating condition. 

(h) 

Illumination and electricity. 

The shelter shall have adequate natural or artificial illumination to permit normal indoor activities and to support
the health and safety of occupants. Sufficient electrical sources shall be provided to permit use of essential electrical
appliances while assuring safety from fire. 

(i) 

Food preparation and refuse disposal. 

All food preparation areas shall contain suitable space and equipment to store, prepare, and serve food in a sanitary
manner. 

(j) 

Sanitary condition. 

The shelter and its equipment shall be maintained in sanitary condition. 



Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 Amendments: 

The 1992 Act changes are described in the following Sections I.B (7)-(9) of this NOFA. 

(7) 

Certification of involvement of homeless individuals and families. 

The recipient must certify that, to the maximum extent practicable, it will involve homeless individuals and families,
through employment, volunteer services, or otherwise, in providing services and in constructing, renovating,
maintaining, and operating facilities, where assistance is provided for those activities under the program. 

(8) 

Termination of assistance. 

The recipient may terminate assistance provided to an individual or a family only in accordance with a formal process
established by the recipient that recognizes the rights of the individuals affected, which may include a hearing.


(9) 

Eligibility of staff costs. 

Staff costs relating to the operation of emergency shelters are specifically recognized as an eligible activity,
but not more than 10 percent of the amount of any grant may be used for these costs. 



C. CHAS and NEPA Requirements 



(1) Indian tribes are not included in NAHA's definition of ``jurisdiction'', the entity charged with submitting
a Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy (CHAS) under section 105 of NAHA. Therefore, Indian tribes are not
required to submit a CHAS. Furthermore, Indian tribes will not be required to certify to consistency with the State's
CHAS to receive ESG funding. The Department reiterates its position stated in adopting the CHAS Interim Rule (56 FR
4484, February 4, 1991) that, given the sovereign status of Indian tribes, a State cannot be deemed the appropriate
jurisdiction to apply its housing strategy to programs administered by Indian tribes (see 56 FR 4481-82). 

(2) The assumption of environmental responsibilities specified in section 104(g)(1) of the Housing and Community
Development Act of 1974 was authorized for certain recipients of assistance under the McKinney Act, pursuant to section
443 of the McKinney Act. Assumption of the responsibilities for the ESG program is set forth in 24 CFR 576.52, and shall
apply to Indian tribes in the same manner as described for a unit of general local government or territory. When the
tribe does not have the legal capacity to assume the environmental responsibility (see 24 CFR 58.11), the appropriate
HUD Office of Native American Programs (ONAP) Field Office will conduct the environmental review. 



D. Allocation Amounts 


This notice announces the availability of a total of $1,469,000 in funding provided by the Department's appropriations
acts for fiscal year 1994 and unused funds from fiscal year 1993 for competitive grants to Indian tribes for emergency
shelter grants. Indian Program Office set-aside allocations of the total amount are detailed in the following chart:

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940628-2-00139 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940628-2-00097 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 








HUD reserves the right to negotiate reductions in the amounts requested by applicants based on the overall demand
for the funds. HUD further reserves the right to reallocate these amounts as provided in Section I.G, Ranking and Selection,
of this NOFA. Each Indian tribe must spend all of the grant amounts it was awarded within 24 months of the date of the grant
award by HUD. Any emergency shelter grant amounts that are not spent within this time period may be recaptured and added
to the following fiscal year's ESG set-aside for Indian tribes. 



E. Eligibility and Threshold Requirements



Applications are invited from Indian tribes for assistance under the emergency shelter grants set-aside program.
Private nonprofit organizations are not eligible to apply directly to HUD for a grant, but may receive funding from
a grantee if the grantee determines that the nonprofit has the financial and organizational capacity to carry out
the proposed activities. 

The selection process for the Indian tribe set-aside program consists of a preliminary threshold review. HUD will
review an application to determine whether: 

(1) The application is adequate in form, time, and completeness; 



</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940628-2-00140 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940628-2-00097 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(2) The applicant is eligible; and 
(3) The proposed activities and persons to be served are eligible for assistance under the program. 



F. Rating Criteria 



Applications that fulfill each of the threshold review requirements described in Section I.E, Eligibility and Threshold
Requirements, of this NOFA will be rated up to 1,000 points based on the following criteria. Successful applicants
must receive points under each of the criteria. 

(1) 

Applicant capacity (300 points). 

HUD will award up to 300 points to an applicant that demonstrates the ability to carry out activities under its proposed
program within a reasonable time, and in a successful manner, after execution of the grant agreement by HUD. Reviewers'
knowledge of the applicant's previous experience will weigh heavily in the scoring. Documented evidence of poor
or slow performance will enter strongly into that determination. The applications that rate highest on this criterion
will show substantial experience as an organization and/or staff in past endeavors that are directly related to the
proposed project. 

(2) 

Need (200 points). 

HUD will award up to 200 points to an applicant that demonstrates the existence of an unmet need for the proposed project
in the area to be served. The applicants with the highest scores on this criterion will be the ones that: (a) Clearly
define the unmet housing and essential services needs of the homeless population proposed to be served in the area
to be served by the project; (b) demonstrate in-depth knowledge of the population to be served and its needs; and (c)
set forth an outreach strategy that assures that the intended population will be served. 


(3) 

Service to homeless population (200 points). 

HUD will award up to 200 points to an applicant that proposes to serve that part of the Indian homeless population that
is most difficult to reach and serve, i.e., those persons having a primary nighttime residence that is a public or private
place not designed for, or ordinarily used as, sleeping accommodations for human beings. In urban areas, this is usually
referred to as living ``on the street.'' To the extent that Indians living on reservations live in such situations
(e.g., sleeping in cars, abandoned structures, out in the open), they meet the definition of living in conditions
similar to ``living on the street.'' 

HUD will focus upon proposed outreach and intake plans, and, especially, the degree to which such plans would maximize
the likelihood that homeless persons would be served by the proposed project. The outreach strategy/intake procedures
to seek out and evaluate the needs of the population to be served should be clearly described in the application. 


(4) 

Appropriateness of essential services (300 points). 

HUD will award up to 300 points to an applicant that proposes essential services that: (a) are appropriate to the needs
of the population proposed to be served; (b) are used or coordinated with existing sources of supportive services
and networks of support in the community; and (c) help, to the degree possible, to move residents to longer term housing
situations. Applicants should describe what services are available and how they will make those services accessible
to the people they serve. In addition, HUD will evaluate the means by which the people to be served will be assisted in
moving to permanent housing that is appropriate and affordable. Applicants should describe what resources are available
to assist the population they serve to find permanent housing. 




G. Ranking and Selection 




Applications from Indian tribes within the area served by the applicable HUD Office of Native American Programs will
be assigned a rating score and placed in ranked order, based upon the rating criteria listed in Section I.F of this NOFA.
Only those applications receiving points under each of the rating criteria, and at least 500 points in total, will
be given funding consideration. In the final stage of the selection process, qualified applicants will be selected
for funding in accordance with their ranked order within each area or field office, to the extent that funds are available
within that area or field office. 


In the event of a tie between applicants, the applicant with the highest total points for rating criterion (2), Need,
in Section I.F of this NOFA, will be selected. In the event of a procedural error that, when corrected, would warrant
selection of an otherwise eligible applicant under this NOFA, HUD may select that applicant when sufficient funds
become available. 


Depending on the availability of funds, the Department may fund qualified applications regardless of location.
If an Indian program office has insufficient funds to make awards to all of its qualified applicants, the Department
may reallocate funds to this office from any other Indian program office that has funds remaining after making awards
to all of its qualified applications. 




II. Application Process



A. Obtaining Applications 




Application packages will be available beginning June 28, 1994, from the HUD Offices of Native American Programs
listed in the Appendix to this NOFA. 




B. Submitting Applications 




Information regarding the submission of applications is included in the package. 

An original application must be received at the HUD Office of Native American Programs serving the area in which the
applicant's project is located by no later than 4:00 p.m. local time (i.e., the time in the office where the application
is submitted) on September 12, 1994. A list of Offices of Native American Programs appears as an Appendix to this NOFA.
Applications transmitted by FAX will not be accepted. 


At the time of submission, one copy of the completed application must also be sent to HUD's Office of Special Needs Assistance
Programs at the address listed at the beginning of this NOFA. A determination that an application was received on time
will be made solely on receipt of the original application at the Office of Native American Programs. 


The above-stated application deadline is firm as to date and hour. In the interest of fairness to all competing applicants,
the Department will treat as ineligible for consideration any application that is received after the deadline. Applicants
should take this practice into account and make early submission of their materials to avoid any risk of loss of ineligibility
brought about by unanticipated delays or other delivery-related problems.
