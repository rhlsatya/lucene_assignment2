NATIONAL CREDIT UNION ADMINISTRATION








Mergers of Federally-Insured Credit Unions: Voluntary Termination or Conversion of Insured Status



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

National Credit Union Administration (NCUA).



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of proposed rulemaking.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The proposed rule would amend part 708 to clarify that the rules and regulations on mergers, voluntary termination
and insurance conversion apply not only to federally-insured credit unions converting to non federally-insured
credit unions, but to federally-insured credit unions converting to any institution that is not NCUSIF insured.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 




A. Background



Section 205(b)(1) of the Federal Credit Union Act, 12 U.S.C. 1785(b)(1) provides that a federally-insured credit
union seeking to merge or consolidate with a ``noninsured credit union or institution'' must obtain the prior written
consent of the NCUA Board. The term ``insured credit union'' means one that is insured by the NCUA Board through the
National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund (NCUSIF); ``noninsured credit union'' means one that is not so insured.
(See Section 101(7) of the Act (12 U.S.C. 1752(7)). The Board has determined that the term ``institution'' as used
in Section 205(b)(1)(A) of the Act applies to any financial institution that is not insured through the NCUSIF, such
as banks and savings and loans as well as institutions that carry no federal insurance. Section 205(c) of the Act sets
forth the six criteria the Board will consider in granting or withholding approval under subsection (b).

In addition, part 708 of the NCUA Rules and Regulations sets forth procedures and requirements of mergers and termination/conversion
of insurance. Part 708 addresses situations where an insured credit union either voluntarily terminates federal
insurance or merges with a credit union that is not federally insured. It does not specifically address the situation
where an insured credit union merges with a non credit union institution. The effect on credit union members_that
is, the loss of membership in a federally insured credit union_is the same no matter what type of financial institution
the credit union merges into. This amendment clarifies part 708 to apply to all merger and termination/conversion
situations where the continuing institution is not insured by NCUSIF.

The amendment is also needed to provide NCUA with clear authority to prevent abuses in connection with conversions
of insured status. In a limited number of past cases, credit unions attempting to convert to private insurance or FDIC
insurance have argued that NCUA has no jurisdiction over these actions. This has called into question NCUA's authority
to require membership votes, to monitor the fairness of those votes, and to ensure the transaction is handled in the
best interests of the members and the NCUSIF.

In one case, a credit union incurred substantial legal and other expenses attempting to convert to an FDIC insured
bank. The credit union was unsuccessful and was ultimately liquidated for insolvency due in part to the expenses associated
with the conversion efforts.

The Board is aware of a limited number of more recent instances where federally insured credit unions have been solicited
for conversion to other institution charters by law firms and consultants. The supposed benefits that have been cited
in these solicitations have had nothing to do with the good of the credit union membership, but rather have been motivated
by the significant fee income the outside parties expect to generate and the prospect of financial gain to management,
through compensation of directors, increased management salary potential, stock options and other means. The Board
hereby serves notice that these solicitations should stop, and that any expense of credit union funds pursuing such
a transaction that is motivated by other than the members' interests will be addressed through the use of all available
administrative powers.

Further, while this regulatory action addresses mergers and consolidations, the Board cautions anyone who would
consider using, as a substitute, a voluntary liquidation with the payout to members being in the form of deposits and/or
stock in another institution. Voluntary liquidation requires a direct payout, to the members of all shares and equity,
and the NCUA Board, working with state regulators where appropriate, will stop any liquidation transaction that
does not include direct payment as a clear element of the liquidation plan.

The Board has in the past worked with the state regulators when approving mergers and consolidations of federally-insured
state chartered credit unions with other credit unions. It will do so as well when reviewing mergers and consolidations
of federally-insured state chartered credit unions with other financial institutions. The Board values its positive
working relationship with state credit union supervisors. This action is not intended to supplant that relationship,
but to ensure the means exist to prevent losses to the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund and protect the rights
of members. The Board will continue to cooperate with state regulators in cases involving federally insured state
chartered credit unions.


The current rule requires credit unions considering the merger/conversion route to submit modifications or additions
to the member notices to the NCUA Regional Director and the appropriate state authority for approval before the information
is sent to the members. 12 CFR 708.303. The Board is proposing to modify the requirement for Regional Director approval
and require all credit unions to obtain institution merger/conversion notice modification approvals from the Board.
As under the current rule, the Board will not approve proposed notices that do not fully apprise members of the negative
consequences of the action as well as any windfall benefits to officials. The rule states that approval of the modifications
may be withheld if it ``is determined that the credit union, by inclusion or omission of information, would materially
mislead or misinform its membership.'' The Board wants to be very clear that approval of a proposed notice to members
is not an approval of the proposed merger/conversion. Since part 708 does not provide an approved notice to members
for credit union to institution merger/conversions, the Board expects all federally insured credit unions proposing
such a merger/conversion to request its approval of proposed notices. The Board is requesting comment on whether
part 708 should include a uniform member notice for institution merger/conversions.

Regulatory Procedures



Regulatory Flexibility Act



The Regulatory Flexibility Act requires the NCUA to prepare an analysis to describe any significant economic impact
any regulation may have on a potential number of small credit unions (primarily those under $1 million in assets).
Preliminary analysis concerning the effect the proposed rule will have on small credit unions indicates that no significant
economic impact will result if the rule is promulgated by the NCUA Board. The proposed rule merely clarifies statutory
authority. Therefore, the NCUA Board has determined and certifies under the authority granted in 5 U.S.C. 605(b)
that the proposed rule, if adopted, will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small credit
unions. Accordingly, the NCUA Board has determined that a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is not required.



Paperwork Reduction Act



These amendments do not change the paperwork requirements.



Executive Order 12612



Executive Order 12612 requires NCUA to consider the effect of its actions on state interests. The proposed regulation
applies to all federally insured credit unions. However, it makes no substantive changes but merely clarifies existing
requirements. The Federal Credit Union Act gave the NCUA the authority to approve all insured credit union mergers
or consolidations with ``institutions.'' 12 U.S.C. 1785(b)(1)(A). The NCUA Office of General Counsel has also issued
several public opinion letters consistent with these clarifications. These letters are available on request to
the NCUA Public and Congressional Affairs Office. The NCUA Board has determined that this amendment is not likely
to have any direct effect on states, on the relationship between the states, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities
among the various levels of government.

Airworthiness Directives: All Model Airplanes Equipped 
with Turbocharged Engines


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPRM). 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 Numerous accidents and incidents attributed 
to turbocharger failure has prompted the Federal 
Aviation Administration (FAA) to more thoroughly 
investigate the conditions related to these accidents. 
Improper or lack of pilot action following the 
turbocharger failures may have contributed to many of 
the accidents and incidents. In order to adequately 
make a determination as to what type of action to take 
(if any), the FAA is issuing this advance notice to 
seek comments from interested persons regarding 
possible problems with airplanes equipped with 
turbocharged engines. The FAA will evaluate all 
comments and ideas and then research the situation to 
decide whether rulemaking is needed. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Comments Invited 


Interested persons are invited to participate in the making of the proposed rule by submitting such written data,
views, or arguments as they may desire. Communications should identify the Rules Docket number and be submitted in
triplicate to the address specified above. All communications received on or before the closing date for comments,
specified above, will be considered before taking action on the proposed rule. The proposals contained in this notice
may be changed in light of the comments received. 

Comments are specifically invited on the overall regulatory, economic, environmental, and energy aspects of the
proposed rule. All comments submitted will be available, both before and after the closing date for comments, in the
Rules Docket for examination by interested persons. A report that summarizes each FAA-public contact concerned
with the substance of this proposal will be filed in the Rules Docket. 

Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments submitted in response to this notice must submit
a self-addressed, stamped postcard on which the following statement is made: ``Comments to Docket No. 94-CE-11-AD.''
The postcard will be date stamped and returned to the commenter. 



Availability of ANPRMs 



Any person may obtain a copy of this ANPRM by submitting a request to the FAA, Central Region, Office of the Assistant
Chief Counsel, Attention: Rules Docket No. 94-CE-11-AD, Room 1558, 601 E. 12th Street, Kansas City,
Missouri 64106. 



Discussion 



From January 1986 to May 1993, the FAA received 580 service difficulty reports relating to failures of turbocharger
systems on airplanes equipped with turbocharged engines. A study of a five-year time period (January 1988 through
May 1993) reveals 88 accidents and incidents, resulting in 35 injuries and 6 deaths. 

Several reports of these accidents, incidents, and service difficulties indicate problems with installation,
inspection, maintenance, service, or overhaul. After accomplishing a thorough review of these failures, the National
Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) notes that improper pilot action following the turbocharger malfunction or
failure may have been a contributing factor in many of the accidents and incidents. 

Numerous airplane manufacturers do not provide written procedures addressing turbocharger failures. Section
23.1585 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 23.1585) consists of the following: 




For each airplane, information concerning normal and emergency procedures and other pertinent information necessary
to safe operation must be furnished, including, * * *

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940630-1-00007 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940630-1-00002 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The regulation then goes on to list several different examples, but is not specific as to information regarding turbocharger
failures. In addition, FAA-approved Specification for Pilots Operating Handbook (GAMA Specification No. 1), prepared
by the General Aviation Manufacturers Association (GAMA), does not specifically address this issue, but, like the
regulations, includes a general statement:




Emergency procedures and other pertinent information necessary for safe operations shall be provided for emergencies
peculiar to a particular airplane design, operating or handling characteristic. 




In order to adequately make a determination as to what type of action to take (if any), the FAA is issuing this advance
notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPRM) to provide an opportunity for the general public to participate in the decision
whether to initiate rulemaking. Interested persons are encouraged to provide information that describes what they
consider the best action (if any) to be taken to correct the possible problem. In this regard, the FAA is especially
interested in comments and viewpoints on the following: 

1. If your airplane was to experience turbocharger failure, would you know what precautions and pilot actions to take?
Would these be as a result of Airplane Flight Manual/Pilot Operating Handbook (AFM/POH) issues and supplements?
Do you believe a safety hazard exists if information related to this subject is not included in the AFM/POH? 

2. Does a safety issue exist on turbocharged airplanes that do not have an AFM/POH, and would placarding these airplanes
solve this safety problem? 

3. Should FAA-approved GAMA Specification No. 1 be revised to include the requirement of AFM/POH information regarding
precautions and pilot action in case of a turbocharger failure? 

4. Should the FAA change policy to require direct reference to this subject on all new model airplanes equipped with
turbocharged engines? 

5. Please provide any other information that you feel is pertinent in helping the FAA determine what type of action
(if any) needs to be taken. 






Issued in Kansas City, Missouri, on June 24, 1994.

By letter dated May 24, 1994, (Administrative Record No. TX-576), Texas submitted a proposed amendment to its
program pursuant to SMCRA. Texas submitted the proposed amendment in response to required program amendments at
30 CFR 943.16(c) (1) and (2), (d), (f), (j) (1), (2), (3), and (4), (r), and (s) (59 FR 13200, March 21, 1994). The provisions
of the Texas Administrative Code (TAC) at 16 TAC 11.221 and the Texas Surface Coal Mining and Reclamation Act that Texas
proposes to amend are:

1. 

Texas Coal Mining Regulations (TCMR) 778.116(m), Identification of interests and compliance information

.

Texas proposes to add language to require a permit application to include information on violations received pursuant
to SMCRA's implementing Federal regulations, all SMCRA-approved Federal programs (OSM-administered Indian lands
program and Federal programs for States), and all SMCRA-approved State programs, not just the Texas program, and
information on air or water environmental protection violations received pursuant to any State laws, rules or regulations
enacted pursuant to Federal laws, rules, or regulations and incurred by the applicant in any State, not just Texas.

2. 

TCMR 786.215 (e) and (f), Review of permit applications.

(a) Texas proposes at TCMR 786.215(e)(1) to require the Commission to consider, as a basis for permit denial, information
on cessation orders issued by States other than Texas, and

(b) Texas proposes at TCMR 786.215(f) to require that issuance of permits is specifically prohibited whenever the
Commission makes a determination that the applicant, anyone who owns or controls the applicant, or the operator specified
in the application controls or has controlled surface coal mining and reclamation operations with a demonstrated
pattern of willful violations of the Texas Surface Coal Mining and Reclamation Act (TSCMRA), SMCRA, SMCRA's implementing
Federal regulations, SMCRA-approved Federal programs, and all SMCRA-approved State programs, not just the Texas
program, of such nature, duration, and with such resulting irreparable damage to the environment, as to indicate
an intent not to comply with these laws, rules, and regulations.

3. TCMR 786.216 (i) through (n), Criteria for permit approval or denial

.

Texas proposes to delete TCMR 786.216(i) and to recodify paragraphs (j) through (o), accordingly. Existing TCMR
786.216(i) prohibits permit approval unless the Commission finds, in writing, that the applicant or the operator,
if other than the applicant, does not control and has not controlled mining operations with a demonstrated pattern
of willful violations of TSCMRA.

4. 

TCMR 788.225 (f), (g) and (h), Commission review of outstanding permits

.

(a) Texas proposes to revise TCMR 788.225(f)(3) to allow the Commission, when it finds that a permit was improvidently
issued, to suspend the permit until the outstanding violation is abated or the penalty or fee is paid, and to add TCMR
788.225(f)(4) to allow the Commission to rescind such permit under the provisions of proposed TCMR 788.225(g).

(b) Texas proposes to add TCMR 788.225(g) to provide that the Commission shall, for a permit found to have been improvidently
issued, (1) serve the permittee with notice of the proposed suspension and rescission, and include in the notice the
reasons for the Commission's findings, and (2) specify the conditions that must be met in order to prevent suspension
or rescission of such improvidently issued permit.

(c) Texas proposes to add TCMR 788.25(h) to specify that upon permit suspension or rescission, the permittee shall
cease all surface coal mining and reclamation operations, except for specific abatement, reclamation, and other
environmental protection measures required by the Commission.

(d) Texas proposes to recodify existing paragraph (h) as TCMR 788.225(i).

5. 

Article 5920-11, (TSMCRA), section 21(c), Reporting notices of violations in permit applications

.

Texas proposes to delete from the first sentence of section 21(c) the words ``within the state'' from the phrase ``in
connection with any surface coal mining operation within the state during the three-year period.''



III. Public Comment Procedures



In accordance with the provisions of 30 CFR 732.17(h), OSM is seeking comments on whether the proposed amendment satisfies
the applicable program approval criteria of 30 CFR 732.15. If the amendment is deemed adequate, it will become part
of the Texas program.

Written comments should be specific, pertain only to the issues proposed in this rulemaking, and include explanations
in support of the commenter's recommendations. Comments received after the time indicated under 

DATES

 or at locations other than the Tulsa Field Office will not necessarily be considered in the final rulemaking or included
in the administrative record.


2. Public Hearing


Persons wishing to testify at the public hearing should contact the person listed under 

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT

 by 4 p.m., c.d.t., July 15, 1994. The location and time of the hearing will be arranged with those persons requesting
the hearing. If no one requests an opportunity to testify at the public hearing, the hearing will not be held.
Filing of a written statement at the time of the hearing is requested as it will greatly assist the transcriber. Submission
of written statements in advance of the hearing will allow OSM officials to prepare adequate responses and appropriate
questions. 
The public hearing will continue on the specified date until all persons scheduled to testify have been heard. Persons
in the audience who have not been scheduled to testify, and who wish to do so, will be heard following those who have been
scheduled. The hearing will end after all persons scheduled to testify and persons present in the audience who wish
to testify have been heard.


3. Public Meeting


If only one person requests an opportunity to testify at a hearing, a public meeting, rather than a public hearing,
may be held. Persons wishing to meet with OSM representatives to discuss the proposed amendment may request a meeting
by contacting the person listed under 

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT.

 All such meetings will be open to the public and, if possible, notices of meetings will be posted at the locations listed
under 

ADDRESSES.

 A written summary of each meeting will be made a part of the administrative record.


IV. Procedural Determinations


1. Executive Order 12866


This rule is exempted from review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under Executive Order 12866 (Regulatory
Planning and Review).


2. Executive Order 12778


The Department of the Interior has conducted the reviews required by section 2 of Executive Order 12778 (Civil Justice
Reform) and has determined that this rule meets the applicable standards of subsections (a) and (b) of that section.
However, these standards are not applicable to the actual language of State regulatory programs and program amendments
since each such program is drafted and promulgated by a specific State, not by OSM. Under sections 503 and 505 of SMCRA
(30 U.S.C. 1253 and 12550) and the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 730.11, 732.15, and 732.17(h)(10), decisions on proposed
State regulatory programs and program amendments submitted by the States must be based solely on a determination
of whether the submittal is consistent with SMCRA and its implementing Federal regulations and whether the other
requirements of 30 CFR Parts 730, 731, and 732 have been met.


3. National Environmental Policy Act


No environmental impact statement is required for this rule since section 702(d) of SMCRA (30 U.S.C. 1292(d)) provides
that agency decisions on proposed State regulatory program provisions do not constitute major Federal actions within
the meaning of section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act (42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)).


4. Paperwork Reduction Act


This rule does not contain information collection requirements that require approval by OMB under the Paperwork
Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3507 

et seq

.).


5. Regulatory Flexibility Act


The Department of the Interior has determined that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq

.). The State submittal which is the subject of this rule is based upon counterpart Federal regulations for which an
economic analysis was prepared and certification made that such regulations would not have a significant economic
effect upon a substantial number of small entities. Accordingly, this rule will ensure that existing requirements
previously promulgated by OSM will be implemented by the State. In making the determination as to whether this rule
would have a significant economic impact, the Department relied upon the data and assumptions for the counterpart
Federal regulations.

Revision of Patent Cooperation Treaty Provisions



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Patent and Trademark Office, Commerce.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of proposed rulemaking.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Patent and Trademark Office (Office) proposes to amend the rules of practice relating to applications filed under
the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) in accordance with revised regulations under the PCT. The proposed changes will
result in a procedure whereby international applications improperly filed in the United States Receiving Office
(RO/US) will, for a fee, be forwarded for processing by the International Bureau as Receiving Office.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

These proposed rule changes will improve filing and processing procedures for applicants in the filing of international
applications.



On September 20 to 29, 1993, representatives of the patent offices of the member countries, in a series of meetings
held in Geneva, Switzerland, agreed upon several changes to the PCT regulations which are designed to make the PCT
more user-friendly. One of the significant changes to the PCT regulations was the addition of a new section (PCT Rule
19.4) which provides for transmittal of an international application to the International Bureau, acting in its
capacity as Receiving Office, in certain instances. Several other changes were agreed upon including modifications
to certain existing regulations. Some of these adopted changes require corresponding changes in Title 37, CFR.

Under the regulations currently in effect, an applicant is required, on filing the international application in
the United States, to specify an applicant who is a resident or national of the United States.

The practice under the revised PCT regulations permits an international application filed with the United States
Receiving Office to be forwarded to the International Bureau for processing in its capacity as a receiving office
if the international application has an applicant who is a resident or national of a PCT Contracting State or has no
residence or nationality indicated, but does not have an applicant who is indicated as being a U.S. resident or national.
The Receiving Office of the International Bureau will consider the international application to be received as of
the date accorded by the United States Receiving Office. This practice will avoid the loss of a filing date in those
instances where the United States Receiving Office is not competent to act, but where the international application
is filed by an applicant who is a national or resident of a PCT Contracting State. Where questions arise regarding residence
or nationality, e.g., where residence and nationality are not clearly set forth, the application will be forwarded
to the International Bureau as Receiving Office. If all of the applicants are indicated to be residents and nationals
of non-PCT Contracting States, PCT Rule 19.4 does not apply and the application is denied an international filing
date.

Discussion of Specific Rules



Section 1.412(c)(6), if added as proposed, would reflect that the United States Receiving Office, where it is not
a competent Receiving Office under PCT Rule 19.1 or 19.2, could transmit the international application to the International
Bureau for processing in its capacity as a Receiving Office.

Section 1.421(a), if amended as proposed, would clarify that applications filed by applicants who are not residents
or nationals of the United States, but who are residents or nationals of a PCT Contracting state or who indicate no residence
or nationality, will, upon timely payment of the proper fee, have their application forwarded to the International
Bureau for processing in its capacity as a Receiving Office.

Section 1.445(a)(5), if added as proposed, would establish a fee equivalent to the transmittal fee in paragraph (a)(1)
of this section for transmittal of an international application to the International Bureau for processing in its
capacity as a Receiving Office.

Section 10.9, if amended as proposed, would add a new provision to be consistent with the change to PCT Rule 90.1, clarifying
that an attorney or agent having the right to act before the International Bureau when acting as Receiving Office may
represent the applicant before the U.S. International Searching Authority or the U.S. International Preliminary
Examining Authority. An individual who has the right to practice before the International Bureau when acting as Receiving
Office, and who is not registered under  10.6, may not prosecute patent applications in the national stage in
the Office.



Other Considerations



The proposed rule changes are in conformity with the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601
et seq., Executive Order 12612, and the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. This proposed rule has
been determined to be not significant for the purposes of E.O. 12866.

The General Counsel of the Department of Commerce has certified to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy, Small Business
Administration, that the proposed rule changes will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities (Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 605(b)), because the proposed rules would affect only a small
number of international applications and would provide more streamlined and simplified procedures for filing and
prosecuting international applications under the PCT.

The Patent and Trademark Office has also determined that this notice has no federalism implications affecting the
relationship between the National government and the States as outlined in Executive Order 12612.

These rule changes will not impose any additional burden under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, 44 U.S.C. 3501
et seq. The paperwork burden imposed by adherence to the PCT is currently approved by the Office of Management and Budget
under control number 0651-0021.

Notice is hereby given that pursuant to the authority granted to the Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks by 35 U.S.C.
6, the Patent and Trademark Office proposes to amend Title 37 of the Code of Federal Regulations as set forth below.

Approval and Promulgation of Air Quality Implementation Plans; Commonwealth of Pennsylvania; Enhanced Motor Vehicle
Inspection and Maintenance Program 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed conditional approval.

 


</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 EPA is proposing to conditionally approve a State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision submitted by the Commonwealth
of Pennsylvania. This revision establishes and requires the implementation of an enhanced motor vehicle inspection
and maintenance (I/M) program in the counties of Allegheny, Beaver, Berks, Blair, Bucks, Cambria, Centre, Chester,
Cumberland, Dauphin, Delaware, Erie, Lackawanna, Lancaster, Lebanon, Lehigh, Luzerne, Lycoming, Mercer, Montgomery,
Northampton, Philadelphia, Washington, Westmoreland and York. The intended effect of this action is to propose
conditional approval of the Pennsylvania enhanced motor vehicle I/M program. This action is being taken under Section
110 of the Clean Air Act.

 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

I. Introduction 



Motor vehicles are significant contributors of volatile organic compounds (VOC), carbon monoxide (CO) and nitrogen
oxide (NOx) emissions. An important control measure to reduce these emissions is the implementation of a motor vehicle
inspection and maintenance (I/M) program. Despite being subject to the most rigorous vehicle pollution control
program in the world, cars and trucks still create about half of the ozone air pollution and nearly all of the carbon
monoxide air pollution in United States cities, as well as toxic contaminants. Of all highway vehicles, passenger
cars and light-duty trucks emit most of the vehicle-related carbon monoxide and ozone-forming hydrocarbons. They
also emit substantial amounts of nitrogen oxides and air toxics. Although the U.S. has made progress in reducing emissions
of these pollutants, total fleet emissions remain high. This is because the number of vehicle miles travelled on U.S.
roads has doubled in the last 20 years to 2 trillion miles per year, offsetting much of the technological progress in
vehicle emission control over the same two decades. Projections indicate that the steady growth in vehicle travel
will continue. Ongoing efforts to reduce emissions from individual vehicles will be necessary to achieve our air
quality goals. 

Today's cars are absolutely dependent on properly functioning emission controls to keep pollution levels low. Minor
malfunctions in the emission control system can increase emissions significantly, and the average car on the road
emits three to four times the new car standard. Major malfunctions in the emission control system can cause emissions
to skyrocket. As a result, 10 to 30 percent of cars are causing the majority of the vehicle-related pollution problem.
Unfortunately, it is rarely obvious which cars fall into this category, as the emissions themselves may not be noticeable
and emission control malfunctions do not necessarily affect vehicle driveability. 

Effective I/M programs, however, can identify these problem cars and assure their repair. I/M programs ensure that
cars are properly maintained in customer use. I/M produces emission reduction results soon after the program is put
in place. 



EPA projects that ``enhanced'' I/M programs in the most polluted cities around the country would cut vehicle emissions
by 28 percent, at a cost of about $12.50 per vehicle per year. This represents a major step toward the Clean Air Acts's
requirement that the most seriously polluted cities achieve a 24 percent overall emissions reduction by 2000. 

The Clean Air Act as amended in 1990 (the Act) requires that most polluted cities adopt either ``basic'' or ``enhanced''
I/M programs, depending on the severity of the problem and the population of the area. The moderate ozone nonattainment
areas, plus marginal ozone areas with existing or previously required I/M programs, fall under the ``basic'' I/M
requirements. Enhanced programs are required in serious, severe, and extreme ozone nonattainment areas with urbanized
populations of 200,000 or more; CO areas that exceed a 12.7 parts per million (ppm) design value

1

 with urbanized populations of 200,000 or more; and all metropolitan statistical areas with a population of 100,000
or more in the Northeast Ozone Transport Region. 





``Basic'' and ``enhanced'' I/M programs both achieve their objective by identifying vehicles that have high emissions
as a result of one or more malfunctions, and requiring them to be repaired. An ``enhanced'' program covers more of the
vehicles in operation, employs inspection methods which are better at finding high emitting vehicles, and has additional
features to better assure that all vehicles are tested properly and effectively repaired.

The Act requires states to make changes to improve existing I/M programs or to implement new ones for certain nonattainment
areas. Section 182(a)(2)(B) of the Act directed EPA to publish updated guidance for state I/M programs, taking into
consideration findings of the Administrator's audits and investigations of these programs. The Act further requires
each area required to have an I/M program to incorporate this guidance into the SIP. Based on these requirements, EPA
promulgated I/M regulations on November 5, 1992 (57 FR 52950, codified at 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 51.350-51.373).



Under sections 182(c)(3), 187(a)(6) and 187(b)(1) of the Act, any area having a 1980 Bureau of Census-defined urbanized
area population of 200,000 or more and either: (1) designated as serious or worse ozone nonattainment or (2) moderate
or serious CO nonattainment areas with a design value greater than 12.7 ppm shall implement enhanced I/M in the 1990
Census-defined urbanized area. The Act also established the ozone transport region (OTR) in the northeastern United
States which includes the States of Maine, Vermont, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New
York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland and Northern Virginia and the District of Columbia. Sections
182(c)(3) and 184(b)(1)(A) of the Act require the implementation of enhanced I/M programs in all metropolitan statistical
areas (MSAs) located in the OTR which have a population of 100,000 or more people. 


The Act requires basic I/M programs to be implemented in the 1990 Census-defined urbanized area of the following nonattainment
areas: (1) any area which is classified as moderate or worse ozone nonattainment and is not required to implement enhanced
I/M or (2) any area outside the OTR that is classified as serious or worse ozone nonattainment or moderate or serious
CO nonattainment with a design value greater than 12.7 ppm and having a 1990 Census-defined urbanized area population
of less than 200,000. Any areas classified as marginal ozone nonattainment or moderate CO nonattainment with a design
value of 12.7 ppm or less shall continue operating existing programs that are part of an approved SIP as of November
15, 1990 or implement any previously required program, and shall update the program to meet the basic I/M requirements
set forth in   51.350-51.373. 


The I/M regulation establishes minimum performance standards for basic and enhanced I/M programs as well as requirements
for the following: network type and program evaluation; adequate tools and resources; test frequency and convenience;
vehicle coverage; test procedures and standards; test equipment; quality control; waivers and compliance via diagnostic
inspection; motorist compliance enforcement; motorist compliance enforcement program oversight; quality assurance;
enforcement against contractors, stations and inspectors; data collection; data analysis and reporting; inspector
training and licensing or certification; public information and consumer protection; improving repair effectiveness;
compliance with recall notices; on-road testing; SIP revisions; and implementation deadlines. The performance
standard for basic I/M programs remains the same as it has been since initial I/M policy was established in 1978, pursuant
to the 1977 amendments to the Clean Air Act. The performance standard for enhanced I/M programs is based on a high-technology
transient test, known as IM240, for new technology vehicles (i.e, those with closed-loop control and, especially,
fuel injected engines), including a transient loaded exhaust short test incorporating hydrocarbons (HC), CO and
NO

x

 cutpoints, an evaporative system integrity (pressure) test and an evaporative system performance (purge) test.
For enhanced I/M programs, all requirements must initially be implemented by January 1, 1995 except that areas switching
from an existing test-and-repair network to a test-only network may phase in that change between January 1995 and
January 1996. 



II. Background 




The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania is part of the OTR and contains the following MSAs or parts thereof with a population
of 100,000 or more: Allentown-Bethlehem, Altoona, Beaver, Erie, Harrisburg Lebanon-Carlisle, Johnstown, Lancaster,
Philadelphia, Pittsburgh-Beaver Valley, Reading, Scranton-Wilkes-Barre, Sharon, State College, Williamsport,
and York. Sections 182(c)(3) and 184(b)(1)(A) of the Act require all states in the OTR region which contain MSAs or
parts thereof with a population of 100,000 or more, to submit a SIP revision for an enhanced I/M program. Section 51.372(b)(2)
of the federal I/M regulation required affected states to submit full I/M SIP revisions that met the requirements
of the Act by November 15, 1993. 


On November 5, 1993, the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Resources (PADER) submitted to EPA a SIP revision
for an enhanced I/M program. The revision included a copy of the final enhanced I/M regulation, 67 Pennsylvania (PA)
Code Chapter 178; the Pennsylvania 
I/M Request for Proposals (RFP); the Pennsylvania I/M legislation, Act 166; and supporting documents. On March 30,
1994, PADER submitted an addendum to the SIP which included portions of the selected I/M contractor's proposal. The
I/M regulations were adopted by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania on June 3, 1993 and become effective on January 1,
1995. EPA's I/M regulations require state I/M rules to be effective by November 15, 1993. However, EPA believes that
the effective date of the Pennsylvania enhanced I/M program is approvable for two reasons. First, it would be a futile
act to require the Commonwealth to amend its regulations to require an earlier effective date at this time. It would
normally take Pennsylvania more than the six months remaining before the effective date of January 1, 1995 to complete
the administrative process to amend the regulations. Secondly, an earlier effective date would not change any of
the requirements of the regulations. Pennsylvania has already initiated all of the steps required under the federal
I/M regulations to be conducted prior to January 1, 1995 under independent authority. The January 1, 1995 effective
date will allow the Commonwealth to fully implement the enhanced I/M program consistent with the requirements of
the federal I/M rule. Therefore, EPA concludes that the delay in the effective date of the Pennsylvania I/M rule is
deminimis, and EPA proposes to approve the January 1, 1995 effective date.

EPA summarizes the requirements of the federal I/M regulations as found in 40 CFR part 51.350-51.373 and its
analysis of the Commonwealth's submittal below. A more detailed analysis of the Commonwealth's submittal is contained
in a Technical Support Document (TSD) dated May 18, 1994, which is available from the Region III office, listed in the


ADDRESSES 

section. Parties desiring additional details on the federal I/M regulation are referred to the November 5, 1992 

Federal Register

 notice (57 FR 52950) or 40 CFR part 51.350-51.373. 



III. EPA's Analysis of Pennsylvania Enhanced I/M Program 



As discussed above, sections 182(c)(3), 184(b)(1)(A), 187(a)(6) and 187(b)(1) of the Act require that states adopt
and implement regulations for an enhanced I/M program in certain areas. The following sections of this notice address
some specific elements of the Commonwealth's submittal. Parties desiring more specific information should consult
the TSD. 



Applicability_40 CFR Part 51.350 



Sections 182(c)(3) and 184(b)(1)(A) of the Act and 40 CFR part 51.350(a) require all states in the OTR which contain
MSAs or parts thereof with a population of 100,000 or more to implement an enhanced I/M program. The Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania is part of the OTR and contains the following MSAs or parts thereof with a population of 100,000 or more:
Allentown-Bethlehem, Altoona, Beaver, Erie, Harrisburg-Lebanon-Carlisle, Johnstown, Lancaster, Philadelphia,
Pittsburgh-Beaver Valley, Reading, Scranton-Wilkes-Barre, Sharon, State College, Williamsport, and York. The
Philadelphia area is classified as a severe ozone nonattainment area and also required to implement an enhanced I/M
program as per section 182(c)(3) of the Act and 40 CFR part 51.350(2). In addition, the Philadelphia area of Pennsylvania
is designated as moderate nonattainment for CO with a design value of less than 12.7 ppm. As per 40 CFR part 51.350(3),
any area classified as moderate CO nonattainment with a design value of 12.7 ppm or less shall continue operating I/M
programs that were part of an approved SIP as of November 15, 1990 and shall update those programs as necessary to meet
the basic I/M program requirements. 

Under the requirements of the Clean Air Act, the following 33 counties in Pennsylvania (which are located in the above
listed MSAs) would be subject to the enhanced I/M program requirements: Adams, Allegheny, Beaver, Berks, Blair,
Bucks, Cambria, Carbon, Centre, Chester, Columbia, Cumberland, Dauphin, Delaware, Erie, Fayette, Lackawanna,
Lancaster, Lebanon, Lehigh, Luzerne, Lycoming, Mercer, Monroe, Montgomery, Northampton, Perry, Philadelphia,
Somerset, Washington, Westmoreland, Wyoming and York. However, under the federal I/M regulations, specifically
40 CFR part 51.350(b), some rural counties having a population density of less than 200 persons per square mile based
on the 1990 census can be excluded from program coverage provided that at least 50% of the MSA population is included
in the program. The following eight counties in the Commonwealth qualify for the exemption discussed in 40 CFR part
51.350(b) and are exempt from participation in the program: Adams, Carbon, Columbia, Fayette, Monroe, Perry, Somerset
and Wyoming. Consequently, the Pennsylvania I/M regulation requires that the enhanced I/M program be implemented
in 25 counties in the Commonwealth. The 25 counties are as follows: Allegheny, Beaver, Berks, Blair, Bucks, Cambria,
Centre, Chester, Cumberland, Dauphin, Delaware, Erie, Lackawanna, Lancaster, Lebanon, Lehigh, Luzerne, Lycoming,
Mercer, Montgomery, Northampton, Philadelphia, Washington, Westmoreland and York. 

The Pennsylvania I/M legislative authority (referred to as Act 166 throughout the remainder of this notice) provides
the legal authority to establish the geographic boundaries. The program boundaries listed in an appendix to the SIP
include the 25 counties listed above and meet the federal I/M requirements under section 51.350. However, part of
this provision states ``this program shall be established in all areas of this Commonwealth where the secretary certifies
by publication in the 

Pennsylvania Bulletin 

that a system is required in order to comply with Federal law. Any area, counties, county or portion thereof certified
to be in the program by the secretary must be mandated to be in the program by Federal law.'' Act 166 requires ``at least
60 days prior to the implementation of any enhanced emission inspection program developed under this subsection,
the Secretary of Transportation shall certify by notice in the 

Pennsylvania Bulletin 

that an enhanced emission inspection program will commence''. The Pennsylvania I/M regulation states that the program
begins 60 days after publication of the notice. It is stated in the Pennsylvania I/M SIP that ``it is not possible at
this time to furnish a copy of that notice since it will be published in calendar year 1994.'' The SIP goes on to state
that ``when that notice has appeared in the 

Bulletin, 

the Department shall furnish a copy to the EPA as an amendment to this SIP''. EPA interprets this language as a commitment
on the part of the Commonwealth to publish the bulletin notice and submit it as an amendment to the SIP by December 31,
1994. EPA is proposing to find that the geographic applicability requirements are satisfied based on the condition
that the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania will submit to EPA by December 31, 1994 the 

Pennsylvania Bulletin 

notice certifying the geographic coverage. EPA, therefore, proposes to conditionally approve the Pennsylvania
SIP based on the Commonwealth's commitment to publish the notice certifying the need for the I/M program and the geographic
scope of the program by December 31, 1994. The geographic coverage certified in the notice must include the 25 counties
listed above or EPA will consider the commitment not met and will promptly issue a letter to the Commonwealth indicating
that the conditional approval has been converted to a disapproval. 

The federal I/M regulation requires that the state program shall not sunset until it is no longer necesary. EPA interprets
the federal regulation as stating that a SIP which does not sunset prior to the attainment deadline for each applicable
area satisfies this requirement. The Pennsylvania I/M regulation provides for the program to continue past the attainment
dates for all applicable nonattainment areas in the Commonwealth and is therefore approvable.

Enhanced I/M Performance Standard_40 CFR Part 51.351 



The enhanced I/M program must be designed and implemented to meet or exceed a minimum performance standard, which
is expressed as emission levels in area-wide average grams per mile (gpm) for certain pollutants. The performance
standard shall be established using local characteristics, such as vehicle mix and local fuel controls, and the following
model I/M program parameters: network type, start date, test frequency, model year coverage, vehicle type coverage,
exhaust emission test type, emission standards, emission control device, evaporative system function checks,
stringency, waiver rate, compliance rate and evaluation date. The emission levels achieved by the state's program
design shall be calculated using the most current version, at the time of submittal, of the EPA mobile source emission
factor model. At the time of the Pennsylvania submittal the most current version was MOBILE5a. Areas shall meet the
performance standard for the pollutants which cause them to be subject to enhanced I/M requirements. In the case of
ozone nonattainment areas, the performance standard must be met for both NO

x

 and HC. The Pennsylvania submittal must meet the enhanced I/M performance standard for HC and NO

x

 in all subject I/M areas in the Commonwealth. 

The Pennsylvania submittal includes the following program design parameters:




Network type_centralized, test-only 
Start date_January 1995 
Test frequency_biennial 
Model year/vehicle type coverage_all 1968 and newer light duty gasoline vehicles (LDGV), light duty gasoline trucks
1 & 2 (LDGT1, LDGT2) up to 9,000 lbs gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR) 

Exhaust emission test type_transient test for 1977 and newer model year vehicles, idle testing for 1968 to 1976 model
year vehicles 

Emission standards_permanent transient test standards (1983 and newer vehicles): 0.8 gpm HC, 15 gpm CO, 2.0 gpm NO

x

 from 1/1/97 through 12/31/01, 0.6 gpm HC, 15 gpm CO and 1.5 gpm NO

x

 from 1/1/02 and after. Please refer to the Pennsylvania I/M regulations found in the June 19, 1993 edition of the 

Pennsylvania Bulletin 

for idle standards and for transient test standards for other applicable model years 

Emission control device_visual inspection of fuel inlet restrictor and catalytic converter on all 1984 and newer
vehicles 

Evaporative system function checks_pressure and purge check on all 1977 and newer vehicles 

Stringency (pre-1981 failure rate)_20% 
Waiver rate_3% on pre and post 1981 vehicles 
Compliance rate_96% 
Evaluation dates_For HC and NO

x

: 7/1/99, 7/1/02 and 7/1/05 for Philadelphia area and 7/1/99 for other other areas




The Pennsylvania program design parameters meet the federal I/M regulations and are approvable. 

The emission levels achieved by the Commonwealth were modeled using MOBILE5a. The modeling demonstration was performed
correctly, used local characteristics and demonstrated that the program design will meet the minimum enhanced I/M
performance standard, expressed in gpm, for HC, and NO

x

, for each milestone and for the attainment deadline. The Philadelphia area was required to meet the basic I/M program
requirements because of the areas' CO nonattainment classification. The modeling demonstration shows that the
program meets the enhanced I/M performance standard and in so doing is exceeding the basic I/M program requirements.
The modeling demonstration is approvable. 



Network Type and Program Evaluation_40 CFR Part 51.353 



Enhanced I/M programs shall be operated in a centralized test-only format, unless the state can demonstrate that
a decentralized program is equally effective in achieving the enhanced I/M performance standard. The enhanced program
shall include an ongoing evaluation to quantify the emission reduction benefits of the program, and to determine
if the program is meeting the requirements of the Act and the federal I/M regulation. The SIP shall include details
on the program evaluation and shall include a schedule for submittal of biennial evaluation reports, data from a state
monitored or administered mass emission test of at least 0.1% of the vehicles subject to inspection each year, description
of the sampling methodology, the data collection and analysis system and the legal authority enabling the evaluation
program. 

Both Act 166 and the Commonwealth's I/M regulation provide for a centralized, test-only network. Pennsylvania's
centralized, test-only network type is approvable. The submittal includes an ongoing program evaluation which
meets the federal I/M regulations. However, Act 166 and the Commonwealth regulation prohibit the contractor from
having any business interest in a vehicle repair facility in the Commonwealth but does not prohibit such interest
in the entire continental United States. EPA interprets section 51.353 of the federal regulation as prohibiting
this business interest without geographic limitation. EPA is aware that as a matter of fact the present contractor
for Pennsylvania's enhanced I/M program does not have any vehicle repair facility business interests in any other
state, and is in fact prohibited from such interests as per contracts with several other state enhanced I/M programs.
Based on this knowledge, EPA is proposing to find that this requirement is met with the contingency that the present
contractor or any future contractors for the Pennsylvania I/M program will not at any time in the future have any business
interest in a vehicle repair facility anywhere in the continental United States. EPA proposes to approve the Pennsylvania
SIP on this basis. EPA's proposed approval is contingent on implementation of the program consistent with this finding.
Should the contractor for the Pennsylvania I/M program at any time acquire any prohibited repair business interest
EPA will rescind its approval and disapprove the SIP.

Adequate Tools and Resources_40 CFR Part 51.354 


The federal regulation requires the state to demonstrate that adequate funding of the program is available. A portion
of the test fee or separately assessed per vehicle fee shall be collected, placed in a dedicated fund and used to finance
the program. Alternative funding approaches are acceptable if demonstrated that the funding can be maintained.
Reliance on funding from the state or local General Fund is not acceptable unless doing otherwise would be a violation
of the state's constitution. The SIP shall include a detailed budget plan which describes the source of funds for personnel,
program administration, program enforcement, and purchase of equipment. The SIP shall also detail the number of
personnel dedicated to the quality assurance program, data analysis, program administration, enforcement, public
education and assistance and other necessary functions. 
The Pennsylvania State Constitution prohibits monies received from test fees or any other fees received to be deposited
in a proprietary account. The Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PADOT), which implements the I/M program,
has no means to fund the I/M program and must rely on future uncommitted annual appropriations from the General Assembly.
The federal I/M regulations allow for this funding method if, as in Pennsylvania, doing otherwise would be a violation
of the State Constitution. The submittal demonstrates that sufficient funds, equipment and personnel have been
appropriated to meet program operation requirements. 
The SIP indicates that the average per vehicle cost for oversight of the program will be 59 cents per vehicle. Other
states are planning to spend roughly $4 per vehicle for oversight of an enhanced I/M program. EPA is concerned that
Pennsylvania's level of oversight committed may be too low. However, the federal regulation does not set a prescribed
amount to be spent for oversight. Therefore, EPA is proposing to approve the current level of funding for program oversight.
But, EPA will monitor program implementation closely to ensure that the current level of funding devoted to oversight
is sufficient. 
The Commonwealth's submittal meets the adequate tools and resources requirements set forth in the federal I/M regulations
and is approvable. 


Test Frequency and Convenience_40 CFR Part 51.355 


The enhanced I/M performance standard assumes an annual test frequency; however, other schedules may be approved
if the performance standard is achieved. The SIP shall describe the test year selection scheme, how the test frequency
is integrated into the enforcement process and shall include the legal authority, regulations or contract provisions
to implement and enforce the test frequency. The program shall be designed to provide convenient service to the motorist
by ensuring short wait times, short driving distances and regular testing hours. 
The Pennsylvania enhanced I/M regulation provides for a biennial test frequency. The Commonwealth has submitted
modeling that demonstrates that the performance standard is met using the biennial test frequency. Act 166 and the
Commonwealth's I/M regulation provide the legal authority to implement and enforce the biennial test frequency.
The Pennsylvania I/M Request for Proposals (RFP), and the Pennsylvania I/M contractors' proposal (hereafter the
contractors' proposal) provide sufficient evidence that convenient services will be provided to the motorist.
The Pennsylvania submittal meets the test frequency and convenience requirements of the federal I/M regulations
and is approvable. 


Vehicle Coverage_40 CFR Part 51.356 


The performance standard for enhanced I/M programs assumes coverage of all 1968 and later model year light duty vehicles
and light duty trucks up to 8,500 pounds GVWR, and includes vehicles operating on all fuel types. Other levels of coverage
may be approved if the necessary emission reductions are achieved. Vehicles registered or required to be registered
within the I/M program area boundaries and fleets primarily operated within the I/M program area boundaries and belonging
to the covered model years and vehicle classes comprise the subject vehicles. Fleets may be officially inspected
outside of the normal I/M program test facilities, if such alternatives are approved by the program administration,
but shall be subject to the same test requirements using the same quality control standards as non-fleet vehicles
and shall be inspected in independent, test-only facilities, according to the requirements of 40 CFR part 51.353(a).
Vehicles which are operated on Federal installations located within an I/M program area shall be tested, regardless
of whether the vehicles are registered in the state or local I/M area. 

The federal I/M regulation requires that the SIP shall include the legal authority or rule necessary to implement
and enforce the vehicle coverage requirement, a detailed description of the number and types of vehicles to be covered
by the program and a plan for how those vehicles are to be identified including vehicles that are routinely operated
in the area but may not be registered in the area, and a description of any special exemptions including the percentage
and number of vehicles to be impacted by the exemption.

The Pennsylvania enhanced I/M program requires coverage of all 1968 and newer LDGV, LDGT1 and LDGT2 up to 9,000 pounds
GVWR which are registered or required to be registered in the I/M program area. As of the date of the SIP submittal, 5,815,580
vehicles will be subject to enhanced I/M testing. The Commonwealth's regulation does not currently include vehicles
operating on all fuel types but Pennsylvania commits to adding the required testing of these vehicles once EPA promulgates
regulations on alternative fueled vehicle I/M testing. Act 166 and the Pennsylvania I/M regulation provide the legal
authority to implement and enforce the vehicle coverage. This level of coverage is currently approvable because
it provides the necessary emission reductions to meet the performance standard. 
Pennsylvania's program provides that large fleets will make special testing arrangements with the Pennsylvania
I/M contractor. This will include appointments scheduled during non-peak hours using a dedicated lane, testing
scheduled after hours and the establishment of a test lane at a large fleet location if such a fleet determines that
this would be a more cost effective approach for their particular needs. Small fleets will be tested on a first-come,
first-served basis at the regular test stations in the same manner as a privately-owned vehicle. The Commonwealth's
plan for testing fleet vehicles is acceptable and meets the requirements of the federal I/M regulation. The Commonwealth's
regulation requires vehicles which are operated on Federal installations located within an I/M program area to be
tested, regardless of whether the vehicles are registered in the state or local I/M area, and is approvable. 
The Commonwealth's regulation provides for no special exemptions. 


Test Procedures and Standards_40 CFR Part 51.357 


Written test procedures and pass/fail standards shall be established and followed for each model year and vehicle
type included in the program. Test procedures and standards are detailed in 40 CFR part 51.357 and in the EPA document
entitled ``High-Tech I/M Test Procedures, Emission Standards, Quality Control Requirements, and Equipment Specifications'',
EPA-AA-EPSD-IM-93-1, dated April 1994. The federal I/M regulation also requires vehicles
that have been altered from their original certified configuration (i.e. engine or fuel switching) to be tested in
the same manner as other subject vehicles. 
The Commonwealth's regulation includes a description of the test procedure for idle emission and evaporative system
pressure testing and for a visual emission control device inspection which conform to EPA approved test procedures
and are approvable. 
The Commonwealth regulations provide a general description of the test procedure for transient emission and evaporative
system purge testing. However, the Commonwealth regulations do not provide specific transient and purge test procedures
as described in the EPA document entitled ``High Tech I/M Test Procedures, Emission Standards, Quality Control Requirements,
and Equipment Specifications'', EPA-AA-EPSD-IM-93-1, April 1994. The Pennsylvania
SIP states that the regulation will be amended by January 1995 to include the test procedures found in the July 1993
version of the EPA document referenced above. EPA interprets this language as a commitment on the part of the Commonwealth
to amend the Commonwealth regulations by December 31, 1994 to incorporate the test procedures from the EPA document.
Since the release of the July 1993 version of the EPA document, a final version, dated April 1994, has been released
which contains minor changes from the July 1993 version. EPA believes that the Commonwealth can incorporate the minor
changes from the final version into their regulation amendments. Section 178.205(2) of the Commonwealth's regulation
allows the Commonwealth to approve alternate purge procedures if they are shown to be equivalent or better than Commonwealths'
existing purge test procedure. EPA's concern is that this provision does not require EPA approval before implementation
of the alternate test procedure in the Commonwealth's program. EPA is proposing to find that the test procedure requirements
of the federal regulation are satisfied based on the condition that the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania will submit
to EPA by December 31, 1994 the amended Commonwealth's regulation incorporating the transient and evaporative purge
test procedures from the final version of the EPA I/M document referenced above and requiring EPA approval prior to
the use of any alternate purge test procedure. EPA proposes to conditionally approve the Pennsylvania SIP based on
the Commonwealth's commitment to amend its regulations consistent with this finding. The effective date of these
regulation amendments must coincide with the start date of the enhanced I/M program. If the Commonwealth fails to
fulfill this condition by December 31, 1994, EPA will consider the commitment not met and will promptly issue a letter
to the Commonwealth indicating that the conditional approval has been converted to a disapproval.

The Commonwealth regulation establishes HC, CO, and CO

2

 pass/fail exhaust standards for the idle test procedure for each applicable model year and vehicle type. The idle
exhaust standards adopted by the Commonwealth conform to EPA established standards and are approvable. 
The Pennsylvania regulation applies one set of start-up transient emission standards and two sets of permanent transient
emission standards for all vehicle types, i.e. LDGT, LDGT1, LDGT2 and Tier 1 vehicles. The Commonwealth regulation
fails to provide Phase 2 standards for all vehicle types and model years. The net result of this is that the Commonwealth
emission standards that apply to LDGT1 and LDGT2 vehicles are more stringent than federal requirement, which is approvable;
however, the Commonwealth emission standards applied to Tier 1 vehicles in the Commonwealth's regulation do not
meet the minimum federal requirements. The SIP states that the Commonwealth will be amending their regulation to
replace the existing standards with the standards found in the July 1993 version of the EPA I/M document referenced
above and further states that the changes can be accomplished by the end of calendar year 1994. EPA interprets this
language as a commitment on the part of the Commonwealth to amend the Commonwealth's regulation by December 31, 1994
to incorporate the emission standards from the EPA document. Since the release of the July version of the EPA document,
a final version, dated April 1994, has been released which contains minor changes from the July 1993 version. EPA believes
that the Commonwealth can incorporate the minor changes from the final version into their regulation amendments.
EPA is proposing to find that the test standard requirements of the federal regulation are satisfied based on the condition
that the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania will submit to EPA by December 31, 1994 the amended Commonwealth's regulation
incorporating the Tier 1 and Phase 2 emission standards from the final version of EPA I/M document referenced above.
EPA is proposing to conditionally approve the Pennsylvania SIP based on the Commonwealth's commitment to revise
its regulations consistent with this finding. The effective date of these regulation amendments must coincide with
the start date of the enhanced I/M program. If the Commonwealth fails to fulfill this condition by December 31, 1994,
EPA will consider the commitment not met and will promptly issue a letter to the Commonwealth indicating that the conditional
approval has been converted to a disapproval. 
EPA intends to promulgate the test procedures and related requirements found in the final version of the EPA I/M document
referenced above as official I/M tests in part 85 of the CFR. Any changes made during the rulemaking process, which
EPA believes would be minimal, should also be made in the Pennsylvania regulation. 
The Commonwealth regulation establishes evaporative purge and pressure test standards which conform to EPA established
standards and are approvable. 
The Pennsylvania regulation provides start-up emission standards for the transient test that apply during calendar
year 1995 and 1996. The schedule for implementation of these start-up emission standards is approvable. The Pennsylvania
regulation provides for two sets of permanent emission standards for the transient test, one set which applies from
1997 through 2001 and the second set which applies in calendar year 2002 and on. The schedule for implementation of
the permanent standards is approvable and was used in the performance standard modeling demonstration. 
The Commonwealth's regulation also requires vehicles that have been altered from their original certified configuration
(i.e. engine or fuel switching) to be tested in the same manner as other subject vehicles. 




Test Equipment_40 CFR Part 51.358 




Computerized test systems are required for performing any measurement on subject vehicles. The federal I/M regulation
requires that the state SIP submittal include written technical specifications for all test equipment used in the
program. The specifications shall describe the emission analysis process, the necessary test equipment, the required
features, and written acceptance testing criteria and procedures.

The Commonwealth submittal contains the written technical specifications for all test equipment to be used in the
program. The specifications require the use of computerized test systems. The specifications also include performance
features and functional characteristics of the computerized test systems which meet the federal I/M regulations
and are approvable. 




Quality Control_40 CFR Part 51.359 




Quality control measures shall insure that emission measurement equipment is calibrated and maintained properly,
and that inspection, calibration records, and control charts are accurately created, recorded and maintained.

The Commonwealth's submittal contains the RFP and the contractors' proposal which describe and establish quality
control measures for the emission measurement equipment, record keeping requirements and measures to maintain
the security of all documents used to establish compliance with the inspection requirements. This portion of the
Commonwealth's submittal complies with the quality control requirements set forth in 40 CFR part 51.359 and is approvable.







Waivers and Compliance Via Diagnostic Inspection_40 CFR Part 51.360 






The federal I/M regulation allows for the issuance of a waiver, which is a form of compliance with the program requirements
that allows a motorist to comply without meeting the applicable test standards. For enhanced I/M programs, an expenditure
of at least $450 in repairs, adjusted annually to reflect the change in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) as compared to
the CPI for 1989, is required in order to qualify for a waiver. Waivers can only be issued after a vehicle has failed a
retest performed after all qualifying repairs have been made. Any available warranty coverage must be used to obtain
repairs before expenditures can be counted toward the cost limit. Tampering related repairs shall not be applied
toward the cost limit. Repairs must be appropriate to the cause of the test failure. Repairs for 1980 and newer model
year vehicles must be performed by a recognized repair technician. The federal regulation allows for compliance
via a diagnostic inspection after failing a retest on emissions and requires quality control of waiver issuance.
The SIP must set a maximum waiver rate and must describe corrective action that would be taken if the waiver rate exceeds
that committed to in the SIP. 
Act 166 and the Pennsylvania I/M regulation provide the necessary authority to issue waivers, set and adjust cost
limits, administer and enforce the waiver system, and set a $450 cost limit and allow for an annual adjustment of the
cost limit to reflect the change in the CPI as compared to the CPI in 1989. The Pennsylvania regulation, RFP, and the
contractors' proposal include provisions which address waiver criteria and procedures, including cost limits,
tampering and warranty related repairs, quality control and administration. These provisions meet the federal
I/M regulations requirements and are approvable. The Pennsylvania I/M regulation requires repairs for 1980 and
later model year vehicles to be performed by a recognized repair technician. The Commonwealth's regulation allows
for compliance via diagnostic inspection and the policies and procedures outlined in the submittal meet federal
I/M regulations and are approvable. The Commonwealth's regulation does not allow for time extensions. The Commonwealth
has set a maximum waiver rate of 3% for both pre-1981 and 1981 and later vehicles and has described corrective actions
to be taken if the waiver rate exceeds 3%. This waiver rate has been used in the performance standard modeling demonstration
and is approvable. The waiver provisions of the SIP meet federal requirements and are approvable. 


Motorist Compliance Enforcement_40 CFR Part 51.361 


The federal regulation requires that compliance shall be ensured through the denial of motor vehicle registration
in enhanced I/M programs unless an exception for use of an existing alternative is approved. An enhanced I/M area may
use either sticker-based enforcement programs or computer-matching programs if either of these programs were used
in the existing program and it can be demonstrated that the alternative has been more effective than registration
denial. For newly implementing enhanced areas, including newly subject areas in a state with an I/M program in another
part of the state, there is no provision for enforcement alternatives in the Act. The SIP shall provide information
concerning the enforcement process, legal authority to implement and enforce the program, and a commitment to a compliance
rate to be used for modeling purposes and to be maintained in practice. 
Both Act 166 and the Pennsylvania I/M regulation provide the legal authority to implement a registration denial system.
The Pennsylvania SIP commits to a compliance rate of 96% which was used in the performance standard modeling demonstration
and is approvable. The submittal includes detailed information concerning the registration denial enforcement
process which meets the federal I/M regulation requirements and is approvable. 


Motorist Compliance Enforcement Program Oversight_40 CFR Part 51.362 


The federal I/M regulation requires that the enforcement program shall be audited regularly and shall follow effective
program management practices, including adjustments to improve operation when necessary. The SIP shall include
quality control and quality assurance procedures to be used to insure the effective overall performance of the enforcement
system. An information management system shall be established which will characterize, evaluate and enforce the
program. 
The Pennsylvania SIP describes in general how the enforcement program oversight is quality controlled and quality
assured and includes the establishment of an information management system.

The SIP includes a commitment to develop the procedures document which will detail the specifics of the implementation
of the oversight program by the fall of 1994. The SIP includes a commitment to submit this procedures document as an
amendment to the SIP. EPA proposes conditional approval of the Pennsylvania SIP with the condition that the Commonwealth
meet its commitment that the motorist compliance enforcement program oversight procedures manual be submitted
as a SIP amendment within one year from the date of publication of the 

Federal Register

 notice which conditionally approves the SIP. 



Quality Assurance_40 CFR Part 51.363 



An ongoing quality assurance program shall be implemented to discover, correct and prevent fraud, waste, and abuse
in the program. The program shall include covert and overt performance audits of the inspectors, audits of station
and inspector records, equipment audits, and formal training of all state I/M enforcement officials and auditors.
A description of the quality assurance program which includes written procedure manuals on the above discussed items
must be submitted as part of the SIP. 

The Pennsylvania submittal describes the quality assurance program and includes regulations and supporting documents
which describe procedures for implementing inspector, records and equipment audits as well as providing formal
training to all Commonwealth enforcement officials. Performance audits of inspectors will consist of both covert
and overt audits. The SIP states that a quality assurance procedure manual is under development which will be consistent
with federal regulation and will include written procedures for performing covert and overt audits. EPA interprets
this as a commitment to develop the procedures manual and submit it to EPA as a SIP revision. EPA proposes to conditionally
approve the SIP based on its finding that the SIP meets the quality assurance requirements of the federal regulation
with the condition that the Commonwealth meet its commitment that the quality assurance program procedures manual
will be submitted as a SIP amendment within one year from the date of publication of the 

Federal Register

 notice which conditionally approves the SIP. 



Enforcement Against Contractors, Stations and Inspectors_40 CFR Part 51.364 



Enforcement against licensed stations, contractors and inspectors shall include swift, sure, effective, and consistent
penalties for violation of program requirements. The federal I/M regulation requires the establishment of minimum
penalties for violations of program rules and procedures which can be imposed against stations, contractors and
inspectors. The legal authority for establishing and imposing penalties, civil fines, license suspensions and
revocations must be included in the SIP. State quality assurance officials shall have the authority to temporarily
suspend station and/or inspector licenses immediately upon finding a violation that directly affects emission
reduction benefits, unless constitutionally prohibited. An official opinion explaining any state constitutional
impediments to immediate suspension authority must be included in the submittal. The SIP shall describe the administrative
and judicial procedures and responsibilities relevant to the enforcement process, including which agencies, courts
and jurisdictions are involved, who will prosecute and adjudicate cases and the resources and sources of those resources
which will support this function. 

The Pennsylvania submittal includes the legal authority to establish and impose penalties against stations, contractors
and inspectors. The penalty schedules for inspectors and stations which are found in the Commonwealth's regulation
meet the federal I/M regulation requirements and are approvable. The penalty schedule for contractors is approvable
with one contingency. 67 PA Code  178.602(b), entitled Schedule of Penalties for Emission Inspection Contractors,
states that ``the contractor shall be subject to the terms and conditions of the Contractor Responsibility Program
and may be subject to penalties and sanctions thereunder in addition to or in lieu of those imposed under this section
or the contract''. The Contractor Responsibility Program (CRP) is not a statute but rather a Governors' Office Management
Directive and is found in the SIP in Addendum I of the RFP. The Management Directive does not list specific monetary
penalties to be assessed to the contractor but rather provides for suspension or debarment of the contractor. EPA
is concerned that the penalties imposed under the CRP could be less stringent than those in the Commonwealth's I/M
regulation. The Commonwealth has indicated that it intends to use this authority only to impose penalties that are
more stringent than those in the Commonwealth's regulation. Therefore, EPA is proposing to approve the penalty schedule
against contractors which is found in section 178.602(b) of the Commonwealth's regulation with the contingency
that penalties assessed against the contractor under the CRP in lieu of the penalties in the Commonwealth's I/M regulation
must be equal to or more stringent than those in the Commonwealth's I/M regulation. However, should Pennsylvania
at any time assess penalties less stringent than those in the regulation EPA will rescind its approval and disapprove
the SIP.

The Commonwealth's I/M regulation gives the state auditor the authority to temporarily suspend station and inspector
licenses or certificates immediately upon finding a violation. The submittal include descriptions of administrative
and judicial procedures relevant to the enforcement process which meet federal I/M regulations and are approvable.





Data Collection_40 CFR Part 51.365 



Accurate data collection is essential to the management, evaluation and enforcement of an I/M program. The federal
I/M regulation requires data to be gathered on each individual test conducted and on the results of the quality control
checks of test equipment required under 40 CFR part 51.359. 

The Commonwealth's regulation and RFP require the collection of data on each individual test conducted and describe
the type of data to be collected. The type of test data collected meets the federal I/M regulation requirements and
is approvable. The submittal also commits to gather and report the results of the quality control checks required
under 40 CFR part 51.359 and is approvable. 



Data Analysis and Reporting_40 CFR Part 51.366 



Data analysis and reporting are required to allow for monitoring and evaluation of the program by the state and EPA.
The federal I/M regulation requires annual reports to be submitted which provide information and statistics and
summarize activities performed for each of the following programs: testing, quality assurance, quality control
and enforcement. These reports are to be submitted by July and shall provide statistics for the period of January to
December of the previous year. A biennial report shall be submitted to EPA which addresses changes in program design,
regulations, legal authority, program procedures and any weaknesses in the program found during the two year period
and how these problems will be or were corrected. 

The Pennsylvania I/M SIP provides for the analysis and reporting of data for the testing program, quality assurance
program, quality control program and the enforcement program. The type of data to be analyzed and reported on meets
the federal I/M regulation requirements and is approvable. The Commonwealth commits to submit annual reports on
these programs to EPA by July of the subsequent year. A commitment to submit a biennial report to EPA which addresses
reporting requirements set forth in 40 CFR part 51.366(e) is also included in the SIP. 



Inspector Training and Licensing or Certification_40 CFR Part 51.376 



The federal I/M regulation requires all inspectors to be formally trained and licensed or certified to perform inspections.


The Pennsylvania I/M regulation requires all inspectors to receive formal training, be certified by the PADOT and
renew the certification every two years. The Commonwealth's I/M regulation, the RFP and the contractors' proposal
include a description of and the information covered in the training program, a description of the required written
and hands-on tests and a description of the certification process. The SIP meets the federal I/M regulation requirements
for inspector training and certification and is approvable. 



Public Information and Consumer Protection_40 CFR Part 51.368 



The federal I/M regulation requires the SIP to include public information and consumer protection programs. The
RFP and the contractors' proposal include a public information program which educates the public on I/M, state and
federal regulations, air quality and the role of motor vehicles in the air pollution problem, and other items as described
in the federal rule. The consumer protection program includes provisions for a challenge mechanism, protection
of whistle blowers and providing assistance to motorists in obtaining warranty covered repairs. The public information
and consumer protection programs contained in the SIP submittal meet the federal regulations and are approvable.




Improving Repair Effectiveness_40 CFR Part 51.369 



Effective repairs are the key to achieving program goals. The federal regulation requires states to take steps to
ensure that the capability exists in the repair industry to repair vehicles. The SIP must include a description of
the technical assistance program to be implemented, a description of the procedures and criteria to be used in meeting
the performance monitoring requirements required in the federal regulation and a description of the repair technician
training resources available in the community. 

The Pennsylvania I/M regulation, the RFP, and the contractors' proposal require the implementation of a technical
assistance program which includes a hot line service to assist repair technicians and a method of regularly informing
the repair facilities of changes in the program, training courses, and common repair problems. A repair facility
performance monitoring program is also included in the Commonwealth's I/M regulation, the RFP, and the I/M contractors'
proposal which includes providing the motorist whose vehicle fails the test a summary of local repair facilities
performances, provides regular feedback to each facility on their repair performance and requires the submittal
of a completed repair form at the time of retest. The performance monitoring program design meets the criteria described
in the federal regulation and is approvable. The Commonwealth's regulation provides for the establishment and implementation
of a repair technician training program which, at a minimum, covers the four types of training described in 40 CFR part
51.369(c) of the federal regulation. The repair effectiveness program described in the SIP meets the federal regulation
and is approvable.

Compliance With Recall Notices_40 CFR Part 51.370 




The federal regulation requires the states to establish methods to ensure that vehicles that are subject to enhanced
I/M and are included in an emission related recall receive the required repairs prior to completing the emission test
and/or renewing the vehicle registration. 


Act 166 and the Commonwealth's I/M regulation provide the legal authority to require owners to comply with emission
related recalls before completing the emission test and renewing the vehicle registration. The SIP includes procedures
to be used to incorporate national database recall information into the Commonwealth's inspection database and
quality control methods to insure recall repairs are properly documented and tracked. The submittal includes a commitment
to submit an annual report to EPA which includes the recall related information as required in 40 CFR part 51.370(c).
The recall compliance program contained in the SIP submittal meets the federal requirements and is approvable. 




On-Road Testing_40 CFR Part 51.371 




On-road testing is required in enhanced I/M areas. The use of either remote sensing devices (RSD) or roadside pullovers
including tailpipe emission testing can be used to meet the federal regulations. The program must include on-road
testing of 0.5% of the subject fleet or 20,000 vehicles, whichever is less, in the nonattainment area or the I/M program
area. Motorists that have passed an emission test and are found to be high emitters as a result of an on-road test shall
be required to pass an out-of-cycle test. 


Legal authority to implement the on-road testing program and enforce off-cycle inspection and repair requirements
is contained in Act 166 and the Commonwealth's I/M regulation. The SIP submittal requires the use of RSD to test 20,000
vehicles per year in the I/M program area and will be implemented by the contractor. A description of the program which
includes test limits and criteria, resource allocations, and methods of collecting, analyzing and reporting the
results of the testing are detailed in the submittal. The on-road testing program described in the SIP meets federal
requirements and is approvable. 




State Implementation Plan Submissions/Implementation Deadlines_40 CFR Part 51.372-373 




The Pennsylvania submittal included the Commonwealth's final I/M regulations, legislative authority to implement
the program, a final RFP, portions of the contractor's proposal, the signed contract between the Commonwealth and
the contractor, a modeling demonstration showing that the program design meets the performance standard, evidence
of adequate funding and resources to implement the program, and a detailed discussion on each of the required program
design elements. The submittal states that all inspectors and stations will be certified by December 22, 1994 and
the start date for implementation of full-stringency cutpoints will be January 1, 1997. The submittal also includes
a commitment to include onboard diagnostic checks in the I/M program within 2 years after promulgation of onboard
diagnostic check regulations for I/M programs. 


Act 166 provides the legal authority to implement the program. However, part of this provision states ``this program
shall be established in all areas of this Commonwealth where the secretary certifies by publication in the 

Pennsylvania Bulletin

 that a system is required in order to comply with Federal law.'' Act 166 requires ``at least 60 days prior to the implementation
of any enhanced emission inspection program developed under this subsection, the Secretary of Transportation shall
certify by notice in the 

Pennsylvania Bulletin

 that an enhanced emission inspection program will commence''. The Pennsylvania I/M regulation states that the program
begins 60 days after publication of the notice. It is stated in the Pennsylvania I/M SIP that ``it is not possible at
this time to furnish a copy of that notice since it will be published in calendar year 1994.'' The SIP goes on to state
that ``when that notice has appeared in the 

Bulletin,

 the Department shall furnish a copy to the EPA as an amendment to this SIP''. EPA interprets this language as a commitment
on the part of the Commonwealth to publish the bulletin notice announcing the start date of the program and submit it
as an amendment to the SIP by December 31, 1994. EPA also interprets this language to mean that the program will commence
no later than March 1, 1995. Although the federal I/M regulation requires programs to commence on January 1, 1995,
EPA believes that Pennsylvania can test the appropriate number of vehicles in calendar year 1995 and that therefore
a two-month delay in the start date is de minimis. EPA is therefore proposing to find that the SIP submission and implementation
deadline requirements set forth in the federal I/M regulation are substantially satisfied based on the condition
that the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania will submit to EPA by December 31, 1994 the 

Pennsylvania Bulletin

 notice certifying the need for the program and that the program begins sixty days after the date of the 

Pennsylvania Bulletin

 notice. EPA is proposing to conditionally approve the Pennsylvania SIP based on the Commonwealth's commitment to
meet this condition. If the 

Pennsylvania Bulletin

 notice is not received by December 31, 1994, EPA will consider the commitment not met and will promptly issue a letter
to the Commonwealth indicating that the conditional approval has been converted to a disapproval.

EPA's review of the material indicates that with the conditions and contingencies described above the Commonwealth
has adopted an enhanced I/M program in accordance with the requirements of the Act. EPA is proposing to conditionally
approve the Pennsylvania SIP revision and the addendum to the revision for an enhanced I/M program, which were submitted
on November 5, 1993 and March 30, 1994, respectively, subject to the conditions and contingencies described above.
EPA is soliciting public comments on the issues discussed in this notice or on other relevant matters. These comments
will be considered before taking final action. Interested parties may participate in the Federal rulemaking procedure
by submitting written comments to the EPA Regional office listed in the 

Addresses

 section of this notice. 



Proposed Action 



EPA is proposing to conditionally approve this revision to the Pennsylvania SIP for an enhanced I/M program based
on certain contingencies. The conditions for approvability are as follows: (1) by December 31, 1994 a notice must
be published in the 

Pennsylvania Bulletin

 by the Secretary of the Department of Transportation which certifies that the enhanced I/M program is required in
order to comply with federal law, certifies the geographic areas which are subject to the enhanced I/M program (the
geographic coverage must be identical to that listed in Appendix A-1 of the November 5, 1993 SIP submittal),
and certifies the commencement date of the enhanced I/M program. This notice must be submitted to EPA as an amendment
to the SIP by December 31, 1994; (2) by December 31, 1994 the Commonwealth must revise and submit to EPA as a SIP amendment,
the amendments to the Pennsylvania I/M regulation, 67 PA Code Chapter 178.202-205, which require EPA approval
prior to implementation of any alternate purge test procedure and incorporate the transient emission standards
for Tier 1 vehicles, the Phase 2 standards for all vehicle types and model years, and the transient and evaporative
purge test procedures found in the final version of the EPA document entitled ``High-Tech I/M Test Procedures, Emission
Standards, Quality Control Requirements, and Equipment Specifications'', EPA-AA-EPSD-IM-93-1,
April 1994, (3) within one year from the date that EPA conditionally approves the Pennsylvania I/M SIP, the Commonwealth
must submit the PADOT procedures manual for motorist compliance enforcement program oversight as an amendment to
the SIP and (4) within one year from the date that EPA conditionally approves the Pennsylvania I/M SIP, the Commonwealth
must submit the PADOT procedures manual for quality assurance as an amendment to the SIP. The contingencies for approvability
are as follows: (1) if penalties are assessed against the contractor under the Contractor Responsibility Program
in lieu of the penalties in 67 PA Code  178.602(b) of the Pennsylvania I/M regulation, the penalties must be equal
to or more stringent than those in the Commonwealth's I/M regulation and (2) the present contractor or any future contractors
for the Pennsylvania I/M program may not have any business interest in a vehicle repair facility anywhere in the continental
United States. 


Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 

et seq.

, EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities.
5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial
number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government
entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000. 


Conditional approvals of SIP submittals under section 110 and subchapter I, part D of the Act do not create any new requirements
but simply approve requirements that the Commonwealth is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal SIP approval
does not impose any new requirements, I certify that it does not have a significant impact on any small entities affected.
Moreover, due to the nature of the Federal-State relationship under the Act, preparation of a flexibility analysis
would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of Commonwealth action. The Clean Air Act forbids
EPA to base its actions concerning SIPs on such grounds. 

Union Electric Co.

 v. 

U.S. EPA,

 427 U.S. 246, 255-66 (1976); 42 U.S.C. 7410(a)(2). 


If the Commonwealth fails to meet any of the conditions of this approval action, the EPA Regional Administrator would
directly make a finding, by letter, that the conditional approval had converted to a disapproval and the clock for
imposition of sanctions under section 179(a) of the Act would start as of the date of the letter. Subsequently, a notice
would be published in the 

Federal Register

 announcing that the SIP revision has been disapproved. 


If the conditional approval is converted to a disapproval under section 110(k), based on the Commonwealth's failure
to meet the commitment, it will not affect any existing Commonwealth requirements applicable to small entities.
Federal disapproval of the Commonwealth's submittal does not affect its state-enforceability. Moreover, EPA's
disapproval of the submittal does not impose a new Federal requirement. Therefore, EPA certifies that this disapproval
action does not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities because it does not remove existing
requirements nor does it substitute a new federal requirement. 

Under Executive Order 12866, this action is not significant. It has not been submitted to OMB for review. 

The Administrator's decision to approve or disapprove the Pennsylvania I/M SIP revision will be based on whether
it meets the requirements of section 110(a)(2)(A)-(K) of the Clean Air Act, as amended, and EPA regulations
in 40 CFR part 51.

Approval and Promulgation of Implementation Plans North Carolina: Approval of Revisions to North Carolina Regulations
for Oxygenated Gasoline Program 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The EPA proposes to approve the State implementation plan (SIP) revision submitted by the State of North Carolina
for the purpose of establishing an Oxygenated Fuel Program in the Winston-Salem and Raleigh/Durham Metropolitan
Statistical Areas. In the final rules section of this 

Federal Register

, the EPA is approving the State's SIP revision as a direct final rule without prior proposal because the Agency views
this as a noncontroversial revision amendment and anticipates no adverse comments. A detailed rational for the approval
is set forth in the direct final rule. If no adverse comments are received in response to that direct final rule, no further
activity is contemplated in relation to this proposed rule. If EPA receives adverse comments, the direct final rule
will be withdrawn and all public comments received will be addressed in a subsequent final rule based on this proposed
rule. The EPA will not institute a second comment period on this document. Any parties interested in commenting on
this document should do so at this time.

Outer Continental Shelf Air Regulations; 
Consistency Update for California 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (``EPA'').



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of proposed rulemaking (``NPR''); consistency update.

 . 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 EPA is proposing to update a portion of the Outer Continental Shelf (``OCS'') Air Regulations. Requirements applying
to OCS sources located within 25 miles of states' seaward boundaries must be updated periodically to remain consistent
with the requirements of the corresponding onshore area (``COA''), as mandated by section 328(a)(1) of the Clean
Air Act (``the Act''), the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. The portion of the OCS air regulations that is being updated
pertains to the requirements for OCS sources for which the Santa Barbara County Air Pollution Control District (Santa
Barbara County APCD), the South Coast Air Quality Management District (South Coast AQMD), and the Ventura County
Air Pollution Control District (Ventura County APCD) are the designated COAs. The OCS requirements for the above
Districts, contained in the Technical Support Document, are proposed to be incorporated by reference into the Code
of Federal Regulations and are listed in the appendix to the OCS air regulations. Proposed changes to the existing
requirements are discussed below.

 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

Background 



On September 4, 1992, EPA promulgated 40 CFR part 55

1

, which established requirements to control air pollution from OCS sources in order to attain and maintain federal
and state ambient air quality standards and to comply with the provisions of part C of title I of the Act. Part 55 applies
to all OCS sources offshore of the States except those located in the Gulf of Mexico west of 87.5 degrees longitude.
Section 328 of the Act requires that for such sources located within 25 miles of a state's seaward boundary, the requirements
shall be the same as would be applicable if the sources were located in the COA. Because the OCS requirements are based
on onshore requirements, and onshore requirements may change, section 328(a)(1) requires that EPA update the OCS
requirements as necessary to maintain consistency with onshore requirements. 





Pursuant to  55.12 of the OCS rule, consistency reviews will occur (1) at least annually; (2) upon receipt of
a Notice of Intent (NOI) under  55.4; and (3) when a state or local agency submits a rule to EPA to be considered
for incorporation by reference in part 55. This NPR is being promulgated in response to the submittal of rules by three
local air pollution control agencies. Public comments received in writing within 30 days of publication of this notice
will be considered by EPA before promulgation of the final updated rule. 


Section 328(a) of the Act requires that EPA establish requirements to control air pollution from OCS sources located
within 25 miles of states' seaward boundaries that are the same as onshore requirements. To comply with this statutory
mandate, EPA must incorporate applicable onshore rules into part 55 as they exist onshore. This limits EPA's flexibility
in deciding which requirements will be incorporated into part 55 and prevents EPA from making substantive changes
to the requirements it incorporates. As a result, EPA may be incorporating rules into part 55 that do not conform to
all of EPA's state implementation plan (SIP) guidance or certain requirements of the Act. Consistency updates may
result in the inclusion of state or local rules or regulations into part 55, even though the same rules may ultimately
be disapproved for inclusion as part of the SIP. Inclusion in the OCS rule does not imply that a rule meets the requirements
of the Act for SIP approval, nor does it imply that the rule will be approved by EPA for inclusion in the SIP. 



EPA Evaluation and Proposed Action 



In updating 40 CFR part 55, EPA reviewed the state and local rules submitted for inclusion in part 55 to ensure that they
are rationally related to the attainment or maintenance of federal or state ambient air quality standards or part
C of title I of the Act, that they are not designed expressly to prevent exploration and development of the OCS and that
they are applicable to OCS sources. 40 CFR 55.1. EPA has also evaluated the rules to ensure they are not arbitrary or
capricious. 40 CFR 55.12 (e). In addition, EPA has excluded administrative or procedural rules.

A. After review of the rules submitted by the Santa Barbara County APCD against the criteria set forth above and in 40
CFR part 55, EPA is proposing to make the following rules applicable to OCS sources for which the Santa Barbara County
APCD is designated as the COA. None of the existing OCS requirements were deleted. The following new rules were submitted
by the District to be added:




Rule 316 Storage and Transfer of Gasoline (Adopted 12/14/93) 
Rule 325 Crude Oil Production and Separation (Adopted 1/25/94)

C. After review of the rules submitted by Ventura County APCD against the criteria set forth above and in 40 CFR part
55, EPA is proposing to make the following rules applicable to OCS sources for which Ventura County APCD is designated
as the COA. None of the existing OCS requirements were deleted. 



The following new rules were submitted by the District to be added: 




Rule 15.1 Sampling and Testing Facilities (Adopted 10/12/93) 
Rule 74.24 Marine Coating Operations (Adopted 3/8/94)

Administrative Requirements 




A. Executive Order 12866 





The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the 
requirements of Section 6 of Executive Order 12866. 




B. Regulatory Flexibility Act 





The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 requires each federal agency to perform a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis
for all rules that are likely to have a ``significant impact on a substantial number of small entities.'' Small entities
include small businesses, organizations, and governmental jurisdictions. 



As was stated in the final regulation, the OCS rule does not apply to any small entities, and the structure of the rule
averts direct impacts and mitigates indirect impacts on small entities. This consistency update merely incorporates
onshore requirements into the OCS rule to maintain consistency with onshore regulations as required by section 328
of the Act and does not alter the structure of the rule. 



The EPA certifies that this notice of proposed rulemaking will not have a 
significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. 




C. Paperwork Reduction Act 





The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has approved the information 
collection requirements contained in the final OCS rulemaking dated September 4, 1992 under the provisions of the


Paperwork Reduction Act,

 44 U.S.C. 3501

<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Public Buildings Service (PBS), GSA. 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Proposed rule; extension of comment period.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The General Services Administration has proposed a regulation to further define the term 

equivalent level of safety

 (59 FR 26768, May 24, 1994). The Federal Fire Safety Act of 1992 amended the Fire Prevention and Control Act of 1974 to
require sprinklers or an 

equivalent level of safety

 in certain types of Federal Employee office buildings, Federal employee housing units, and Federally assisted housing
units. This regulation establishes certain criteria which alternative approaches must satisfy to be judged equivalent.
These criteria have been selected to provide the level of life safety prescribed in the Act. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

At the request of the Department of Defense, the period for public comments on the proposed rule further defining an


equivalent level of safety

 is being extended. The public will have until July 25, 1994, to comment on the regulation. 



A survey of individuals involved in fire protection, conducted by the Naval Facilities Engineering Command, indicated
a number of people were unaware of the proposed rule and the request for public comments. A thirty-day extension of
the public comment period should provide sufficient time for interested individuals to respond. Consideration
of all substantive issues is important is ensuring that the rule reflects sound state-of-the-art fire protection
engineering principles, fosters science and technological advancements, and provides reasonable flexibility.

Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants; Extension of Comment Period and Notice of Public Hearing on Proposed
Threatened Status for the Virgin Spinedace (Lepidomeda Mollispinis Mollispinis)



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Fish and Wildlife Service, Interior.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Proposed rule; notice of public hearing and extension of comment period.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) provides notice that a public hearing will be held on the proposed determination
of threatened status for the Virgin spinedace (

Lepidomeda mollispinis mollispinis

) and that the comment period on the proposal is extended. This small fish in the minnow family (

Cyprinidae

) is endemic to the Virgin River drainage, a tributary to the Colorado River of southwestern Utah, northwestern Arizona,
and southeastern Nevada.



All interested parties are invited to submit comments on this proposal.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Background



The Virgin spinedace (

Lepidomeda mollispinis mollispinis

) is endemic to the Virgin River drainage, a tributary to the Colorado River of southwestern Utah, northwestern Arizona,
and southeastern Nevada. Approximately 40 percent of the historical habitat of the Virgin spinedace has been lost
due to human impacts, which include habitat fragmentation; introduction of nonnative fishes; and dewatering due
to agriculture, mining, and urbanization. These impacts continue to threaten the Virgin spinedace. Listing this
species as threatened would afford the Virgin spinedace protection under the Endangered Species Act (Act) of 1973,
as amended (16 U.S.C. 1531 

et seq.

).

On May 18, 1994, the Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) published a proposed rule (59 FR 25875) to list the Virgin spinedace
as threatened under the Act. Section 4(b)(5)(E) of the Act requires that a public hearing be held if requested within
45 days of publication of the proposal in the 

Federal Register

. A public hearing request was received within the allotted time period from Ronald W. Thompson, District Manager,
St. George, Utah, representing the Washington County Water Conservancy District.

The Service has scheduled this hearing on Wednesday, July 13, 1994, from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. and 7 p.m. to 9 p.m., with registration
beginning at 3:30 p.m. mountain daylight time (see 

ADDRESSES

 above). Anyone wishing to make an oral statement for the record is encouraged to provide a written copy of their statement
to be presented to the Service at the start of the hearing. In the event there is a large attendance, the time allotted
for oral statements may have to be limited. An adjacent room also will be provided for those who wish to ask questions
and to obtain additional information during and after the formal hearing.

Oral and written statements concerning the proposed rule that are presented at the hearing will receive equal consideration
by the Service. There are no limits to the length of written comments presented at this hearing or mailed to the service.
Comments particularly are sought concerning:

(1) Biological, commercial trade, or other relevant data concerning any threat (or lack thereof) to this species;

(2) The location of any additional populations of this species and the reasons why any habitat should or should not
be determined to be critical habitat as provided by section 4 of the Act;

(3) Additional information concerning the range, distribution, and population size of this species; and

(4) Current or planned activities in the subject area and their possible impacts on this species.

Legal notices and news releases announcing the date, time, and location of the hearing are being published in newspapers
concurrently with this 

Federal Register

 notice.

The comment period on the proposal originally closed on July 18, 1994. In order to accommodate the hearing, the Service
hereby extends the comment period until August 17, 1994. Written comments may now be submitted to the Service office
identified in the 

ADDRESSES

 section, however, all comments must be received before the close of the comment period to be considered.

The Service stated in the proposed rule (59 FR 25875) that critical habitat will be proposed for the Virgin spinedace
and the other listed Virgin River species before publishing a final determination to list the Virgin spinedace only,
this could have a negative impact on the Virgin spinedace. Section 7 of the Act requires that: ``Each Federal agency
shall * * * insure that any action authorized, funded, or carried out by such agency * * *
is not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of any endangered species or result in the destruction or adverse
modification of habitat of such species which is determined * * * to be critical, unless such agency
has been granted an exemption for such action * * *.'' The Virgin spinedace presently occupies areas
of the Virgin River drainage that overlap or are upstream of areas occupied by the endangered Virgin River chub (

Gila robusta seminuda

) and woundfin (

Plagopterus argentissimus

). Because these species occur in such close proximity and they, in part, share common resources, the Service finds
that critical habitat must be determined only on a multispecies level using an ecosystem approach. If critical habitat
and its constituent elements were determined for the Virgin spinedace only, this could have a negative impact on the
Virgin River chub and woundfin minnow. Therefore, in the case of the Virgin River fishes, it would not be prudent to
designate critical habitat for a single species.

At this time, the Service is seeking comments related to the proposed listing of the Virgin spinedace. At a later date,
the Service will publish a proposed rule for determining critical habitat for the Virgin River fishes, and additional
comments concerning its multispecies approach to endangered species conservation for the Virgin River will be sought.
After the proposed rule for critical habitat is published in the 

Federal Register

, the Service will open a public comment period, hold public hearings, and request comments from all interested parties
on the proposed critical habitat designation. After the public comment period has expired, the Service will review
the public input, consider any areas recommended for exclusion, make a final critical habitat designation, and publish
the critical habitat designation.

ACTION: 

Notice of proposed rulemaking.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This notice proposes changes to the powerplant airworthiness standards for normal, utility, acrobatic, and commuter
category airplanes. These proposals arise from the joint effort of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and
the European Joint Aviation Authorities (JAA) to harmonize the Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) and the Joint
Aviation Requirements (JAR) for airplanes that will be certificated in these categories. The proposed changes would
provide nearly uniform powerplant airworthiness standards for airplanes certificated in the United States under
14 CFR part 23 (part 23) and in the JAA countries under Joint Aviation Requirements 23 (JAR 23) simplifying airworthiness
approvals for import and export purposes.

Background



At the June 1990 meeting of the JAA Council (consisting of JAA members from European countries) and the FAA, the FAA
Administrator committed the FAA to support the harmonization of the FAR with the JAR being developed for use by the
European authorities who are members of the JAA. In response to this commitment, the FAA Small Airplane Directorate
established an FAA Harmonization Task Force to work with the JAR 23 Study Group to harmonize part 23 and the proposed
JAR 23. The General Aviation Manufacturers Association (GAMA) also established a JAR 23/part 23 Committee to provide
technical assistance in this effort.

Following a review of the first draft of proposed JAR 23, members of the FAA Harmonization Task Force and the GAMA Committee
met in Brussels, Belgium for the October 1990 meeting of the JAR 23 Study Group. Representatives from the Association
Europeenne des Constructeures de Material Aerospatial (AECMA), an organization of European airframe manufacturers,
also attended. The main agenda item for this meeting was the establishment of procedures to accomplish harmonization
of the airworthiness standards for normal, utility, and acrobatic category airplanes. The JAA had decided that its
initial rulemaking effort should be limited to these three categories and that commuter category airworthiness
standards should be addressed separately.

After that meeting, technical representatives from each of the four organizations (GAMA, AECMA, FAA and JAA) met
to resolve differences between the proposed JAR and part 23. This portion of the harmonization effort involved a number
of separate meetings of specialists in the flight, airframe, powerplant, and systems disciplines. These meetings
showed that harmonization would require revisions to both part 23 and the proposed JAR 23.

Near the end of the effort to harmonize the normal, utility, and acrobatic category airplane airworthiness standards,
the JAA requested and received recomendations from its member countries on proposed airworthiness standards for
commuter category airplanes. The JAA and the FAA held specialist and study group meetings to discuss these recommendations,
which resulted in proposals to revise portions of the part 23 commuter category airworthiness standards.

Unlike the European rules, where commuter category airworthiness standards are separate, for U.S. rulemaking it
is advantageous to adopt normal, utility, acrobatic, and commuter category airworthiness standards simultaneously,
since commuter category airworthiness standards are already contained in part 23. Accordingly, this NPRM proposes
to revise the powerplant airworthiness standards for all part 23 airplanes.

During the part 23 Harmonization effort, the FAA established an Aviation Rulemaking Advisory Committee (ARAC) (56
FR 2190, January 22, 1991), which held its first meeting on May 23, 1991. The ARAC on General Aviation and Business Airplane
(GABA) Issues was established at that meeting to provide advice and recommendations to the Director, Aircraft Certification
Service, FAA, regarding the airworthiness standards in part 23 as well as related provisions of parts 91 and 135 of
the regulations.

The FAA announced, on June 2-5, 1992, at the JAA/FAA Harmonization Conference in Toronto, Ontario, Canada,
that it would consolidate within the ARAC structure an ongoing objective to ``harmonize'' the JAR and the FAR. Coinciding
with that announcement, the FAA assigned the ARAC on GABA Issues those rulemaking projects related to JAR/part 23
harmonization that were in final coordination between the JAA and the FAA. The harmonization process included the
intention to present the results of JAA/FAA coordination to the public as NPRM's. Subsequently, the ARAC on GABA Issues
established on ARAC-JAR 23 Study Group.

The JAR 23 Study Group made recommendations to the ARAC on GABA Issues concerning the FAA's disposition of the rulemaking
issues coordinated between the JAA and the FAA. The draft NPRM's previously prepared by the FAA harmonization team
were made available to the harmonization working group to assist them in their effort.

A notice of the formation of the JAR/FAR 23 Harmonization Working Group was published on November 30, 1992 (54 FR 56626).
The group held its first meeting on February 2, 1993. These efforts resulted in the proposals for powerplant airworthiness
standards contained in this notice. The ARAC on GABA Issues agreed with these proposals.

The FAA received unsolicited comments from the JAA dated January 20, 1994, concerning issues that were left unresolved
with the JAR 23 Study Group. The JAR/FAR 23 Harmonization Working Group did not address some of the unresolved issues
because the JAA had not yet reached positions on those issues. Unresolved issues will be dealt with at future FAR/JAR
Harmonization meetings. With respect to other issues unresolved by the JAR 23 Study Group, the JAR/FAR Harmonization
Working Group recommendations did not reflect harmonization, but reflected the technical discussion of the merits
of each issue that had been thoroughly debated at the JAR/FAR 23 Harmonization meetings. (The Working Group Chairperson
had been present at the Harmonization meetings.) The JAA comments have been placed in the docket for this proposal,
and will be considered along with those received during the comment period.

Following completion of these harmonization efforts, the FAA determined that the proposed revisions to part 23 were
too numerous for a single NPRM. The FAA decided to simplify the issues by issuing four NPRM's. These NPRM's address
the airworthiness standards in the specific areas of systems and equipment, powerplant, flight, and airframe. These
NPRM's propose changes in all seven subparts of part 23. Since there is some overlap, interested persons are advised
to review all four NPRM's to identify all proposed changes to a particular section.

Discussion of the Proposals


Section 23.777 Cockpit Controls


The current requirements of  23.777 address the location of powerplant controls on tandem-seated airplanes.
For single-engine airplanes that are designed for a single cockpit occupant, the powerplant controls should be located
in the same position as they are for tandem-seated airplanes. Therefore,  23.777(c)(2) would be revised to
include single-seated airplanes.


Section 23.779 Motion and Effect of Cockpit Controls


Current  23.779(b)(1) provides requirements for ``powerplant controls,'' including direction of travel
and effect. This proposal would revise  23.779(b)(1) by adding a new item ``fuel'' to the table. This proposal
would require that any fuel shutoff control other than mixture must move forward to open.


Section 23.901 Installation


Section 23.901(d)(1), as amended in Amendment 23-43, requires that each turbine engine installation must
be constructed and arranged to result in vibration characteristics that do not exceed those established during the
type certification of the engine. This requirement would be revised to add the word ``carcass'' before vibration.
This change would restrict analyses to those vibrations that are caused by external excitation to the main engine
frame or ``carcass.'' While the word ``carcass'' has not traditionally been used in this context in the United States,
it is used in Europe and is proposed here in the interest of harmonization.
Section 23.901(d)(2), as amended in Amendment 23-43, would be revised by deleting the last sentence which reads:
``The engine must accelerate and decelerate safely following stabilized operations under these rain conditions.''
This requirement is already provided for in the first sentence of paragraph (d)(2), which states that the turbine
engine must be constructed and arranged to provide ``continued safe operation.''
Paragraph (e) of this section would be revised by adding the word ``powerplant'' in front of ``installation'' to make
clear that it pertains to all powerplant installations.
Current paragraph (e)(1) would be reformatted to accommodate the added provisions of new paragraph (e)(1)(ii).
The current paragraph (e)(1) would be divided into paragraphs (e)(1), (e)(1)(i), and (e)(1)(ii). Paragraph (e)(1)
would be revised by adding the word ``installation'' in front of ``instruction'' to make clear which instructions
are applicable. Proposed paragraph (e)(1) would end after the word ``under_,'' and paragraphs (e)(1)(i) and (e)(1)(ii)
would continue the paragraph.
Proposed paragraph (e)(1)(i) would contain the requirement with respect to the engine type certificate currently
set forth in paragraph (e)(1). Proposed paragraph (e)(1)(ii) would continue the current requirement with respect
to the propeller type certificate, but also would permit the alternative of meeting the requirements of another approved
procedure that would provide an equivalent level of safety. This revision is proposed to be consistent with the proposed
revisions to  23.905, Propellers, which are discussed below.


Section 23.903 Engines


This proposal would revise paragraphs (c) and (g) by adding the headings ``Engine isolation'' and ``Restart capability,''
respectively. Current  23.903 includes headings for paragraphs (a), (b), (d), (e) and (f) that identify the
subject of each paragraph. This revision will provide this same identification for paragraphs (c) and (g).
The heading of paragraph (f) would be changed from ``Restart capability'' to ``Restart envelope'' since the paragraph
addresses the altitude and airspeed envelope for restarting the engines in flight.


Section 23.905 Propellers


Section 23.905(a), which requires each propeller to have a type certificate, would be revised to require the propeller
to either be type certificated or meet the requirements of another approved procedure that provides an equivalent
level of safety. This would allow a propeller to be installed and approved on a U.S. type certificated airplane if that
propeller is approved by a procedure that provides a level of safety equivalent to that provided by the FAA type certificate.
For example, some foreign propellers, approved as part of the airplane and not having a separate type certificate,
could be approved without requiring an exemption to part 23 or obtaining a U.S. type certificate; but the ``equivalent
procedure'' is not intended to be limited to a procedure of a foreign authority.
This proposal would provide an alternative approval process for propellers without reducing safety.


Section 23.906 Propeller Vibration


Current  23.907(a) requires that each ``propeller with metal blades or highly stressed metal components must
be shown to have vibration stresses, in normal operating conditions, that do not exceed values'' that are ``safe for
continuous operation.'' The proposed revision to paragraph (a) would change the applicability to propellers ``other
than a conventional fixed-pitch wooden propeller.'' This change is necessary because all metal and most composite
propeller blades are highly stressed and need to be evaluated for vibration. Only propellers with fixed-pitch wooden
blades would be exempt from the vibration requirements.


Section 23.925 Propeller Clearance


Current  23.925 requires that propeller clearance must be evaluated with the airplane at maximum weight, with
the most adverse center of gravity and with the propeller in the most adverse pitch position. To make the requirement
consistent with current certification practice, paragraph (a) would be revised to read that propeller clearance
must be evaluated with the airplane at the most adverse combination of weight and center of gravity, and with the propeller
in the most adverse pitch position.
Interested persons should additionally note that the FAA is also proposing a change to  23.925(b). In the Airframe
Harmonization notice, the FAA proposes to move the requirements in  23.925(b) for tail wheels, bumpers, and
energy absorption devices to  23.497(c), 

Supplementary conditions for tail wheels,

 where the structural designer would expect to find such a requirement.


Section 23.929 Engine Installation Ice Protection


This proposal would replace the word ``power'' in  23.929 in the phrase ``without appreciable loss of power''
with the word ``thrust.'' The word ``thrust'' is more descriptive of the loss experienced when ice forms on a propeller.


Section 23.933 Reversing Systems


This proposal would revise  23.933(a)(1) to agree with the corresponding turbojet and turbofan reversing
system airworthiness standards of part 25. The purpose of thrust reversing systems for part 23 airplanes is the same
as that for part 25 airplanes. While there is no technical change, in the interest of harmonization part 23 would be
changed to read the same as part 25. Also, this proposal would delete the word ``forward'' from paragraph (a)(3) since
this word is not necessary. It would correct the typographical error in paragraph (b)(2) to read ``(b)(1)'' instead
of ``(a)(1).''


Section 23.955 Fuel Flow


Section 23.955(a) would be revised by deleting the word ``and'' where it occurs between paragraphs (1), (2), (3) and
(4). This is a nonsubstantive editorial change. All four paragraphs are independent of each other and equally subordinate
to paragraph (a).
Section 23.955(a)(3) would be revised by adding the word ``probable'' so that the requirement would read as follows:
``If there is a flow meter without a bypass, it must not have any probable failure mode * * * '' This addition
of the word ``probable'' would clarify the intent of the requirement that only probable failures need be analyzed.

Section 23.959 Unusable Fuel Supply


Current  23.959 requires that the unusable fuel supply for each tank be established and states certain parameters
for establishing the unusable supply. The current text of  23.959 would be redesignated as paragraph (a); a
proposed new paragraph (b) would require that the effect of any fuel pump failure on the unusable fuel supply also be
established.
It has been industry practice to include in the Airplane Flight Manual an entry describing any additional unusable
fuel quantity that results from a fuel pump failure. This proposal would not require any change in the fuel quantity
indicator marking required by  23.1553.


Section 23.963 Fuel Tanks: General


Current  23.963(b), which requires that each flexible fuel tank liner must be of an acceptable kind, would be
revised by replacing the phrase ``must be of an acceptable kind'' with the phrase ``must be shown to be suitable for
the particular application.'' The word ``acceptable'' is inexact since all components of a type certificated airplane
must be acceptable. This is a clarifying, nonsubstantive change. Also the reference to  23.959 would be revised
by changing it to  23.959(a) to coincide with the proposed revision of  23.959 discussed above.


Section 23.965 Fuel Tank Tests


Section  23.965(b)(3)(i) would be revised by changing the phrase ``the test frequency of vibration cycles
per minute is obtained by * * *'' to ``the test frequency of vibration is the number of cycles
per minute obtained by * * *''. This would clarify that it is the number of cycles per minute
that is to be used during testing of a fuel tank. The frequency of vibration to be used during testing of a fuel tank on
a non-propeller driven airplane has received differing interpretations during certification procedures.


Section 23.973 Fuel Tank Filler Connection


Current  23.973(f) specifies a minimum diameter of the fuel filler opening for airplanes with turbine engines
that are not equipped with pressure fueling systems. The proposed paragraph (f) would remove the provision related
to pressure fueling systems to make the regulation apply to all airplanes with turbine engines, including turbine
engines that are equipped with pressure fueling systems. The need to restrict the fuel opening diameter on the top
side of the fuel tank is not related to a function of whether or not the airplane is equipped with pressure refueling.


Section 23.975 Fuel Tank Vents and Carburetor Vents


Current 23.975(a)(5), as amended in Amendment 23-43, requires that there be no undrainable points in any vent
lines where moisture can accumulate and that any drain lines installed in the vent lines must discharge clear of that
airplane and be accessible for drainage. This paragraph would be revised to clarify that there may be no points in any
vent line where moisture can accumulate unless drainage is provided. The intent is to allow low spots in the fuel tank
vent system if a drain is provided for each low spot.


Section 23.979 Pressure Fueling System


Section 23.979(b) would be revised to add a requirement for commuter category airplanes that an automatic shutoff
means must provide indication at each fueling station of failure of the shutoff means to stop fuel flow at the maximum
level. This revision makes the commuter category automatic shutoff means requirements similar to the requirements
for transport category airplanes in  25.979.


Section 23.1001 Fuel Jettisoning System


This proposal would revise  23.1001(b)(2) to redefine the speed at which the fuel jettisoning system tests
should be conducted. In a separate notice, as identified in the background section of this document, the FAA determined
that the best rate-of-climb speed no longer need be determined under part 23, and has proposed that it be eliminated
from  23.69(b). Accordingly, this proposal would redefine the climb speed as stated in  23.1001(b)(2)
to reference  23.69(b) as proposed.


Section 23.1013 Oil Tanks


This proposal would delete the word ``crankcase'' in  23.1013(d)(1), making this paragraph applicable to
all engine installations.


Section 23.1041 General


Current  23.1041 under the cooling heading requires that powerplant and auxiliary power unit cooling provisions
must maintain the temperature of powerplant components and engine fluids within the limits established for those
components and fluids to the maximum altitude for which approval is requested. This section would be revised to state
``to the maximum altitude and maximum ambient atmospheric temperature conditions for which approval is requested.''
For reciprocating engine powered airplanes, it has been the practice to correct the cooling temperatures to 100 
 F ambient temperature. In practice, turbine engine powered airplanes have been corrected to the maximum temperature
for which approval is requested. The standard would be revised to require all airplanes, regardless of engine type,
to demonstrate adequate cooling at one maximum ambient atmosphere temperature for which approval is requested.


Section 23.1043 Cooling Tests


Section 23.1043(a)(3) would be revised to shown that the minimum grade fuel requirement applies to both turbine and
reciprocating engines and that the lean mixture requirement applies to reciprocating engines only. The introductory
text of paragraph (a) would be simplified by deleting the requirement that compliance must be shown ``under critical
ground, water, and flight operating conditions to the maximum altitude for which approval is requested.'' This requirement
is already contained in  23.1041.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940630-1-00039 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940630-1-00011 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The requirement in the introductory text of paragraph (a), which states that, for turbo-charged engines, each turbocharger
must be operated through the part of the climb profile for which turbo-charger operation is requested, would be moved
to paragraph (a)(4) to improve the organization of the section.

Paragraph (a)(1) would not be substantively changed. It would be revised to be consistent with proposed changes to
 23.1041 and changes to the introductory text of paragraph (a) described above.

Paragraph (a)(2) is reworded without substantive change to make this language identical to the JAR.

Paragraph (a)(3) would be revised to clarify that the requirement for mixture settings applies to reciprocating
engines and that the mixture settings must be the leanest recommended for the climb. While this has been the case in
practice, it has not been explicitly stated in the rule. The ``leanest recommended for climb'' mixture setting is
considered a normal operating condition.

Paragraph (a)(5) is removed because water taxi tests are required by  23.1041 as amended by Amendment 23-43.

Paragraphs (c) and (d) would be revised by adding the requirement that cooling correction factors be determined for
the appropriate altitude. This would codify current certification practice and increase safety by ensuring the
proper correction factor is determined.



Section 23.1045 Cooling Test Procedures for Turbine Engine Powered Airplanes



Current 23.1045(a)(3) requires that compliance with  23.1041 must be shown by certain specified phases of
operations: takeoff, climb, en route, and landing. It also specifies that the cooling tests must be conducted with
the airplane in the configuration and under the operating conditions that are critical to cooling for each stage of
flight. It also defines a ``stabilized'' temperature as having a rate of change of less than 2 
 F per minute.

Current paragraph (a) would be revised to state more generally that compliance with  23.1041 must be shown for
all phases of operations. Also, the airplane must be flown in the configuration, at the speeds, and following the procedures
recommended in the Airplane Flight Manual for the relative stage of flight that corresponds to the applicable performance
requirements critical to cooling.

The purpose of this proposed revision is to clarify the cooling test procedures by specifying that all phases of operations,
not only the four phases of flight, are to be evaluated for proper cooling.



Section 23.1047 Cooling Test Procedures for Reciprocating Engine Powered Airplanes



This proposal would revise the cooling test procedures in  23.1047 for reciprocating engine powered airplanes
by deleting the specific procedures. Many of the current provisions in  23.1047 provide procedures for conducting
a cooling test that are inappropriate in the regulation. Experience has shown that such detailed procedures are not
directly applicable to certain engine configurations and certain operating conditions. Guidance material is available
that provides appropriate procedures for testing different types of engine configurations and for testing at different
operating conditions.



Section 23.1091 Air Induction System



Current  23.1091 requires the air induction system design protect against ingestion of foreign material located
``on the runway, taxiway, or other airport operating surface.'' This proposal would require the air induction system
design protect against foreign matter, from whatever source, ``during takeoff, landing, and taxiing.'' This would
codify current certification practice and increase safety by protecting against universal foreign matter rather
than foreign matter from a restricted source.



Section 23.1093 Induction System Icing Protection



Section 23.1093(c) would be revised by adding the heading ``Reciprocating engines with superchargers.'' This is
being done to be consistent with paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, which have headings.



Section 23.1105 Induction System Screens



Current  23.1105 requires that any induction screens must be upstream of the carburetor. This requirement
would be revised to include fuel injection systems. Some reciprocating engines incorporate a fuel injection system,
and the same provisions required for a carburetor are necessary for a fuel injection system.



Section 23.1107 Induction System Filters



Current  23.1107, which was added in Amendment 23-43, applies to reciprocating engine installations.
The introductory section of this paragraph would be revised by deleting the reference to reciprocating engine installations
to make the section applicable to airplanes with either reciprocating or turbine engines. If a filter is installed
in the induction system of a turbine powered airplane, the same provisions that apply to a reciprocating engine are
necessary.



Section 23.1121 General



This proposal would revise  23.1121(g) by adding standards for APU exhaust systems; these were overlooked
when APU standards were introduced into part 23 by Amendment 23-43. Prior to Amendment 23-43, applicants
for type certification of part 23 airplanes having APU installations were required to comply with special conditions
for those installations. Amendment 23-43 included a codification, albeit an incomplete one, of those special
conditions.



Section 23.1141 Powerplant Controls: General



Current  23.1141(b) requires that each flexible control be of an acceptable kind. This paragraph would be revised
to replace the phrase ``must be of an acceptable kind'' with the phrase ``must be shown to be suitable for the particular
application.'' This is a clarifying, non-substantive change.

<PARENT> FR940630-1-00011 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Section 23.1143 Engine Controls


Current  23.1143(f) requires that if a power or thrust control incorporates a fuel shutoff feature, the control
must have a means to prevent the inadvertent movement of the control into the shutoff position. Paragraph (f) would
be revised to add that a fuel control (other than a mixture control) must also have such a means.


Section 23.1153 Propeller Feathering Controls


Current  23.1153 requires that if there are propeller feathering controls, each propeller must have a separate
control, and each control must have a means to prevent inadvertent operation. This section would be revised because
it does not matter whether the feathering controls are separate from the propeller speed and pitch controls as long
as it is possible to feather each propeller separately.


Section 23.1181 Designated Fire Zones; Regions Included


Current  23.1181, which was added in Amendment 23-43, defines designated fire zones for reciprocating
engines and turbine engines. Proposed new  23.1181(b)(3) would add to the designated fire zones for turbine
engines any complete powerplant compartments that do not have firewalls between compressor, accessory, combustor,
turbine and tailpipe sections. The proposal would codify current certification practice and increase safety by
ensuring that all appropriate regions of turbine engines are evaluated as designated fire zones.


Section 23.1183 Lines, Fittings, and Components


Current  23.1183(a) includes the requirement that flexible hose assemblies must be approved. This requirement
in paragraph (a) would be revised by replacing the word ``approved'' with the words ``shown to be suitable for the particular
application.'' The revision clarifies what is required.


Section 23.1191 Firewalls


Current  23.1191(a) requires that each engine, auxiliary power unit, fuel-burning heater, and other combustion
equipment intended for operation in flight must be isolated ``by fire walls, shrouds, or equivalent means.'' Paragraph
(b) of the section requires that each firewall or shroud must be constructed so that no hazardous quantity of liquid,
gas, or flame can pass from the engine compartment to other parts of the airplane.
Paragraph (b) would be revised to define isolated compartment and to show that the provisions of paragraph (b) would
also apply to APU's.


Section 23.1203 Fire Detector System


Current  23.1203(e) requires that wiring and other components of each fire detector system in an engine compartment
must be at least fire resistant. For accuracy, proposed  23.1203(e) would replace the words ``engine compartment''
with ``designated fire zone'' to correct an oversight in the amendment and to make it consistent with  23.1181.


Section 23.1305 Powerplant Instruments


Current  23.1305(b)(3), as amended in Amendment 23-43, requires, for reciprocating engine-powered
airplanes, a cylinder head temperature indicator for each air-cooled engine with cowl flaps; each airplane for which
compliance with  23.1041 is shown at a speed higher than V

Y

; and each commuter category airplane.
The proposed revision to paragraph (b)(3) would delete paragraph (b)(3)(ii), which refers to compliance with  23.1041.
The flight notice referenced above contains a proposal to delete the determination of the V

Y

 speed and this notice proposes a change that the engine cooling test of  23.1047 be conducted at a speed recommended
in the Airplane Flight Manual (AFM). Accordingly, other sections referencing the V

Y

 speed or the engine cooling test would also be amended.
The proposed revision would retain the requirement that a cylinder head temperature indicator is required for commuter
category airplanes having reciprocating engines and for airplanes having air-cooled engines and cowl flaps.


Section 23.1337 Powerplant Instruments


Under the area of ``Installation,'' the reference in  23.1337(b)(1) to  23.959 would be changed to  23.959(a),
in accordance with the revision to  23.959 proposed in this notice. The revision would redesignate the existing
 23.959 text as  23.959(a); there is no change in the requirement itself.

Regulatory Evaluation, Regulatory Flexibility Determination, and Trade Impact Assessment



Proposed changes to Federal regulations must undergo several economic analyses. First, Executive Order 12866 directs
that each Federal agency shall propose or adopt a regulation only upon a reasoned determination that the benefits
of the intended regulation justify its costs. Second, the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 requires agencies to
analyze the economic effect of regulatory changes on small entities. Third, the Office of Management and Budget directs
agencies to assess the effects of regulatory changes on international trade. In conducting these analyses, the FAA
has determined that this rule: (1) Would generate benefits that would justify its costs and is not a ``significant
regulatory action'' as defined in the Executive Order; (2) is not ``significant'' as defined in DOT's Policies and
Procedures; (3) would not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities; and (4) would not constitute
a barrier to international trade. These analyses, available in the docket, are summarized below.



Regulatory Evaluation Summary



The FAA has determined that the benefits of the proposed rule, though not directly quantifiable, would exceed the
expected costs. Minor costs, ranging from $240 to $6,000 per certification, are projected for four of the provisions
in this proposal. No costs are attributed to the other thirty-two provisions. The benefits of the proposed rule are
considered below in four categories: (1) harmonization, (2) safety, (3) reduced need for special conditions, and
(4) clarification.



Harmonization



The proposed rule, in concert with other rulemaking and policy actions, would provide nearly uniform powerplant
airworthiness standards for airplanes certificated in the United States and the JAA member countries. Thirty-four
of the thirty-six sections affected by the proposed rule would be harmonized. The resulting greater uniformity of
standards would simplify airworthiness approval for import and export purposes and reduce the cost of certification
for airplanes seeking certification under both sets of regulations.



Safety



In addition to the harmonization benefits, five proposed changes would provide additional safety benefits. First,
the proposed rule would revise  23.933(a)(1) to more closely agree with the corresponding turbojet and turbofan
reversing system airworthiness standards of part 25. The FAA estimates that this provision would necessitate an
additional 100 hours of failure mode and effects analysis at an assumed cost rate of $60 per hour, including labor and
overhead. The estimated $6,000 cost would apply to each certification. The FAA projects that no additional production
or operating costs would result from this provision.

The primary potential benefit of the provision is the additional safety that could result from analyzing the feasible
range of reverser system failures, the effects of those failures, and the corresponding capabilities necessary
to correct the failure or circumvent its effects. Such an analysis would reduce the possibility that an unanticipated
condition with catastrophic potential would remain in the system. In addition to the safety benefit, it is expected
that some operating benefits and manufacturing economies would result from the uniformity of standards between
parts 23 and 25. The FAA is not able to quantify the potential benefits of this provision but has determined that the
benefits would exceed the expected minor costs.

Second, the proposed rule would add a new paragraph (b) to  23.959 requiring that the effect of any fuel pump failure
on the unusable fuel supply be determined. Though not previously required, it has been industry practice to include
this information in the Airplane Flight Manual. The FAA estimates that the nominal cost of making this determination
would be $240 per certification (4 hours of engineering analysis at $60 per hour). In addition, an insignificant cost
($1) would be incurred in adding a table entry to the manual for each airplane that is produced. The fact that the proposed
requirement is already standard practice supports the FAA's position that the potential benefits of the provision
would exceed the minor costs. The safety benefits of this provision would be derived from the assurance that this vital
information would continue to be provided for future airplane models.

Third, under  23.979, the proposed rule would add the requirement for commuter category airplanes that an indication
be provided at each fueling station in the event of a failure of the shutoff means to stop fuel flow at the maximum level.
The FAA estimates that the proposed required device would necessitate an incremental design and development cost
of $3000 per certification (50 hours of engineering design at $60 per hour) and an additional nominal manufacturing
cost of $10 per airplane. The benefit of the provision is the avoidance of a potentially catastrophic condition whereby
excess fuel could unknowingly be forced out of the contained fuel system by the pressure fueling system. The FAA holds
that these potential benefits would exceed the minor associated costs.

Fourth,  23.1041 would require that the powerplant cooling system must be able to maintain the specified operating
temperatures of the powerplant components and fluids. The ambient temperature for testing reciprocating engine
airplanes is currently required to be corrected to show the capacity of the cooling system at 100 
 F. Under the proposal, this temperature standard would be revised to the ``maximum ambient temperature conditions
for which approval is requested.''

No costs are attributed to this provision. Reciprocating engine airplane manufacturers would continue to have the
option to request approval for operations at the existing 100 
 F temperature.

A decision to request approval for a higher temperature would necessitate demonstration of the capability of the
cooling system at that temperature. That choice, however, would be made at the manufacturer's discretion and would
be based on its decision that any associated incremental cooling system costs would be recovered in the marketplace.
The potential benefit of this provision is the reduced likelihood that an inadequate cooling system would be relied
on during high temperature operations.

Finally,  23.1045(a) would be revised to state more generally that compliance with the cooling margin requirements
of  23.1041 must be shown for all phases of operation, as compared to the four phases of flight currently listed.
In effect, the proposal would add the taxi phase of operation.

The FAA estimates that the specific addition of the taxi phase would necessitate an incremental 5 hours of engineering
analysis valued at $60 per hour, for a total of $300 per certification. The potential benefit of this provision is the
enhanced safety that would result from evaluating the efficacy of the cooling system during the taxi phase of operation.
In the taxi phase of operation, engine power settings and heat production generally may be lower than that experienced
during flight, but available air circulation might also be lower. The heat mechanics of the two phases of operation
are distinct and warrant separate evaluation. The FAA holds that the potential benefits of this provision would exceed
the nominal associated costs.

Reduced Need for Special Conditions



The proposed rule includes five provisions that would replace the need for processing certain parts or materials
as special conditions because they have been considered novel or unusual design features. The subjects of these provisions
include composite propellers, fuel injection systems for reciprocating engines, induction filters on turbine
engines, fuel shutoff controls other than mixture controls, and auxiliary power units. No costs are attributed to
these provisions. Formalization of the equivalent safety standards and requirements for these subjects would obviate
the need for special conditions actions and would simplify the certification process for manufacturers.



Clarification



Several unclear provisions of part 23 were revealed during the harmonization review. In response to this finding,
the proposal includes a number of no-cost, editorial revisions that would clarify the existing requirements. These
changes would benefit manufacturers by removing potential confusion about the specific standards and requirements
necessary for product certification.

In summary, the FAA holds that each of the provisions, as well as the entire proposal, would be cost beneficial.



Regulatory Flexibility Determination



The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (RFA) was enacted by Congress to ensure that small entities are not unnecessarily
or disproportionately burdened by Government regulations. The RFA requires a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis
if a proposed rule would have a significant economic impact, either detrimental or beneficial, on a substantial number
of small entities. Based on implementing FAA Order 2100.14A, Regulatory Flexibility Criteria and Guidance, the
FAA has determined that the proposed amendments would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities.



Trade Impact Assessment



The proposed rule would not constitute a barrier to international trade, including the export of American airplanes
to foreign countries and the import of foreign airplanes into the United States. Instead, the proposed powerplant
airworthiness standards would be harmonized with those of foreign aviation authorities and would lessen current
restraints on trade caused by differences in certification requirements.



Federalism Implications



The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.



Conclusion



The FAA proposes to revise the airworthiness standards to provide propulsion standards for normal, utility, acrobatic,
and commuter category airplanes to harmonize them with the standards that will be proposed for the same category airplanes
by the Joint Aviation Authorities in Europe. If adopted, the proposed revisions would reduce the regulatory burden
on the United States and European airplane manufacturers by relieving them of the need to show compliance with different
standards each time they seek certification approval of an airplane in a different country.

For the reasons discussed in the preamble, and based on the findings in the Regulatory Evaluation, the FAA has determined
that this proposed regulation is not significant under Executive Order 12866. In addition, the FAA certifies that
this proposal, if adopted, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number
of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. This proposal is not considered significant
under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979). An initial regulatory evaluation
of the proposal has been placed in the docket. A copy may be obtained by contacting the person identified under

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM).






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This notice of proposed rulemaking would update existing fees for airmen and repair station certification services
performed outside the United States (U.S.) to reflect current cost levels; establish a schedule of fees where no fee
currently exists for: tests, authorizations, certificates, permits, or ratings relating to any airmen certification,
and repair station certification performed outside the United States; establish the methodology for computing
user fees and a timetable for periodic updates of fees; and establish additional methods of collecting those fees.



This proposed rulemaking is necessary to allow the FAA to fully recover the costs it incurs in performing airmen certification,
and repair station certification services outside the United States and to bring current airmen fees charges more
nearly in line with nondiscrimination principles of multilateral trade agreements to which the U.S. is a signatory
including the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and the GATT Aircraft Code.

The intended effect of this proposed action is to recover the costs of providing airmen, and repair station certification
services outside the United States. Recovering these costs would allow the FAA to continue to provide airmen, and
repair station certification services outside the United States, thereby facilitating the acceptance of U.S. aeronautical
products overseas.

Background


Statement of the Problem


The fee schedule that appears in 14 CFR part 187, appendix A, was established by rulemaking and became effective on
October 18, 1982. It contains fees for certain certification services performed outside of the United States by the
FAA. However, it does not contain fees for the full scope of activities for which fees may be charged under current statutory
authority. Rather, the fee schedule lists only fees for services that were being rendered outside the United States
at the time of that rulemaking. The fee schedule has not been updated since 1982, although the FAA's costs for performing
these services has escalated since adoption of the present rule in 1982. The FAA incurs special costs to operate overseas
that increase the costs for providing services outside the United States. These additional costs include cost-of-living
allowances as well as allowances for housing and education. Due to these costs, employing an inspector outside the
United States is approximately $85.4 thousand more costly than employing the same inspector within the United States.
Further, since the methodology for computing fee schedules and time table for adjustment of fees was not established
in 14 CFR part 187, appendix A, it is currently necessary to update this fee schedule by rulemaking.
The changes set out in this NPRM make the FAA's fee practice more nearly consistent with the principles of nondiscrimination
and most-favored-nation treatment that are at the core of the international trade regime set up by the GATT, and which
includes the Aircraft Code and the General Agreement on Trade in Services. Under these core trade principles, governments
should not treat foreign nationals differently in the measures that they take that affect international trade. Airman
certifications are not governed by any trade agreement to which the U.S. is a party, but the FAA has determined that
bringing its fee practices into line with international trade practices is desirable, if not required by any specific
obligation of the U.S. FAA measures with regard to certification of foreign repair stations, however, including
fees charged, will be subject to U.S. obligations under the General Agreement on Trade in Service (GATS), recently
concluded in the so-called Uruguay Round of GATT negotiations. The U.S. signed the agreement, but has not ratified
it, and it is not in force. Implementing legislation has not yet been submitted to Congress. Nevertheless, the GATS,
which applies multilateral trade principles to trade in services for the first time, will cover some aspects of aircraft
maintenance. This NPRM will be consistent with U.S. obligations under the GATS, once it goes into effect.


Statutory Authority


Title VI of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, as amended (the Act), gives the Administrator authority to issue certificates
for airmen, instructors, schools, and repair stations.
In addition, under Title V of the Independent Offices Appropriation Act of 1952 (31 U.S.C. 9701), the FAA has been charged
with establishing a fair and equitable system for recovering full costs expended for any service, such as the issuance
of the certificates discussed in this proposal, that provide a special benefit to an individual beyond those that
accrue to the general public. Section 403a of that Act provides, in part, as follows:



It is the sense of the Congress that any work service, publication, report, document, benefit, privilege, authority,
use, franchise, license, permit, certificate, registration, or similar thing of value or utility performed, furnished,
provided, granted, prepared or issued by any Federal Agency * * * to or for any person (including groups,
associations, organizations, partnerships, corporations, or businesses), except those engaged in the transaction
of official business of the Government, shall be self-sustaining to the fullest extent possible * * *.



Section 483a further provides, in part:

<DOCNO> FR940630-1-00050 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940630-1-00012 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The head of each Federal agency is authorized by regulation (which, in the case of agencies in the Executive Branch,
shall be as uniform as practicable and subject to such policies as the President may prescribe) to prescribe therefore
such fee, charge, or price, if any, as he shall determine, in case none exists, or redetermine, in case of any existing
one, to be fair and equitable taking into consideration direct and indirect cost to the Government, value to the recipient,
public policy or interest served, and other pertinent facts * * *.



Finally, in 1980, Congress passed the International Air Transportation Competition Act of 1979 (hereinafter ``IATC
Act'') giving the FAA authority to establish fee schedules for airmen and repair station certification services
provided outside the U.S. Section 28 of the IATC Act amended Section 45 of the Airline Deregulation Act to read as follows:



Nothing in this section shall prohibit the Secretary of Transportation or the Administrator from collecting a fee,
charge, or price for any test, authorization, certificate, permit, or rating, administered or issued outside the
United States, relating to any airman or repair station. (49 U.S.C. 334, second sentence).



The amounts collected shall be paid to the Federal Government.


Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Guidelines


To aid in establishing fee schedules, OMB has prescribed in Circular No. A-25 the general guidelines to be used
in developing an equitable and reasonable uniform system of charges for certain government services and property.
The circular provides that ``where a service (or privilege) provides special benefits to an identifiable recipient
above and beyond those that accrue to the public at large, a charge should be imposed to receive the full cost to the Federal
Government of rendering that service.'' Circular No. A-25 specifies the following:
A special benefit will be considered to accrue and a charge should be imposed when a Government-rendered service:
(a) Enables the beneficiary to obtain more immediate or substantial gains or values (which may or may not be measurable
in monetary terms) than those which accrue to the general public (for example, receiving a patent, crop insurance,
or license to carry on a specific business), or
(b) Provides business stability or assures public confidence in the business activity of the beneficiary (for example,
certificates of necessity and convenience [sic: convenience and necessity] for airline routes, or safety inspections
of craft); or
(c) Is performed at the request of the recipient and is above and beyond the services regularly received by other members
of the same industry or group, or of the general public (for example, receiving passport visa, airman's certificate,
or an inspection after regular duty hours).


General Discussion of the Proposals


This notice proposes that the fee schedule in 14 CFR part 187, Appendix A, be amended to provide the methodology for
computing user fees that permit full recovery of the FAA costs incurred in performing these services authorized by
legislation and to develop a timetable for updating fees. The method of payment of fees prescribed in 14 CFR 187.15
would also be amended to take advantage of some additionally available banking services, that is, wire transfers
and payment by credit card, that would expedite deposit of funds to the U.S. Government.
In keeping with the authority granted under the IATC Act, this notice would establish the schedule of fees that would
be published in an FAA Advisory Circular on inspector fees. Under this proposal, hourly rates for repair station certifications,
and fixed fees for each airman certificate issued would be derived from total costs to the FAA of providing the services
and have been computed using direct and indirect labor costs (excluding holiday, Sunday, and overtime costs), and
overhead costs. Fees for transportation and subsistence expenses associated with the issuance of certificates
have not been included in the computation of hourly fees and fixed fees. Fees covering those expenses would be charged
to applicants in addition to the specified fee whenever such expenses are incurred by the FAA in providing the requested
service. Consistent with OMB Circular A-25, under this NPRM the FAA would recover all costs incurred for performing
the above-described certification services outside the U.S.


Airman Certifications


There are 55 categories of airman certification actions for which fees are prescribed under the Appendix A at the present
time. These were the only categories of airman certification actions being administered by the FAA outside the United
States at the time of the original fees rulemaking in 1982. Since that time, demand for airman certification services
outside the U.S. has increased, and the FAA now administers airman tests, approvals, and ratings for which fees have
not been established.
There are 96 categories of FAA airman tests, approvals, or ratings that currently may be performed outside the U.S.
This proposal would update existing fees for the 55 types of airman tests, approvals, and ratings listed in 14 CFR part
187, Appendix A, and would also establish fees for the 41 other types of airman tests, approvals and ratings that the
FAA may administer outside the United States. Thus, the proposed rule would prescribe fees for all tests, renewals,
authorizations, or approvals relating to airman certification outside the United States.

This NPRM would also permit FAA recovery of transportation and subsistence expenses that may be incurred in the administering
of airman tests, approvals, and ratings outside the United States. Generally, written airman tests are given at the
FAA Flight Standards Office (FSO) and practical airman tests are conducted at a nearby airport where transportation
and subsistence expenses are not incurred. When inspectors give airman tests at locations outside of the FAA duty
station city, those tests are typically conducted in conjunction with a scheduled inspection. Since the fees charged
for airman tests do not offset the costs associated with travel, the FAA currently does not send its inspectors to locations
outside their duty stations solely for the purpose of conducting airman tests.

An occasion may arise, however, where an individual or group of individuals, such as a flying club, may be willing to
pay the transportation and subsistence expenses of an FAA inspector to permit him or her to travel in order to administer
airman tests. In instances of this type, this notice of proposed rulemaking would permit the FAA to recover transportation
and subsistence expenses in addition to the established airman fee.

Under the current rule, the FAA may charge only foreign nationals when it administers airman tests or performs similar
services outside the United States. This NPRM would remove that limitation by permitting the FAA to charge all applicants
for these services, regardless of country of citizenship, as authorized by the IATC Act. The removal of this limitation
will correct the current inequity of FAA charging U.S.-owed foreign repair stations for certification actions but
not charging other U.S. citizens for airman certification.

The cost to the FAA of providing airman certification services outside the United States is the same for all applicants
for the same type of test regardless of the citizenship of the applicant. Because Federal law prohibits charging anyone,
a foreign national or a U.S. citizen, more than the cost of services provided, the application of fees only to foreign
nationals effectively precludes full recovery of costs. Moreover, it is highly unlikely that costs of services provided
abroad to U.S. citizens could be recovered through the indirect user taxes that provide most of the FAA's funding.
These taxes_assessed on the value of domestic passenger tickets, domestic freight charges, passengers departing
the United States, and aviation fuel sold in the United States_are not paid by airmen living abroad, whether U.S. citizens
or foreign nationals.

Most U.S. citizens already pay for airman testing services provided outside the United States by using FAA designated
test examiners for obtaining airman certification services. Under this proposal, U.S. citizens would pay the same
fee as anyone else for the certification services described in this NPRM, regardless of whether a service is provided
by an FAA designated test examiner or by an FAA inspector.



Repair Stations



This proposal would also revise the hourly billing rate paid to the FAA for the certification of repair stations. The
current rate, found in 14 CFR part 187, Appendix A, would be increased from $47 per inspector hour to $80 per inspector
hour to cover the FAA's current costs incurred while performing this service. In addition to the hourly fees for inspector
services, this proposal would permit the FAA to recover transportation and subsistence expenses that may be incurred
in connection with repair station and services. The transportation and subsistence expenses incurred by FAA inspectors
represent a large portion of the costs incurred by the FAA when performing repair station certification work. Most
of this work must be performed on-site and, therefore, requires that an FAA inspector travel to the repair station
facility to be inspected. Repair stations facilities range from 20 minutes to 30 hours in travel time from FAA FSO's
and, in some instances, lack of funds to cover the FAA's transportation and subsistence costs may prevent the agency
from sending inspectors to perform needed repair station certification evaluations.

This proposal would delete the existing hourly fee of $14 for clerical time devoted to repair station certification
activities listed in 14 CFR part 187, Appendix A. Instead of computing a direct fee for clerical time, clerical costs
have been included in the hourly base rate that would be charged for the FAA inspector's time.

Fee Computation



Proposed fixed fees and hourly rates have been derived based on the standard methodology used in FAA cost allocation
studies. A single, average hourly billing rate for all Flight Standards Aviation Safety Inspectors (ASI'S), both
domestic based ASI'S and foreign based ASI'S, was derived using the methodology discussed in this section. Domestic
based ASI'S perform certification services, in addition to foreign based ASI'S. While domestic based ASI'S are employed
at a much lower rate than foreign based ASI'S ($85.4 thousand annual difference) it is beneficial, and consistent
with international treaties, to have one average hourly billing rate for ASI services, rather than have multiple
rates based on ASI location.

To determine the average hourly rate the FY94 Flight Standards operations budget of $270,515,400, excluding direct
ASI travel, Sunday, holiday and overtime pay, was used as the base. The annual appropriations for facilities and equipment
and research and development were also not used in the rate base. The operations budget contains the following items.

(1) Personnel compensation and benefits, budget code series 1100 (excluding codes 1151 and 1152_overtime, Sunday
and holiday pay), 1200 and 1300.

(2) Travel and transportation of persons, budget code series 2100 (excluding code 2100_site visit travel).

(3) Transportation of things, budget code series 2200.

(4) Rental, communications, utilities, budget code series 2300.

(5) Printing and reproduction, budget code series 2400.

(6) Contractual services, budget code series 2500.

(7) Supplies and materials, budget code series 2600.

(8) Equipment, budget code series 3100.

(9) Lands and structures, budget code series 3200.

10. Insurance claims and indemnities, budget code series 4200.

In order to recover overhead costs attributable to providing safety services, all costs are assigned to the inspector.
This is accomplished by dividing the operations budget of $270,515,400 by 2,694 ASI's on board at the beginning of
FY94. The number 2,694 is taken from the Flight Standards monthly staffing report and is the total number of ASI'S in
the OMB position series 1825. This division results in an annual ASI cost of $100,414.03. The annual ASI cost of $100,414,03
is divided by 2,087 hours, which is the annual paid hours of each federal government employee. This results in an hourly
cost of $48.11 per ``paid hour'' (the actual amount paid by the FAA for each hour of work performed by an inspector),
based on 2,087 paid hours per inspector year.

This cost of $48.11 per hour does not ensure full recovery of costs. Inspectors spend a significant amount of time in
indirect work such as training and the preparation of administrative reports, to support their inspection activities,
much of which cannot be allocated to any one client. In addition, not all 2,087 annual paid hours are available as work
hours. Training, providing technical assistance, leave, and other factors reduce the work hours that may be directly
billed. Consequently, it is necessary to increase the hourly ASI government paid amount of $48.11 by an indirect work
factor of 1.66 to arrive at the full cost recovery hourly ASI billing rate.
The indirect work factor of 1.66 is derived as follows. The Flight Standards Staffing Standard (FAA Order 1380.28B,
dated January 15, 1985) uses an indirect work rate of 0.43 to project the amount of time an ASI spends in indirect work
activities, as opposed to certification and surveillance work, during the year. The indirect work activities are:




(a) Development of master minimum equipment lists on Flight Operations Evaluation Board

(b) Development of aircraft training documents on Flight Standardization Board

(c) Development of Maintenance program documents on Maintenance Review Board

(d) Providing technical assistance

(e) Assisting legal counsel

(f) Evaluation of technical documents

(g) Leave (all types)

(h) Training

(i) Administrative time

(j) travel for indirect work




Further, OMB guidelines require agencies to use 1,800 average annual hours available for work and 280 average annual
leave hours (all types of leave) for computing manpower requirements. From the OMB guidelines, the ratio of yearly
leave hours to average annual hours available for work (280 divided by 1800) is computed at 0.16. Thus, the indirect
work factor for billing purposes is computed using the following formula:








where: a=indirect work rate, and
b=leave usage (total leave hours divided by total hours available for work).




This computation yields an indirect work factor of 1.66, which is computed from (1+0.43)(1+0.16). The indirect work
factor shows that the FAA actually pays for 1.66 hours for each direct billable hour of ASI time.

The hourly inspector billing rate is determined by multiplying the $48.11 hourly government paid rate by the indirect
work factor of 1.66 to arrive at the hourly ASI billing rate of $79.81, or $80 rounded to the nearest dollar. The proposed
hourly billing rate of $80 per ASI hour is applied to airman and repair station certification actions as follows.

The proposed fixed fees for airman certification were derived by multiplying the proposed ASI billing rate of $80
by the total time used in the Flight Standards Staffing Standard or airman test guidelines as necessary to complete
each certification activity. The FAA is not proposing fixed fees for the certification of air agencies, such as airman
schools and repair stations, because the time involved in certificating these facilities varies widely and therefore
there is no average staffing standard time.

For certification actions where there is no fixed fee, as air agency certifications, this notice proposes that applicants,
at the time of application, submit a prepaid deposit at the hourly ASI billing rate of $80 per hour for the minimum estimated
time required to complete the certification applied for, as determined by the certifying Flight Standards Office
(FSO). When the certification effort is completed, the applicant would either receive a refund or submit the additional
amount due, depending upon the time actually required for certification, plus transportation and subsistence expenses.

The charges to applicants by the FAA for inspector transportation and subsistence expenses, are governed by Federal
Travel Regulations, and would reflect the cost expended by the FAA on the requested certification action.



Proposed Future Revisions to the Fee Schedule



The FAA plans to review actual costs incurred in the certification efforts every year, at the beginning of the fiscal
year, using the same fee methodology described above, and, the FAA proposes to amend the fee schedule on an annual basis
to either increase or decrease fees. Each amended fee schedule would be published in the 

Federal Register

 and published in an FAA Advisory Circular on the subject of Inspector Fees.

The proposed fee schedule that would be established as a result of this rulemaking is contained in the attached Table
to this NPRM.



Fee Collection



For airman certification actions, the FAA would collect the fee at the time of application for a certification, rating
or approval, after first ascertaining the applicant's eligibility. The FSO or designated examiner would determine
whether the applicant meets the preliminary eligibility requirements, such as age and currency. If these requirements
are met, the FSO would issue a receipt as evidence of payment, ensure the deposit of fees into a U.S. Treasury approved
bank, and forward the fee deposit information to the regional accounting office serving the area.

Under this NPRM, payments for services rendered by FAA inspectors would have to be in the form of a check, money order,
draft, or wire transfer, and would have to be payable in U.S. currency to the FAA and drawn on a U.S. bank. Bank processing
fees may also be added to the fees charged to applicants, where such processing fees are charged to U.S. Government
accounts. No application would be acted upon until evidence of payment by the applicant has been presented.

Generally, there would be no refund of any fee paid for FAA certification services, including fees paid for any airman
test, approval, or authorization that an applicant fails to pass. However, if an applicant notifies the FAA of a test
cancellation at least one week prior to a scheduled examination, the FAA would refund the fee after deducting a minimal
service charge to cover the cost of processing the application.

In the case of a request for airman certification and repair station facility certifications (air agency certification),
applicants would submit as prepayment a deposit in the amount specified by the certifying FSO. This prepayment would
be based on the estimated minimum number of hours that an ASI would need to certificate the facility, as determined
by the FSO performing the service. The hourly rate to be paid for the inspector's time would be the rate specified in
Appendix A of Part 187. If the cost to complete the certification is less than the amount prepaid by the applicant, the
FAA would submit to the applicant a refund to cover the difference between the prepayment and the actual charges. Conversely,
if the cost is greater, the applicant would be required to submit the additional charges. As in the case of airman certificates,
applicants for air agency certification would have to pay the required fees, regardless of whether an FAA certificate
is issued.

Comparison of FAA Proposal With International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and European Joint Aviation Authority
(JAA) Regulations



ICAO does not perform airman or agency certification actions of the type proposed by the FAA in this NPRM.

The JAA currently has not completed writing its operations regulations and, therefore, has no airman charges at this
time. For foreign repair station c
