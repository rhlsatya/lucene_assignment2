Availability of Environmental Assessments and Findings of No Significant Impact 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, USDA. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 We are advising the public that eight environmental assessments and findings of no significant impact have been prepared
by the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service relative to the issuance of permits to allow the field testing of
genetically engineered organisms. The environmental assessments provide a basis for our conclusion that the field
testing of these genetically engineered organisms will not present a risk of introducing or disseminating a plant
pest and will not have a significant impact on the quality of the human environment. Based on its findings of no significant
impact, the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that environmental impact statements need
not be prepared. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The regulations in 7 CFR part 340 (referred to below as the regulations) regulate the introduction (importation,
interstate movement, and release into the environment) of genetically engineered organisms and products that are
plant pests or that there is reason to believe are plant pests (regulated articles). A permit must be obtained before
a regulated article may be introduced into the United States. The regulations set forth the procedures for obtaining
a limited permit for the importation or interstate movement of a regulated article and for obtaining a permit for the
release into the environment of a regulated article. The Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) has stated
that it would prepare an environmental assessment and, when necessary, an environmental impact statement before
issuing a permit for the release into the environment of a regulated article (see 52 FR 22906). 


In the course of reviewing each permit application, APHIS assessed the impact on the environment that releasing the
organisms under the conditions described in the permit application would have. APHIS has issued permits for the field
testing of the organisms listed below after concluding that the organisms will not present a risk of plant pest introduction
or dissemination and will not have a significant impact on the quality of the human environment. The environmental
assessments and findings of no significant impact, which are based on data submitted by the applicants and on a review
of other relevant literature, provide the public with documentation of APHIS' review and analysis of the environmental
impacts associated with conducting the field tests. 
Environmental assessments and findings of no significant impact have been prepared by APHIS relative to the issuance
of permits to allow the field testing of the following genetically engineered organisms: 




 


The environmental assessments and findings of no significant impact have been prepared in accordance with: (1) The
National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA)(42 U.S.C. 4321 

et seq.

), (2) Regulations of the Council on Environmental Quality for Implementing the Procedural Provisions of NEPA (40
CFR parts 1500-1508), (3) USDA Regulations Implementing NEPA (7 CFR part 1b), and (4) APHIS Guidelines Implementing
NEPA (44 FR 50381-50384, August 28, 1979, and 44 FR 51272-51274, August 31, 1979).

<DOCTITLE>Environmental Assessment and Finding of No Significant Impact for Disposal and Reuse of Pontiac Storage Activity,
Michigan</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Department of the Army, DOD.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of availability.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The proposed action is the disposal of the Pontiac Storage Activity (PSA) Pontiac, Michigan. The 32-acre site is closed
and maintained in a caretaker condition. The Army considers PSA unencumbered, meaning no conditions or restrictions
have been placed on the PSA property for transfer. A Statement of Condition was issued by the Department of the Army
on August 11, 1993, which stated that the site has been fully restored and is available for reuse. The screening process
has been completed for PSA with the Department of Defense, other Federal agencies, the McKinney Act, and state and
local agencies. The City of Pontiac was the only organization showing interest in the PSA property.



As part of PSA's disposal, the Army has worked with Federal, state and local entities in order to identify three reasonable
reuse options for the reuse of PSA. These alternatives were evaluated against PSA's existing baseline condition
in order to determine an environmentally sound and socioeconomically beneficial use for the property. The baseline
was described as the environmental and socioeconomic conditions of the site in caretaker status. The three alternatives
considered included: (1) Light Industrial and Commercial; (2) Light Industrial and Warehouse; and (3) the No-Action
Alternative, as required by National Environmental Policy Act and AR 200-2. Alternative 1, Light Industrial
and Commercial, is the local community's preferred reuse of the site.

Alternative 1 was chosen over Alternatives 2 and 3 because it provides the greatest economic benefits for the state
and local community, while having no significant impact on the natural or human environment. While Alternative 2,
Light Industrial and Warehouse, has even less impact on the human and natural environment than Alternative 1, it does
not provide the most beneficial economic gain. Alternative 3, the No-Action Alternative, would provide no economic
benefits to the area and no benefit to the Federal government. The property would remain under the care of the Army and
may experience some deterioration of buildings and overgrowth of grounds.

Placing the property into the local economy would create revenues for the state and local tax base. In addition, implementation
of Alternative 1 would have a positive effect on the regional economy by creating as many as 250 new jobs and increasing
local sales volumes. It would not have a significant impact on the population or housing market, public services,
and infrastructure. Land use would be compatible with the current zoning of the site. Local traffic flow may be altered
in the immediate vicinity of the facility when compared with baseline conditions, but would require only minor mitigative
measures to lessen impacts to traffic and transportation. Additional traffic signals and entrances to the site would
alleviate impacts to local traffic.

The environmental resources affects associated with the disposal would be insignificant. The topography or geology
of the site would not be affected under the proposed activities. Additional parking requirements may cause minor
disturbances to soils and loss of vegetative cover, but the impacts would be minor. Water resources would not be affected
under the disposal. It is anticipated that the ambient air quality would not be significantly impacted nor the National
Air Quality Standards levels would be exceeded. No hazardous materials nor waste generation is expected. However,
if they are included in the reuse, the appropriate regulatory requirements would be met. Plant and animal resources
effects are expected to be insignificant. No wetlands, threatened and endangered species, and cultural resources
exist within the boundaries of PSA. Noise levels are not anticipated to be above background levels and the aesthetic
value of the site is expected to remain the same.

Based on the environmental and socioeconomic impact analysis in the Environmental Assessment for the Disposal and
Reuse of Pontiac Storage Activity, which is incorporated into this Finding of No Significant Impact (FNSI), it has
been determined that the disposal of real property and its subsequent reuse would not have a significant impact on
the quality of the natural or human environment. Because there would be no significant environmental or socioeconomic
impacts resulting from implementation of the proposed action, an Environmental Impact Statement is not required
and will not be prepared.

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of availability of draft sector-specific supporting document and request for comment. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 Pursuant to Section 1605(b) of the Energy Policy Act of 1992, the Department of Energy is developing guidelines for
the voluntary reporting of greenhouse gas emissions, their reduction, and carbon fixation achieved through any
measure. The data will be reported on forms to be developed by the Energy Information Administration (EIA) and entered
into an EIA database. 


The draft technical supporting document for the voluntary reporting of greenhouse gas emissions and reductions,
and of carbon sequestration, in the agriculture sector is available for public review and comment. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Under section 1605(b) of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (EPAct; Pub.L. 102-486), the Secretary of Energy with
the Energy Information Administration is to establish a voluntary reporting system and database on emissions of
greenhouse gases (GHGs), reductions in emissions of these gases, and carbon fixation. Draft guidelines and supporting
methodologies provide guidance on the institutional and technical aspects of the voluntary program. They are provided
in discrete parts, as discussed below. DOE requests comment on the draft supporting document for the agriculture
sector. 


A complete discussion of the relevant legislative provisions and the organization of the guidelines and supporting
documents is set forth in the June 1, 1994, Notice of Availability and Request for Comment on the draft guidelines and
sector-specific supporting documents (59 FR 28345). The reader is referred to that notice for a discussion of the
voluntary reporting program and issues in the development of the program, including those that may apply to greenhouse
gas emissions and reductions and carbon sequestration in the agriculture sector. 
Sector-specific supporting documents for five of the six sectors were made available for comment on June 1, 1994.
These are the sector-specific documents dealing with the following sectors: electricity supply, residential and
commercial buildings, industrial, transportation, and forestry. At that time, DOE stated that the sector-specific
supporting document for the agriculture sector would be available at a later date. The sector-specific supporting
document for the agriculture sector is now available for public review and comment. 


Written Comments 


Interested persons are invited to submit comments on the draft document, Agriculture Sector-Specific Issues and
Reporting Methodologies Supporting the General Guidelines for the Voluntary Reporting of Greenhouse Gases under
Section 1605(b) of the energy Policy Act of 1992. Ten copies should be submitted to the address indicated in the ADDRESSES
section above, and must be received by the date indicated in the DATES section of this notice. All written comments
received will be available for public inspection in the DOE Freedom of Information Office reading Room at the address
provided at the beginning of this notice. 
Pursuant to provisions of 10 CFR 1004.11, any person submitting information which that person believes to be confidential
information and which may be exempt from law from public disclosure, should submit one complete copy of the document
as well as two copies from which the information claimed to be confidential has been deleted. DOE reserves the right
to determine the confidential status of the information and to treat it according to its determination.

Green Mountain Power Corp.; Notice of Availability of Draft Environmental Assessment



June 24, 1994.



In accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's
(Commission's) regulations, 18 CFR part 380 (Order No. 486, 52 FR 47897), the Office of Hydropower Licensing has reviewed
the application for a new license for the Essex No. 19 Hydroelectric Project, located in the townships of Essex Junction
and Williston, Chittendon County, Vermont and has prepared a Draft Environmental Assessment (DEA) for the project.
In the DEA, the Commission's staff has analyzed the potential environmental impacts of the existing project and has
concluded that approval of the project, with appropriate environmental protection or enhancement measures, would
not constitute a major federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment.

Copies of the DEA are available for review in the Public Reference Branch, Room 3104, of the Commission's offices at
941 North Capitol Street, N.E., Washington, DC 20426.

Any comments should be filed within 45 days from the date of this notice and should be addressed to Lois D. Cashell, Secretary,
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, N.E., Washington, DC 20426. Please affix ``Essex

<DOCTITLE>Columbia Gas Transmission Corporation; Refund Report</DOCTITLE>



June 24, 1994.



Take notice that on June 17, 1994, Columbia Gas Transmission Corporation (Columbia) filed a refund report advising
the Commission that on April 21, 1994, Columbia made lump sum refunds in the amount of $138,521,816 to disburse refunds
received after Columbia filed for bankruptcy.

Columbia states that it made refunds in the amount of $135,526,272 pursuant to an April 14, 1994 order in Docket No.
RP91-41-021. The April 14 order accepted Columbia's March 18, 1994 filing to reinstate its implementation
of Order No. 528 and make certain refunds in accordance with an order of the Bankruptcy Court dated March 15, 1994. Columbia
reports that it also refunded (1) $476,956 to its customers for amounts owed for transportation refunds received
from upstream suppliers after Columbia filed for bankruptcy, related to the period April 1, 1987 through March 31,
1990, and (2) $2,535,954 for refunds paid by Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corporation to Columbia after Columbia
filed for bankruptcy, which as a result of the merger of Commonwealth Gas Pipeline Corporation and Columbia, Columbia
refunded to the former customers of Commonwealth.

After it paid the refunds on April 21, Columbia states it discovered that the transportation refunds of $476,956 included
$457,460 that Columbia had received from Texas Eastern and Texas Gas that related to Columbia's capacity allocation
program. These refunds were for a time period when Columbia had released its capacity on these two pipelines to other
shippers. Therefore, Columbia believes it should have refunded the $457,460 only to shippers to whom the capacity
was assigned. On May 6, 1994, Columbia refunded $458,512.87 ($457,460 plus $1,052.87 for interest from April 21 through
May 5) to the shippers to whom the capacity was assigned. Columbia states that it will bill other customers $457,460
in its May invoices to recover the amounts refunded in error.

Because Columbia's refunds to customers were being disputed in Columbia's bankruptcy, Columbia had deposited all
prebankruptcy petition period refunds in a restricted investment arrangement (RIA), as authorized by the Bankruptcy
Court and the Commission. Columbia states that it calculated the interest to be refunded based on the interest it actually
earned in the RIA. It notes that it has petitioned the Commission in Docket No. GP94-2-000, seeking to pay
customers the interest actually earned in RIA rather than the interest otherwise required by the Commission's regulations.
Columbia recognizes that its flowthrough of refunds here is subject to the Commission's final decision on the petition.

Columbia states that it has mailed a copy of its refund report to interested state Commissions and, to each jurisdictional
customer, a copy of the refund schedule showing the refund amount by issue.

Any person desiring to be heard or to protest said filing should file a motion to intervene or a protest with the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with Rules 211
and 214 of the Commission's Rules and Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.211 and 385.214). All such motions or protests
should be filed on or before July 1, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate
action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a
party must file a motion to intervene. Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public
inspection.

Finally, Gasdel requests waiver of all other regulations that may otherwise be applicable so as to permit the proposed
FIL Rates to become effective as of October 1, 1994.

<DOCTITLE>Granite State Gas Transmission, Inc.; Proposed Changes in FERC Gas Tariff</DOCTITLE>


June 24, 1994.



Take notice that on June 16, 1994, Granite State Gas Transmission, Inc. (Granite State), 300 Friberg Parkway, Westborough,
Massachusetts 01581 filed Second Revised Sheet No. 25 in its FERC Gas Tariff, Third Revised Volume No. 1, proposing
changes in rates for effectiveness on July 16, 1994.

According to Granite State, its filing is submitted to passthrough to its customers the take-or-pay buydown and buyout
costs directly billed to Granite State by Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company (Tennessee).

Granite State states that, on May 31, 1994, Tennessee filed revised tariff sheets in Docket No. RP94-261-000
to adjust its recovery for the buydown and buyout of purchase gas contract obligations consistent with the Stipulation
and Agreement (the Cosmic settlement) approved by the Commission in Docket Nos. RP83-119, 

et al.

 According to Granite State, its tariff sheet reflects the changes in Tennessee's allocation of take-or-pay costs
to Granite State and also complies with the requirements of the reallocation of costs to small customers pursuant
to Order No. 528-A.

According to Granite State the proposed rate changes are applicable to its jurisdictional sales services formerly
rendered to Bay State Gas Company and Northern Utilities, Inc. and to a sale to a direct customer, Pease Air Force Base.
Granite State further states that copies of its filing were served upon its customers and the regulatory commission
of the States of Maine, New Hampshire and Massachusetts.

Any person desiring to be heard or to make any protest with reference to said filing should file a motion to intervene
or protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426 in
accordance with Rules 211 and 214 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.211 and 385.214).
All such motions or protests should be filed on or before July 1, 1994.

Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve
to make protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party to the proceeding or to participate
as a party in any hearing therein must file a motion to intervene in accordance with the Commission's rules. Copies
of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection.

<DOCTITLE>Access to Confidential Business Information to a Contractor </DOCTITLE>





<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 




</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice. 






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 EPA intends to transfer confidential business information (CBI) collected from the pulp, paper, and paperboard
manufacturing industry to one contractor. Transfer of the information will allow the contractor to assist EPA in
developing exposure assessments for the reregistration of microbiocides used in the pulp, paper, and paperboard
industry under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA). The information being transferred
was collected under the authority of section 308 of the Clean Water Act (CWA). Interested persons may submit comments
on this intended transfer of information to the addresses noted below. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 EPA intends to transfer information, including CBI, to one contractor: Versar, Inc., 6850 Versar Center, Springfield,
VA 22151. More specifically, the information being transferred to the contractor includes the following information
collected under section 308 of the CWA: Information collected through questionnaires and surveys of the industry.




EPA also intends to transfer to Versar all information listed above (including CBI) that may be collected or developed
in the future under section 308 of CWA. This information is necessary to enable Versar to carry out the work required
by their contract to support EPA's exposure assessment for the reregistration of microbiocides under FIFRA. The
contractor, contract number, and type of support are as follows: Contractor: Versar, Inc.; Contract Number: 68-D3-0013;
Type of Support: Exposure assessment.

In the case of information claimed to be proprietary, and therefore, confidential, all regulations and confidentiality
agreements apply. This transfer would not affect the status of this information as information claimed to be proprietary.
The relevant contract contains all confidentiality provision required by EPA's confidentiality regulations.
Need for access to the information shall continue until March 9, 1996.

In accordance with those regulations, companies who have submitted information claimed to be confidential have
until July 11, 1994, to comment on EPA's proposed transfer of this information to Versar for the purpose outlined above.

<DOCTITLE>Acetochlor Registration Partnership; Approval of Pesticide Product Registrations </DOCTITLE>


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This notice announces Agency approval of applications submitted by Acetochlor Registration Partnership, to conditionally
register the pesticide products Acetochlor Technical and Acetochlor EC containing new active ingredients not included
in any previously registered products pursuant to the provisions of section 3(c)(7)(C) of the Federal Insecticide,
Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA), as amended. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 EPA received applications from Acetochlor Registration Partnership (c/o ICI Americas and Zeneca Agricultural
Products) P.O. Box 751, Wilmington, DE 19897, to conditionally register the herbicide products Acetochlor Technical
and Acetochlor EC (EPA Registration Numbers 66478-1 and 66478-2) containing the active ingredients
acetochlor, 2-chloro-

N

-(2-ethyl-6-methylphenyl)acetamide and acetochlor 2-chloro-2'-methyl-6'-ethyl-

N

-ethoxymethylacetanilide at 92 and 81.15 percent~ respectively, active ingredients not included in any previously
registered products. Both products contain a different formulation of the chemical acetochlor. However, since
the notice of receipt of applications did not publish in the 

Federal Register

, as required by section 3(c)(4) of FIFRA, as amended, interested parties may submit written comments within 30 days
from the date of publication of this notice.


The applications were approved on March 11, 1994, as Acetochlor Technical for formulation of herbicide products
only (EPA Reg. No. 66478-1) and for restricted use of Acetochlor EC for use on (corn) field, silage, and pop (EPA
Reg. No. 66478-2). 
~~
A conditional registration may be granted under section 3(c)(7)(C) of FIFRA for a new active ingredient where certain
data are lacking, on condition that such data are received by the end of the conditional registration period and do
not meet or exceed the risk criteria set forth in 40 CFR 154.7; that use of the pesticide during the conditional registration
period will not cause unreasonable adverse effects; and that use of the pesticide is in the public interest. 
The Agency has considered the available data on the risks associated with the proposed use of acetochlor~~, and information
on social, economic, and environmental benefits to be derived from such use. Specifically, the Agency has considered
the nature of the chemical and its pattern of use, application methods and rates, and level and extent of potential
exposure. Based on these reviews, the Agency was able to make basic health and safety determinations which show that
use of acetochlor~~ ~~during the period of conditional registration is not expected to cause any unreasonable adverse
effect on the environment, and that use of the pesticide is in the public interest. 
Consistent with section 3(c)(7)(C), the Agency has determined that this conditional registration is in the public
interest. Use of the pesticides are of significance to the user community, and appropriate labeling, use directions,
and other measures have been taken to ensure that use of the pesticides will not result in unreasonable adverse effects
to man and the environment. 
More detailed information on this conditional registration is contained in a Chemical Fact Sheet on acetochlor~~.
~~
A copy of the fact sheet, which provides a summary description of the chemical, use patterns and formulations, science
findings, and the Agency's regulatory position and rationale, may be obtained from the National Technical Information
Service (NTIS), 5285 Port Royal Road, Springfield, VA 22161. 
In accordance with section 3(c)(2) of FIFRA, a copy of the approved label and the list of data references used to support
registration are available for public inspection in the office of the Product Manager. The data and other scientific
information used to support registration, except for material specifically protected by section 10 of FIFRA, are
available for public inspection in the Public Response and Program Resources Branch, Field Operations Division
(7506C), Office of Pesticide Programs, Environmental Protection Agency, Rm. 1132, CM #2, Arlington, VA 22202 (703-305-5805).
Requests for data must be made in accordance with the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act and must be addressed
to the Freedom of Information Office (A-101), 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460. Such requests should: (1)
Identify the product name and registration number and (2) specify the data or information desired.

<DOCTITLE>Mass Media Regulatory Fees</DOCTITLE>



June 20, 1994.



The Federal Communications Commission issues this Public Notice in order to provide information concerning the
payment of regulatory fees in 1994. If you are a licensee in any of the mass media services, you should carefully review
this Public Notice.



Who Must Pay Regulatory Fees In 1994



Most licensees and other entities regulated by the Commission must pay regulatory fees in 1994. This Public Notice
concerns the following Mass Media licensees: commercial AM & FM radio stations, commercial television stations.
Low Power Television and television translator and booster licensees, broadcast auxiliary and international (short
wave) broadcast station licensees. Non-commercial educational licensees are exempt from regulatory fees as are
licensees of auxiliary broadcast services such as low power auxiliary stations, television auxiliary service stations,
remote pickup stations and aural broadcast auxiliary stations where such licenses are used in conjunction with commonly
owned non-commercial educational stations. Emergency broadcast service (EBS) licenses for auxiliary service
facilities are also exempt as are Instructional Television Fixed Service (ITFS) licensees. Also, no regulatory
fees are required in Fiscal Year 1994 for FM translators and FM boosters.



Why the Commission Must Collect New Fees



The new requirement to collect annual regulatory fees was contained in Public Law 103-66, ``The Omnibus Budget
Reconciliation Act of 1993''. These new regulatory fees, which are likely to change each fiscal year, will be used
to offset costs associated with the Commission's enforcement, public service, international and policy and rulemaking
activities. The new fees are in addition to any application processing fees associated with obtaining a license or
other authorization from the Commission.



When Fees Will Be Due



Fee payment dates vary by service. Payments must be 

received 

by the Commission by the dates shown below in order to avoid a 25% late penalty. When paying multiple fees, the consolidated
fee payment is due on the date the latest individual fee payment would be due.




AM Radio (including associated broadcast auxiliary fees): September 2, 1994

FM Radio (including associated broadcast auxiliary fees): August 10, 1994

Television (including associated broadcast auxiliary fees, low power television, TV translators & boosters):
July 29, 1994 (except, if authorized, a second installment payment which must be received by August 26, 1994)

International (HF) Broadcast Station fees: September 2, 1994



FCC Form 159



Regulatory fee payments 

must 

be accompanied by FCC Form 159 (``FCC Remittance Advice''). A copy of this form, with specific instructions, is attached
to this Public Notice. Please see ``Special Instructions for Completing FCC Forms 159 & 159-C'' for detailed
information on how to correctly complete these Forms.



Where To Send Regulatory Fee Payments



All regulatory fee payments must be sent to the following address: Federal Communications Commission, Regulatory
Fees, P.O. Box 358835, Pittsburgh, PA 15251-5835.



Method of Payment



Regulatory fee payments may be made by check, money order or by credit card (Visa or Mastercard only). When paying by
credit card, please make sure you sign the appropriate block of Form 159. Payments may also be made electronically
provided prior approval has been obtained from the Commission. Contact Thomas M. Holleran at (202) 418-1925
for prior approval.






Note: 

We encourage arrangements to consolidate regulatory fee payments for different entities into a single payment instrument
by a single payee. We recognize the benefits to be gained by all the parties involved. Notwithstanding the scheduled
payment due dates specified in this Public Notice, consolidation of 100 or more regulatory fees due from different
entities by a single payee will be due on 

September 2, 1994

. Entities participating in such consolidated payment arrangements that are eligible, and choose, to pay by installment,
should pay one-half of the regulatory fee eligible for installment payment by September 2, 1994. The second installment
payment will then be due 

September 30, 1994

. Multiple fee payments may be made with one check, money order, credit card or electronic payment. Payors who will
be making a single payment for a significant number of entities and wish to submit automated data submissions in lieu
of a large number of FCC Forms 159-C (``Advice Continuation Sheets'') should contact Thomas M. Holleran at (202)
418-1925 at least four weeks prior to the payment due date.



Installment Payments



Only commercial television station licensees are permitted to make installment payments and then only if their total
regulatory fee 

exceeds $12,000. 

Please note that fee payments for other than television station licenses cannot be counted toward the $12,000 installment
threshold. Nor can licensees or permittees of any LPTV, TV translators & boosters, broadcast auxiliaries service
stations or holders of construction permits pay their fees by installment. Eligible licensees choosing to make installment
payments must pay one-half of their total fee by 

July 29, 1994

. The second installment payment is due no later than 

August 26, 1994

. Entities participating in consolidated payment arrangements that are eligible, and elect, to pay by installment
should note the different due dates for their installment payments (see ``Method of Payment'' above).

Compliance



Licensees are solely responsible for accurately accounting for all licenses and for paying proper regulatory fees.
Any omission or payment deficiency can result in a 25% monetary penalty, dismissal of pending actions, and/or revocation
of any authorization. Additionally, the Commission intends to invoke its authority under the Debt Collection Act
against any licensee failing to meet its regulatory fee payment obligations.



Waivers, Reductions, and Deferments of Regulatory Fees



The Commission will consider requests for waivers, reductions or deferments of regulatory fees, in extraordinary
and compelling circumstances only, upon a showing that such action overrides the public interest in reimbursing
the Commission for its regulatory costs. Timely submission of the appropriate regulatory fee must accompany requests
for waivers or reductions. This will ensure efficient collection in situations where a waiver or reduction is not
warranted and will allow the requester to avoid a 25% late-payment penalty if its request is denied. The regulatory
fee would be refunded later if the request is granted. Only in exceptional or compelling instances (where payment
of the regulatory fee along with the waiver or reduction request could result in the reduction of service to a community
or other financial hardship to the licensee) will the Commission accept a petition to defer payment along with a waiver
or reduction request.



Additional Information



The Commission has prepared a number of informative Fee Filing Guides for information on 

application

 fees for cable services, and for information on 

application

 and 

regulatory

 fees for the common carrier, mass media, engineering and technology, field operations or private radio services.
These Guides are available from the Commission's Public Service Division, from its various field office locations
and can be downloaded from the Internet (ftp

@

fcc.gov). For additional information, please call the Fees Hotline at (2) 632-FEES, or write to: Federal Communications
Commission, ATTN: Public Service Division, 1919 M Street NW., Washington, DC 20554.

<DOCTITLE>Common Carrier Regulatory Fees</DOCTITLE>



June 20, 1994.



The Federal Communications Commission issues this Public Notice in order to provide information concerning the
payment of regulatory fees in 1994. If you hold authorizations in any of the common carrier services, excluding space
stations and earth stations, you should carefully review this Public Notice. A separate Public Notice for space station
and earth station licensees is available.



Who Must Pay Regulatory Fees in 1994



Most licensees and other entities regulated by the Commission must pay regulatory fees in 1994. This Public Notice
concerns only the following Common Carrier regulatees: interexchange carriers, local exchange carriers, competitive
access providers, cellular and public mobile (part 22) licensees, domestic public fixed radio (part 21) licensees,
international public fixed radio (part 23) licensees and providers of international bearer circuits.



Why the Commission Must Collect New Fees



The new requirement to collect annual regulatory fees was contained in Public Law 103-66, ``The Omnibus Budget
Reconciliation Act of 1993.'' These new regulatory fees, which are likely to change each fiscal year, will be used
to offset costs associated with the Commission's enforcement, public service, international and policy and rulemaking
activities. The new fees are in addition to any application processing fees associated with obtaining a license or
other authorization from the Commission.



When Fees Will Be Due



Fee payment due dates vary by category within the common carrier services. Payments must be 

received

 by the Commission by the dates shown below in order to avoid a 25% late penalty. When paying for fees in more than one category
below, the consolidated fee payment is due on the latest date the individual fee payment would be due.

FCC Form 159



Regulatory fee payments 

must

 be accompanied by FCC Form 159 (``FCC Remittance Advice''). A copy of this form, with specific instructions, is attached
to this Public Notice. Please see, ``Special Instructions for Completing FCC Forms 159 & 159-C'' for detailed
information on how to correctly complete these Forms.



Where To Send Regulatory Fee Payments



All regulatory fee payments must be sent to the following address: Federal Communications Commission, Regulatory
Fees, P.O. Box 358835, Pittsburgh, PA 15251-5835.



Method of Payment



Regulatory fee payments may be made by check or money order. Payments may also be made by credit card (Visa or Mastercard
only). When paying by credit card, please make sure you sign the appropriate block of Form 159. Payments may also be
made electronically provided prior approval has been obtained from the Commission. Contact Thomas M. Holleran at
(202) 418-1925 for prior approval.

In its Report and Order the Commission noted that ``NECA has proposed to process regulatory fees on behalf of its pooling
exchange carriers and to submit their consolidated fees to our lockbox bank in a single instrument of payment.'' The
Commission has no objection to NECA's submission of the fee on behalf of its pooling exchange carriers or others. However,
we remind entities subject to the payment of a regulatory fee that the regulatee, not an agent, such as NECA, is responsible
for ensuring that the payment is made and that it is subject to penalty for failure to submit the entire fee due in a timely
manner. LEC's will be expected to pay their fees based on the number of access lines as determined by NECA. In case of
a dispute between a carrier and NECA concerning the carrier's line count as of December 31, 1993, NECA will certify
its calculation of the carrier's line count and the basis for its calculation.

We encourage arrangements to consolidate a number of regulatory fee payments for different entities into a single
payment instrument made by a single payee. We recognize the benefits to be gained by all the parties involved. Notwithstanding
the published schedule of payment due dates, consolidation of 100 or more regulatory fees due from different entities
by a single payee will be due on 

September 2, 1994.

 Entities participating in such consolidated payment arrangements that are eligible, and choose, to pay by installment,
should pay one-half of the regulatory fee eligible for installment payment by September 2, 1994. The second installment
payment will then be due 

September 30, 1994.








Note:

 Multiple fee payments may be made with one payment instrument. Payors who will be making a single payment for a significant
number of entities and wish to submit automated data submissions in lieu of a large number of FCC Forms 159-C (``Advice
Continuation Sheets'') should contact Thomas M. Holleran at (202) 418-1925 at least four weeks prior to the
payment due date.



Installment Payments



Interexchange carriers are permitted to make installment payments if their total regulatory fee 

exceeds $500,000.

 Local exchange carriers are permitted to make installment payments if their total regulatory fee 

exceeds $700,000.


 Fee payments for other than interexchange or local exchange carriers access lines cannot be counted toward the respective
installment threshold. Nor can competitive access providers, providers of international bearer circuits and licensees
of any public fixed or mobile service pay their fees by installment. Eligible carriers choosing to make installment
payments must pay one-half of their total fee by 

August 17, 1994.

 The second installment payment is due no later than 

September 14, 1994.

 Entities participating in consolidated payment arrangements that are eligible, and elect, to pay by installment
should note the different due dates for their installment payments (see ``Method of Payment'' above).





Compliance



Licensees are solely responsible for accurately accounting for all licenses and for paying proper regulatory fees.
Any omission or payment deficiency can result in a 25% monetary penalty, dismissal of pending actions, and/or revocation
of any authorization. Additionally, the Commission intends to invoke its authority under the Debt Collection Act
against any licensee failing to meet its regulatory fee payment obligations.

Waivers, Reductions, and Deferments of Regulatory Fees



The Commission will consider requests for waivers, reductions or deferments of regulatory fees, in extraordinary
and compelling circumstances only, upon a showing that such action overrides the public interest in reimbursing
the Commission for its regulatory costs. Timely submission of the appropriate regulatory fee must accompany requests
for waivers or reductions. This will ensure efficient collection in situations where a waiver or reduction is not
warranted and will allow the requestor to avoid a 25% late-payment penalty if its request is denied. The regulatory
fee would be refunded later if the request is granted. Only in exceptional or compelling instances (where payment
of the regulatory fee along with the waiver or reduction request could result in the reduction of service to a community
or other financial hardship to the licensee), will the Commission accept a petition to defer payment along with a waiver
or reduction request.

<DOCTITLE>Space and Earth Station Regulatory Fees</DOCTITLE>


June 20, 1994.



The Federal Communications Commission issues this Public Notice in order to provide information concerning the
payment of regulatory fees in 1994. If you are a space station and/or earth station licensee in the common carrier services,
you should carefully review this Public Notice.


Who Must Pay Regulatory Fees in 1994


Most licensees and other entities regulated by the Commission must pay regulatory fees in 1994. This Public Notice
concerns space station and earth station licensees in the common carrier services only.


Why the Commission Must Collect New Fees


The new requirement to collect annual regulatory fees was contained in Public Law 103-66, ``The Omnibus Budget
Reconciliation Act of 1993''. These new regulatory fees, which are likely to change each fiscal year, will be used
to offset costs associated with the Commission's enforcement, public service, international and policy and rulemaking
activities. The new fees are in addition to any application processing fees associated with obtaining a license or
other authorization from the Commission.


When Fees Will Be Due


All Space Station and Earth Station licensees must remit their regulatory fees to the Commission by August 19, 1994,

 in order to avoid a 25% late penalty:


FCC Form 159


Regulatory fee payments 

must

 be accompanied by FCC Form 159 (``FCC Remittance Advice''). A copy of this form, with specific instructions is attached
to this Public Notice. Please see, ``Special Instructions for Completing FCC Forms 159 & 159-C'' for detailed
information on how to correctly complete these Forms.


Where To Send Regulatory Fee Payments


All regulatory fee payments must be sent to the following address: Federal Communications Commission, Regulatory
Fees, P.O. Box 358835, Pittsburgh, PA 15251-5835.


Method of Payment


Regulatory fee payments may be made by check or money order. Payments may also be made by credit card (Visa or Mastercard
only). When paying by credit card, please make sure you sign the appropriate block of Form 159. Payments may also be
made electronically provided prior approval has been obtained from the Commission. Contact Thomas M. Holleran at
(202) 418-1925 for prior approval.





Note:

 We encourage arrangements to consolidate a number of regulatory fee payments for different entities into a single
payment instrument made by a single payee. We recognize the benefits to be gained by all the parties involved. Notwithstanding
the published schedule of payment due dates, consolidation of 100 or more regulatory fees due from different entities
by a single payee will be due on 

September 2, 1994.

 Entities participating in such consolidated payment arrangements that are eligible, and choose, to pay by installment,
should pay one-half of the regulatory fee eligible for installment payment by September 2, 1994. The second installment
payment will then be due 

September 30, 1994.

 Multiple fee payments may be made with one payment instrument. Payors who will be making a single payment for a significant
number of entities and wish to submit automated data submissions in lieu of a large number of FCC Forms 159-C (``Advice
Continuation Sheets'') should contact Thomas M. Holleran at (202) 418-1925 at least four weeks prior to the
payment due date.

Installment Payments



Installment payments are permitted for 

space station

 licensees only. Eligible entities choosing to make installment payments must pay one-half of their space station
fee by 

August 19, 1994.

 Regulatory fees for earth stations cannot be paid by installment. The second installment payment for 

space stations

 is due no later than 

September 16, 1994.

 Entities participating in consolidated payment arrangements that are eligible, and elect, to pay by installment
should note the different due dates for their installment payments (see ``Method of Payment'' above).



Compliance



Licensees are solely responsible for accurately accounting for all licenses and for paying the proper regulatory
fees. Any omission or payment deficiency can result in a 25% monetary penalty, dismissal of pending actions, and/or
revocation of any authorization. Additionally, the Commission will invoke its authority under the Debt Collection
Act against any licensee failing to meet its regulatory fee payment obligations.



Waivers, Reductions And Deferments of Regulatory Fees



The Commission will consider requests for waivers, reductions or deferments of regulatory fees, in extraordinary
and compelling circumstances only, upon a showing that such action overrides the public interest in reimbursing
the Commission for its regulatory costs. Timely submission of the appropriate regulatory fee must accompany requests
for waivers or reductions. This will ensure efficient collection in situations where a waiver or reduction is not
warranted and will allow the requestor to avoid a 25% late-payment penalty if its request is denied. The regulatory
fee would be refunded later if the request is granted. Only in exceptional or compelling instances (where payment
of the regulatory fee along with the waiver or reduction request could result in the reduction of service to a community
or other financial hardship to the regulatee or licensee), will the Commission accept a petition to defer payment
along with a waiver or reduction request. All requests for deferments must be filed before 

August 19, 1994,

 in order to avoid the 25% late-payment penalty.

Filing Procedures for Earth Stations



Who Must Pay





VSAT and Equivalent C-Band Antennas:

 Earth station systems comprising very small aperture terminals make up authorized networks operating in the 12 and
14 GHz bands that provide a variety of communications services to other stations in the network. Each system, authorized
pursuant to blanket licensing procedures in part 25 of the Rules, consists of a network of technically-identical
small fixed-satellite earth stations which often includes a larger hub station. This category also includes earth
stations operating 4/6 GHz frequency bands using networks of technically identical antennas that are 2 meters or
less in diameter. For FY 1994, entities holding these types of authorizations as of 

October 1, 1993,

 will be assessed a regulatory fee of $0.06 per antenna per call sign. Licensees with less than 100 antennas per call
sign will be subject to a minimum $6.00 fee per call sign.



Mobile Satellite Earth Stations:

 Under part 25 of the Rules, mobile satellite service providers operate under blanket licenses for mobile antennas
(transceivers), which are small than one meter and provide voice or data communications, including position location
information, for mobile platforms such as cars, buses or trucks. For FY 1994, entities holding these types of authorizations
as of

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Commission has authorized Sprint Communications Company L.P. to provide direct packet data service between
the United States and Cuba in accordance with the provisions of the Cuban Democracy Act. This will allow Sprint to help
meet the large demand for direct telecommunications services between the United States and Cuba. Under the guidelines
established by the Department of State, Sprint is to submit reports indicating the numbers of circuits activated
by facility, on or before June 30, and December 31 of each year, and on the one-year anniversary of this notification
in the 

Federal Register

.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 




Sprint Communications Company L.P.







Application for authority to lease and operate facilities for the provision of direct packet data service between
the United States and Cuba



Order and Authorization



Adopted: June 6, 1994; Released: June 22, 1994

By the Chief, International Facilities Division:




1. The Commission has under consideration the above-captioned application filed by Sprint Communications Company
L.P. (``Sprint'') requesting authority pursuant to Section 214 of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, to
establish channels of communication between the United States and Cuba for the provision of direct packet data service.
The application was placed on the Commission's public notice and no comments were received.

2. Sprint proposes to provide international packet data service between the U.S. and Cuba via the INTELSAT satellite
located at 335
  E.L. using appropriately licensed existing earth station facilities. Specifically, Sprint requests authority
to lease from Comsat and operate one 2-Mbps digital satellite circuit between the Orion international Standard A
earth station located at Shenandoah, Virginia and the theoretical midpoint of the INTELSAT AOR satellite connecting
with matching facilities provided by INTERTEL S.A. (``INTERTEL'') of Cuba. Sprint proposes to connect its operating
center in New York, New York, to the Orion earth station using Sprint's own facilities. Sprint states that it has already
entered into an operating agreement with INTERTEL for the establishment of direct packet data service between the
United States and Cuba. Under the terms of its agreement, INTERTEL and Sprint have agreed to a 50/50 split of a $5.50
per kilosegment and $5.50 per hour accounting rate for packet data traffic. Sprint states this rate is consistent
with U.S. policy guidelines.
 Sprint states that it will initiate service within one year.





3. Sprint states that the public interest would be served by a grant of its application because it will result in the
rapid introduction of new lines of telecommunications between the United States and Cuba. Sprint states that an immediate
and large demand exists for direct telecommunications services between the United States and Cuba, and Sprint's
proposed service will help meet that demand within the regulatory framework established by the Cuban Democracy Act.

4. In a letter dated July 22, 1993, the U.S. Department of State informed the Commission of the Executive Branch's general
policy guidelines for implementation of the telecommunications provisions of the Cuban Democracy Act, which provides
that ``telecommunication services between the United States and Cuba shall be permitted.''
 Among the policy guidelines are the following requirements: (1) the proposals must have the potential to be operational
within a year; (2) settlements must not be more favorable to Cuba than the current 50/50 split of the $1.20 per minute
accounting rate; (3) proposals must be limited to equipment and services necessary to deliver a signal to Cuba; (4)
proposals must utilize modes of communications already in place between the U.S. and Cuba; and (5) carriers shall
report the number of circuits activated by facility on June 30 and December 31 of each year and on the one-year anniversary
of the notification by the FCC in the 

Federal Register

.

5. Upon consideration of Sprint's application, we find that a grant of its application will serve the public interest
subject to the conditions set forth below. Sprint's application is consistent with the Executive Branch's general
guidelines set forth in the Department of State's letter. Sprint states that it will initiate service within one year,
and expects to initiate service shortly after all requisite regulatory approvals have been obtained. Sprint's proposed
use of INTELSAT facilities and appropriately licensed existing earth station facilities satisfies the requirements
that facilities already be in existence and be limited to equipment and services necessary to deliver a signal to Cuba.
6. With respect to Sprint's proposed 50/50 split of a $5.50 per kilosegment and $5.50 per hour accounting rate for packet
data traffic between the United States and Cuba, the Department of State in a follow-up letter dated May 23, 1994, stated
it has no objection to our approval so long as we determine that this proposed rate does not exceed the 50/50 split of
the $1.20 accounting rate required under the guidelines.
 We find that the proposed accounting rate is within the Department of State's guidelines because both the approximately
27.5$ per minute accounting rate for a typical dial packet data transmission, and the approximately 46$
per minute accounting rate for a typical dedicated packet data transmission
 is well below the $1.20 per minute accounting rate approved for voice services.





7. Accordingly, 

It Is Ordered

 that application File No. I-T-C-94-238 IS GRANTED and Sprint Communications Company, L.P.
is authorized to:
a. lease from Comsat and operate one 2-Mbps digital satellite circuit between the Orion international Standard A

international division of EMTELCUBA);
b. lease from Orion and operate necessary earth segment facilities at Orion's earth station at Shenandoah, Virginia;
c. operate necessary connecting facilities between its operating center in New York and Orion's earth station at

<DOCTITLE>Public Information Collection Requirements Submitted to Office of Management and Budget for Review</DOCTITLE>


June 23, 1994.


The Federal Communications Commission has submitted the following information collection requirements to OMB
for review and clearance under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3507).
Copies of these submissions may be purchased from the Commission's copy contractor, International Transcription
Service, Inc., 2100 M Street, NW., Suite 140, Washington, DC 20037, (202) 857-3800. For further information
on these submissions contact Judy Boley, Federal Communications Commission, (202) 632-0276. Persons wishing
to comment on these information collections should contact Timothy Fain, Office of Management and Budget, Room 3221
NEOB, Washington, DC 20503, (202) 395-3561.


OMB Number:

 3060-0188.


Title:

 Section 73.3550, Requests for new or modified call sign assignments.


Action:

 Revision of a currently approved collection.


Respondents:

 State or local governments, non-profit institutions, and businesses or other for-profit (including small businesses).


Frequency of Response:

 On occasion reporting requirement.


Estimated Annual Burden:

 2,600 responses; .667 hours average burden per response; 1,734 hours total annual burden.


Needs and Uses:

 Section 73.3550 requires that a licensee, permittee, assignee or transferee of a broadcast station file a letter
with the Commission when requesting a new or modified call sign. On 5/19/94, the Commission adopted a First Report
and Order (R&O) in MM Docket No. 93-114, Review of the Commission's Rules Governing the Low Power Television
Service. In this First R&O the Commission has, among other things, amended  73.3550 to permit any low power
television (LPTV) station to request a four-letter call sign after receiving its construction permit. All initial
LPTV construction permits will continue to be issued a five-character LPTV call sign. In addition to the letter request,
a LPTV must submit a certification under  74.783 which was submitted to OMB separately. We estimate that we will
receive 800 requests for a four-letter call sign in FY 1995. The data are used by FCC staff to ensure that the call requested
is not already in use by another station and that the proper ``K'' or ``W'' designation is used in accordance with the
station location (east or west of the Mississippi River).





OMB Number:

 3060-0414.


Title:

 Terrain Shielding Policy.


Action:

 Revision of a currently approved collection.


Respondents:

 State or local governments, non-profit institutions, and businesses or other for-profit (including small businesses).


Frequency of Response:

 On occasion reporting requirement.


Estimated Annual Burden:

 150 responses; 10 hours average burden per response; 1,500 hours total annual burden.


Needs and Uses:

 On 5/19/94, the Commission adopted a First Report and Order (R&O) in MM Docket No. 93-114, Review of the Commission's
Rules Governing the Low Power Television Service. In the First R&O the Commission has, among other things, broadened
the circumstances in which terrain shielding waivers can be used in this authorization of LPTV service. This action
will cause an additional 50 terrain shielding waivers to be filed with the Commission. The terrain shielding policy
would require respondents to submit either a detailed terrain study, or to submit letters of assent from all potentially
affected parties and graphic depiction of the terrain. The data is used by FCC staff to determine if adequate interference
protection can be provided by terrain shielding and if a waiver of   74.705 and 74.707 of the Rules is warranted.





OMB Number:

 None.


Title:

 Section 74.783, Station identification.


Action:

 New collection.


Respondents:

 State or local governments, businesses or other for-profit (including small businesses).


Frequency of Response:

 On occasion reporting requirement.


Estimated Annual Burden:

 950 responses; .166 hours average burden per response; 158 hours total annual burden.


Needs and Uses:

 Section 74.783(b) requires television translator stations, whose station identification is made by the television
station whose signals are being rebroadcast by the translator, to furnish current information with regard to the
translator's call letters and location, and the name, address and telephone number of the licensee to be contacted
in the event of malfunction of the translator. The certification requirement will effectively enable Commission
staff to award four-letter call signs to those permittees most likely to be constructed and operated. The furnishing
of current information is used by the primary station licensee and/or FCC staff in field investigations to contact
the translator licensee in the event of malfunction of the translator.

<DOCTITLE>Pleading Cycle Extended for Comments on AT&T's Petition for Reconsideration of Commission Order Authorizing
Three International Resale Carriers Proposing To Provide ``Call-Back'' Services</DOCTITLE>



June 22, 1994.



The Commission recently granted the above-referenced Section 214 applications of VIA USA, Ltd., Telegroup, Inc.,
and Discount Call International Co. to resell international switched services of other carriers using a ``call-back''
configuration. (

VIA USA, Ltd et al.

, FCC 94-86, released May 11, 1994). This service allows a customer in a foreign country to use foreign facilities
to dial a telephone number in the United States and receive dial tone at a switch at the reseller's U.S. location, which
the customer can then use to place a call via an outbound switched service of a U.S. carrier. The through calls are billed
at U.S.-tariffed rates.

AT&T petitioned to deny these applications alleging that this service constitutes an unreasonable practice
under Section 201 of the Communications Act (``the Act'') and may constitute wire fraud. The Commission denied AT&T's
petition. On June 10, 1994, AT&T filed a petition for reconsideration asking the Commission to find that uncompleted
call signalling is an unreasonable practice under Section 201(b) of the Act, is contrary to the public interest for
purposes of Section 214 of the Act, violates Section 202(a) of the Act, and violates the federal wire fraud statute,
18 U.S.C. 1343.

In order to develop a complete record on the issues raised by AT&T's petition, the Commission on its own motion
is extending the time for the filing of comments. Interested parties may file comments by July 22, 1994, and reply comments
by August 8, 1994 with the Secretary, FCC, 1919 M Street NW., Washington, DC 20554. A copy should also be sent to Troy
F. Tanner, Common Carrier Bureau, FCC, Room 534, 1919 M Street, NW., Washington, DC 20554.




For further information, contact Troy F. Tanner, International Facilities Division of the Common Carrier Bureau,
at (202) 632-7265.

Worldlink Logistics, Inc. v. Hyundai Merchant Marine Co., Ltd.; Notice of Filing of Complaint and Assignment



Notice is given that a complaint filed by Worldlink Logistics, Inc. (``Complainant'') against Hyundai Merchant
Marine Co., Ltd. (``Respondent'') was served June 27, 1994. Complainant alleges that Respondent violated sections
8(c) and 10(b)(12) of the Shipping Act of 1984, 46 U.S.C. app. sections 1707(c) and 1709(b)(12), by failing and refusing
to make available the essential terms of a service contract to Respondent, a similarly situated shipper, on the same
basis as made available to the original contract shipper, and by refusing to negotiate a service contract with Respondent,
an American NVOCC,, on terms similar to those given to Korean NVOCC's similarly situated to Respondent.

This proceeding has been assigned to the Office of Administrative Law Judges. Hearing in this matter, if any is held,
shall commence within the time limitations prescribed in 46 CFR 502.61, and only after consideration has been given
by the parties and the presiding officer to the use of alternative forms of dispute resolution. The hearing shall include
oral testimony and cross-examination in the discretion of the presiding officer only upon proper showing that there
are genuine issues of material fact that cannot be resolved on the basis of sworn statements, affidavits, depositions,
or other documents or that the nature of the matter in issue is such that an oral hearing and cross-examination are necessary
for the development of an adequate record. Pursuant to the further terms of 46 CFR 502.61, the initial decision of the
presiding officer in this proceeding shall be issued by June 27, 1995, and the final decision of the Commission shall
be issued by October 25, 1995.

Nabisco, Inc; Filing of Petition for Affirmation of GRAS Status


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Food and Drug Administration, HHS.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is announcing that Nabisco, Inc., has filed a petition (GRASP 4G0404) proposing
to affirm that short- and long-chain fatty acid triacylglycerols are generally recognized as safe (GRAS) as direct
human food ingredients. Nabisco, Inc., has proposed the common or usual name SALATRIM for this class of substances.
SALATRIM is an acronym formed from the term ``short- and long-chain acid triacylglycerol molecules.''


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (secs. 201(s) and 409 (21 U.S.C. 321(s) and 348)) and the regulations
for affirmation of GRAS status in  170.35 (21 CFR 170.35), notice is given that Nabisco, Inc., 200 DeForest Ave.,
East Hanover, NJ 07936, has filed a petition (GRASP 4G0404) proposing that short- and long-chain fatty acid triacylglycerols
be affirmed as GRAS for use as direct human food ingredients. Nabisco, Inc., has proposed the common or usual name SALATRIM
for this class of substances. SALATRIM is an acronym formed from the term ``short-and long-chain acid triacylglycerol
molecules.'' 


The petition has been placed on display at the Dockets Management Branch (address above).
Any petition that meets the requirements outlined in  170.30 (21 CFR 170.30) and  170.35 is filed by the
agency. There is no prefiling review of the adequacy of data to support a GRAS conclusion. Thus, the filing of a petition
for GRAS affirmation should not be interpreted as a preliminary indication of suitability for GRAS affirmation.
The potential environmental impact of this action is being reviewed. If the agency finds that an environmental impact
statement is not required and this petition results in a regulation, the notice of availability of the agency's finding
of no significant impact and the evidence supporting that finding will be published with the regulation in the 

Federal Register

 in accordance with 21 CFR 25.40(c).
Interested persons may, on or before August 29, 1994, review the petition and/or file comments with the Dockets Management
Branch (address above). Two copies of any comments should be filed and should be identified with the docket number
found in brackets in the heading of this document. Comments should include any available information that would be
helpful in determining whether the substance is, or is not, GRAS for the proposed use. In addition, consistent with
the regulations promulgated under the National Environmental Policy Act (40 CFR 1501.4(b)), the agency encourages
public participation by review of and comment on the environmental assessment submitted with the petition that is
the subject of this notice. A copy of the petition (including the environmental assessment) and received comments
may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.

<DOCTITLE>Teepak, Inc.; Petition for Affirmation of GRAS Status; Reopening of Comment Period</DOCTITLE>


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Food and Drug Administration, HHS.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice; reopening of comment period.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is reopening to August 1, 1994, the comment period for interested persons on
the petition filed by Teepak, Inc., (GRASP 3G0397) entitled ``GRAS Affirmation Petition for Collagen Fiber.'' FDA
is taking this action in response to a request to allow additional time for public comment.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

In the 

Federal Register

 of December 3, 1993 (58 FR 63996), FDA published a notice of filing stating that Teepak, Inc., had filed a petition (GRASP
3G0397) proposing that collagen fiber be affirmed as generally recognized as safe (GRAS) as an ingredient in human
food. Interested persons were given until February 1, 1994, to comment on this notice of filing.


FDA received a request, dated January 24, 1994, to extend the comment period for public response. The comment stated
that an extension was needed because there was a delay in receiving a copy of the petition through the Freedom of Information
process. After careful consideration, the agency has concluded that it is in the public interest to allow additional
time for interested persons to submit comments. However, because the initial comment period ended on February 1,
1994, the agency is reopening the comment period. The agency is now requesting all comments by August 1, 1994.
Interested persons may, on or before August 1, 1994, submit to the Dockets Management Branch (address above) written
comments regarding this petition. Two copies of any comments are to be submitted, except that individuals may submit
one copy. Comments are to be identified with the docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document. Received
comments may be seen in the office above between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.

committee meeting shall have an open public hearing portion. Whether or not it also includes any of the other three

Any interested person who wishes to be assured of the right to make an oral presentation at the open public hearing portion
of a meeting shall inform the contact person listed above, either orally or in writing, prior to the meeting. Any person
attending the hearing who does not in advance of the meeting request an opportunity to speak will be allowed to make
an oral presentation at the hearing's conclusion, if time permits, at the chairperson's discretion.
The agenda, the questions to be addressed by the committee, and a current list of committee members will be available

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of Availability of Proposed Plan Amendment and Environmental Assessment/FONSI on Oil and Gas Leasing for
the Randolph and Park City Management Framework Plans, Bear River Resource Area, Utah.





</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Bureau of Land Management completed a Proposed Plan Amendment/EA/FONSI on May 26, 1994. All public land and subsurface
oil and gas estate in Cache, Davis, Morgan, Rich, Summit, Wasatch, and Weber Counties have been analyzed. The proposed
recategorization for oil and gas leasing is as follows:




Category 1_Open to leasing, 102,139 acres.

Category 2_Open to leasing with special stipulations, 330,723 acres.

Category 3_Open to leasing with no surface occupancy, 530 acres.

Category 4_Closed to leasing, 0 acres.




The proposed amendment to the Randolph and Park City Management Framework Plans (MFPs) would incorporate these revised
decisions on management of oil and gas resources. The final Environmental Assessment revealed no significant impacts
from the proposed action. The Bureau's preferred alternative is Alternative 1_Proposed Action. A Notice of Intent
proposing to amend the MFPs was published in the 

Federal Register

 on April 24, 1990.

A 30-day protest period for the planning amendment will commence with publication of this notice of availability.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

This action is announced pursuant to section 202(a) of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 and 43 CFR
part 1610. The proposed planning amendment is subject to protest from any adversely affected party who participated
in the planning process. Protest must be made in accordance with the provisions of 43 CFR 1610.5-2. Protests
must be received by the Director (WO-760) of the Bureau of Land Management, 18th and C Street NW., Washington,
DC 20240, within 30 days after the date of publication of this notice of availability for the proposed planning amendment.

<DOCTITLE>Oil and Gas and Sulphur Operations in the Outer Continental Shelf</DOCTITLE>


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Minerals Management Service, Interior.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Minerals Management Service (MMS) is continuing the evaluation of the safety and environmental management program
(SEMP) concept. The SEMP is a safety management system that is intended to reduce the risk and occurrence of accidents
and pollution events on offshore oil and gas drilling and production facilities. The MMS believes that development
and implementation of SEMP, by individual companies operating Outer Continental Shelf (OSC) drilling and production
facilities, promotes safety and environmental protection in the OCS. The MMS encourages all OCS lessees and operators
to voluntarily adopt and implement the SEMP concept. The MMS will monitor the implementation of this voluntary program
over the next 2 years to determine whether rulemaking is needed to meet the goals of the SEMP concept.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The MMS inspection program is mandated by the OCS Lands Act (43 U.S.C. 1348) to conduct annual onsite inspections at
all OCS facilities, as well as periodic unannounced inspections, to ensure compliance with environmental and safety
regulations. In 1989, MMS requested that the Marine Board study the inspection program to develop and assess alternative
inspection strategies and recommend alternative inspection procedures which will improve operational safety
and the effectiveness of the inspection process. One of the Marine Board report findings was that although the inspection
program adhered to the OCS Lands Act inspection requirements, OCS operator compliance with regulations did not equal
safety. The Marine Board recommended that MMS develop programs to motivate operators to incorporate safety directly
into OCS drilling and production operations.


In the same year, an MMS internal task force also assessed the OCS inspection and enforcement program. The MMS directed
the task force to develop measures to (1) enhance the inspection program operations and (2) increase the safety of
OCS operations. The task force found that the inspection program was presently effective but may not meet future inspection
demands without incorporating innovative alternative inspection strategies. One recommended strategy was to
require OCS operators to develop and implement an MMS-approved SEMP to stimulate safety consciousness.


July 1991 Federal Register Notice


On July 2, 1991, MMS published a 

Federal Register 

Notice (56 FR 30400) that announced its investigation of alternative strategies to promote safety and environmental
protection in the OCS. The notice discussed the SEMP concept and outlined key points of a SEMP plan that a lessee/operator
should adopt to ensure safety and environmental protection while conducting operations in the OCS, including:



_Management Policy_short policy statement by appropriate management official;
_Organizational Structure_description of responsibilities, authorities, and communications for actions implementing
SEMP;

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940630-2-00084 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940630-2-00066 </PARENT>

_Policies and Procedures_responsibilities of officials, employees, and contractors necessary to ensure safety
and environmental protection;

_Training Program_program to describe and demonstrate safe practice, also a process for ensuring that all personnel,
including contractors, are adequately trained;

_Inspection, Testing, and Maintenance Program_program to ensure inspections and tests are performed and equipment
is maintained to ensure safe and proper operation;

_Corrective Action_process to correct non-conformance of a SEMP element;

_Accident Prevention and Investigation Program_procedures to address accidents, operational upsets, and near
misses, including a system to review, analyze, and correct practices;

_Internal Review_process to systematically review and assess the SEMP effectiveness;

_Procurement_policies and procedures to address procurement; and

_Documentation_all policies, procedures, and internal programs to be documented.




The notice also solicited information on the SEMP concept and the efforts necessary to implement a SEMP-like program.
The MMS received comments from offshore operators, trade organizations, government entities, consultants, an
engineering society, and an environmental organization. Generally, the commenters supported MMS's efforts to
enhance safety and environmental protection in the OCS. Some were concerned that SEMP would cross jurisdictional
lines and create regulatory conflict and confusion. Many commenters urged MMS to defer publishing SEMP regulations
and allow the American Petroleum Institute (API) to develop a voluntary standard that addresses safety and environmental
protection.

In November 1991 and January 1992, as a part of the SEMP information gathering process, MMS invited a cross section
of operators to give presentations on their safety policies and safety management programs. Those discussions were
useful for gaining a better understanding of the overall development of industry safety programs for both large and
small operators. Most company presenters were encouraged by the SEMP initiative. Several suggested that MMS wait
until the API completed its recommended practice before making a SEMP decision. Some encouraged MMS to set goals for
safety rather than promulgate regulations, while others suggested that MMS coordinate SEMP efforts with all other
OCS-related agencies to streamline the regulatory environment.

The MMS participated on the API subcommittee that developed ``Recommended Practices for Development of a Safety
and Environmental Management Program for Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) Operations and Facilities'' (API RP 75),
published in May 1993. We believe API RP 75 provides a good foundation for promoting safety and environmental protection
in the offshore oil and gas industry. The document generally captures our perception of what SEMP should contain.

The API and Offshore Operators Committee (OOC) conducted three API RP 75 workshops in 1993, one in New Orleans and two
in Houston. The purpose of the workshops was to provide attendees (especially small- and medium-sized independent
operators) a better understanding of the purpose of API RP 75 and guidance for its implementation. The MMS participated
in all three workshops. Approximately 600 persons attended the three workshops.



The MMS Intentions and Monitoring Plan



The MMS urges all operators to voluntarily implement the principles of SEMP through API RP 75. In addition, MMS will
cooperate with the API/OOC SEMP committee (the Committee) in the continuing development of the SEMP concept and will
monitor industry's progress towards the implementation of SEMP, while assessing its success.

<DOCNO> FR940630-2-00085 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940630-2-00066 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The Committee, with assistance from MMS, will develop a survey for distribution during 1994 to determine the status
of industry's implementation of API RP 75. The Committee may also sponsor a retreat for all OCS operators to consider
survey results and report on the progress (and any problems) concerning the implementation of API RP 75. Annually,
the Committee will distribute followup surveys to assess the progress of SEMP implementation.

For its part, MMS will postpone rulemaking for the general application of SEMP for OCS facilities. During the next
2 years, MMS will monitor the progress of API RP 75 application by (1) soliciting informal information on the implementation
of API RP 75 directly from operators, (2) making general inquiries at offshore facilities to monitor API RP 75 development,
and (3) evaluating the results of the Committee's survey. The MMS will also gather data on the need for SEMP on OCS facilities
and develop strategies for measuring SEMP application and benefits.

The MMS will examine the progress and success of industry-wide voluntary adoption of API RP 75. From these assessments,
MMS will, at the end of 2 years, decide whether to continue to monitor industry progress or to proceed with rulemaking.



Future Options for SEMP



At the completion of the 2-year monitoring program, MMS will determine if voluntary implementation of API RP 75 accomplishes
the goals of SEMP. Options for proceeding from that point include: (1) Continuing to encourage voluntary implementation
of the program, or (2) establishing a structured regulatory program for all operations. Other options may also be
available, such as (1) only requiring SEMP for specific areas, or (2) requiring SEMP where inspections or safety records
reveal less-than-acceptable performance. The MMS will identify other options as well and select one or more options
based on monitoring results, industry's safety record, and other factors.

The MMS could also decide to continue monitoring the progress of the voluntary implementation of SEMP. The MMS would
monitor industry's approach to safety management and accident rates, while inspectors check for application of
SEMP on platforms and facilities.

If voluntary adoption of API RP 75 is deemed unsuccessful, MMS may require all operators to formally develop and implement
SEMP. The MMS could incorporate API RP 75 into the regulations, or it could promulgate new SEMP requirements, possibly
similar to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's 29 CFR 1910 regulations. The MMS would alter its inspection
program accordingly to ensure operators implement SEMP.

The MMS may determine that SEMP is also suited for specialized applications, such as in deep water or the arctic where
operational demands are greater. Under this option, a specific SEMP plan would cover all operational activities
at a site, including activities not covered by current regulations. For example, a site-specific SEMP plan would
address contingency planning, risk analysis, and departures from the regulations, as well as routine operations.
This would compel an operator to explain how it would ensure the safety of operations at a specific site. The MMS is currently
evaluating the application of the SEMP concept to deep-water development.

Another option MMS may examine requires operators with less-than-acceptable performance to develop and implement
SEMP plans. The MMS could evaluate operators based on inspection records and accident data. This regulatory approach
focuses on operators needing improvement and does not place additional requirements on operators that consistently
operate in a safe manner.

Discussion of these regulatory options should not be considered an indication that MMS is backing away from its commitment
to the SEMP concept or faith in API RP 75. The MMS strongly supports voluntary implementation of API RP 75 by all lessees
and operators.

United States' Response To Public Comments



United States of America, Plaintiff, v.

 Airline Tariff Publishing Company, et al., Defendants.




Pursuant to section 2(d) of the Antitrust Procedures and Penalties Act, 15 U.S.C. 16(d) (the `APPA'' or ``Tunney Act''),
the United States responds to public comments on the proposed Final Judgement submitted for entry in this civil antitrust
proceeding.

This action began on December 21, 1992, when the United States filed a Complaint charging eight major domestic airlines
 and the Airline Tariff Publishing Company (``ATP'') with violations of the antitrust laws. The first count of the
Complaint alleges that each of the airline defendants engaged in various combinations and conspiracies with other
of the airline defendants and co-conspirators, consisting of agreements to fix prices by increasing fares, eliminating
discounted fares, and setting fare restrictions. The Complaint alleges that these agreements were reached using
the computerized fare dissemination services of ATP to exchange proposals, negotiate fare changes, and trade fare
increases in one or more markets for fare increases in other markets (or to other fare types). As a result of these agreements,
consumers paid higher fares for airline tickets.





The second count of the Complaint alleges that the airline defendants, ATP, and co-conspirators engaged in a combination
and conspiracy consisting of an agreement to create, maintain, operate, and participate in the ATP fare dissemination
system in a manner that unnecessarily facilitates the ability of the airline defendants and their co-conspirators
to coordinate changes to their fares. As a result of this agreement, consumers have paid higher prices for airline
tickets.

The Complaint seeks an injunction barring the defendants from entering into agreements with one another with respect
to fares, and from disseminating the information concerning proposed changes to fares that has enabled them to increase
prices collusively and illegally.

Simultaneously with the filing of the Complaint, the United States filed a proposed Final Judgment, a Competitive
Impact Statement (``CIS''), and a stipulation signed by two of the defendants, United and USAir, for entry of a proposed
Final Judgement. After reviewing the proposed Final Judgment pursuant to the Tunney Act, the Court concluded that
the Judgment was in the public interest within the meaning of the Tunney Act, and it became final with respect to United
and USAir on November 1, 1993.

On March 17, 1994, the United States, ATP, Alaska, American, Continental, Delta, Northwest, and TWA filed with the
Court a Stipulation consenting to the entry of a new proposed Final Judgment with respect to the remaining defendants.
This proposed Final Judgment is substantially identical to the Final Judgment entered against United and USAir with
the following exceptions. Section V(B) clarifies that the proposed Final Judgment does not prohibit an airline defendant
from selling management services to another airline. Section V(C) permits the airline defendants to disseminate
last ticket dates through ATP in some specified circumstances where the United/USAir decree prohibits the use of
last ticket dates. The record keeping provisions in Section VI(E) have been changed to reflect the changes to Section
V(C). Finally, Section IV(B) provides the relief the United States is seeking against defendant ATP.

As required by the Antitrust Procedures and Penalties Act, on March 25, 1994, American, Alaska, Delta, and ATP filed
with this Court a description of written and oral communications on their behalf within the reporting requirements
of section 15(g) of the APPA. Continental, Northwest and Trans World filed their notifications of written and oral
communications with the Court on March 28, 1994. A summary of the terms of the proposed Final Judgment and CIS, and directions
for the submission of written comments relating to the proposed decree were published in the Washington Post for seven
days over a period beginning March 27, 1994. The proposed Final Judgment and CIS were published in the 

Federal Register

 on March 31, 1994. 59 FR 15225.

The 60-day period for public comments commenced on April 1, 1994 and expired on May 30, 1994. The United States received
only one comment on the proposed Final Judgment, a letter from Michael London. As required by 15 U.S.C. 16(b), this
comment is being filed with this response. (Exhibit A).

In his comments, Mr. London expressed concern that the proposed Final Judgment's prohibition on advance price announcements
would deprive consumers of valuable information for making travel plans. Mr. London also expressed concern that
the United States may have filed its lawsuit without sufficient evidence to substantiate its claims against the airlines.
The United States sent Mr. London a letter individually responding to his inquiries regarding the proposed Final
Judgment. The United State's correspondence with Mr. London is also being filed with this response. (Exhibit B).


The Department has carefully considered Mr. London's comments. Nothing in these comments has altered the United
States' conclusion that the proposed Final Judgment is in the public interest.

The proposed Final Judgment provides all of the relief requested in the Complaint against American, Alaska, Continental,
Delta, Northwest, Trans World, the ATP, without the substantial expense of a trial. The relief provided by the proposed
decree will leave these airlines and ATP without the ability to resume the actions that constituted the antitrust
violations. Entry of the proposed Final Judgment is in the public interest.

Exhibit A_Civil Action No. 92-2854 (SSH)



April 5, 1994.



Assistant Attorney General, Anne K. Bingaman, 


United States Department of Justice, Washington, D.C.




Dear Ms. Bingaman: I am writing to you concerning an article that appeared in our local newspaper about a settlement
of price fixing allegations.

There are 2 points about this matter that concern me as both an air traveller and as a citizen.

(1) I have found in the past, the prenotification of fare adjustments very useful in planning airline travel. My travel
agent would scan the computer system for reduced fares to be effective at some future date. I could then plan travel
for a date when that fare would be available.

This would enable me to save money instead of paying a higher current fare. Therefore, instead of injuring the public,
this practice could result in savings over existing fares.

(2) The part that really concerns me and that seems unbelievable is the section of the article that states ``The government
believes that history would make proving guilt beyond a reasonable doubt difficult''.

If this paraphrase of your department's statement is correct, it seems a terrible thing that our government would
take action under these circumstances. I always thought that there were Constitutional safeguards that protected
individuals and companies against arbitrary prosecution. If the Justice Department had these doubts, how dare they
waste our tax money and impinge the reputation of companies on such an unsubstantiated charge.

I am a stockholder of one of the airline companies named as a party to the settlement. I believe that unfair and arbitrary
actions of the Justice Department have injured the reputation of the company and therefore my investment. If I believe
that the actions of the Justice Department constitute False Prosecution or the attempt at False Prosecution, what
remedies are available to me?




   Very Truly yours,


</SIGNJOB>

Michael London.

Michael London,


P.O. Box 2106, McAllen, Texas 78505-2106.




Dear Mr. London: I am responding to your letter to Assistant Attorney General Anne Bingaman concerning the proposed
consent decree between the Department of Justice, a number of major airlines and the Airline Tariff Publishing Company
(``ATP''), a computerized fare exchange system. The proposed decree settles a civil antitrust suit in which the Department
alleged that eight major airlines fixed prices and used the ATP system in a way that unnecessarily facilitated coordination
of airline fares. You express concern that the proposed decree's prohibitions on prenotification of fare adjustments
will deprive consumers of information regarding future fare discounts. You also express concern that the Department
may have filed the lawsuit against the airlines without substantial evidence to support its allegations.

In your letter, you state that pre-notification of fare changes enabled you to schedule travel for dates when fares
would be reduced. The proposed decree will not prohibit the airlines from publishing different fares applicable
for travel on different dates, provided the fares are currently available for sale. Thus, you will still be able to
plan your travel for days of the week or months of the year when the airlines charge lower fares.

The decree will prohibit the airlines from disseminating fares that can only be purchased at a later date. In the past,
the airlines used such fares to negotiate and agree upon fare increases or the elimination of discounts. Because these
fares changed frequently during negotiations, and often never became available for sale, they were extremely unreliable
and therefore not useful for consumers planning when to purchase their tickets.

You also suggest that the Department may have acted arbitrarily in its prosecution of the airlines because the government
did not believe that it could prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The Department filed this action because it had
compelling evidence that the airlines used ATP to reach agreements to raise prices and eliminate discounts, in violation
of the Sherman Act, raising prices in thousands of markets and for millions of travelers.

The government's decision whether to prosecute any particular violation of the Sherman Act civilly or criminally
is one that depends on a number of factors. In this case, the government's primary goal was to obtain injunctive relief
that would prevent the airlines from continuing their anticompetitive practices. We also recognized that the airlines'
collusive pricing practices evolved from a system that developed when the airlines were heavily regulated and not
subject to the antitrust laws; indeed, at one time the airlines were required to file fare changes in advance to allow
regulators time to review and disapprove them. That history would have made it considerably more difficult to prove
beyond a reasonable doubt that the airlines intended to reach price fixing agreements. For these and other reasons,
the Department elected to bring a civil case seeking injunctive rather than punitive relief against the airlines.
In a civil case, the government need only prove that the defendants violated the Sherman Act by a preponderance of the
evidence. The government is confident that it could easily have met that burden at trial.

I hope that this letter responds to your concerns. Thank you for your interest in this matter and in the enforcement
of the antitrust laws.




   Sincerely,

<USDEPT>NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION</USDEPT>






Vectra Technologies, Inc.; Environmental Assessment and Finding of No Significant Impact



The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC or the Commission) is considering issuance of an exemption to VECTRA
Technologies, Inc. (VECTRA) (formerly Pacific Nuclear Fuel Services, Inc.) located in San Jose, California, to
fabricate (but not use) a NUHOMS transfer cask. The transfer cask is a component of the Standardized NUHOMS System
that is intended to be used by Toledo Edison Company to store spent fuel at its Davis-Besse Nuclear Power Station (DBNPS)
(Docket No. 50-346, License No. NPF-3) located near Oak Harbor, Ohio. The exemption request does not include
the principal storage components of the Standardized NUHOMS System (i.e., horizontal storage module and dry shielded
canister).

The Standardized NUHOMS System is currently the subject of an NRC rulemaking which proposes to add the cask to the list
of NRC-approved storage casks (59 FR 28496, June 2, 1994). A draft NRC Safety Evaluation Report (SER), issued May 4,
1994, provides a detailed description and technical evaluation of the Standardized NUHOMS System, including he
transfer cask that is the subject of VECTRA'S exemption request.



Environmental Assessment



Identification of Proposed Action



The requested exemption, proposed by VECTRA letter dated March 4, 1994, concerns the requirements of 10 CFR 72.234(c),
which states that ``Fabrication of casks under the Certificate of Compliance must not start prior to receipt of the
Certificate of Compliance for the cask model.'' Specifically, VECTRA proposes to fabricate one NUHOMS transfer
cask prior to the Commission's issuance of a Certificate of Compliance for the Standardized NUHOMS System of which
the transfer cask is a part. Therefore, the proposed action by NRC would grant VECTRA an exemption from 10 CFR 72.234(c)
for the limited purpose of fabricating one transfer cask prior to VECTRA's receipt of a final Certificate of Compliance
for the Standardized NUHOMS System.



The Need for the Proposed Action



VECTRA'S request for exemption indicates that the proposed exemption is needed to have necessary equipment available
in time for use by DBNPS in mid-1995, and thus enable DBNPS to maintain complete full-core off-load capability in its
spent fuel pool following the refueling outage scheduled for early 1996. VECTRA's request indicates that in order
to meet this schedule, VECTRA must begin fabrication of a transfer cask promptly. However, the NRC administrative
process for approval of the Certificate of Compliance, which includes completion of the pending rulemaking on the
Standardized NUHOMS System, may not be completed before December 1994.

Procurement, fabrication, and construction activities for the transfer cask by VECTRA under the proposed exemption
would be entirely at VECTRA's own risk. In this regard, VECTRA's exemption request states that changes to procedures
or specifications that result from the remaining NRC certification activities can be accommodated into the components
to be fabricated under the proposed exemption. Favorable NRC action on the exemption request shall not be construed
as an NRC commitment to favorably consider VECTRA'S application for a certificate, or to approve VECTRA's proposed
design for the Standardized NUHOMS System. VECTRA would bear the risk of any activities conducted under the proposed
exemption, in light of NRC's future action on VECTRA's application and proposed design.



Environmental Impacts of the Proposed Action



The Commission has evaluated the environmental impacts of the proposed action, which is limited to fabrication only
and would not authorize any action with respect to use of the transfer cask for spent fuel. As noted, the NRC reviewed
the NUHOMS system Final Safety Analysis Report (SAR), and on May 4, 1994, issued a Draft SER, and on April 28, 1994, issued
a Draft Certificate of Compliance for use of the Standardized NUHOMS System under a general license. As a result of
this SAR review, VECTRA has an NRC-approved quality assurance program under which this component of the NUHOMS system
can be fabricated. VECTRA has developed procurement and fabrication specifications under this approved QA program,
which will be used to control procurement and fabrication activities related to construction of the transfer cask.
In addition, VECTRA's previous fabrication for NUHOMS systems, performed under NRC-approved QA programs, include
those for Carolina Power & Light Company's H.B. Robinson, Duke Power Company's Oconee, and Baltimore Gas and
Electric Company's Calvert Cliffs independent spent fuel storage installations. Environmental impact from the
limited transfer cask fabrication activities would be similar to the assembly of metal components at a large machine
shop. The environmental assessments for the Proposed Rule (54 FR 19379) and Final Rule (55 FR 29181), ``Storage of
Spent Fuel in NRC-approved Storage Casks at Power Reactor Sites,'' considered the environmental impact associated
with the construction and use of such certified casks and concluded that these activities would have no significant
impact on the environment. A finding of no significant environmental impact was also reached in the draft environmental
assessment for the pending NRC rulemaking on the Standardized NUHOMS System including the transfer cask. Accordingly,
the Commission concludes that the proposed exemption for VECTRA to fabricate (but not use) one transfer cask will
have no significant radiological or nonradiological environmental impacts.



Alternative to the Proposed Action



The alternative to the proposed exemption would be to deny the requested exemption. Based on the information provided
in VECTRA's request, this would result potentially in the loss of lead time for procurement and fabrication necessary
for the availability of the transfer cask needed by Toledo Edison Company, and could thereby cause disruptions in
planned activities for a series of plant outages beginning in 1996.



Agencies and Persons Consulted



The Commission's staff reviewed VECTRA's request and did not consult other agencies or persons.



Finding of No Significant Impact



Based upon the foregoing environmental assessment, the Commission concludes that the proposed action would not
have a significant effect on the quality of the human environment. Accordingly, the Commission has determined not
to prepare an environmental impact statement for the proposed exemption.

For further details with respect to this action, the request for exemption dated March 4, 1994, and other documents
are available for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street,
NW., Washington, DC 20555, and the Local Public Document at the William Carlson Library, Government Documents Collection,
University of Toledo, 2801 West Bancroft Avenue, Toledo, Ohio 43606.

<DOCTITLE>Governors' Designees Receiving Advance Notification of Transportation of Nuclear Waste</DOCTITLE>



On January 6, 1982, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) published in the 

Federal Register,

 as final, certain amendments to 10 CFR parts 71 and 73 (effective July 6, 1982), which require advance notification
to Governors or their designees concerning transportation of certain shipments of nuclear waste and spent fuel.
The advance notification covered in part 73 is for spent nuclear reactor fuel shipments and the notification for part
71 is for large quantity shipments of radioactive waste (and of spent nuclear reactor fuel not covered under the final
amendment to 10 CFR part 73).

The following list updates the names, addresses and telephone numbers of those individuals in each State who are responsible
for receiving information on nuclear waste shipments. The list will be published annually in the 

Federal Register

 on or about June 30, to reflect any changes in information.

<DOCTITLE>Draft Regulatory Guide; Issuance, Availability</DOCTITLE>



The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has issued for public comment a draft of a new guide planned for its Regulatory Guide
Series. This series has been developed to describe and make available to the public such information as methods acceptable
to the NRC staff for implementing specific parts of the Commission's regulations, techniques used by the staff in
evaluating specific problems or postulated accidents, and data needed by the staff in its review of applications
for permits and licenses.

The draft guide is temporarily identified as DG-8015, ``Release of Patients Administered Radioactive Materials,''
and is intended for Division 8, ``Occupational Health.'' DG-8015 is being developed to provide guidance on
determining the potential doses to an individual likely to receive the highest dose from exposure to a patient and
to establish appropriate activities and dose rates for release of a patient. The guide will also provide guideline
on instructions for patients on how to maintain doses to other individuals as low as reasonably achievable and will
describe recordkeeping requirements.

This draft guide is being issued to involve the public in the early stages of the development of a regulatory position
in this area. The draft guide has not received complete staff review and does not represent an official NRC staff position.

Public comments are being solicited on the guide. Comments should be accompanied by supporting data. Written comments
may be submitted to the Rules Review and Directives Branch, Division of Freedom of Information and Publications Services,
Office of Administration, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555. Copies of comments received
may be examined at the NRC Public Document Room, 2120 L Street NW., Washington, DC. Comments will be most helpful if
received by August 29, 1994.

Although a time limit is given for comments on this draft guide, comments and suggestions in connection with items
for inclusion in guides currently being developed or improvements in all published guides are encouraged at any time.

Regulatory guides are available for inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, 2120 L Street NW., Washington,
DC. Requests for single copies of draft guides (which may be reproduced) or for placement on an automatic distribution
list for single copies of future draft guides in specific divisions should be made in writing to the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory
Commission, Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Distribution and Mail Services Section. Telephone requests cannot
be accommodated. Regulatory guides are not copyrighted, and Commission approval is not required to reproduce them.

<DOCTITLE>Order To Transfer Licensed Materials (Effective Immediately) and Demand for Information</DOCTITLE>



In the matter of: Brian A. Clark, Dunmore, Pennsylvania.


I


Brian A. Clark was the President and Owner of August Corporation (Licensee), the holder of expired Byproduct Materials
License No. 37-20935-01 (License) issued by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC or Commission) pursuant
to 10 CFR Part 30 on November 15, 1985. The License authorized the possession and use of an americium-241 sealed source,
not to exceed 44 millicuries, in a Troxler Electronics Labs gauge, in accordance with the conditions specified therein.
The License expired on November 30, 1990, and the NRC has been informed by Mr. Clark that August Corporation is now defunct.
Since the expiration of the License, the byproduct material has remained in the possession of Mr. Clark at his residence
at 1608 Adams Avenue, Dunmore, Pennsylvania 18509.


II


The Licensee did not submit an application for renewal of the License under 10 CFR 30.37 prior to its expiration, nor
did the Licensee notify the Commission, in writing under 10 CFR 30.36, of a decision not to renew the License. Although
Mr. Clark stated his intentions, in a telephone conversation he initiated with Mr. William Oliveira, Health Physicist,
NRC, Region I, on December 27, 1991, to obtain a license in his name, as of this date, Mr. Clark has not applied for, nor
obtained, an NRC license.

On February 24, 1992, the NRC, Region I, issued a Notice of Violation (NOV) to the August Corporation for failure to
request renewal, or to file a notice of non-renewal or transfer of the byproduct material, prior to expiration of the
License. The letter forwarding the NOV directed the Licensee to place the gauge in secure storage and not to use the
material until the Licensee obtained a new NRC license. Neither the Licensee nor Mr. Clark responded to the Notice
of Violation, even though Mr. Clark was again telephonically contacted by Mr. Charles Amato, Health Physics Inspector,
NRC, Region I, on December 29, 1992, and informed that he was illegally possessing radioactive material, had not responded
to the Notice of Violation, and enforcement action could be taken. Although Mr. Clark again stated that he wanted to
obtain a license in his name, he has not applied for an NRC license.

In addition, in a July 1, 1993 letter, the NRC again reminded Mr. Clark of the need to respond to the NRC Notice of Violation.
Further, Ms. Sharon Johnson, Administrative Assistant, NRC, Region I, in a telephone conversation that Mr. Clark
initiated on February 25, 1994, and telephone conversations that Ms. Johnson initiated on March 15, 1994, and March
28, 1994, reminded Mr. Clark of his possession of NRC-licensed material without a license. Mr. Herbert Kaplan, Senior
Reactor Engineer, NRC, Region I, discussed the same issue in a subsequent telephone conversation that he initiated
on April 28, 1994. To date, Mr. Clark still possesses the gauge without an NRC license and without applying for such
a license.



III



Mr. Clark remains in possession of NRC-licensed radioactive material without a license. This is prohibited by Section
81 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, and by 10 CFR 30.3, which state that, except for persons exempt as provided
in 10 CFR Parts 30 and 150, no person shall possess or use byproduct material except as authorized in a specific or general
NRC license. Furthermore, based on the above, Mr. Clark has deliberately violated NRC requirements by possessing
the gauge without a license. This conclusion is based on the fact that Mr. Clark never filed a renewal application before
the License issued to August Corporation expired on November 30, 1990, as required by 10 CFR 30.37; Mr. Clark has not
responded to an Inquiry Letter (No. 90-001) dated November 28, 1990, sent by the NRC before the License expired;
Mr. Clark has not responded to the NRC Notice of Violation issued on February 24, 1992; Mr. Clark has not respond to an
NRC letter, via ``CERTIFIED MAIL'' dated July 1, 1993, addressing his previous failure to respond to the Notice of
Violation; Mr. Clark has refused to dispose of the radioactive material; Mr. Clark possesses the radioactive material
contrary to 10 CFR 30.3, without a valid NRC specific license; and Mr. Clark has stated to the NRC on numerous occasions
that he wants an NRC license (in his own name), but has not applied for such a license.

Improper handling of the gauge can result in an unnecessary exposure to radiation. The Atomic Energy Act and the Commission's
regulations require that material possessed by the Licensee be under a regulated system of licensing and inspection.
Mr. Clark's possession of NRC-licensed material without a valid NRC license, as documented in the February 24, 1992
Notice of Violation, and his unwillingness to respond to numerous NRC written and verbal communications to apply
for an NRC license, demonstrate a deliberate disregard for NRC requirements. Mr. Clark, by continuing to possess
material after being notified of the expiration of the License, has demonstrated that he is not willing to comply with
Commission requirements.

Given the circumstances surrounding Mr. Clark's possession of the byproduct material and his lack of communication
with the NRC, I lack the requisite reasonable assurance that the health and safety of the public will be protected while
Mr. Clark remains in possession of the radioactive material. Consequently, the public health, safety, and interest
require the imposition of the requirements set forth in Section IV below. Furthermore, pursuant to 10 CFR 2.202, I
have determined that the significance of Mr. Clark's actions described above (specifically, the deliberate possession
of licensed material without a License, after repeated NRC notification of the need to either obtain a license or transfer
the material to an authorized recipient) is such that the public health, safety, and interest require that this Order
be immediately effective.


IV


Accordingly, pursuant to Sections 81, 161b, 161i, 161o, 182 and 186 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, and
the Commission's regulations at 10 CFR 2.202 and 10 CFR Part 30, It Is Hereby Ordered, Effective Immediately, That:

A. The americium-241 source in Mr. Clark's possession shall be transferred to a person authorized to receive
and possess the source within 45 days of the date of this Order. If Mr. Clark believes he does not have sufficient funds
to complete the transfer, he must provide, within 30 days of this Order, evidence supporting such a claim by submitting
to the Director, Office of Enforcement, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, D.C. 20555, (1) an estimate
of the cost of the transfer and the basis for the estimate, including the license number and identity of the person who
would perform the transfer, (2) written statements from at least two banks stating that Mr. Clark could not qualify
for a loan to pay for the transfer, (3) copies of Federal income tax returns for the years ending 1993, 1992, 1991, and
1990, for Mr. Clark, and (4) a signed agreement to allow the NRC to receive Mr. Clark's credit information from a credit
agency. A submittal of evidence supporting the lack of sufficient funds does not excuse noncompliance with this order.
B. The americium-241 source shall be tested for leakage by a person authorized to perform the test prior to transfer
of the source to another person, if a leak test has not been performed with the last six months prior to transfer.
C. Mr. Clark continue to maintain safe control over the gauge containing the source, by keeping the source in locked
storage and not allowing any person access to the source until the source is leak tested and transferred to a person
authorized to receive and possess the source in accordance with the provisions of this Order.
D. Mr. Clark ensure that there is no use of the americium-241 source, except for performance of the pre-transfer
leak test and transfer to an authorized recipient.
E. Unless the source already has been transferred, Mr. Clark shall provide a written update within 30 days of receipt
of this Order to the Regional Administrator, Region I and the Director, Office of Enforcement, on Mr. Clark's progress
in finding an authorized person to receive and possess the source.
F. Mr. Clark shall notify Dr. Ronald Bellamy, Chief, Nuclear Materials Safety Branch, NRC, Region I, by telephone
at least two working days prior to the date of the transfer of the source so that the NRC may, if it elects, observe the
transfer of the source to the authorized recipient.
G. Mr. Clark, within seven days following completion of the transfer, shall provide to the Regional Administration,
Region I: (1) confirmation in writing and under oath (NRC Form 314) that the americium-241 has been transferred,
(2) a copy of the leak test performed prior to the transfer, and (3) a copy of the certification from the authorized recipient
that the source has been received.
The Regional Administrator, NRC Region I, may, in writing, relax or rescind any of the above conditions upon a showing
by Mr. Clark of good cause.


V


In accordance with 10 CFR 2.202, Mr. Clark must, and any other person adversely affected by this Order may, submit an

If a hearing is requested by Mr. Clark or a person whose interest is adversely affected, the Commission will issue an
Order designating the time and place of any hearing. If a hearing is held, the issue to be considered at such hearing
shall be whether this Order should be sustained. 

Pursuant to 10 CFR 2.202 (c)(2)(i), Mr. Clark, or any other person adversely affected by this Order may, in addition
to demanding a hearing, at the time the answer is filed or sooner, move the presiding officer to set aside the immediate
effectiveness of the Order on the ground that the Order, including the need for immediate effectiveness, is not based
on adequate evidence but on mere suspicion, unfounded allegations, or error. 

In the absence of any request for hearing, the provisions specified in Section IV above shall be final 20 days from the
date of this Order without further order or proceedings. An answer or request for hearing shall not stay the immediate
effectiveness of this order. 



VI 



In addition to issuance of this Order, the Commission requires further information from Mr. Clark in order to determine
whether the Commission can have reasonable assurance that in the future, should Mr. Clark perform licensed activities
under any other NRC license, Mr. Clark will conduct any NRC licensed activity in accordance with NRC requirements,
and whether enforcement action is warranted against Mr. Clark, individually. 

Accordingly, pursuant to section 161c, 161o, 182, and 186 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, and the Commission's
regulations in 10 CFR 2.204 and 10 CFR 30.32(b), you are hereby required to submit to the Director, Office of Enforcement,
U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, within 30 days of the date of this Order and Demand for Information,
a statement in writing, under oath or affirmation, of: 

1. Why the NRC should have confidence that you will comply with NRC requirements in the event that you perform licensed
activities under another NRC license. 

2. Why, in light of the facts set forth above, the NRC should not issue an Order to you prohibiting you from engaging in
NRC-licensed activities. 

This information is needed in light of the deliberate violations of Commission requirements. Copies of the response
to this Demand for Information also shall be sent to the Assistant General Counsel for Hearings and Enforcement, U.S.
Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, and to the Regional Administrator, NRC Region I, 475 Allendale
Road, King of Prussia, PA 19406. 

After reviewing your response, the NRC will determine whether further action is necessary to ensure compliance with
regulatory requirements.

<DOCTITLE>Commonwealth Edison Co.; Notice of Consideration of Issuance of Amendments to Facility Operating Licenses, Proposed
No Significant Hazards</DOCTITLE>




The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an amendment to Facility Operating
License Nos. DPR-39 and DPR-48, issued to the Commonwealth Edison Company (CECo, the licensee), for operation
of the Zion Station, Units 1 and 2, located in Lake County, Illinois.

The proposed amendments would consist primarily of an administrative change to the Zion Station's Technical Specifications
(TSs) to reflect an exemption to 10 CFR part 50, appendix J, section III.D.3.


The exemption from section III.D.3 of appendix J, which is schedular in nature, would authorize the licensee to defer,
on a one time only basis, the Type C leak rate testing requirements for valves 1(2)MOV-CC685 until the next refueling
outage for each unit. NRC approval of this request would allow CECo continued operation of both units in full compliance
with the operating license.


Emergency circumstances existed in 1991, in that prior to that date, CECo was unaware of a number of penetrations and
their associated valves, including 1(2)MOV-CC685, which had never been Type C leak rate tested in accordance
with 10 CFR part 50, appendix J. On April 5, 1991, the NRC issued an Emergency Technical Specification Amendment (EMTSA)
which allowed continued operation of Zion, Units 1 and 2, until their next refueling outages, at which time the required
Type C leak rate tests for those penetrations were to be performed. The staff expected that 1(2)MOV-CC685 and
the other penetrations would be subjected to the appropriate modifications and required testing performed, which
would put Zion Station in compliance with the Type C testing requirement. However, on June 8, 1994, it was determined
by Zion Station that the Type C leak rate testing requirement had inadvertently not been met for 1(2)MOV-CC685.
On June 13, 1994, the NRC issued a Notice of Enforcement Discretion (NOED) not to enforce compliance with the Technical
Specification (TS) for Zion Nuclear Power Station, Units 1 and 2 pending submittal of a schedular exemption request
to the requirements of 10 CFR part 50, appendix J, and a Technical Specification amendment request. The exigent nature
of this request is necessary due to the identification of this issue after the completion of the Zion Station's refueling
outage and startup operations and is required to be reviewed quickly by the staff to support an exemption request from
the requirements to test in accordance with 10 CFR part 50, appendix J, for valves 1(2)MOV-CC685 until the next
refueling outage for each unit. The exemption request was submitted by the licensee in another letter, also dated
June 16, 1994.

Before issuance of the proposed license amendment, the Commission will have made findings required by the Atomic
Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act) and the Commission's regulations.

Pursuant to 10 CFR 50.91(a)(6), for amendments to be granted under exigent circumstances the NRC staff must determine
that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration. Under the Commission's regulations
in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not (1) involve
a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated; or (2) create the
possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant
reduction in a margin of safety. As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue
of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below:




1. The proposed amendment does not involve a significant increase in the probability of occurrence or consequences
of any accident previously evaluated.

The subject pathway and associated containment isolation valves 1(2)MOV-CC685and 1(2)MOV-CC9438
provide the necessary assurance to conclude that the overall containment leakage rates will remain within the limits
assumed in the accident analysis. Failures in excess of design basis requirements would be necessary to adversely
impact the offsite dose in the unlikely event of an accident. This conclusion can be reached since the isolation barriers
of the Component Cooling Water return from the reactor coolant pumps' thermal barriers meet the following criteria:




_are of seismic design,
_are required to operate post accident (except for large break LOCA),
_the valves close automatically on Phase B isolation signal,
_are subject to Emergency Operating Procedure guidance for manual IVSW system actuation,
_are of similar design and exposed to similar environments as those penetrations that are Type C leak tested,




As such, the consequences of previously evaluated accidents, with respect to offsite dose considerations, would
not be significantly impacted.


2. The proposed amendment does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously
analyzed.


The proposed changes to the Technical Specifications do not result in plant operations or configurations that could
create a new or different type of accident. Installed plant equipment is not operated in a new or different manner.
The proposed amendment does not add new or different types of plant equipment nor do the proposed changes alter any
plant procedures used during recovery from accidents described in the analysis. As such, it can be concluded that
the possibility for a new or different type of accident has not been introduced.


3. The proposed changes do not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.

As described in Technical Specification Bases, dose calculations suggest that the public exposure would be well
below the 10 CFR 100 values in the event of a design basis accident.

Calculations indicate that the accident leak rate could be allowed to increase to approximately 0.148%/day before
the guidance thyroid [dose] value given in 10 CFR 100 would be exceeded. However, the 0.1%/day pre-operational test
acceptance criteria provides an adequate margin of safety to assure the health and safety of the public. Additional
margin is achieved by establishing the allowable operational leakage rate at 0.075%/day. The measured containment
leakage rates are well within that limit. Despite the lack of Type C testing of the subject valves in strict compliance
with appendix J, substantial barriers to fission product release are provided by the intact system piping and associated
valves.


Testing that has been completed on the subject valves and penetrations provides a high degree of confidence that Type
C leakage limits would be met. Based on this it is concluded that the proposed changes to the Technical Specifications
do not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.

The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

The Commission is seeking public comments on this proposed determination. Any comments received within 15 days after
the date of publication of this notice will be considered in making any final determination.

Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendment until the expiration of the 15-day notice period. However,
should circumstances change during the notice period, such that failure to act in a timely way would result, for example,
in derating or shutdown of the facility, the Commission may issue the license amendment before the expiration of the
15-day notice period, provided that its final determination is that the amendment involves no significant hazards
consideration. The final determination will consider all public and State comments received. Should the Commission
take this action, it will publish in the 

Federal Register

 a notice of issuance. The Commission expects that the need to take this action will occur very infrequently.

Written comments may be submitted by mail to the Rules Review and Directives Branch, Division of Freedom of Information
and Publications Services, Office of Administration, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555,
and should cite the publication date and page number of this 

Federal Register

 notice. Written comments may also be delivered to Room 6D22, Two White Flint North, 11555 Rockville Pike, Rockville,
Maryland, from 7:30 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. Federal workdays. Copies of written comments received may be examined at the
NRC Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555.

The filing of requests for hearing and petitions for leave to intervene is discussed below.

By August 1, 1994, the licensee may file a request for a hearing with respect to issuance of the amendment to the subject
facility operating license and any person whose interest may be affected by this proceeding and who wishes to participate
as a party in the proceeding must file a written request for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene. Requests
for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's ``Rules of Practice
for Domestic Licensing Proceedings'' in 10 CFR Part 2. Interested persons should consult a current copy of 10 CFR 2.714
which is available at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington
20555 and at the local public document room located at the Waukegan Public Library, 128 N. County Street, Waukegan,
Illinois 60085. If a request for a hearing or petition for leave to intervene is filed by the above date, the Commission
or an Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, designated by the Commission or by the Chairman of the Atomic Safety and Licensing
Board Panel, will rule on the request and/or petition; and the Secretary or the designated Atomic Safety and Licensing
Board will issue a notice of hearing or an appropriate order.

As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall set forth with particularity the interest of the
petitioner in the proceeding, and how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding. The petition
should specifically explain the reasons why intervention should be permitted with particular reference to the following
factors: (1) the nature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made a party to the proceeding; (2) the nature and
extent of the petitioner's property, financial, or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect
of any order which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest. The petition should also identify
the specific aspect(s) of the subject matter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Any person
who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has been admitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting
leave of the Board up to 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended
petition must satisfy the specificity requirements described above.

Not later than 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file
a supplement to the petition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions which are sought to be litigated
in the matter. Each contention must consist of a specific statement of the issue of law or fact to be raised or controverted.
In addition, the petitioner shall provide a brief explanation of the bases of the contention and a concise statement
of the alleged facts or expert opinion which support the contention and on which the petitioner intends to rely in proving
the contention at the hearing.

The petitioner must also provide references to those specific sources and documents of which the petitioner is aware
and on which the petitioner intends to rely to establish those facts or expert opinion. Petitioner must provide sufficient
information to show that a genuine dispute exists with the applicant on a material issue of law or fact. Contentions
shall be limited to matters within the scope of the amendment under consideration. The contention must be one which,
if proven, would entitle the petitioner to relief. A petitioner who fails to file such a supplement which satisfies
these requirements with respects to at least one contention will not be permitted to participate as a party.

Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subject to any limitations in the order granting leave
to intervene, and have the opportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, including the opportunity
to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses.

If the amendment is issued before the expiration of the 30-day hearing period, the Commission will make a final determination
on the issue of no significant hazards consideration. If a hearing is requested, the final determination will serve
to decide when the hearing is held.
If the final determination is that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration, the Commission
may issue the amendment and make it immediately effective, notwithstanding the request for a hearing. Any hearing
held would take place after issuance of the amendment.
If the final determination is that the amendment request involves a significant hazards consideration, any hearing
held would take place before the issuance of any amendment.
A request for a hearing or a petition for leave to intervene must be filed with the Secretary of the Commission, U.S.

Confirmatory Order Modifying License (Effective Immediately) 

I



In the Matter of: Nuclear Fuel Services, Inc., Erwin, Tennessee.

 


Nuclear Fuel Services, Inc. (NFS), located at Erwin, Tennessee, is the holder of License SNM-124 issued by the
Nuclear Regulatory Commission pursuant to 10 CFR Part 70. The license authorizes the licensee to receive, possess,
use, and transfer special nuclear material under the conditions specified in the license. The license was originally
issued on September 18, 1957, and was last renewed on June 9, 1992. 



II 



During the course of licensed activities and until June 28, 1981, when on-site burial of waste contaminated with special
nuclear material was no longer permitted by former 10 CFR 20.304, NFS buried certain wastes contaminated with special
nuclear material, such as specific process wastes, contaminated equipment, and other like debris, in an area on the
licensee's premises now designated as ``Pond 4.'' Pond 4 has also been designated by the United States Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) as Solid Waste Management Units 2, 4, and 6, and is subject to the requirements for remediation
and management for ground water protection of the Resources Conservation and Recovery Act, 42 USC  6901-6986.


In order to comply with the decommissioning requirements of the Commission, NFS must ultimately decontaminate the
above identified areas used for waste management and disposal to a level suitable for release of the property for unrestricted
use. 10 CFR 70.38. To do so requires the removal or reduction of the special nuclear material present, either in its
discrete form or as part of other materials present. 



III 



In order to comply with requirements of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, regarding solid waste management,
and with NRC decontamination and decommissioning requirements, the licensee proposes to engage in a program of remediation
of the Pond 4 area, as detailed in its ``Decommissioning/Interim Measures Workplan for the Pond 4 Area, Solid Waste
Management, Units 2, 4, and 6'' (Interim Workplan). 

Although the licensee believes that its license already contains adequate authority to carry out Phase I source removal
of the decontamination and decommissioning activities outlined in the Interim Workplan for Pond 4 and other areas,
the staff of the NRC has concluded that the decontamination and decommissioning activities proposed represent a
significant change from past practices so as to require additional license conditions to assure protection of the
health and safety of the public, workers, and the environment from unexpected radiological conditions resulting
from the material excavated, stored, and ultimately disposed of. 

In accordance with 10 CFR 70.38(c)(2)(i)(A)-(D), the licensee is required to submit a decommissioning plan
for approval by the NRC prior to undertaking decommissioning work, which poses potential health and safety impacts,
if procedures would involve techniques not applied routinely during cleanup or maintenance operations; or if workers
would be entering areas not normally occupied where surface contamination and radiation levels are significantly
higher than routinely encountered during operation; or if procedures could result in significantly greater airborne
concentrations of radioactive materials than are present during operation; or if procedures could result in significantly
greater release of radioactive material to the environment than those associated with operation. 

Pursuant to Clause H.015 of the NFS/U.S. DOE contract DE-A-C12-90 SN 39106 incorporated into NFS
license Chapter 7, the United States Deepartment of Energy (DOE) is responsible for providing funds to decommission
and decontaminate Pond 4 and other areas covered by the Interim Workplan. DOE has established funding to recognize
and support the immediate commencement of the decontamination and decommissioning of Pond 4 and other areas subject
to the Interim Workplan and as directed by this Order. NFS has kept DOE, EPA, and the State of Tennessee informed of the
schedule for commencement of decontamination and decommissioning activities under the Interim Workplan. 

Decontamination and decommissioning activities proposed by the Interim Workplan will involve techniques not applied
routinely during operation, cleanup, or maintenance operations, in that bulk soil and waste material excavation
will take place using heavy equipment in an enclosed structure. Additionally, procedures used in the excavation
and processing of contaminated soils and debris will result in the material becoming highly disturbed and thereby
creating a potential for release of radioactivity to the environment through liquid and gaseous effluents, and a
greater potential for exposure of workers though inhalation of airborne radioactivity, than that associated with
operation. The currently scheduled date for commencement of those activities is June 23, 1994. 

Therefore, the Commission finds that the public health, safety, and interest requires that the NFS license be further
conditioned and modified with special conditions to protect the health and safety of workers and public in the performance
of the decontamination and decommissioning of the Pond 4 area of the NFS site, with respect to activities proposed
by the Interim Workplan. The licensee has consented to these conditions and modification of the license by issuance
of this Order.

Pursuant to 10 CFR 2.202(d), I have determined that, based on the licensee's consent to the issuance of this Order and
the public health, safety, and interest, this Order shall be immediately effective. 



IV 



Accordingly, pursuant to sections 53, 161b, 161i, 161o of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, and the Commission's
regulations in 10 CFR 2.202 and 10 CFR Part 70, it is hereby ordered, effective immediately, that License SNM-124
is modified by addition of the following conditions, to require Nuclear Fuel Services, Inc. to: 

1. By November 1, 1994, submit a technically derived characterization plan. The characterization plan must provide
a program to reasonably define the extent and nature of the contamination in Pond 4 and other areas of the plant site
used for waste management and disposal, denoted as the crosshatched area on the attached plane outline of the licensee's
facility. (Appendix I) 

2. Perform all current decommissioning and decontamination of the Pond 4 area within Building 410 in accordance with
the ``Decommissioning/Interim Measures Workplan for the Pond 4 Area, Solid Waste Management, Units 2, 4, and 6,''
dated December 7, 1993, Revision 1 of the Interim Workplan dated June 16, 1994, and the letter dated June 1, 1994, signed
by Andrew Maxin and addressed to Robert Pierson, ``Responses to NRC Questions/Comments, dated May 20, 1994,'' which
are hereby incorporated by reference and made part of this Order. The licensee may make changes to the Interim Workplan
without notification to the NRC as long as those changes do not decrease the effectiveness of its safety program as
determined by the NFS Safety and Safeguards Review Council (SSRC). Proposed changes which decrease the effectiveness
of its safety program shall not be implemented without prior approval of the NRC. Revisions to the Interim Workplan
implemented without NRC review and approval shall be reported to the NRC within 15 days. 

3. Not undertake any decommissioning and decontamination activities of the Pond 4 area outside of the confines of
Building 410 prior to the approval by the NRC of a remediation plan for such outside areas. The remediation plan must
include an evaluation of estimated worker and public radiation exposures that takes into account the experience
from work performed within Building 410 for partial remediation, and for the partial remediation of Impoundments
1, 2, and 3. The remediation plan for outside areas must describe and analyze the impact of the proposed remediation
of the outside areas on groundwater. 

4. Install and use an environmental air sampling device in a location that will most effectively monitor airborne
releases from Building 410. To ensure that all potential pathways are monitored, Trailer T-20 must be moved
so that it does not obstruct the free flow of air around the air sampling device presently located immediately north
of Trailer T-20, or the air sampling device must be repositioned to accomplish the same objective. 

5. Return processed soil only to the remediated areas within 
Building 410 or ship to a licensed burial site. 

6. Analyze excavated material for radioactivity levels and submit data to NRC for review prior to removal of Building
410 and the licensee's securing of the groundwater drawdown system. After reviewing data, NRC will determine when
Building 410 may be removed and when the licensee may secure the groundwater drawdown system, and if additional measures
are needed to avoid unacceptable groundwater contamination. 

7. Not release any liquids to the sanitary sewer system prior to the approval by the NRC of the licensee's evaluation
and demonstration that the release will conform to 10 CFR 20.2003. 

8. In the absence of, or in lieu of, monitoring effluents in air at the point of release to the ambient atmosphere from
Building 410, not allow concentrations of radioactive elements in air within Building 410 in the immediate vicinity
of areas under remediation to exceed the exposure rates in 10 CFR 20.1302. 

The Director, Office of Nuclear Material Safety and Safeguards, may, in writing, relax or rescind any of the above
conditions upon demonstration by the licensee of good cause.

In the Matter of: Siemens Power Corporation, Richland, Washington.

 
Order and Demand for Information 
I 


Siemens Power Corporation (SPC) is the holder of Special Nuclear Materials License SNM-1227, issued by the
Nuclear Regulatory Commission. The license authorizes possession and use of uranium for the manufacture of fuel
assemblies for commercial nuclear power plants. The license also authorizes possession and use of plutonium in sealed
sources and as mixed oxide in stored waste. The license was last renewed on September 10, 1987, and was due to expire
September 30, 1992. The licensee submitted an application for renewal of the license on August 25, 1992. The license
has continued in effect since then under the timely renewal provision of 10 CFR 70.33(b). 


II 


The Commission's regulations in 10 CFR Part 20 (Standards for Protection Against Radiation) prohibit the release
of insoluble non-biological licensed materials to sanitary sewers. Specifically, 10 CFR 20.2003(a)(1) provides
that a licensee may discharge licensed material into sanitary sewer systems only if, among other things, the material
is readily soluble in water. The purpose of this prohibition is to prevent accumulation and possible reconcentration
of the materials in the sanitary sewer system, sewage treatment plants, and sewage sludge. While revised Part 20 was
effective in June 1991, licensees were permitted to defer implementation of the rule until January 1, 1994. 56 Fed.
Reg. 23360, May 21, 1991; 57 Fed. Reg. 38588, August 26, 1992. 
On January 28, 1994, the NRC issued Information Notice (IN) 94-07, which discussed two approaches that could
be used for determining a chemical compound's solubility in water. The IN emphasized that unless releases qualify
as being ``readily soluble,'' 10 CFR 20.2003(a)(1) would prohibit release to sanitary sewers absent the grant of
an exemption to that regulation. 
SPC is authorized by License SNM-1227, Safety Condition S-1, to operate a laundry facility for the cleaning
of protective clothing and equipment contaminated with uranium compounds and to discharge liquid effluents to the
Richland Municipal Sewerage System. These effluents are continuously monitored, and composite samples are analyzed
for uranium and regulated chemicals. Results of the liquid effluent monitoring are reported to the NRC in accordance
with 10 CFR 70.59. The results are also reported to the Washington State Department of Ecology, Water Quality Division
and the Director, Water and Waste Utilities, of the City of Richland. 
On April 14, 1994, SPC submitted an application for an exemption from 10 CFR 20.2003(a)(1). SPC stated that based on
1993 data an evaluation of liquid effluents had demonstrated that the sewer discharge from its retention tanks, which
receive the bulk of their input from the contaminated clothing laundry, contained small amounts of insoluble uranium.
SPC reported that the average uranium concentration was 0.24 parts per million; the liquid discharge was approximately
4,000 gallons per day; the total uranium discharged to the sanitary sewer annually was 1.47 kilograms, or 0.0026 curies
of uranium; and the insoluble uranium fraction measured by filtration is approximately 59 percent of the total discharged
uranium, or 0.0015 curies. 
The information contained in SPC's exemption request indicates that SPC may be in violation of 10 CFR 20.2003(a)(1).
SPC was required to comply with the provisions of 10 CFR 20.2003 by January 1, 1994, and yet has reported that 59 percent
of the uranium discharges to the sanitary sewer from its retention tanks are insoluble. The filing of an exemption
request did not and does not relieve SPC from the obligation to comply with NRC regulations. The NRC staff's review
of the exemption request has not been completed. 
SPC is hereby notified that it must comply with the provisions of 10 CFR 20.2003 notwithstanding the fact that it has
requested an exemption from that regulation. Only in the event that the exemption request is granted may SPC discharge
any non-biological insoluble licensed material into sanitary sewerage. While the request is pending, SPC could
be subject to enforcement action for violating NRC regulations prohibiting such discharges. 


III 


In light of the information contained in SPC's exemption request, further information is needed. Accordingly, pursuant
to Sections 161c, 161o, 182, and 186 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, and the Commission's regulations
in 10 CFR 2.204, in order for the Commission to determine whether enforcement action should be taken to ensure compliance
with NRC statutory and regulatory requirements, SPC is required to submit by July 6, 1994, to the Director, Office
of Nuclear Material Safety and Safeguards, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, D.C. 20555, with a copy
to the Chief, Fuel Cycle Licensing Branch, the following information, in writing and under oath or affirmation: 
1. a. State what actions SPC has taken to ensure compliance with 10 CFR 20.2003(a)(1) since January 1, 1994. 
b. Describe the circumstances, since January 1, 1994, under which non-biological insoluble licensed materials
were discharged into sanitary sewerage, and the actions, if any, which were taken to prevent further discharges.

2. State what actions SPC will take to ensure future compliance with 10 CFR 20.2003(a)(1). 
Copies also shall be sent to the Assistant General Counsel for Hearings and Enforcement at the same address. After
receiving your response, the NRC will determine whether further action is necessary to ensure compliance with statutory
and regulatory requirements.

<DOCTITLE>Wolf Creek Nuclear Operating Corp.; (Wolf Creek Generating Station, Unit 1) Exemption</DOCTITLE>


I


On June 4, 1985, the Commission issued Facility Operating License No. NPF-42 to Wolf Creek Nuclear Operating
Corporation (the licensee) for Wolf Creek Generating Station, Unit 1. The license provides, among other things,
that it is subject to all rules, regulations, and orders of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) now
and hereafter in effect.


II


Section 50.54(q) of 10 CFR part 50 requires a licensee authorized to operate a nuclear power plant to follow and maintain
in effect emergency plans which meet the standards of 10 CFR 50.47(b) and the requirements of Appendix E to 10 CFR Part
50. The subject exemption is from the requirement of Section IV.F.2 of Appendix E to 10 CFR Part 50 which requires each
licensee at each site to annually exercise its emergency plan.
The NRC may grant exemptions from the requirements of the regulations, pursuant to 10 CFR 50.12, that (1) are authorized
by law, will not present an undue risk to the public health and safety, and are consistent with the common defense and
security; and (2) present special circumstances. Section 50.12(a)(2) of 10 CFR Part 50 describes special circumstances
as including cases that provide only temporary relief from the applicable regulation when the licensee has made good
faith efforts to comply with the regulation.


III


By letter dated March 8, 1994, the licensee requested a one-time exemption from the requirements to conduct an annual
exercise of the Wolf Creek emergency plan pursuant to Section IV.F.2 of Appendix E to 10 CFR Part 50. The licensee had
planned to conduct the 1994 annual radiological emergency response plan exercise on June 29, 1994. Full participation
with the State of Kansas and affected counties was not required during the 1994 exercise. The previous emergency preparedness
exercise for Wolf Creek Generating Station was conducted in December 1993. The licensee requested an exemption in
order to allow for the approval and implementation of revised emergency classification criteria and to avoid conflict
with the seventh refueling outage, currently scheduled to begin in September 1994. The proposed exemption would
not affect the requirement to conduct the normally scheduled 1995 annual exercise.
The proposed exemption provides only temporary relief to delay the annual exercise in order to afford the licensee
an opportunity to implement revised emergency classification procedures and avoid conflict with a scheduled refueling
outage. The exercise has been tentatively rescheduled for February 1995 which would result in an approximate fourteen
month interval between the 1993 and rescheduled 1994 exercises.
Section 50.47(a)(4) of 10 CFR Part 50 and Section IV.B of Appendix E to 10 CFR Part 50 require an emergency classification
and action level scheme for use by licensees and government response organizations. Regulatory Guide 1.101, ``Emergency
Planning and Preparedness for Nuclear Power Reactors,'' Revision 3, August 1992, accepted guidance contained in
NUMARC/NESP-007 (Revision 2, January 1992), ``Methodology for Development of Emergency Action Levels''
as an alternative to NUREG-0654/FEP-REP-1, ``Criteria for Preparation and Evaluation of Radiological
Response Plans and Preparedness in Support of Nuclear Power Plants'' for the preparation of emergency action levels.
By letter dated December 15, 1993, the licensee requested NRC review and approval of revised emergency action levels
developed using the guidance of NUMARC/NESP-007. The proposed exemption was requested, in part, to accommodate
the transition to the revised emergency action levels. The transition period includes time for NRC review and training
of licensee personnel on the revised emergency action levels. Conducting an emergency exercise prior to the implementation
of the revised emergency action levels would significantly reduce potential benefits since important emergency
classification procedures would be superseded shortly after the exercise.
Scheduling the exercise for the latter portions of 1994, following implementation of the revised emergency action
levels, results in a conflict with the planning and execution of the seventh refueling outage, currently scheduled
to begin in September 1994. Both activities, the exercise and refueling outage, are resource intensive and require
focused management attention. Therefore, it is undesirable to schedule them for the same time period.
The proposed exemption would result in an interval between exercises of approximately fourteen months. Although
slightly longer than the twelve month period specified by the regulations, the proposed interval adequately addresses
the underlying purpose of the rule regarding periodic exercises. In addition to the December 1993 exercise, the licensee
conducts smaller scale emergency plan drills and has stated that emergency response team members will participate
in such a drill during the first half of 1994. These activities ensure that licensee personnel and equipment remain
capable of responding during an emergency.
On this basis, the NRC staff finds that the licensee has demonstrated that special circumstances are present as required
by 10 CFR 50.12(a)(2). Further the staff also finds that a delay in the 1994 exercise until early in 1995 will not present
an undue risk to the public health and safety.


IV


Accordingly, the Commission has determined pursuant to 10 CFR 50.12, this exemption is authorized by law and will
not endanger life or property or the common defense and security and is otherwise in the public interest. Therefore,
the Commission hereby grants Wolf Creek Nuclear Operating Corporation an exemption from the requirements of 10 CFR
50, Appendix E, Paragraph IV.F.2.
Pursuant to 10 CFR 51.32, the Commission has determined that the granting of this exemption will have no significant
impact on the environment (59 FR 27076).

<USDEPT>PENSION BENEFIT GUARANTY CORPORATION</USDEPT>



<DOCTITLE>Request for Extension of Approval of Collection of Information Under the Paperwork Reduction Act; Requests for PBGC
Approval of Multiemployer Plan Amendment Adopting Abatement Rules</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of request for OMB approval.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (``PBGC'') has requested that the Office of Management and Budget (``OMB'')
extend approval, under the Paperwork Reduction Act, of a collection of information in its regulations on the reduction
or waiver of complete withdrawal liability (OMB control number 1212-0044; expires September 30, 1994). A multiemployer
plan amendment adopting alternative rules for the reduction or waiver of complete withdrawal liability may not be
put into effect until approved by the PBGC in response to a plan sponsor's request. The effect of this notice is to advise
the public of the PBGC's request and solicit public comment on this collection of information.




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (``PBGC'') administers the pension plan termination insurance programs
under Title IV of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (``ERISA'') (29 U.S.C. 1001 

et seq.

). Part 2647 of the PBGC's regulations (29 CFR Part 2647), Reduction or Waiver of Complete Withdrawal Liability, implements
the requirements of ERISA section 4207 (29 U.S.C. 1387). Since April 1, 1994, Part 2647 has included, in  2647.9,
a procedure and standards for the amendment of plans to provide alternative rules for the reduction or waiver of complete
withdrawal liability (

i.e., 

rules for abatement under conditions other than those specified in   2647.4 and 2647.8 (c) and (d)) (59
FR 9926, March 2, 1994).




Under  2647.9, Plan rules for abatement, a plan amendment adopting such alternative rules (and any subsequent
modification thereof) may not be put into effect until approved by the PBGC in response to a request by the plan sponsor.
Paragraph (d) of  2647.9 requires the submission of information that the PBGC needs to identify a plan and to
determine whether to approve the amendment. (The PBGC will approve an amendment if it determines that the rules rules
therein are consistent with the purposes of ERISA (paragraph (f)).)

The PBGC is requesting that the Office of Management and Budget (``OMB'') extend approval of the collection of information
(OMB control number 1212-0044; expires September 30, 1994) for another three years. The agency estimates that
it will receive not more than 10 requests annually and that each request will take about 1/4 hour to prepare, for a total
annual burden of not more than 21/2 hours.

Approximately 21,000 advisers will incur a total of 5,049,870 burden hours annually.

Rule 6a-2 and Form 1-A allows a registered or exempt exchange to update its registration annually by filing
amendments on Form 1-A to reflect any changes in specified information contained in the registration statement
of the exchange or its accompanying exhibits that were not previously reported in an amendment. Approximately 9 national
securities exchanges will incur a total of 270 burden hours annually.

Rule 206(4)-3 sets forth the conditions in which investment advisers are permitted to pay referral fees to solicitors
of clients. Approximately 3,588 respondents will incur a total of 25,260 burden hours annually.

Rule 206(4)-4 requires advisers to disclose certain financial and disciplinary information to clients. Approximately
1,231 advisers will incur a total of 9,233 burden hours annually.

Form S-6 is used for registration of securities under the Securities Act of 1933 (1933 Act) by unit investment
trusts currently issuing securities. Approximately 11,527 respondents will incur a total of 403,445 burden hours
annually.

Rule 11a-3 regulates offers of exchange that may be made by open-end investment companies, other than insurance
company separate accounts, and their principal underwriters to their shareholders and to shareholders of other
open-end investment companies within the same group of investment companies. Approximately 3,000 respondents
will incur a total of 6,000 burden hours annually.

Rule 17f-5 permits registered management investment companies that engage in foreign securities transactions
to place their assets with eligible foreign custodians under certain specified conditions. Approximately 1,035
recordkeepers will incur a total of 5,105 burden hours annually.

Direct general comments to the Desk Officer for the Securities and Exchange Commission at the address below. Direct

Self-Regulatory Organizations; Notice of Filing of Proposed Rule Change by the Chicago Stock Exchange, Inc. Relating
to Utilization of Exempt Credit by Market Makers



Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''),
 notice is hereby given that on March 15, 1994, the Chicago Stock Exchange, Inc. (``CHX'' or ``Exchange'') filed with
the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'' or ``SEC'') the proposed rule change as described in Items
I, II and III below, which items have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization. The Commission is publishing
this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons.





I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change



The CHX proposes to amend Interpretation and Policy .01 of Rule 17 of Article XXXIV of the Exchange's Rules. The text
of the proposed rule is as follows:




Additions italicized.




Article XXXIV

Rule 17

Interpretations and Policies



.01 Utilization of Exempt Credit. Exchange Members registered as equity market makers are members registered as
specialists for purposes of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and as such are entitled to obtain exempt credit for
financing their market maker transactions. Members and/or prospective members who are anticipating becoming registered
as equity market makers as well as those clearing firms who are or will be carrying the accounts of market makers should
be aware of the following interpretation relative to the use of such credit:

1. Only those transactions initiated on the Exchange Floor qualify as market transactions. This restriction prohibits
the use of exempt credit where market maker orders are routed to the Floor from locations off the Floor.

2. Fifty per cent (50%) of the quarterly share volume which creates or increases a position in a market maker account
must result from transactions 

which are either

 consummated on the Exchange 

or sent from the Exchange Floor for execution in another market via ITS

.

3. Only those positions which have been established as a direct result of bona fide equity market maker activity qualify
for exempt credit treatment. This restriction precludes exempt credit financing based on an equity market maker
registration for positions resulting from options exercises and assignments.



II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose
of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text
of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The self-regulatory organization has
prepared summaries, set forth in Sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.



A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



1. Purpose



The proposed rule change relates to the utilization of exempt credit by market makers. Under current rules, in order
for a market maker to obtain exempt credit for the financing of its market maker transactions, fifty percent (50%)
of the quarterly share volume in its market maker account must result from transactions consummated on the Exchange.

The proposed rule change would amend this interpretation and policy under the Exchange's rules so that the fifty percent
(50%) volume test also would include orders that, although initiated on the Exchange Floor, are sent to another market
for execution via the Intermarket Trading System (``ITS''). The Exchange believes that when a market maker initiates
an order on the Exchange Floor and clears the post, the market maker should not be penalized when there is no order against
which it can be executed or when the specialist does not accept the order for placement in his book. As a result, if a market
maker clears the post, sends the order to another market via ITS and the order is executed, under the proposed rules,
that transaction would count towards the fifty percent (50%) quarterly share volume requirement.



2. Statutory Basis

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; International Securities Clearing Corporation; Order Granting Accelerated
Approval of Proposed Rule Change Relating to an Amendment to the Linkage Agreement With Japan Securities Clearing
Corporation</DOCTITLE>


June 24, 1994.


On May 26, 1994, International Securities Clearing Corporation (``ISCC'') filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission (``Commission'') a proposed rule change pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934 (``Act'').
 The Commission published notice of the proposed rule change in the 

Federal Register

 on June 10, 1994.
 No comments have been received on the notice. As discussed below, the Commission is approving the proposed rule change
on an accelerated basis.





I. Description


In 1988, ISCC entered into a linkage agreement with the Japan Securities Clearing Corporation (``JSCC'')
 which permits JSCC to obtain access through ISCC to certain services of The Depository Trust Company (``DTC'') for
U.S. shares listed on stock exchanges in Japan and included in JSCC's central depository clearing system for foreign
shares. In 1994, ISCC and JSCC entered into an amendment to the linkage agreement which permits JSCC to obtain access
through ISCC to the National Securities Clearing Corporation's (``NSCC'') New York Window (``NYW'') services for
initial public offerings (``IPOs'') of U.S. securities listed on exchanges in Japan until such time as such securities
are eligible for deposit at DTC.






Under NSCC's NYW service, JSCC gives ISCC instructions to receive securities from an underwriter.
 ISCC forwards these instructions to NSCC, which accepts the securities on behalf of ISCC. Securities received are
checked for good form and apparent negotiability and then are matched with receive instructions. Securities which
are not in good form (

i.e., 

not negotiable) or do not match receive instructions within specified tolerances are returned to ISCC. NSCC holds
these securities in its custody in vault space leased from DTC. JSCC may then provide further instructions to NSCC
via ISCC to deliver securities to parties designated by JSCC. All other securities will be delivered to DTC at such
time as these securities become eligible for deposit at DTC.




NSCC provides NYW services to ISCC under the following conditions. NSCC acts as agent for ISCC and not as principal
or for its own account. All actions taken by NSCC are based on instructions from ISCC. ISCC is not entitled to reimbursement
from NSCC for any losses suffered or liabilities incurred as a result of NYW operations. ISCC's liability to JSCC is
limited to losses resulting from a breach of their agreement caused by ISCC's gross negligence, criminal act, or willful
misconduct.
The securities held by NSCC will be used as the basis for the bookkeeping entries at JSCC. JSCC will pay to ISCC fees for
ISCC services and NSCC charges that ISCC incurs as a result of activity in the ISCC-sponsored account for JSCC. ISCC
will capture information about each transaction including, among other things: (1) The daily number of securities
delivers and receives that take place within the ISCC-sponsored account at NSCC for JSCC, (2) the quantity of shares,
by issue, for each delivery and receipt, (3) the identity of the parties delivering to NSCC and the parties to whom NSCC
delivers securities, (4) the start of day and end of day position in each issue, and (5) the identity of the JSCC party
to each transaction. In addition, ISCC will provide such information to the Commission upon request pursuant to Section
17(a)(1) of the Act.


II. Discussion


The Commission believes the proposed rule change is consistent with Section 17A of the ACt and, therefore, is approving
the proposal. Specifically, the Commission believes the proposal is consistent with Section 17A(b)(3)(F)
 of the Act in that it promotes the prompt and accurate clearance of settlement of securities transactions. NSCC's
NYW services were developed to provide a more efficient and standardized procedure for the clearance and settlement
of physical securities. Without access to the NYW services, JSCC would be required to develop its own window service,
which would be a fairly expensive venture.
 ISCC's provision of this service to JSCC enables it to settle securities transactions more efficiently and to expedite
the transfer of its securities to DTC when the securities become eligible for deposit.





In the initial order granting ISCC temporary registration as a clearing agency, the Commission stated that the development
of efficient and comparable automated national and international clearance, settlement, and payment systems is
one of the more important international goals.
 In light of the increase in foreign activity in U.S. stocks, the Commission stressed the importance of developing
clearing linkages between existing clearance and settlement systems. The amendment to the linkage agreement will
make the U.S. securities market more accessible to foreign investors by giving Japanese investors a more efficient
method of settling U.S. IPO activity.




ISCC has requested that the Commission find good cause for approving the proposed rule change prior to the thirtieth
day after the date of publication of the notice of filing. JSCC is participating in an IPO during the month of June for
which the securities will not be immediately eligible for DTC services. Without the agreement in effect, JSCC will
need to develop its own window service for the securities during the short period prior to the expiration of the customary
notice period. Due to the burdensome nature of this process, the Commission finds sufficient cause to accelerate
approval of this proposal.


III. Conclusion


For the reasons stated above, the Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with Section 17A of
the Act.
It is therefore ordered, pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act, that the proposed rule change (File No. SR-ISCC-94-02)
be, and hereby is, approved.




For the Commission by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Notice and Immediate Effectiveness of Proposed Rule Change by the National Association
of Securities Dealers, Inc. Relating to Initial Quotations of Initial Public Offerings</DOCTITLE>


June 24, 1994.


Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby
given that on June 15, 1994 the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (``NASD'' or ``Association'') filed
with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in
Items I, II, and III below, which Items have been prepared by the NASD. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit
comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons.


I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change


The NASD is proposing to implement a change to its existing practice and procedures regarding quotations and the commencement
of trading in Nasdaq securities newly listed after an initial public offering (``IPO'') that permit a five minute
quotation-only time period prior to the commencement of trading in the IPO.


II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change


In its filing with the Commission, the NASD included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed
rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be
examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The NASD has prepared summaries, set forth in Sections (A), (B),
and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.


(A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change


The NASD is proposing to change the current policies and practices by which initial quoting and trading of new issues
are conducted in The Nasdaq Stock Market. Under the proposed change, when an IPO is first authorized for inclusion
in the Nasdaq Stock Market, the system will display the time of day when quoting in the issue may begin and a time of day
when trading in that issue may begin. Specifically, when a new security is released for trading, the window for quotations
has been set to allow market makers a period of five minutes to enter and adjust their quotations prior to the commencement
of trading. This quotation period should assist the market makers in determining the appropriate opening price.
Currently, when an IPO is authorized for trading on Nasdaq, market makers are permitted to immediately and simultaneously
enter quotations and trade on the subject security.
The proposed quotation-only period for IPOs is similar to the display of quotations that occurs prior to the opening
of the Nasdaq Stock market. As with the pre-opening quotation period that occurs daily in the Nasdaq Stock Market,
the proposed quotation-only period should provide market makers with the opportunity to adjust their quotations
and to present a better quotation when the market opens for trading. Because it may be difficult at times to accurately
gauge interest in an IPO, quotes and trades in the IPO may be subject to excessive volatility. This ``IPO Quote Window''
should permit a more orderly market to develop prior to its release for actual trading.
The NASD believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with the provisions of Section 15A(b)(6) of the Act,
which requires, among other things, that the rules of the Association remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism
of a free and open market and a national market system, and Section 15A(b)(11), which provides that the rules of the
Association relating to quotations should be designed to produce fair and informative quotations, to prevent fictitious
or misleading quotations, and to promote orderly procedures for collecting, distributing, and publishing quotations.


(B) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition


The NASD does not believe that the proposed rule change will result in any burden on competition that is not necessary
or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act, as amended.


(C) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received from Members, Participants,
or Others


Written comments were neither solicited nor received.


III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action


The foregoing rule change has become effective pursuant to Section 19(b)(3)(A) of the Act and subparagraph (e) of
Rule 19B-4 thereunder because the proposal constitutes a change to its stated practices regarding the administration
and operation of existing quotation rules. At any time within 60 days of the filing rule change if it appears to the Commission
that such action is necessary or appropriate in the public interest, for the protection of investors, or otherwise
in furtherance of the purposes of the Act.


IV. Solicitation of Comments


Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views, and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying in the Commission's
Public Reference Room. Copies of such filing will also be available for inspection and copying at the principal office
of the NASD. All submissions should refer to the file number in the caption above and should be submitted by July 21,
1994.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Philadelphia Depository Trust Company; Notice of Filing and Order Granting Accelerated
Approval of a Proposed Rule Change Concerning the PHILANET Terminal Communication System, the Voluntary Offer Instruction
Service, and the Defender Security System</DOCTITLE>



June 23, 1994.



Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
 (``Act'') notice is hereby given that on August 17, 1993 the Philadelphia Depository Trust Company (``PHILADEP'')
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items
I and II below, which Items have been prepared primarily by PHILADEP. The Commission is publishing this notice and
order to solicit comments from interested persons and to grant accelerated approval of the proposed rule change.





I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change



The purpose of the proposed rule change is to obtain permanent approval for PHILADEP's PHILANET Terminal Communication
System (``PHILANET'') and for PHILADEP's Voluntary Offer Instruction (``VOI'') service. PHILANET is an electronic
communication system linking PHILADEP to its participants. The VOI service allows participants to electronically
submit to PHILADEP's Reorganization Department through PHILANET instructions relating to voluntary corporate
actions. PHILANET and the VOI service currently are being operated as temporarily approved pilot programs. The proposal
also seeks approval of the installation of the Defender security system to PHILANET.



II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of and Statutory Basis for the Proposed Rule Change



In its filing with the Commission, PHILADEP included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed
rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be
examined at the places specified in Item IV below. PHILADEP has prepared summaries, set forth in sections (A), (B),
and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.



A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statements of the Purpose of and Statutory Basis for the Proposed Rule Change



On December 30, 1983, the Commission approved File No. SR-PHILADEP-83-03 which approved PHILANET
on a pilot basis.
 The Commission has extended its approval of the pilot program several times.
 On March 8, 1993, the VOI service was approved on a pilot basis as part of the PHILANET System.








PHILADEP states it has operated PHILANET for ten years without experiencing any instances of unauthorized system
access. PHILADEP continues to monitor the adequacy of current safeguards and to implement additional safeguards
as necessary to minimize the risk of unauthorized access. PHILADEP has recently installed the Defender access management
system, a dial-back data communications security program. Defender protects against unauthorized dial-up access
to PHILANET and the VOI service by verifying that only authorized users from authorized locations have access. To
access PHILANET, a participant must dial the Defender system and enter an assigned identification number. Defender
then verifies the identification number and the time-of-day restrictions and dials the authorized location for
that participant. Defender secures all dial-up lines (synchronous and asynchronous) of the PHILANET system. Audit
records are generated for all accesses and configuration changes, and Defender incorporates the audit information
into reports and graphs which assist in operating and maintaining proper security.



B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition



PHILADEP does not believe that PHILANET, the VOI service, or Defender will impose any inappropriate burden on competition.



C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received from Members, Participants
or Others



No comments on the proposal have been solicited or received.



III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action



Sections 17A(b)(3) (A) and (F) of the Act require that a clearing agency be organized and its rules designed to promote
the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of securities transactions and to assure the safeguarding of securities
and funds which are in the custody or control of the clearing agency or for which it is responsible.
 The proposal enhances PHILADEP's capacity to facilitate the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of securities
transactions by providing participants with the ability to electronically communicate with PHILADEP. PHILANET
along with the VOI service has enhanced securities processing, has reduced paper processing, and has reduced the
use of tape transmissions. As a result, PHILADEP has been able to reduce the risk of data loss and delays in receiving
and transmitting data. The Defender security system program should help prevent unauthorized access to PHILANET
and VOI.





PHILADEP has requested and the Commission finds good cause for approving the proposed rule change prior to the thirtieth
day after the date of publication of notice of the filing. PHILADEP has informed the Commission that PHILANET and the
VOI service have been operating satisfactorily during the pilot phase.
 The Defender system, which has been implemented and is already operating, appears to be an appropriate security measure
for PHILADEP's data communication systems. In light of the above reasons for approving the proposal, the fact that
PHILANET, VOI, and the Defender system have been operating satisfactorily for some time, and the fact that the Commission
does not expect any adverse comments, the Commission believes it is appropriate to grant accelerated approval.





IV. Solicitation of Comments



Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views, and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying in the Commission's Public Reference Section,
450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of such filing will also be available for inspection and copying
at the principal office of PHILADEP. All submissions should refer to File No. SR-PHILADEP-93-02
and should be submitted by July 21, 1994.



V. Conclusion



On the basis of the foregoing, the Commission finds that PHILADEP's proposed rule change is consistent with the Act
and in particular with Section 17A of the Act.

It is therefore ordered, pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act,
 that the proposed rule change (File No. SR-PHILADEP-93-02) be, and hereby is, approved.

and/or declaration(s), as filed or as amended, may be granted and/or permitted to become effective.


Central and South West Corporation, et al. (70-8433)



Central and South West Corporation (``CSW''), a registered holding company, and its nonutility subsidiary company
CSW Energy, Inc. (``Energy''), both located at 1616 Woodall Rodgers Freeway, P.O. Box 660164, Dallas, Texas 75202,
and its proposed nonutility subsidiary, Energy Sub (``Energy Sub'') (together, ``Applicants''), have filed an
application-declaration under Sections 6, 7, 9(a), 10, 12(b) and 32 of the Act and Rules 43, 45 and 54 thereunder.


CSW and Energy propose to form and invest in Energy Sub, a wholly owned special purpose subsidiary of Energy, in connection
with the purchase from Texasgulf, Inc. (``Texasgulf''), a nonassociate corporation, of an approximately 85 megawatt
natural gas fired generation facility, including approximately 40 acres of land (``Project'') located in or near
Wharton County, Texas. Energy Sub will develop the Project such that it will qualify as an exempt wholesale generator,
as defined in Section 32(e) of the Act (``EWG'').


Energy Sub will be incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware with an authorized capital of up to 1,000 shares
of common stock, each without par value. Energy will subscribe to all of Energy Sub's common stock at a subscription
price of $1.00 per share.

It is further proposed that Energy Sub will purchase the Project from Texasgulf, the sole owner of the Project, for
a purchase price in an amount not to exceed $11 million (``Purchase Price'') at financial closing of the purchase of
the Project (``Purchase Closing''). The Purchase Closing is anticipated to occur promptly after the Commission's
approval of the proposed transactions, expected to be in July 1994.

In addition to the Purchase Price, Energy Sub anticipates incurring costs to develop the Project. The aggregate of
such development costs will not exceed $5 million (``Development Costs''). CSW and Energy propose to fund the Purchase
Price and the Development Costs by capital contributions, loans or open account advances from CSW to Energy and from
Energy to Energy Sub. All such loans or open account advances from CSW to Energy and from Energy to Energy Sub would bear
interest at a rate per annum not in excess of CSW's weighted cost of capital and would have a final maturity not to exceed
five years.

Munitions Exports Involving the Armaments Corporation of South Africa, Ltd., a/k/a ARMSCOR, and Related Entities
and Individuals



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Department of State.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

Notice is hereby given that it shall be the policy of the Department of State to deny all export license applications
and other requests for approval involving, directly or indirectly: the Armaments Corporation of South Africa, Ltd,
a/k/a ARMSCOR, an agency of the South African Government; the Denel Group (Pty) Ltd., a/k/a DENEL, a wholly-owned
company of the South African Government; Kentron (Pty) Ltd. (KENTRON); Fuchs Electronics (Pty) Ltd. (FUCHS); William
Randy METELERKAMP. Vern DAVIS; Brian SCOTT, a/k/a ``Graham Craighness''; Bert QUINN; Johan LOMBARD; Jaco BUDRICKS;
Gerrit PRETORIUS, a/k/a ``Bull''; and, any divisions, subsidiaries, associated companies, affiliated persons,
or successor entities. This action also precludes the use in connection with such entities of any exemptions from
license or other approval included in the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) (22 CFR parts 120-130).



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

On October 31, 1991, a federal grand jury in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania returned an indictment charging
the above cited persons, except DENEL, with conspiracy to violate and violating the Arms Export Control Act (AECA).
The Department of State, therefore, has reasonable cause to believe that, during the period from 1978 through 1989,
ARMSCOR and the other cited entities have engaged in an ongoing conspiracy to export, and exported, defense articles
and defense services to the Republic of South Africa and to Iraq without the requisite license(s) or approval(s) of
the Department of State. During the period from 1978 through 1989, what is now DENEL was an integral part of ARMSCOR.
DENEL reportedly came into being in 1992, in the separation and restructuring of ARMSCOR. It is a wholly owned company
of the South African Government, operating as a commercial organization. Inasmuch as it is a successor to ARMSCOR,
DENEL is also liable for AECA and/or ITAR related violations. 



This action has been taken pursuant to sections 38 and 42 of the Arms Export Control Act (AECA) (22 U.S.C. 2778 &
2791) and sections 126.7(a) (1) and 126.7(a)(2) of the ITAR (22 CFR 126.7(a) (1) & (2)). It will remain in force
until rescinded.

Exceptions may be made to this policy on a case-by-case basis at the discretion of the Office of Defense Trade Controls.
However, such an exception would be granted only after a full review of all circumstances, paying particular attention
to the following factors: whether an exception is warranted by overriding foreign policy or national security interests;
whether an exception would further law enforcement concerns; and whether other compelling circumstances exist
which are consistent with the foreign policy or national security interests of the United States, and which do not
conflict with law enforcement concerns.

A person (as defined at 22 CFR 120.14) named in an indictment for an AECA-related violation may submit a written request
for reconsideration of the denial policy to the Office of Defense Trade Controls. Such request for reconsideration

<DOCTITLE>James M. Cox-Dayton International Airport Dayton, OH; Noise Exposure Map Notice</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Federal Aviation Administration, DOT.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) announces its determination that the revised noise exposure maps submitted
by the city of Dayton, Ohio, for James M. Cox-Dayton International Airport under the provisions of Title I of the Aviation
Safety and Noise Abatement Act of 1979 (Public Law 96-193) and 14 CFR part 150 are in compliance with applicable
requirements.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

This notice announces that the FAA finds that the noise exposure maps submitted for the James M. Cox-Dayton International
Airport are in compliance with applicable requirements of Part 150, effective June 6,1994. These maps replace the
previously accepted NEM's of September 23, 1988.



Under section 103 of the Aviation Safety and Noise Abatement Act of 1979 (hereinafter referred to as ``the Act''),
an airport operator may submit to the FAA noise exposure maps which meet applicable regulations and which depict non-compatible
land uses as of the date of submission of such maps, a description of projected aircraft operations, and the ways in
which such operations will affect such maps. The Act requires such maps to be developed in consultation with interested
and affected parties in the local community, government agencies, and persons using the airport.

An airport operator who has submitted noise exposure maps that are found by the FAA to be in compliance with the requirements
of Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) part 150, promulgated pursuant to title I of the Act, may submit a noise compatibility
program for FAA approval which sets forth the measures the operator has taken or proposes for the reduction of existing
non-compatible uses and for the prevention of the introduction of additional non-compatible uses.

The FAA has completed its review of the noise exposure maps and related description submitted by the city of Dayton,
Ohio for James M. Cox-Dayton International Airport. The specific maps under consideration are the ``1992 Noise Exposure
Map'', page I-8 and ``1997 Noise Exposure Map'', page I-9, in the submission. The FAA has determined that
these maps for James M. Cox-Dayton International Airport are in compliance with applicable requirements. This determination
is effective on June 6, 1994. The FAA's determination on an airport operator's noise exposure maps is limited to a finding
that the maps were developed in accordance with the procedures contained in appendix A of FAR part 150. Such determination
does not constitute approval of the applicant's data, information or plans, or a commitment to approve a noise compatibility
program or to fund the implementation of that program.

If questions arise concerning the precise relationship of specific properties to noise exposure contours depicted
on a noise exposure map submitted under section 103 of the Act, it should be noted that the FAA is not involved in any way
in determining the relative locations of specific properties with regard to the depicted noise contours, or in interpreting
the noise exposure maps to resolve questions concerning, for example, which properties should be covered by the provisions
of Section 107 of the Act. These functions are inseparable from the ultimate land use control and planning responsibilities
of local government. These local responsibilities are not changed in any way under part 150 or through the FAA's review
of noise exposure maps. Therefore, the responsibility for the detailed overlaying of noise exposure contours onto
the map depicting properties on the surface rests exclusively with the airport operator which submitted those maps,
or with those public agencies and planning agencies with which consultation is required under section 103 of the Act.
The FAA has relied on the certification by the airport operator, under  150.21 of FAR part 150, that the statutorily
required consultation has been accomplished.

Copies of the noise exposure maps and of the FAA's evaluation of the maps are available for examination at the following
locations:

<DOCTITLE>Pilot Briefings Concerning VFR Operating Procedures in the Boston Class B Airspace over the ``Thunderfest 1994 Powerboat
Race'' </DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT. 




</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of meeting. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This notice is announcing pilot briefings concerning Visual Flight Rules (VFR) operating procedures in the Boston
Class B airspace over the Thunderfest 1994 Powerboat Race. The race is scheduled for July 30, 1994, in Boston Harbor,
Boston, Massachusetts. The race start time is scheduled for 1:00 p.m. and is expected to last approximately 2 hours.
In the event of inclement weather on July 30, the race will start at the same time on the following day (July 31). 



The race course is located adjacent to Boston-Logan International Airport, within the Boston Class B airspace. Because
this event will take place in close proximity to the Boston-Logan International Airport, the FAA will conduct mandatory
pilot briefings for those pilots who would like to observe the event. Due to the limited airspace surrounding the race
course and the possible need to conduct search and rescue operations, the number of aircraft that will be permitted
to operate in the vicinity of the race course will be limited. Receiving one of the briefings will make a pilot eligible
to enter the Class B airspace encompassing the race course, but will not guarantee that a clearance to enter the area
will be granted. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

Meeting Procedures 



(a) The meeting will be informal in nature and will be conducted by a representative of the FAA New England Region. Representatives
from the FAA will present a formal briefing on procedures to be used during the event. At the meeting, information regarding
procedures to be used on the day of the event will be distributed. These procedures were developed by the FAA, in concert
with system user representatives. 

(b) A list of pilot's names and associated aircraft registration numbers will be compiled at the meetings. 

(c) The meeting will be open to all persons on a space-available basis. There will be no admission fee or other charges
to attend and participate. 

(d) The meeting will not be formally recorded. However, a list of attendees will be compiled and forwarded to Boston
Air Traffic Control Tower. 





Agenda for the Meeting 



Opening Remarks. 
Briefing on procedures that will be in effect on race day.

Test Program to Evaluate Random Drug Testing Rate



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Federal Railroad Administration (FRA), Department of Transportation (DOT).



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of Extension of Test Program.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 FRA extends an experimental program designed to evaluate the effect of different random drug testing rates on general
deterrence. In a recent notice, the Department of Transportation proposed a system which would authorize FRA to lower
the minimum random drug testing rate for railroads from 50 percent to 25 percent if the industry-wide random positive
rate is less than 1.0 percent for 2 calendar years. If the Department adopts this proposal, FRA could use existing data
from its previous annual reporting system as a basis for adjusting the minimum railroad random drug testing rate.
Extending FRA's experimental program indefinitely will allow four test railroads that have been conducting random
drug testing at a 25 percent rate to provide additional data on the relative effectiveness of the two testing rates.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 In February of 1991, the Association of American Railroads (AAR) filed a petition proposing an experimental program
that would permit a test group of railroads to conduct random drug testing at a 25 percent rate for one year, for comparison
against a group of control railroads which would continue to test at the required 50 percent rate. Data from the two
groups could then be analyzed to determine the effect of different testing rates on deterrence.



FRA agreed with the AAR that an experimental program would be useful. To create a group of test railroads, FRA granted
four railroads (three Class I freight railroads and one commuter railroad) a waiver to conduct random drug testing
at a 25 percent rate (instead of the required 50 percent rate) beginning on July 1, 1991. FRA also designated a control
group of three additional Class I freight railroads and one additional commuter railroad which would continue to
test at the 50 percent rate. FRA monitored the program by reviewing quarterly test reports submitted by the test and
control railroads.

In the program's first two years, positive test rates did not vary appreciably between the test and control groups.
Through June 30, 1993, the four test railroads conducted 19,958 random drug tests, with a positive test rate of .90
percent. The four control railroads conducted 34,121 random drug tests, with a positive rate of .85 percent. (The
positive test rate for the industry as a whole was .89 percent in 1991, .79 percent in 1992, and .72 percent in 1993).

The last three quarters of data, however, show a greater improvement in the aggregated positive test rate for the control
group, (.75 percent), than for the test group (.83). This trend suggests caution when considering further reductions
in the random drug testing rate. Railroads should also continue to use a mix of countermeasures, in addition to random
testing, to ensure deterrence.

On February 15, 1994, the Department published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking proposing to allow the operating administrations
to lower the minimum random drug testing rate from 50 percent to 25 percent if the industry-wide random positive rate
is less than 1.0 percent for 2 calendar years [59 FR 7614]. Under this proposed system, FRA could use existing data from
railroad annual reports as a basis for lowering the minimum railroad random drug testing rate to 25 percent. In light
of this notice, the AAR has requested an extension of the experimental program, currently set to expire on June 30,
1994, to allow the test railroads to continue testing at a 25 percent random rate until the Department decides whether
or not to adopt this proposal.

FRA intends to grant the AAR's request to extend the experimental program, and capture more data on the relative effectiveness
of the two testing rates. By letter, FRA will extend the current conditional waivers indefinitely. FRA will continue
to require all participating railroads to comply with its previously established protocols covering test conditions
and reporting requirements. As before, FRA reserves the right to terminate or modify the experimental program on
10 days notice if any party fails to comply with any conditions specified in the protocols, if quarterly reports indicate
a particularly serious degrading of performance by one or more of the test railroads, or if FRA finds material deficiencies
in railroad alcohol/drug program administration.

FRA does not intend to grant the AAR's proposal for a second experimental program to study the effect of further lowering
the random drug testing rate to 10 percent. As stated above, the latest data from FRA's current experimental program
shows a stronger trend of improvement in the positive test rate of the control railroads, which have continued to test
at 50 percent. Moreover, the minimum testing rate should be set at that point which balances the value of additional
deterrence against the increased cost of testing. As mentioned above, the Department has already considered this
issue, and has proposed to lower the random drug testing rate to 25 percent if an industry achieves a positive test rate
of less than 1.0 percent for two years. FRA's current experimental rate of 25 percent is consistent with the Department's
proposal, and is not excessively burdensome in view of the residual rate of drug use in the rail industry. FRA therefore
believes that an additional, separate rail experimental program to study the effect of a 10 percent rate is unnecessary,
and will so notify the AAR by letter.

NOFA for Consolidated Technical Assistance for 
Community Planning and Development (CPD) Programs 

 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Office of the Assistant Secretary for Community Planning and Development, HUD.


</AGENCY>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This notice (NOFA) announces the availability of four Community Planning and Development (CPD) Technical Assistance
(TA) programs. By announcing the funding for four programs in one NOFA, HUD's goal is to simplify the requirements
of its Community Planning and Development Programs and to streamline the Technical Assistance application process.



This NOFA announces the availability of $51 million in TA funds from four separate technical assistance programs:
Supportive Housing (SH) TA, HOME TA, Community Housing Development Organization (CHDO) TA and Community Development
Block Grant (CDBG) TA. These funds are available for eligible applicants in support of individual program objectives
and cross-cutting and coordinated approaches to improving the effective use of these program funds. 
The funding of these four TA programs through a single NOFA will not affect the ability of eligible applicants to seek
TA funding. Eligible applicants are able, as they have been in the past, to apply for funding under as few as one, and
as many as four, separate TA programs, individually or collectively, singularly or in combination. The specific
provisions of the four separate CPD TA programs have not been changed. The NOFA reflects the statutory requirements
and differences in the four different TA programs. As a result, this new application procedure will not affect the
way individual TA programs function. 
In the body of this NOFA is information concerning: 
(a) The purpose and background of the NOFA, and the funding level provided through this NOFA; 
(b) Eligible applicants and activities, factors for award, and statutory and cooperative agreement requirements;
and 
(c) The application requirements and steps involved in the application process.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Paperwork Reduction Act Statement 


The information collection requirements contained in this NOFA have been approved by the Office of Management and
Budget, under section 3504(h) of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501-3520), and assigned OMB
Control Number 2535-0084. 


I. Background; Purpose; Authority; Amount Allocated 


(A) Background 


HUD's Office of Community Planning and Development (CPD) is consolidating and simplifying the submission requirements
of its formula grant programs to offer local jurisdictions a better ability to shape these and other available resources,
into effective, coordinated, neighborhood and community development strategies to revitalize and physically,
socially and economically strengthen their communities. To complement this overall consolidation and simplification
effort, CPD has designed this NOFA to increase access for technical assistance to CPD grantees, potential grantees
and program participants in the CDBG, HOME, Supportive Housing and CHDO assistance programs. This NOFA places heavy
emphasis upon coordination of technical assistance activities to provide greater flexibility and responsiveness
in meeting the community development and housing needs, including the housing needs of homeless populations in local
jurisdictions, while providing greater flexibility to TA providers in the delivery of assistance services. 
The new application procedures presented in this NOFA will simplify the TA process, promote cost savings, eliminate
duplication, improve the system for potential grantees in need of assistance, and allow interested applicants to
seek to deliver a wider, more integrated array of TA services.

The selection criteria are designed to select the best qualified TA providers in each specific program area who are:

(a) skilled in providing a variety of technical assistance services which address often multi-faceted and complex
problems; (b) knowledgeable about local programs and institutions in the geographic areas they propose to serve;
and (c) willing to work with other TA providers to bring the essential programs together, so that available housing
resources, services for the homeless and community and economic development resources can more effectively address
community problems.
In some instances, HUD may select a single organization to provide TA for all CPD programs within a given geographic
area. In other instances several, including qualified consortia of technical assistance providers, may be selected.
Where appropriate, HUD may select multiple TA providers to work within a single geographic area. HUD encourages TA
providers to work together to coordinate, and to the maximum extent possible, join their activities to form a seamless
and comprehensive program of technical assistance for the geographic area they are assisting. 
All selected TA providers, with the exception of some national TA providers, will be required to work under the direction
of the local HUD Field offices which have jurisdiction over the geographic areas which the provider will serve. All
geographically-based work plans must be approved by the local HUD Field Office(s) before they are implemented, and
progress reports must be submitted to the relevant Field Office on a minimum quarterly basis. HUD headquarters shall
maintain oversight responsibilities for all awards to ensure continuity and that all areas of the country are fully
served by those organizations selected as TA providers. National TA providers conducting activities that do not
involve specific geographic areas, such as publications and national training sessions, will be managed by HUD Headquarters
or its designee. 


(B) Purpose 


The purpose of this NOFA is to: 
(1) Strengthen the abilities of State and local governments and non-profit organizations to make more effective
use of CPD grant and related programs through coordinated neighborhood and community development strategies to
revitalize communities; 
(2) Create opportunities for strategic planning and citizen participation in a comprehensive context at the local
level; 
(3) Promote methods for developing more coordinated and effective approaches to dealing with urban problems by recognizing
the inter-connections among the underlying problems and ways to address them through the over-laying of available
HUD programs; 
(4) Promote the ability of non-profit organizations, including CHDOs and community land trusts, to develop more
effective ways of assisting communities in maintaining, rehabilitating and constructing affordable housing for
low income families; develop and implement programs to assist homeless persons and prevent homelessness; create
jobs for low-income persons; and assist CDBG, HOME, and SHP grantees to apply for and maximize the use of available
program funds; and 
(5) Recognize and make better use of the expertise that each component (supportive housing, affordable housing,
community development, economic development) and the organizations (States, local governments, non-profit and
for-profit providers) can contribute when developing the consolidated plan. 


(C) Authorities 


(1) The HOME Investment Partnerships Act (42 U.S.C. 12701-12840) 24 CFR part 92 authorizes the Department to
set aside $25 million of the total HOME Program appropriation for FY 1994 for community housing partnership activities
and $22 million for support for State and local housing strategies. 
(2) The Community Development Block Grant Technical Assistance Program, authorized under Title I of the Housing
and Community Development Act of 1974, (42 U.S.C. 5301-5320; Sec. 7(d), Department of Housing and Urban Development
(42 U.S.C. 3535(d); 24 CFR 570.402.), has several purposes and encompasses several programs. 
(3) The Supportive Housing Program is authorized under 42 U.S.C. 11389; 42 U.S.C. 3535(d); 24 CFR 583.140.

(D) Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance Numbers 


The Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance numbers for the four technical assistance programs under this NOFA are:

(1) Supportive Housing Technical Assistance: 14.231 
(2) HOME Technical Assistance: 14.239 
(3) Community Housing Development Organization (CHDO) Technical Assistance: 14.239 
(4) Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) Technical Assistance: 14.227. 


(E) Amount Allocated 


This NOFA announces the availability of $51 million in TA funds from four separate technical assistance programs:
Supportive Housing (SH) TA, HOME TA, Community Housing Development Organization (CHDO) TA and Community Development
Block Grant (CDBG) TA. The funds provided are as follows:

 

CDBG TA funds: $7,500,000 
CHDO TA funds: 25,000,000 
HOME TA funds: 13,000,000 
SH TA funds: 5,500,000



Each HUD/CPD Field Office has been allocated a ``fair-share'' of TA funds for purposes of this competition. (See Appendix
A to this NOFA.) The amounts are based on allocations of HOME and CDBG funds among the States and other factors designed
to represent the approximate TA workload in each jurisdiction. These amounts are only for guidance purposes to applicants
in developing their program budgets by Field Office jurisdiction and are not the exact amounts to be awarded in each
area or to each provider. The total amount to be awarded to any provider will be determined by HUD based upon the size
and needs of the provider's service area within each Field Office jurisdiction in which the provider is selected to
operate, the funds available for that area, the number of other awardees selected in that area, and the scope of the
technical assistance to be provided. Additionally, HUD may reduce the amount of funds allocated for Field Office
jurisdictions to fund national TA providers and other TA providers for activities which cannot be budgeted or estimated
by Field Office jurisdiction. HUD may require selected applicants, as a condition of funding, to provide coverage
on a geographically broader basis than applied for in order to supplement or strengthen the intermediary network
in terms of the location (service area), types and scope of technical assistance proposed.
To the extent permitted by funding constraints, HUD intends to provide coverage of as full a range as possible of eligible
TA activities of each TA program in each Field Office jurisdiction. To achieve this objective, HUD will fund the highest
ranking providers that bring the required expertise in one or more specialized activity areas, and fund portions
of providers' proposed programs in which they have the greatest skill and capability for given geographic areas or
on a national basis. It also may require national, multi-jurisdictional, or other providers to provide coverage
to Field Office jurisdictions which cannot otherwise receive cost-effective support from a TA provider. In selecting
applicants for funding, in addition to the ranking factors, HUD will apply program policy criteria identified in
Section IV(B) of this NOFA to select a range of providers and projects that would best serve program objectives for
each program serviced by the TA funded under this NOFA.
Cooperative Agreements will be for a period of up to 36 months. However, HUD reserves the right to terminate awards
in accordance with provisions contained in OMB Circulars A-102, A-110 and 24 CFR part 85 anytime after
12 months. HUD also reserves the right to withdraw funds from a specific provider, if HUD determines that the urgency
of need for the assistance is greater in other Field Office jurisdictions or the demand for assistance is not commensurate
with the award for assistance. In addition, HUD reserves the right, using either funds that have been withdrawn from
providers, future appropriations or other available appropriations, to provide additional resources to funded
applicants that perform well and can demonstrate a need for the additional funds, and to extend the performance period
of individual awardees up to a total of 12 additional months.
In cases where an applicant selected for funding under this NOFA currently is providing TA under an existing CPD TA
grant/cooperative agreement, HUD reserves the right to adjust the start date of funding under this NOFA to coincide
with the conclusion of the previous award, or to incorporate the remaining activities from the previous award into
the new agreement, adjusting the funding levels as necessary.


(F) General Program Requirements 


(1) 

Statutory Requirements

. All applicants must meet and comply with all statutory and regulatory requirements applicable to the TA program
for which they are chosen in order to be awarded a cooperative agreement. (Appendices C, D, E and F to this NOFA contain
copies of applicable regulations.) 
(2) 

Profit/Fee

. No increment above cost, no fee nor profit, may be paid to any recipient or subrecipient of an award under this NOFA.

(3) 

Statement of Work

. After selection for funding but prior to award, each applicant must ensure that any deletions, additions or enhancements
to the Statement of Work submitted in the application are incorporated into the approved grant, including details
of how the approved Statement of Work will be accomplished. Following a task-by-task format, the approved Statement
of Work must: 
(a) Delineate the tasks and sub-tasks involved in each program for which the grantee is responsible within each Field
Office jurisdiction.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940630-2-00166 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940630-2-00128 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(b) Indicate the sequence in which the tasks are to be performed, noting areas of work which must be performed simultaneously.

 
(c) Identify specific numbers of quantifiable end products and program improvements the TA provider aims to deliver
by the end of the cooperative agreement period, e.g., number of prospective CHDOs to be certified by Participating
Jurisdictions (PJs) as a result of TA; number of CHDOs which will submit fundable applications to PJs for the first
time as a result of TA, etc. 

(4)

 Certifications and Assurances.

 After selection for funding but prior to award, each applicant must submit signed copies of the following Assurances
and Certifications: (a) Standard Form (SF) 424-B-Assurances for Non-Construction Programs; (b) Drug-Free
Workplace Certification; (c) Certification Regarding Lobbying; Applicant/Recipient Disclosure Update Report;
(d) Certification and Disclosure Regarding Payments To Influence Certain Federal Transactions (where applicable);
and (e) CDBG Nexus Statement (where applicable). 

 (5)

 Project Management and Staff Allocation Plan.

 After selection for funding but prior to award, each applicant must submit a Project Management and Staff Allocation
Plan for carrying out the activities proposed in the Statement of Work. The Project Management Plan and Staff Allocation
submission should cover the proposed period of performance. 
 
(6) 

Financial Management and Audit Information. 

After selection for funding but prior to award, each applicant must submit a certification from an Independent Public
Accountant or the cognizant government auditor, stating that the financial management system employed by the applicant
meets prescribed standards for fund control and accountability required by OMB Circular A-110 for Institutions
of Higher Education and other Non-Profit Institutions, OMB Circular A-133 for other non-profit organizations,
or 24 CFR part 85 for States and local governments, or the Federal Acquisition Regulations (for all other applicants).
The information should include the name and telephone number of the independent auditor, cognizant Federal auditor,
or other audit agency as applicable. 
 
(7)

 Demand/Response Delivery System.

 All awardees must operate within the structure of the demand/response system described in this section. They must
coordinate their plans with, and operate under the direction of, each HUD Field Office within whose jurisdictions
they are operating. When so directed by a Field Office, they will coordinate their activities instead through a lead
TA provider or other organization designated by the Field Office. 
 
If selected as the lead TA provider in any Field Office jurisdiction, the awardee must coordinate the activities of
other TA providers selected under this NOFA under the direction of the HUD Field Office. Joint activities by TA providers
may be required. 

Under the demand/response system, TA providers will be required to: 
 
(a) Market the availability of their services to existing and potential clients. 
 
(b) Respond to requests for assistance from the HUD Field Office(s) with oversight of the geographic service area
for which the technical assistance will be delivered. CHDOs, HOME PJs, CDBG and Supportive Housing grantees may request
assistance from the TA provider directly, but such requests must be approved by the local HUD Field Office. 

(c) Advise grantees of their responsibility to provide economic opportunities for low- and very low-income persons
under new regulations to be issued in 24 CFR part 135 implementing section 3 of the Housing and Urban Development Act
of 1968, as amended by the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992. TA providers are encouraged to make program
grantees and TA recipients aware of the existence of the new section 3 regulations and their responsibilities under
these regulations. Since section 3 applies to many of the program areas for which TA services are being provided, TA
providers should encourage TA recipients to facilitate the employment of, and award of contracts to, low- and very
low-income persons. Section 3 applies to housing construction, housing rehabilitation and other public construction
activities. The new section 3 regulations issued under 24 CFR part 135 are expected to be published in the 

Federal Register

 on or about June 30, 1994.

(d) Conduct a Needs Assessment to identify the type and nature of the assistance needed by the recipients of the assistance.
The needs assessment should identify the nature 
of the problem to be addressed by the technical assistance services; the plan of action to address the need including
the type of technical assistance services to be provided, the duration of the service, the staff assigned to provide
the assistance, anticipated products and/or outcomes, and the estimated cost for the provision of services; and
the relationship of the proposed services to the planned or expected Consolidated Plan submission to HUD and to other
technical assistance providers providing service within the locality. 
 
(e) Obtain approval for the technical assistance delivery plan from the HUD Field Office(s) with oversight for the
area in which service will be provided. 
 
(f) Work cooperatively with other TA providers in their geographic areas to ensure that clients are provided with
the full range of TA services needed and available. TA providers are expected to be knowledgeable about the range of
services available from other providers, make referrals and arrange visits by other TA providers when appropriate,
and carry out TA activities concurrently when it is cost-effective and in the interests of the client to do so. HUD Field
Offices may direct TA providers to conduct joint activities. 
(g) CDBG TA providers will be expected to obtain designation as technical assistance providers by the chief executive
officers of each community within which they are working as required by 24 CFR 570.402(c)(2). CHDO TA providers will
be responsible for securing a technical assistance designation letter from a PJ stating that a CHDO or prospective
CHDO to be assisted by the provider is a recipient or intended recipient of HOME funds and indicating, at its option,
subject areas of assistance that are most important to the PJ. 

(h) When conducting training sessions as part of its TA activities, TA providers will be expected to: (1) Make provision
for professional videotaping of the workshops/courses as directed by the GTR and ensure their production in a professional
and high-quality manner suitable for viewing by other CPD clients; (2) design the course materials as ``step-in''
packages so that a Field Office or other TA provider may separately give the course on its own; and (3) arrange for joint
delivery of the training with Field Office participation when so requested by the Field Office. 
 
(i) Report to the HUD Field Office(s) with oversight of the geographic area(s) in which TA services are provided. At
a minimum, this reporting shall be on a quarterly basis unless otherwise specified in the approved TA action plan.

 
(j) HUD Field Offices will be active participants in the delivery of all technical assistance by funded providers
throughout the term of the cooperative agreement. HUD Field Offices may modify funded providers' responsibilities
to adjust to the demand for assistance, or its internal ability to provide effective oversight. HUD Field Offices
may also establish technical assistance coordinator roles through a funded TA provider or other entity, or perform
this role themselves. 
 
(k) Where appropriate or requested by HUD Field Offices, HUD Headquarters staff will serve as active participants
in the delivery of technical assistance by funded providers, serving in such roles as Cooperative Agreement Officers,
Government Technical Representatives, coordinators, etc., as needed. 

(6)

 CHDO Pass-Through Funds.

 TA providers proposing pass-through grants are required to: 

(a) Establish written criteria for selection of CHDOs receiving pass-through funds which includes the following:

 
(i) Participating jurisdictions (PJs) must designate them as CHDOs. 
 
(ii) Generally, the organizations should not have been in existence more than 3 years. 

(b) Enter into an agreement with the CHDO that the agreement and pass-through funding may be terminated at the discretion
of the Department if no written legally binding agreement to provide assistance for a specific housing project 
(for acquisition, rehabilitation, new construction or tenant-based rental assistance) has been made by the PJ with
the CHDO within 24 months of receiving the pass-through funding. (See 24 CFR 92.300(e).)

II. Eligible Applicants 
 

The eligible applicants for each of the four TA programs are listed below. Many organizations are eligible to apply
for more than one TA program and are encouraged to do so to the extent they have the requisite experience, expertise
and capability. 
 All applicant organizations must have demonstrated experience in providing TA in a geographic area larger than a

single city or county and must propose to serve an area larger than a single city or county. Additionally, an organization
may not provide assistance to itself, and any organization funded to assist CHDOs under this NOFA may not act as a CHDO
itself within its service area while under award with HUD. 
 A consortium of organizations may apply for one or more TA programs, but HUD will require that one organization be designated
as the legal applicant, where legally feasible. Where one organization cannot be so designated for all proposed activities,
HUD may execute more than one cooperative agreement with the members of a consortium. 
 All applicants must meet minimum statutory eligibility requirements for each TA program for which they are chosen
in order to be awarded a cooperative agreement. (See Appendices C, D, E, and F to this NOFA for copies of applicable regulations.)

 All eligible TA providers may propose assistance using in-house staff, consultants, sub-contractors and sub-recipients,
and networks of private consultants and/or local organizations with requisite experience and capabilities. Whenever
possible, applicants should make use of technical assistance providers located in the Field Office jurisdiction
receiving services. This draws upon local expertise and persons familiar with the opportunities and resources available
in the area to be served while reducing travel and other costs associated with delivering the proposed technical assistance
services. 


(A) CDBG and Supportive Housing Eligible Applicants 
 

(1) States and units of general local government. 
 (2) Public and private non-profit or for-profit groups, including educational institutions and area-wide planning
organizations, qualified to provide technical assistance on CDBG programs or Supportive Housing projects. 


(B) CHDO Eligible Applicants 
 

Public and private non-profit intermediary organizations that customarily provide services (in more than one community)
related to affordable housing or neighborhood revitalization to CHDOs or similar organizations that engage in community
revitalization, including all eligible organizations under 24 CFR 92.302(b)(1)(v) and (b)(2). An intermediary
will be considered as a primarily single state technical assistance provider if it can document that more than 50 percent
of its past activities in working with CHDOs or similar nonprofit and other organizations (on the production of affordable
housing or revitalization of deteriorating neighborhoods and/or the delivery of technical assistance to these
groups) was confined to the geographic limits of a single state. 


(C) HOME Eligible Applicants 
 

(1) A for-profit or non-profit professional and technical services company or firm that has demonstrated capacity
to provide technical assistance services; 
 (2) A HOME participating jurisdiction (PJ) or agency thereof; 
 (3) A public purpose organization responsible to the chief elected official of a PJ and established pursuant to state
or local legislation; 
 (4) An agency or authority established by two or more PJs to carry out activities consistent with the purposes of the
HOME program; 
 (5) A national or regional non-profit organization that has membership comprised predominantly of entities or officials
of entities of PJs or PJs' agencies or established organizations. 


III. Eligible Activities 


(A) General. 


Eligible activities for each of the four TA programs are listed in the program regulations. (See Appendices C, D, E,
and F to this NOFA for copies of applicable regulations.) Any and all eligible activities for each TA program may be
proposed as part of an applicant's TA program. For the Supportive Housing TA program, this means that TA must be provided
to help supportive housing applicants, prospective applicants, and/or recipients involved in supportive housing
plan, develop, administer, implement, and evaluate their supportive housing projects or proposed projects; implement
linkages between assisted supportive housing projects and other activities (including linkages involved in continuum
of care comprehensive planning); and/or evaluate their supportive housing project's effectiveness at establishing
a continuum of care. 
Applicants should pay special attention to eligible activities related to the Factors for Award contained in Section
IV(A) of this NOFA.

<TEXT>
 

(B) Sub-Grants/Pass-Through Funds



Applicants may propose to make sub-grants to achieve the purposes of their proposed TA programs in accordance with
program requirements in Section I(E) of this NOFA. In the case of CHDO TA, these sub-grants (also called ``pass-through''
funds) may be made for eligible activities and to eligible entities as identified in 24 CFR 92.302(c) (1), (2), (6),
and (7). When CHDO TA sub-grants are made to CHDOs, two statutory provisions apply: (1) the sub-grant amount, when
combined with other capacity building and operating support available through the HOME program, cannot exceed the
greater of 50 percent of the CHDO's operating budget for the year in which it receives the funds, or $50,000 annually;
(2) an amount not exceeding 10 percent of the total funds awarded for the ``Women in the Homebuilding Professions''
eligible activity may be used to provide materials and tools for training such women. 



IV. Factors for Award 



(A) Ranking Factors 
 

Applications will be evaluated competitively and ranked against all other applicants that have applied for the same
TA program (CDBG, HOME, CHDO and Supportive Housing). There will be separate rankings for each TA program, and applicants
will be ranked only against others that have applied for the same TA program. The factors and maximum points for each
factor are provided below. The maximum number of points for each TA program is 100. 
 Rating of the ``applicant'' or the ``applicant's organization and staff'', unless otherwise specified, will include
any sub-contractors, consultants, sub-recipients, and members of consortia which are firmly committed to the project.

 
(1) Potential effectiveness of the application in meeting needs of target groups/localities and accomplishing
project objectives for each TA program for which funds are requested (40 points). In rating this factor, HUD will consider
the extent to which the proposal: (a) identifies high priority needs and issues to be addressed for each TA program
for which funding is requested; (b) outlines a clear & effective plan for addressing those needs and aiding a broad
diversity of eligible client/beneficiary groups, including those which traditionally have been under-served;
(c) identifies creative and promising ways of carrying out eligible activities which will result in better or less
costly service to TA clients; (d) identifies creative activities to assist eligible clients in participating in
the development of, and improving, local consolidated plans and comprehensive strategies; (e) identifies creative
ways to assist clients in achieving the economic development and continuum of care objectives of local consolidated
plans & comprehensive strategies OR of creating linkages between activities they are assisting and activities
to achieve these objectives; (f) identifies specific numbers of quantifiable end products and program improvements
the TA provider aims to deliver by the end of the cooperative agreement period, (e.g., number of prospective CHDOs
to be certified by PJs as a result of TA; number of CHDOs which will submit fundable applications to PJs for the first
time as a result of TA; etc. 
 (2) Soundness of approach (20 points). In rating this factor, HUD will consider the extent to which the proposal: 
(a) Provides a technically and cost effective plan for designing, organizing, and carrying out the proposed technical
assistance within the framework of the Demand/Response System; 
(b) Demonstrates an effective and creative plan for working in partnership with all other CPD TA providers in each
Field Office jurisdiction in which it will operate, coordinating and conducting joint activities under the direction
of the Field Office or its designee; 
(c) Provides for full geographic coverage, including urban and rural areas, (directly or through a consortium of
providers) of a single state or Field Office jurisdiction or is targeted to address the needs of rural areas, minority
groups or other under-served client groups. 
 (3) Capacity of the applicant and relevant organizational experience (30 points). In rating this factor, HUD will
consider the extent to which the proposal demonstrates: 
(a) Recent, relevant and successful experience of the applicant's organization and staff in providing technical
assistance in all eligible activities and to all eligible entities for the TA program(s) applied for, as described
in the regulations (see appendices to this NOFA); 
(b) The experience and competence of key personnel in managing complex, multi-faceted or multi-disciplinary programs
which require coordination with other TA entities or multiple, diverse units in an organization; 
(c) The applicant has the skills and knowledge to aid grantees in the development of Consolidated Submissions for
CPD programs, comprehensive plans and planning processes and citizen participation activities; 
(d) The applicant has a working knowledge of, and established relationships with, key public bodies and private organizations
involved in CPD programs in the geographic areas in which it proposes to serve;

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940630-2-00170 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940630-2-00128 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(e) The applicant has sufficient personnel or access to qualified experts or professionals to deliver the proposed
level of technical assistance in each proposed service area in a timely and effective fashion. 

(4) Transferability of results (10 POINTS). In rating this factor, HUD will consider the extent to which the applicant
proposes a feasible, creative plan, which uses state of the art or new promising technology, to transfer models and
lessons learned in each of its TA program's activities to clients in other TA programs. 



 Selection Process 



Once scores are assigned, all applications will be listed in rank order for each TA program for which they applied.
All applications for the CDBG TA program will be listed in rank order on one list, all applications for the CHDO TA program
will be listed in rank order on a second list, all applications for the HOME TA program will be listed in rank order on
a third list, and all applications for the Supportive Housing TA program will be listed in rank order on a fourth list.
Under this system, a single application from one organization for all four TA programs could be assigned different
scores and different rankings for each program. 

Applications will be funded in rank order for each TA program by Field Office jurisdiction, except for national providers
and others which cannot be ranked by Field Office jurisdiction. National providers and others will be ranked separately
and funded in rank order for each TA program. Irrespective of final scores, HUD may apply the following criteria to
select a range of providers and projects that would best serve program objectives for each program serviced by the
TA funded under this NOFA: geographic distribution and diversity of methods, approaches or kinds of projects. HUD
will apply these program policy criteria to: 

(1) Ensure compliance with all statutory and regulatory requirements of each TA program; 

(2) Select providers that bring expertise in one or more specialized activity areas to strengthen or supplement the
intermediary network in terms of the location (service area), types and scope of technical assistance provided;


(3) Ensure adequate geographic coverage of urban and rural areas to maximize the number and diversity of clients served;


(4) Ensure an adequate representation of approaches used by small and large TA providers or providers with special
skills; 

(5) Ensure coverage of TA services for minorities; women, particularly women in the homebuilding professions under
24 CFR 92.302(c)(7); the disabled; homeless; persons with AIDS and others with special needs; and rural areas. 

Additionally, HUD reserves the right to adjust funding levels for each applicant for each TA program as follows: 

(1) Pursuant to 24 CFR 92.302(d) (1) and (2) of the HOME regulations, funding to any single eligible nonprofit intermediary
organization seeking to provide CHDO TA, whether as an independent or joint applicant, is limited to the lesser of
20 percent of all funds (i.e., $5 million), or an amount not to exceed 20 percent of the organization's operating budget
for any one year (not including funds sub-awarded or passed through the intermediary to CHDOs); 

(2) Reduce the amount of funding for an application based upon the appropriateness of the proposed activities or to
meet statutory requirements; not fund all or portions of the activities proposed in an application; and/or determine
an appropriate amount of funds for proposed activities. 

(3) Award additional funds to organizations designated as lead TA providers as discussed in Sections I(E) and I(F)
of this NOFA; 

(4) Adjust funding levels for any provider based upon the size and needs of the provider's service area within each
Field Office jurisdiction in which the provider is selected to operate, the funds available for that area, the number
of other awardees selected in that area, or funds available on a national basis for providers that will be operating
nationally, and the scope of the technical assistance to be provided; 

(5) To negotiate increased grant awards with applicants approved for funding if HUD requests them to offer coverage
to geographic areas for which they did not apply or budget, or if HUD receives an insufficient amount of applications.

<TEXT>
 

Additionally, if funds remain after funding the highest ranking applications, HUD may fund part of the next highest
ranking application. If the applicant turns down the grant offer, HUD will make the same determination for the next
highest ranking application. 

If funds remain after all selections have been made, remaining funds may be made available for other TA program competitions.

Corrections To Deficient Applications 


After the deadline, applicants have a 14 day cure period to correct technical deficiencies in the applications. Technical
deficiencies relate only to items that would not improve the substantive quality of the application relative to the
ranking factors such as a failure to submit a required certification. Applicants will have 14 calendar days from the
date HUD notifies the applicant of any problem to submit the appropriate information in writing to HUD. Notification
of a technical deficiency shall be made in writing. 


VII. Other Matters 


Environmental Review


In accordance with 40 CFR 1508.4 of the regulation of the Council on Environmental Quality and 24 CFR 50.20 (b) of the
HUD regulations, the policies and procedures contained in this rule relate only to the provisions of technical assistance
and therefore are categorically excluded from the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act. 


Federalism Impact


The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under section 6(a) of the Executive Order 12612, 

Federalism

, has determined that the policies contained in this notice will not have substantial direct effects on States or their
political subdivisions, or the relationship between the Federal government and the States, or on the distribution
of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. As a result, the notice is not subject to review
under the Order. The NOFA will fund technical assistance to promote the ability of eligible recipient organizations
to assist low-income families in accordance with the program requirements of the programs for which assistance is
to be provided as identified in this NOFA. No substantial impacts on States or their political subdivisions are anticipated
as a result of the provision of technical assistance services under this NOFA. 


Impact on the Family


The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under Executive Order 12606, 

The Family

, has determined that this notice will have a beneficial, although indirect, impact on family formation, maintenance,
and general well-being. The technical assistance provided as a result of an award under this NOFA will promote the
ability of eligible applicants to meet the requirements and program objectives of the programs identified as eligible
for technical assistance services under this NOFA. Accordingly, since the impact on the family is beneficial and
indirect, no further review is considered necessary. 


Section 102 of the HUD Reform Act: Documentation and Public Access Requirements; Applicant/Recipient Disclosures



Documentation and Public Access Requirements


HUD will ensure that documentation and other information regarding each application submitted pursuant to this
NOFA are sufficient to indicate the basis upon which the assistance was provided or denied. This material, including
any letters of support, will be made available for public inspection for a five-year period beginning not less than
30 days after the award of assistance. Material will be made available in accordance with the Freedom of Information
Act (5 U.S.C. 552) and HUD's implementing regulations at 24 CFR part 15. In addition, HUD will include the recipients
of assistance pursuant to this NOFA in its quarterly 

Federal Register

 notice of all recipients of HUD assistance awarded on a competitive basis. (See 24 CFR 12.14 (a) and 12.16 (b), and the
notice published in the 

Federal Register

 on January 16, 1992 (57 FR 1942), for further information on these documentation and public access requirements).



Disclosures


HUD will make available to the public for five years all applicant disclosure reports (HUD FORM 2880) will be made available
along with the applicant disclosure reports, but in no case for a period of less than three years. All reports_both
applicant disclosures and updates_will be made available in accordance with the Freedom of Information Act part
15, subpart C, and the notice published in the 

Federal Register

 on January 16, 1992 (57 FR 1942), for further information on these disclosure requirements. 


Section 103 of the HUD Reform Act


HUD's regulation implementing section 103 of the HUD Reform Act is codified as 24 CFR part 4, and applies to the funding
competition announced today. The requirements of the rule continue to apply until the announcement of the selection
of successful applicants. 
HUD employees involved in the review of applications and in the making of funding decisions are restrained by part
4 from providing advance information to any person (other than an authorized employee of HUD) concerning funding
decisions, or from persons who apply for assistance in this competition should confine their inquiries to the subject
areas permitted under 24 CFR part 4. 
Applicants who have questions should contact the HUD Office of Ethics (202) 708-3815 (voice/TDD). (This is
not a toll-free number). The Office of Ethics can provide information of a general nature to HUD employees, as well.
However, a HUD employee who has specific program questions, such as whether a particular subject matter can be discussed
with persons outside the Department, should contact his or her Regional or Field Office Counsel, or Headquarters
counsel of the program to which the question pertains. 


Section 112 of the HUD Reform Act


Section 112 of the HUD Reform Act added a new section 13 to the Department of Housing and Urban Development Act (42 U.S.C.
3537b). This new section 13 contains two provisions dealing with efforts to influence HUD's decisions with respect
to financial assistance. The first imposes disclosure requirements on those who are typically involved in these
efforts_ those who pay others to influence the award of assistance or the taking of a management action by the Department
and those who are paid to provide the influence. The second restricts the payment of fees to those who are paid to influence
the award of HUD assistance, if those fees are tied to the number of housing units received or are based upon the amount
of assistance received, or if they are contingent upon the receipt of assistance. 
Section 13 is implemented by 24 CFR part 86. If readers are involved in any efforts to influence the Department in these
ways, they are urged to refer to the regulations, particularly the examples contained in Appendix A to this NOFA. 
Any questions about the rule should be directed to the Office of Ethics, Room 2158, Department of Housing and Urban
Development, 451 7th Street SW., Washington, D.C. 20410-3000. Telephone: (202) 708-3815 (Voice/TDD).
(This is not a toll-free telephone number. Forms necessary for compliance with the rule may be obtained from the local
HUD Field. 


Prohibition Against Lobbying Activities


The use of funds awarded under this NOFA is subject to the disclosure requirements and prohibitions of section 319
of the Department of Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 1990 (31 U.S. C. 1352) ( the ``Byrd
Amendment'') and the implementing regulations at 24 CFR part 87. These authorities prohibit recipients of Federal
contracts, grants or loans from using appropriated funds for lobbying the Executive or Legislative branches of the
federal government in connection with a specific contract, grant or loan. The prohibition also covers the awarding
of contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, or loans unless the applicant has made an acceptable certification
regarding lobbying.

HOME Program Regulations Relating to the provision of Technical 
Assistance to Community Housing Development Organizations (CHDOs)
[The the definition of ``community housing development organization'' in  92.2, and the text of   92.300
and 92.302 are republished for informational purposes.] 


 92.2 Definitions. 




Community housing development organization 

means a private nonprofit organization that 
(1) Is organized under state or local laws; 
(2) Has no part of its net earnings inuring to the benefit of any member, founder, contributor, or individual; 
(3) Is neither controlled by, nor under the direction of, individuals or entities seeking to derive profit or gain
from the organization. A community housing development organization may be sponsored or created by a for-profit
entity, but: 
(i) The for-profit entity may not be an entity whose primary purpose is the development or management of housing, such
as a builder, developer, or real estate management firm. 
(ii) The for-profit entity may not have the right to appoint more than one-third of the membership of the organization's
governing body. Board members appointed by the for-profit entity may not appoint the remaining two-thirds of the
board members; and 
(iii) The community housing development organization must be free to contract for goods and services from vendors
of its own choosing; 
(4) Has a tax exemption ruling from the Internal Revenue Service under section 501(c) of the Internal Revenue Code
of 1986; 
(5) Does not include a public body (including the participating jurisdiction). An organization that is State or locally
chartered may qualify as a community housing development organization; however, the State or local government may
not have the right to appoint more than one-third of the membership of the organization's governing body and no more
than one-third of the board members may be public officials. Board members appointed by the State or local government
may not appoint the remaining two-thirds of the board members; 
(6) Has standards of financial accountability that conform to Attachment F of OMB Circular No. A-110 (Rev.)
``Standards for Financial Management Systems.'' 
(7) Has among its purposes the provision of decent housing that is affordable to low-income and moderate-income persons,
as evidenced in its charter, articles of incorporation, resolutions or by-laws; 
(8) Maintains accountability to low-income community residents by_
(i) Maintaining at least one-third of its governing board's membership for residents of low-income neighborhoods,
other low-income community residents, or elected representative of low-income neighborhood organizations. For
urban areas, ``community'' may be a neighborhood or neighborhoods, city, county or metropolitan area; for rural
areas, it may be a neighborhood or neighborhoods, town, village, county, or multi-county area (but not the entire
State); and 
(ii) Providing a formal process for low-income, program beneficiaries to advise the organization in its decisions
regarding the design, siting, development, and management of affordable housing;
(9) Has a demonstrated capacity for carrying out activities assisted with HOME funds. An organization may satisfy
this requirement by hiring experienced accomplished key staff members who have successfully completed similar
projects, or a consultant with the same type of experience and a plan to train appropriate key staff members of the organization;
and 
(10) Has a history of serving the community within which housing to be assisted with HOME funds is to be located. In general,
an organization must be able to show one year of serving the community (from the date the participating jurisdiction
provides HOME funds to the organization). However, a newly created organization formed by local churches, service
organizations or neighborhood organizations may meet this requirement by demonstrating that its parent organization
has at least a year of serving the community. 


 92.300 Set-aside for community housing development organizations (CHDOs). 


(a) For a period of 24 months after the allocation (including, for a state, funds reallocated under  92.451(c)(2)(i)
and, for a unit of general local government, an allocation transferred from a state under  92.102(b)) is made
available to a participating jurisdiction, the participating jurisdiction must reserve not less than 15 percent
of these funds for investment only in housing to be developed, sponsored, or owned by community housing development
organizations. The funds must be provided to a community housing development organization and the funds are reserved
when a participating jurisdiction enters into a written agreement with the community housing development organization.
If a community housing development organization's involvement in a project is as an owner it must have control of the
project, as evidenced by legal title or a valid contract of sale. If it owns the project in partnership, it or its wholly
owned for-profit subsidiary must be the managing general partner. In acting in any of the capacities specified, the
community housing development organization must have effective management control. 
(b) Each participating jurisdiction must make reasonable efforts to identify community housing development organizations
that are capable, or can reasonably be expected to become capable, of carrying out elements of the jurisdiction's
approved housing strategy and to encourage such community housing development organizations to do so. If during
the first 24 months of its participation in the HOME Program a participating jurisdiction cannot identify a sufficient
number of capable CHDOs, up to 20 percent of the minimum CHDO set-aside of 15 percent specified in paragraph (a) of this
section, above, (but not more than $150,000 during the 24 month period) may be expended to develop the capacity of CHDOs
in the jurisdiction. 
(c) Up to 10 percent of the HOME funds reserved under this section may be used for activities specified under  92.301.

(d) HOME funds required to be reserved under this section are subject to reduction, as provided in  92.500(d).

(e) If funds for operating expenses are provided under  92.206(g) to a community housing development organization
that is not also receiving funds under paragraph (a) of this section for housing to be developed, sponsored or owned
by the community housing development organization, the participating jurisdiction must enter into a written agreement
with the community housing development organization that provides that the community housing development organization
is expected to receive funds under paragraph (a) of this section within 24 months of receiving the funds for operating
expenses, and specifies the terms and conditions upon which this expectation is based.

(f) Limitation. A community housing development organization may not receive HOME funding for any fiscal year in
an amount that provides more than 50 percent or $50,000, whichever is greater, of the community housing development
organization's total operating expenses in that fiscal year. This includes organization support and housing education
provided under  92.302 (c)(1), (c)(2), and (c)(6), as well as funds for operating expenses provided under  92.206(g)
and administrative funds provided under  92.206(f) (if the community housing development organization is
a subrecipient or contractor of the participating jurisdiction).

maintain, rehabilitate and construct housing for low-income and moderate-income families in conformance with
the requirements of this part; and 

(3) To achieve the purposes under paragraphs (a) (1) and (2) of this section by helping women who reside in low- and moderate-income
neighborhoods rehabilitate and construct housing in the neighborhoods. 

(b) 

Delivery of assistance. 

HUD will provide assistance under this section only through contract_

(1) With a nonprofit intermediary organization that, in the determination of HUD_

women for apprenticeship training in construction or administering programs for training for construction or other
nontraditional occupations (in which women constitute 25 percent or less of the total number of workers in the occupation);
or 

(2) With another organization, if a participating jurisdiction demonstrates that the organization is qualified
to carry out eligible activities and that the jurisdiction would not be served in a timely manner by intermediaries
specified under paragraph (b)(1) of this section. Contracts under paragraph (b)(2) of this section must be for activities
specified in an application from the participating jurisdiction. The application must include a certification
that the activities are necessary to the effective implementation of the participating jurisdiction's approved
housing strategy. 

(c) 

Eligible activities.

(1) 

Organizational support. 

Organizational support assistance may be made available to community housing development organizations to cover
operational expenses and to cover expenses for training and technical, legal, engineering and other assistance

Housing education assistance may be made available to community housing development organizations to cover expenses
for providing or administering programs for educating, counseling, or organizing homeowners and tenants who are
eligible to receive assistance under other provisions of this part. 

(3) 

Program-wide support of nonprofit development and management. 

Technical assistance, training, and continuing support may be made available to eligible community housing development
organizations for managing and conserving properties developed under this part. 

(4) 

Benevolent loan funds. 

Technical assistance may be made available to increase the investment of private capital in housing for very low-income

to developers of low-income housing and to low-income homebuyers. 

(5) 

Community development banks and credit unions. 

Technical assistance may be made available to establish privately owned, local community development banks and
credit unions to finance affordable housing. 

(6) 

Community Land Trusts (CLTs). 

HOME funds may be made available to CLTs for organizational support, technical assistance, education and training,

(ii) Is established, and undertakes activities to: 

(A) Acquire parcels of land, held in perpetuity, primarily for conveyance under long-term ground leases; 

(B) Transfer ownership of any structural improvements located on such leased parcels to the lessees; and

rehabilitation of housing in low- and moderate-income areas to assist women residing in the area to obtain jobs involving
such activities. This might include facilitating access by women to, and providing, apprenticeship and other training
programs regarding non-traditional skills, recruiting women to participate in such programs, providing support
for women at job sites, counseling and educating businesses regarding suitable work environments for women, providing
information to such women regarding opportunities for establishing small housing construction and rehabilitation
businesses. Up to ten percent of the funds made available for this activity may be used to provide materials and tools
for training such women. 

(d) 

Limitations. 

Contracts under this section with any one contractor for a fiscal year may not_

(1) Exceed 20 percent of the amount appropriated for this section for such fiscal year; or

Appendix F 


CDBG Technical Assistance Program Regulations, 
24 CFR 570.402 

[The text of  570.402 is republished for informational purposes.] 


 570.402 Technical assistance awards. 



(a) 

General.

 (1) The purpose of the Community Development Technical Assistance Program is to increase the effectiveness with
which States, units of general local government, and Indian tribes plan, develop, and administer assistance under
Title I and section 810 of the Act. Title I programs are the Entitlement Program (24 CFR part 570, subpart D); the section
108 Loan Guarantee Program (24 CFR part 570, subpart M); the Urban Development Action Grant Program (24 CFR part 570,
subpart G); the HUD-administered Small Cities Program (24 CFR part 570, subpart F); the State-administered Program
for Non-Entitlement Communities (24 CFR part 570, subpart I); the grants for Indian Tribes program (24 CFR part 571);
and the Special Purpose Grants for Insular Areas, Community Development Work Study and Historically Black Colleges
and Universities (24 CFR part 570, subpart E). The section 810 program is the Urban Homesteading Program (24 CFR part
590). 

(2) Funding under this section is awarded for the provision of technical expertise in planning, managing or carrying
out such programs including the activities being or to be assisted thereunder and other actions being or to be undertaken
for the purpose of the program, such as increasing the effectiveness of public service and other activities in addressing
identified needs, meeting applicable program requirements (e.g., citizen participation, nondiscrimination,
OMB Circulars), increasing program management or capacity building skills, attracting business or industry to
CDBG assisted economic development sites or projects, assisting eligible CDBG subrecipients such as neighborhood
nonprofits or small cities in how to obtain CDBG funding from cities and States. The provision of technical expertise
in other areas which may have some tangential benefit or effect on a program is insufficient to qualify for funding.


(3) Awards may be made pursuant to HUD solicitations for 
assistance applications or procurement contract proposals issued in the form of a publicly available document which
invites the submission of applications or proposals within a prescribed period of time. HUD may also enter into agreements
with other Federal agencies for awarding the technical assistance funds: 

(i) Where the Secretary determines that such funding procedures will achieve a particular technical assistance
objective more effectively and the criteria for making the awards will be consistent with this section; or 

(ii) The transfer of funds to the other Federal agency for use under the terms of the agreement is specifically authorized
by law. The Department will not accept or fund unsolicited proposals. 
 

(b) 

Definitions.

 (1) 

Areawide planning organization (APO)

 means an organization authorized by law or local agreement to undertake 
planning and other activities for a metropolitan or non-metropolitan area. 

(2) 

Technical assistance

 means the facilitating of skills and knowledge in planning, developing and administering activities under Title
I and section 810 of the Act in entities that may need but do not possess such skills and knowledge, and includes assessing
programs and activities under Title I.

Urban Homesteading program by the chief executive officer of each unit to be assisted, unless the assistance is limited
to conferences/workshops attended by more than one unit of government. 

(d) 

Eligible Activities.

 Activities eligible for technical assistance funding include: 

(1) The provision of technical or advisory services; 

(2) The design and operation of training projects, such as workshops, seminars, or conferences; 

(3) The development and distribution of technical materials and information; and 

(4) Other methods of demonstrating and making available skills, information and knowledge to assist States, units
of general local government, or Indian Tribes in planning, developing, administering or assessing assistance under
Title I and Urban Homesteading programs in which they are participating or seeking to participate. 

(e) 

Ineligible Activities.

 Activities for which costs are ineligible under this section include: 

(1) In the case of technical assistance for States, the cost of carrying out the administration of the State CDBG program
for non-entitlement communities; 
 

(2) The cost of carrying out the activities authorized under the Title I and Urban Homesteading programs, such as the
provision of public services, construction, rehabilitation, planning and administration, for which the technical
assistance is to be provided; 

(3) The cost of acquiring or developing the specialized skills or knowledge to be provided by a group funded under this
section; 

(4) Research activities; 

(5) The cost of identifying units of governments needing assistance (except that the cost of selecting recipients
of technical assistance under the provisions of paragraph (k) is eligible); or 

(6) Activities designed primarily to benefit HUD, or to assist HUD in carrying out the Department's responsibilities;
such as research, policy analysis of proposed legislation, training or travel of HUD staff, or development and review
of reports to the Congress. 

(f) 

Criteria for Competitive Selection.

 In determining whether to fund competitive applications or proposals under this section, the Department will use
the following criteria: 
 
(1) For solicited assistance applications. The Department will use two types of criteria for reviewing and selecting
competitive assistance applications solicited by HUD: 


(i) Evaluation Criteria:

 These criteria will be used to rank applications according to weights which may vary with each 
competition: 

(A) Probable effectiveness of the application in meeting needs of localities and accomplishing project objectives;


(B) Soundness and cost-effectiveness of the proposed approach; 

(C) Capacity of the applicant to carry out the proposed activities in a timely and effective fashion; 
 

(D) The extent to which the results may be transferable or applicable to other title I or Urban Homesteading program

participants. 

(ii) 

Program Policy Criteria:

 These factors may be used by the selecting official to select a range of projects that would best serve program objectives
for a particular competition: 

(A) Geographic distribution; 

(B) Diversity of types and sizes of applicant entities; and 

(C) Diversity of methods, approaches, or kinds of projects. 

The Department will publish a Notice of Fund Availability (NOFA) in the 

Federal Register

 for each competition indicating the objective of the technical assistance, the amount of funding available, the
application procedures, including the eligible applicants and activities to be funded, any special conditions
applicable to the solicitation, including any requirements for a matching share or for commitments for CDBG or other
title I funding to carry out eligible activities for which the technical assistance is to be provided, the maximum
points to be awarded each evaluation criterion for the purpose of ranking applications, and any special factors to
be considered in 
assigning the points to each evaluation criterion. The Notice will also indicate which program policy factors will
be used, the impact of those factors on the selection process, the justification for their use and, if appropriate,
the relative priority of each program policy factor. 

(2) For competitive procurement contract bids/proposals. The Department's criteria for review and selection of
solicited 
bids/proposals for procurement contracts will be described in its 
public announcement of the availability of an Invitation for Bids 
(IFB) or a Request for Proposals (RFP). The public notice, 
solicitation and award of procurement contracts, when used to acquire technical assistance, shall be procured in
accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (48 CFR chapter 1) and the HUD Acquisition Regulation (48 CFR
chapter 24). 

(g) 

Submission Procedures.

 Solicited assistance applications shall be submitted in accordance with the time and place and content requirements
described in the Department's NOFA. Solicited bids/proposals for procurement contracts shall be submitted in accordance
with the requirements in the IFB or RFP. 

(h) 

Approval Procedures.

 (1) 

Acceptance.

 HUD's acceptance of an application or proposal for review does not imply a commitment to provide funding.

(2) 

Notification. 

HUD will provide notification of whether a project will be funded or rejected.

(3) 

Form of award. 

(i) HUD will award technical assistance funds as a grant, cooperative agreement or procurement contract, consistent
with this section, the Federal Grant and Cooperative Agreement Act of 1977, 31 U.S.C. 6301-6308, the HUD Acquisition
Regulation, and the Federal Acquisition Regulation.

(ii) When HUD's primary purpose is the transfer of technical assistance to assist the recipients in support of the
Title I or Section 810 programs, an assistance instrument (grant or cooperative agreement) will be used. A grant instrument
will be used when substantial Federal involvement is not anticipated. A cooperative agreement will be used when substantial
Federal involvement is anticipated. When a cooperative agreement is selected, the agreement will specify the nature
of HUD's anticipated involvement in the project.

(iii) A contract will be used when HUD's primary purpose is to obtain a provider of technical assistance to act on the
Department's behalf. In such cases the Department will define the specific tasks to be performed. However, nothing
in this section shall preclude the Department from awarding a procurement contract in any other case when it is determined
to be in the Department's best interests.

(4) 

Administration. 

Project administration will be governed by the terms of individual awards and relevant regulations. As a general
rule, proposals will be funded to operate for one to two years, and periodic and final reports will be required.

(i) 

Environmental and Intergovernmental Review. 

The requirements for Environmental Reviews and Intergovernmental Reviews do not apply to technical assistance
awards.

(j) 

Selection of Recipients of Technical Assistance. 

Where under the terms of the funding award the recipient of the funding is to select the recipients of the technical
assistance to be provided, the funding recipient shall publish, and publicly make available to potential technical
assistance recipients, the availability of such assistance and the specific criteria to be used for the selection
of the recipients to be assisted. Selected recipients must be entities participating or planning to participate
in the Title I or Urban Homesteading programs or activities for which the technical assistance is to be provided.
