Commodity Credit Corporation









General Price Support Regulations for Grain, Rice, and Oilseeds for 1993 and Subsequent Crop Years 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Commodity Credit Corporation, USDA. 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Interim rule with request for comments. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This interim rule amends the regulations with respect to the price support loan programs for grains and similarly
handled commodities, including oilseeds (canola, mustard seed, rapeseed, safflower seed, soybeans, and sunflower
seed), which are conducted by the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) in accordance with the Agricultural Act of 1949,
as amended (the 1949 Act), and other acts. The amendments made by this interim rule will provide greater clarity, enhance
the administration of CCC programs by providing uniformity between CCC price support programs, eliminate obsolete
provisions, provide more authority to State and county committees in administering the programs, lessen the administrative
actions CCC imposes on producers who violate the loan and loan deficiency payment (LDP) agreements, and correct errors.




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

Executive Order 12866 



This rule has been determined to be not-significant for purposes of Executive Order 12866 and therefore has not been
reviewed by OMB. 



Federal Assistance Program 



The title and number of the Federal Assistance Program, as found in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance, to
which this rule applies are Commodity Loans and Purchases_10.051. 



Regulatory Flexibility Act 



It has been determined that the Regulatory Flexibility Act is not applicable because the CCC is not required by 5 U.S.C.
553 or any other provision of law to publish a notice of proposed rulemaking with respect to the subject matter of these
determinations. 



Environmental Evaluation 



It has been determined by an environmental evaluation that this action will have no significant impact on the quality
of human environment. 



Executive Order 12372 



This program is not subject to the provisions of Executive Order 12372, which requires intergovernmental consultation
with State and local officials. See the Notice related to 7 CFR part 3015, subpart V, published at 48 FR 29115 
(June 24, 1983). 



Executive Order 12778 



This interim rule has been reviewed pursuant to Executive Order 12778. To the extent State and local laws are in conflict
with these regulatory provisions, it is the intent of CCC that the terms of the regulations prevail. The provisions
of this interim rule are not retroactive. Prior to any judicial action in a court of competent jurisdiction, administrative
review under 7 CFR part 780 must be exhausted. 



Paperwork Reduction Act 



Public reporting burden for the information collections contained in this regulation with respect to price support
programs is estimated to average 
15 minutes per response, including the time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering
and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collections of information. The information collections
have previously been cleared under the current regulations by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and assigned
OMB Nos. 0560-0087 and 
0560-0129. In accordance with the provisions of 44 U.S.C. 35, the information collection requirements that
are revised as a result of this rule will be resubmitted to OMB for review. 



Comments 



Since producers are currently making decisions regarding commodities which may be pledged as collateral for CCC
price support loans, the provisions of this interim rule are effective upon publication in the 

Federal Register

. Comments are requested, however, and will be taken into consideration when developing the final rule. This interim
rule will be scheduled for review so that a final document discussing comments received and any amendments required
can be published in the 

Federal Register

 as soon as possible. 



Background 



The 1949 Act sets forth the statutory authority for CCC price support programs. CCC price support programs are intended
to stabilize market prices and provide interim financing to producers to assist in the orderly marketing of eligible
commodities. 

This interim rule amends regulations found at 7 CFR part 1421 to provide rules for administering CCC price support
programs for the 1993 and subsequent crop years.

Section 1421.1 is amended to remove the reference to soybeans. Soybeans are already included because they are defined
as an oilseed in  1421.3. 

Section 1421.3 is amended to: (a) Add the reference to part 1425; (b) clarify that the definitions in this part apply
if there are any conflicts with the referenced parts; and (c) add a definition of high moisture commodities. 

This interim rule amends  1421.4(b) to add references to a receiver, guardian, or trustee which were inadvertently
omitted. In addition,  1421.4(f) is amended to remove an obsolete reference. 

Section 1421.5(b)(1) is amended to clarify the application of the provision of the paragraph to loans, purchases,
and LDP's and  1421.5(b)(4)(iv) to correct the unit of measure for peanuts to tons and hundredths of a ton. 

Section 110 of the 1949 Act sets forth the statutory authority for the farmer owned reserve (FOR) program for wheat
and feed grains. 

Producers with regular 9-month nonrecourse price support loans are eligible to enter the FOR upon maturity of the
regular loan. Producers may repay regular 
9-month loans and repledge the commodity pledged as collateral for such initial loan for a subsequent loan. Under
current program regulations, the maturity date for the subsequent loan is the same as the maturity date for the initial
9-month loan. Section 110(b)(1) of the 1949 Act provides, in part, that ``an extended loan shall only be made to a producer
after the expiration of a 9-month price support loan * * *.'' Accordingly, under current program regulations,
grain pledged as collateral for a subsequent loan is not eligible to be pledged as collateral for a FOR loan because
the grain is not placed into the FOR ``after the expiration of a 9-month price support loan''. 

This interim rule amends  1421.5(d)(2) to provide that CCC may allow producers to extend price support loans
which are less than 9 months in length because the collateral securing such loan had been previously pledged as collateral
for a price support loan so that the maturity date for such subsequent loan is the last day of the ninth month following
the month such subsequent loan was disbursed. This would permit producers having such a loan to enter into the FOR upon
maturity if all other eligibility requirements are met. 

This interim rule amends  1421.7 by removing paragraph (b) and redesignating paragraphs (c) and (d) as paragraphs
(b) and (c), respectively. The weed control provisions are removed because CCC has determined that weed control laws
do not affect the value of a commodity. 

In addition, this interim rule amends  1421.7(c)(1) to include rice and to remove the reference to the weed control
law discounts. Section 1421.7 is also amended to redesignate paragraph (c)(3) as (c)(4) and add a new paragraph (c)(3),
which was inadvertently omitted, which includes the method to determine the loan rate for rice based on the milling
yield. 

This interim rule amends  1421.8(b)(2) to remove an incorrect reference to the United States Warehouse Act.


This interim rule amends  1421.9(f)(2)(iv) by removing paragraph (G) to correct an error. Rice has not been
stored identity preserved for many years.
This interim rule amends   1421.9(f)(2)(xiv)(B)(

5

)(

v

) and 1421.18(b)(15)(ii)(G) to correct the terminology that the sunflower seed must pass through a 14/64
'
' round hole screen. 

This interim rule amends  1421.11(a) to correct a typographical error. 

Provisions for taking administrative offsets are provided in part 3 of this title and part 1403 of this chapter. Accordingly,
this interim rule removes and reserves  1421.14. 

This interim rule amends  1421.16 (a) and (c) to include applicable references to Forms CCC-666, CCC-666
LDP, CCC-678, and CCC-709 and to remove incorrect references to Forms CCC-700 and CCC-701.


Producers who violate the loan note and security agreement by moving farm-stored loan collateral from the structures
designated for the storage of such loan collateral, without prior written consent of the county committee, are subject
to liquidated damages. In some cases, the collateral is moved to other structures on the farm which makes it possible
for CCC to perfect its security on such collateral. CCC has determined that when such security can be established,
producers should not be subject to such liquidated damages. Accordingly, this interim rule amends  1421.16(b)(2)
to clarify that unauthorized removal only includes cases where CCC cannot obtain the first lien on the collateral.


It is difficult to prove the amount of damages to CCC for loan and LDP violations committed by producers; however, 20
and 50 percent of the loan and LDP rates, as applicable, were established for first and second violations, respectively,
when the county committee determined that the producer acted in good faith. CCC has determined that the liquidated
damages can be reduced without affecting the administration of the loan and LDP programs. Accordingly, this interim
rule amends  1421.16 to: (a) Decrease the liquidated damages amounts; and (b) add paragraph (q) to provide that
any or all of the liquidated damages may be waived under certain conditions. 

In addition, under certain conditions, producers who violate loan and LDP provisions may be denied loans and LDP's
on commodities stored on the farm. CCC has determined that this penalty is severe and should only be assessed when the
county committee determines that such action is necessary to protect the interests of CCC. Accordingly, in  1421.16,
paragraphs (d) and (e) have been amended to remove the requirement for denial of farm-stored loans or LDP's and paragraphs
(k) and (l) have been amended to clarify that producers must pay the liquidated damages assessed and such amounts cannot
be repaid with a commodity certificate under the provisions of part 1470 of this chapter. 

Section 1421.17 provides requirements for farm-stored commodities. 
Section 1421.17 is amended as follows: (a) Paragraph (a) has been amended to clarify that the reduced quantity for
loan shall be the mortgaged loan quantity; 
(b) paragraph (c)(1) has been amended to clarify that, when farm-stored loans are transferred from the farm to warehouse
storage, the warehouse-stored quantity cannot exceed 110 percent of the loan quantity transferred from the farm-stored
loan; (c) paragraph (c)(3) has been amended to correct a reference; and (d) paragraph (e) has been amended to include
a reference to Form CCC-709 which was omitted.

This interim rule amends  1421.18 to correct the following errors: (a) paragraph (b)(12)(iv)(B) has been amended
to correct the spelling of ``green''; (b) paragraph (b)(13)(iv)(D) has been amended to correct punctuation; and
(c) paragraph (b)(13)(iv)(D)(

5

) has been amended to correct the spelling of ``inconspicuous.''

This interim rule amends  1421.19(b) to correct the spelling of ``Form.''

This interim rule amends  1421.20 as follows: (a) paragraph (a)(2) to correct two references; and (b) to add
paragraph (e) to provide if a producer moves a commodity from storage without prior approval on a nonworkday, the producer
will not be subject to administrative actions providing the producer notifies the county office on the next workday
that the commodity has been moved and such movement is approved by CCC.

Section 1421.22 provides the settlement provisions of price support loans. This interim rule amends  1421.22
as follows: (a) Paragraph (c)(3)(i)(A) to correct the percentage of foreign material for peanuts; (b) paragraph
(c)(4) to remove references to location differentials for rice because such reference is obsolete; and (c) to add
paragraphs (e) through (i) to include provisions that: (1) CCC may pay to producers the cost for hauling commodities
delivered to CCC beyond the producer's normal delivery point, (2) producers may deliver commodities to CCC directly
to rail cars, (3) producers will receive storage credit for commodities delivered or forfeited to CCC in advance of
the loan maturity date, and (4) producers will receive credit for prepaid warehouse charges for receiving and loading
out for commodities delivered or forfeited to CCC.

Section 1421.29 provides the provisions for LDP's. Section 1421.29 is amended as follows: (a) paragraph (b)(3) removes
references to obsolete forms and corrects an incorrect reference; (b) paragraphs (c) and (g) adds references to rice
for clarity; and (c) paragraph (h) is removed and paragraph (i) is redesignated as paragraph (h). This provision was
included to allow producers delivering commodities to a buyer directly after harvest an opportunity to file for a
LDP on the day such commodities were harvested and delivered. This required producers to report deliveries to the
county office before the next loan repayment rate announcement. Since this provision was implemented, CCC developed
a more workable procedure that allows producers to request LDP's in advance of harvest and delivery with the LDP rate
based on the loan repayment rate announced and in effect on the day the commodity is delivered to the processor, buyer,
warehouse, or cooperative according to redesignated  1421.29(h). Accordingly, the provisions in removed
paragraph (h) are no longer needed.

This interim rule amends  1421.202 to add a reference to wheat which was inadvertently omitted and corrects
an incorrect reference.

Section 1421.205 is amended as follows: (a) paragraphs (a) and (b) clarify that a reserve loan is approved rather than
disbursed; and (b) paragraph (a)(2) clarifies the quantity for which the reserve agreement is approved.

This interim rule amends  1421.206(b) as follows: (a) removes references to grain which grades ``sample grade''
because such grain is not eligible for a FOR loan; and (b) removes the provision that corn eligible for the FOR must be
shelled corn. Currently, corn pledged as collateral for a FOR loan is restricted to shelled corn. CCC has determined
that producers of ear corn should not be denied participation in the FOR and that the quality of the grain in the FOR would
not be adversely affected if ear corn is permitted into the FOR. Accordingly, this interim rule removes the stipulation
that corn must be shelled.

Quantities of a commodity approved for FOR that are in approved storage earn storage credit and CCC pays producers
storage payments at the end of each quarterly period. Producers with commodities stored in approved warehouse storage
must pay or provide for the storage charged by the warehouse before CCC will pay the FOR storage payment. This interim
rule amends  1421.207 to clarify these provisions.

Section 1421.208 has been amended to remove a typographical error.

Section 1421.210 provides the commingling and rotation provisions for FOR loans. Accordingly,  1421.210
is amended as follows: (a) paragraph (a) clarifies the provisions that are applicable to producers who commingle
a quantity of an eligible commodity with the quantity approved for FOR; (b) paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(4) add the provision
that producers may rotate FOR loan collateral by replacing such collateral with grain from existing stocks. In the
past, producers were only allowed to use grain from their most recent harvest as replacement stocks for rotated FOR
loan collateral. CCC has determined that this requirement was unnecessary and that CCC would be at no risk by allowing
producers to use grain from their existing stocks of harvested grain from any past harvest; (c) paragraph (b)(5)(i)
corrects punctuation, paragraph (b)(5)(ii) removes an incorrect reference, and paragraph (b)(5)(iv) reduces
the percent of liquidated damages for failing to replace the rotated quantity; (d) paragraph (c)(1) removes the reference
to new grain to conform to the changes made in paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(4); (e) paragraph (c)(2) corrects a typographical
error; (f) paragraph (c)(3) clarifies that storage shall not be earned for FOR collateral released for sale by the
producer from the date of the rotation request until the replacement stocks are in place; (g) paragraph (c)(4) requires
that the producer certify to the FOR quantity that the producer is requesting CCC to release for rotation that the producer
intends to feed and clarifies that storage shall not be earned for such collateral released from the date of the rotation
request until the replacement stocks are in place; and (h) paragraph (c)(5) removes the requirement to measure and
inspect the grain to be released and the growing crop of the replacement stocks to conform to the changes made in paragraphs
(b)(2) and (b)(4), and clarifies that the replacement stocks, when such stocks are already in store on the farm, must
be inspected and measured before the release of the FOR collateral.

This interim rule amends  1421.211 to clarify that producers may repay FOR loans at any time at the marketing
loan repayment rate if such rate is in effect.

(1) When signing Form CCC-666, Farm Stored Loan Quantity Certification, when applicable, Form CCC-677,
Farm Storage Note and Security Agreement, and Form CCC-678, Warehouse Storage Note and Security Agreement,
that the producer will not: 
(i) Provide an incorrect certification of the quantity or make any fraudulent representation for loan, or 


* * * * * 


(2) When signing Form CCC-666 LDP, Loan Deficiency Payment Application and Certification, or CCC-709,
Direct Loan Deficiency Payment Agreement, as applicable, that the producer will not provide an incorrect certification
of the quantity or make any fraudulent representation for loan deficiency payment purposes. 
(3) That violation of the terms and conditions of the Form CCC-677, Form CCC-678, Form CCC-666 LDP,
or Form CCC-709, as applicable, will cause harm or damage to CCC in that funds may be disbursed to the producer
for a quantity of a commodity which is not actually in existence or for a quantity on which the producer is not eligible.

(b) * * * 
(1) Incorrect certification is the certifying of a quantity of a commodity for the purpose of obtaining a commodity
loan or a loan deficiency payment in excess of the quantity eligible for such loan or loan deficiency payment or the
making of any fraudulent representation with respect to obtaining loans or loan deficiency payments. 
(2) Unauthorized removal is the movement of any farm-stored loan quantity from the storage structure in which the
commodity was stored or structures which were designated when the loan was approved to any other storage structure
whether or not such structure is located on the producer's farm without prior written authorization from the county
committee in accordance with  1421.20, if the movement of loan collateral prevents CCC from obtaining the first
lien on such collateral. 


* * * * * 


(c) The producer and CCC agree that it will be difficult, if not impossible, to prove the amount of damages to CCC for
the violations in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section. Accordingly, if the county committee determines
that the producer has violated the terms and conditions of Form CCC-677, Form CCC-678, Form CCC-666
LDP, or Form CCC-709, as applicable, liquidated damages shall be assessed on the quantity of the commodity which
is involved in the violation. If CCC determines the producer:

involved in the violation by: 
(i) 10 percent of the loan rate applicable to the loan note or the loan deficiency payment rate for the first offense;
or 
(ii) 25 percent of the loan rate applicable to the loan note or the loan deficiency payment rate for the second offense;
or 
(2) Did not act in good faith with regard to the violation, or for cases other than the first or second offense, liquidated
damages will be assessed by multiplying the quantity involved in the violation by 25 percent of the loan rate applicable
to the loan note or the loan deficiency payment rate.

12. Section 1421.17 is amended by revising paragraphs (a), (c)(1), (c)(3), and (e) to read as follows: 



 1421.17 

Farm-stored commodities. 



(a) The quantity of a commodity which shall be used to determine the amount of a farm-stored loan shall not exceed a percentage
(the ``loan percentage''), as established by the State committee which shall not exceed a percentage established
by CCC, of the certified or measured quantity of the eligible commodity stored in approved farm storage and covered
by the note and security agreement. The quantity of a commodity pledged as security for a farm-storage loan shall be
measured or certified in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section. Farm-stored loans may be made on less than
the maximum quantity eligible for loan at the producer's request. If the loan quantity is reduced by the State committee,
the county committee, or by request of the producer, such reduced quantity shall be the mortgaged quantity on the note
and security agreement for the commodity in a bin, crib, or lot on which the loan is made. 



* * * * * 



(c) * * * 

(1) Liquidation of the farm-stored loan or part thereof shall be made through the pledge of warehouse receipts for
the commodity placed under warehouse-stored loan and the immediate payment by the producer of the amount by which
the warehouse-stored loan is less than the farm-stored loan or part thereof and charges plus interest. The loan quantity
for the warehouse-stored loan cannot exceed 110 percent of the loan quantity transferred from the farm-stored loan.




* * * * * 



(3) For loans extended in accordance with   1421.200 through 1421.217, CCC may limit the quantity for
a warehouse-stored loan to the quantity approved on the farmer owned reserve agreement loan. 



* * * * * 



(e) The quantity of a commodity pledged as security for a farm-stored loan or for which a loan deficiency payment is
requested may be determined on the basis of the quantity of the commodity which an eligible producer certifies in writing
on Form CCC-666 for a loan and Form CCC-666 LDP or CCC-709, as applicable, for a loan deficiency payment,
is eligible to be pledged as collateral and is otherwise available for loan or loan deficiency payment purposes. 



* * * * * 



13. Section 1421.18 is amended by revising paragraphs (b)(12)(iv)(B), (b)(13)(iv)(D), (b)(13)(iv)(D)(

5

), and (b)(15)(ii)(G) to read as follows:

(iv) * * * 

(B) For distinctly green seeds, 1.5 percent;

14. Section 1421.19 is amended by revising paragraph (b) to read as follows: 



 1421.19 

Liquidation of loans. 



* * * * * 



(b) If the producer desires to deliver eligible commodities to CCC in satisfaction of the loan, the producer must notify
CCC of such intention before the loan maturity date by giving written notice to the county office which disbursed the
proceeds for such loan. If the producer fails to deliver such commodities to CCC by the date specified on Form CCC-691,
Commodity Delivery Notice, and the producer subsequently redeems the commodity pledged as collateral for the loan
before delivery is completed, interest shall continue to be assessed on such amount in accordance with part 1405 of
this chapter. 



* * * * * 



15. Section 1421.20 is amended by: 

A. Revising paragraph (a)(2), and 

B. Adding paragraph (e) to read as follows:

 1421.20 

Release of the commodity pledged as collateral for a loan. 



(a) * * * 

(2) If CCC so announces, an amount less than the principal amount of the loan and charges plus interest under the terms
and conditions specified by CCC at the time the producer redeems the commodity pledged as collateral for such loan
in accordance with  1421.25. The producer may request and CCC may approve removal of a quantity of the commodity
from storage, without the payment of CCC of the loan amount, if the principal amount outstanding on such loan before
such removal does not exceed the maximum loan value of the quantity of the commodity remaining in storage after such
removal. When the proceeds of the sale of the commodity are needed to repay all or a part of a farm-stored loan, the producer
must request and obtain prior written approval of the county office on a form prescribed by CCC in order to remove a specified
quantity of the commodity from storage. Any such approval shall be subject to the terms and conditions set forth in
the applicable form, copies of which may be obtained by producers at the county office. Any such approval shall not
constitute a release of CCC's security interest in the commodity or release the producer from liability for any amounts
due and owing to CCC with respect to the loan indebtedness if full payment of such amounts is not received by the county
office. If a producer fails to repay a loan within the time period prescribed by CCC for a farm-storage loan and commodity
pledged as loan collateral has been delivered to a buyer in accordance with Form CCC-681-1, Authorization
for Delivery of Loan Collateral for Sale, such producer may not repay the loan at the level that is less than the loan
level determined in accordance with  1421.25(a)(1)(ii), (b)(2), or (d)(2). 



* * * * * 



(e) If the commodity is moved on a nonworkday from storage without obtaining prior approval to move such commodity,
such removal shall constitute unauthorized removal or disposition, as applicable, of such commodity unless the
producer notifies the county office the next workday that such commodity has been moved and such movement is approved
by CCC.




16. Section 1421.22 is amended by: 

A. Revising paragraphs (c)(3)(i)(A) and (c)(4), and 

B. Adding paragraphs (e), (f), (g), (h), and (i) to read as follows: 



 1421.22 

Settlement. 



* * * * * 



(c) * * * 

(3) * * * 

(i) * * * 

(A) $2 per ton, net weight, for each full 1 percent of foreign material in excess of 15 percent; and 



* * * * * 



(4) With respect to rice acquired by CCC at a location other than an approved warehouse, settlement shall be made on
the basis of the class, grade, and quality entries set forth in the Federal-State inspection certificate and on the
basis of the quantity set forth in the weight certificates. 



* * * * * 



(e) When a producer is directed by the county office to haul the commodity for a loan, except aromatic rice, a greater
distance than would have been necessary to make delivery to the producer's customary delivery point, as determined
by CCC, the producer will be allowed compensation, as determined by the State committee at a rate not to exceed the common
carrier truck rate or the rate available from local truckers, for hauling the eligible commodity the additional distance.
In determining the rate of payment for excess hauling, the State committee may establish reasonable mileage minimums
below which producers will not receive compensation for hauling. 

(f) (1) Producers may request trackloading for loan collateral where approved warehouse space is not available locally
or where KCCO determines that it would be to the benefit of CCC. Where local weighing facilities are not available or
when requested by producers, destination weights may be used for settlement purposes. All producers loading in the
same car must sign an agreement stating the percentage share of the total quantity to be credited to each. When requested
by producers prior to delivery of the commodity, settlement may be made on the basis of destination grades. Such destination
grade determination for a car shall be applied to the entire quantity of a commodity loaded into the same car, regardless
of the grade or quality of a commodity loaded into the car by any producer.

(2) A trackloading payment of 19 cents per bushel (or 31.66 cents per hundredweight in the case of sorghum, oilseeds,
and rice, excluding aromatic rice) shall be made to the producer on an eligible commodity delivered to CCC under this
subsection. 
(g) If a farm-stored commodity is delivered in advance of the applicable loan maturity date as provided in   1421.19
and 1421.21, a deduction for storage charges shall be made. The deduction shall be made for the period from the date
of delivery to the applicable maturity date or expiration date for the commodity. Such deduction shall be at the rate
charged by the warehouse to which the commodity was delivered. No deduction for storage charges shall be made for early
delivery of a farm-stored commodity if the loan maturity date is accelerated by CCC under a general acceleration of
the maturity date in a particular area. 
(h) A refund of warehouse storage charges will be made by CCC to the producer if the maturity date of a warehouse storage
loan is accelerated by CCC for reasons other than any wrongful act or omission on the part of the producer, and the commodity
is not redeemed. The amount of the storage charges to be refunded shall be computed at the lesser of the UGSA rate or the
rate prepaid by the producer for the period of unearned storage. 
(i) If a warehouse charges the producer for either the receiving charges or the receiving and loading out charges on
an eligible commodity in an approved warehouse, the producer shall, upon delivery to CCC of warehouse receipts representing
the commodity stored in such warehouse, be reimbursed or given credit by the county office for such prepaid charges
at the lesser of the UGSA rate or the rate prepaid by the producer. The producer must furnish to the county office, written
evidence signed by the warehouse operator that such charges have been paid.

 

17. Section 1421.29 is amended by: 
A. Revising paragraphs (b)(3), (c), and (g) to read as follows, 
B. Removing paragraph (h), and

Loan deficiency payments. 


* * * * * 


(b) * * * 
(3) File and request payment on Form CCC-666 LDP, unless the producer enters into an agreement according to paragraph
(h) of this section, for a quantity of an eligible commodity; 


* * * * * 


(c) The loan deficiency payment rate for a crop shall be the amount by which the price support loan level for the crop
exceeds the level at which CCC has announced that producers may repay their price support loans in accordance with
 1421.25. Such rate shall be the amount determined on the day the producer submits a completed request for a loan
deficiency payment to the county office. When such request is for rice and the request provides that the loan deficiency
payment rate shall be based on the date of delivery, and the documentation of delivery indicates the rice was delivered
after 3 p.m. eastern time, the loan deficiency payment rate in effect after 3 p.m. eastern time of the delivery date
shall be used. In all other cases for rice where the loan deficiency payment rate is based on the delivery date, the payment
rate in effect at 12:00:01 a.m. eastern time of the delivery date shall be used. 


* * * * * 


(g) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, on the day of the announcement of the adjusted world price,
applications for loan deficiency payments for rice that specify the payment rate will not be accepted between 
2 p.m. eastern time and the time of the world price announcement.

Length of reserve agreements. 


The length of a FOR loan shall be 27 months from the maturity date of the regular price support loan. The day following
the maturity date of the regular price support loan shall be the effective date of the FOR loan agreement. In order to
assure that producers throughout the United States are treated in a fair and equitable manner, CCC may allow extensions
of regular price support loans for wheat, corn, grain sorghum, oats, and barley which expire in or before the month
following the month of the date for such commodity as specified in 
 1421.201(b). The terms and conditions of such extension shall be provided through actual notice to affected
producers. FOR agreements may be extended by CCC, at CCC's sole discretion, at maturity for an additional six months.

 

19. Section 1421.205 is amended by revising paragraph (a) introductory text and revising paragraphs (a)(2) and (b)
to read as follows: 


 1421.205 

Quantity eligible for grain reserve loans. 


(a) Farm-stored FOR loans shall be approved on a quantity not to exceed the lesser of: 


* * * * * 


(2) The quantity upon which the disbursement of the regular price support loan was based. 
(b) Warehouse-stored FOR loans shall be approved on a quantity not to exceed the quantity shown on the warehouse receipt
or the supplemental certificate, if applicable, which secured the regular price support loan. 
20. Section 1421.206 is amended by revising paragraph (b) to read as follows: 


 1421.206

Storage rates. 


* * * * * 


(b) (1) Storage payments shall be paid quarterly, starting from the effective date of the FOR loan. Such payments shall
be paid within 30 days after the end of each quarter in which such payments are earned. Storage payments shall not be
earned when the grain which was pledged as collateral for the FOR loan is not in storage, as determined by CCC. Storage
payments shall not be earned when the 5-day adjusted market price determined in accordance with  1421.209(e)
equals or exceeds 95 percent of the current year's established price for the commodity. In such instance, no storage
payments shall be earned from the day the 5-day adjusted market price was equal to or exceeded 95 percent of such established
price through the ninetieth day following the last day on which the 5-day adjusted market price equalled or exceeded
95 percent of such established price. 
(2) * * *
(i) A FOR agreement shall not be approved until the producer provides written evidence to CCC that at least the next
year's storage, including any storage deduction applicable to the regular loan, has been paid to the warehouse or
arrangements for the payment of such storage have been made with the warehouse on the FOR loan quantity. 


* * * * * 


(iii) The eighth quarterly storage payment shall not be made until the producer provides written evidence to CCC that
storage has been paid to the warehouse or arrangements for the payment of such storage have been made with the warehouse
on the FOR quantity through the FOR loan maturity date. 


* * * * * 


22. Section 1421.208 is revised to read as follows: 


 1421.208 

Charging interest. 


FOR loans shall not accrue interest unless CCC determines that the 5-day adjusted market price determined in accordance
with  1421.209(e) for the commodity is equal to or exceeds 105 percent of the current year's established price
for such commodity. In such instance, interest shall accrue from the day the 5-day adjusted market price was equal
to or exceeded 105 percent of such established price and continue to accrue for the balance of the month following the
last day on which the 5-day adjusted market price equaled or exceeded 105 percent of such established price through
the two succeeding months. The rate of interest which shall be applicable to a FOR loan during an interest-accruing
period shall be the rate applicable to the regular price support loan as determined in accordance with part 1405 of
this chapter.

 

23. Section 1421.210 is amended by revising paragraphs (a), (b)(2), (b)(4) introductory text, (b)(4)(ii), (b)(5)(i),
(b)(5)(ii), (b)(5)(iv), (c)(1) introductory text, (c)(2), (c)(3), (c)(4), and (c)(5) to read as follows: 


 1421.210 

Commingling and replacement of wheat and feed grains. 


(a) In the case of farm-stored FOR loans, if an eligible quantity of a commodity has been commingled with an ineligible
quantity of the commodity, the commingled commodity is not eligible to be pledged as collateral for a FOR loan unless
the provisions in  1421.17 (b)(1) or (b)(2) are met. 
(b) * * * 
(2) Grain which is used to replace existing FOR loan collateral must have been produced by the producer and be eligible
to be pledged as collateral for a regular price support loan, except that compliance with the terms and conditions
of any commodity program conducted in accordance with part 1413 of this chapter on the farm on which such replacement
grain was produced is not required. Replacement loan collateral may be grain from the crop which is harvested after
the date established by the State committee in accordance with paragraph (b)(1) of this section or be grain from a producer's
existing stocks in CCC-approved farm storage. This grain must not have been purchased and must be free of any liens
or encumbrances unless waivers that fully protect the interest of CCC are obtained. With respect to wheat, such replacement
grain must be of the same class as the regular price support loan collateral. 


* * * * * 


(4) To protect the interest of CCC in the quantity of collateral to be released for replacement in accordance with paragraph
(c)(1)(i) or (c)(1)(iii) of this section, the county committee may require producers to remit payments to the CCC
before a request to replace FOR loan collateral is approved. In such cases, the amount to be remitted shall be the smaller
of:

(ii) The product of the market price available in the county office on the date that the replacement request was made,
times the quantity to be replaced, as determined by CCC. 
(5) * * * 
(i) The principal amount of the FOR loan and other charges plus interest from the disbursement date of such amount;

(ii) Storage payments made in accordance with the loan from the date the request for replacement was approved for CCC
to the disbursement date of such payments; 


* * * * * 


(iv) Liquidated damages computed by multiplying the quantity not replaced by 25 percent of the loan rate applicable
to the loan note. 
(c) (1) A producer who files a Form CCC-687-1 or CCC-681 requesting the approval to replace existing
FOR loan collateral may after approval of the request: 


* * * * * 


(2) A producer who delivers grain to a CCC-approved warehouse in accordance with paragraph (c)(1) of this section
shall cause to be delivered to CCC a warehouse receipt issued in the name of CCC with respect to such grain. The warehouse
receipt shall show that storage charges have been paid or otherwise provided for through the final date specified
to complete the replacement, and CCC shall retain control of the receipt until the producer has replaced the original
FOR loan collateral with eligible replacement grain. Except as provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, if the
producer fails to replace the grain within the approved replacement period, CCC shall take title to the warehouse
receipt without any further action by the producer and shall determine the value of the grain represented by the receipt.
This value shall be determined in accordance with  1421.22 and shall be credited to the amount owed by the producer
as determined in accordance with paragraph (b)(5) of this section. 
(3) A producer who, in accordance with paragraph (c)(1) of this section, sells the grain which is the collateral for
the FOR loan shall only sell such grain to the person specified on Form CCC-681. Storage payments shall not be
earned on the quantity rotated, as determined by CCC, from the date the rotation request is approved until the replacement
stocks are in place. To protect the interest of CCC in the quantity of collateral to be released for replacement, the
county committee may require the purchaser to make and remit to CCC a check for the full amount of the purchase. In such
instances, CCC shall make these funds available to the producer upon the replacement of the original FOR loan collateral
with eligible replacement grain if such replacement occurs prior to the final date of the approved replacement period.
Except as provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, if the producer fails to replace the grain by this date, the
producer shall forfeit the sales proceeds to CCC without any further action by the producer. Such sales proceeds shall
be credited to the amount owed by the producer as determined in accordance with paragraph (b)(5) of this section. 
(4) A producer who, in accordance with paragraph (c)(1) of this section, intends to feed such grain to the producer's
own livestock, may only feed the quantity of grain which was approved by the county committee for such purposes. The
producer must certify to the quantity the producer intends to use for feed during the approved rotation period. Storage
payments shall not be earned on the quantity rotated, as determined by CCC, from the date the rotation request is approved
until the replacement stocks are in place in CCC-approved farm storage. 
(5) Any producer who files a Form CCC-687-1 or CCC-681 with the county committee shall not remove
the existing FOR loan collateral until written approval has been made by the county committee. The producer shall
allow a representative of the county committee to inspect and measure, at the producer's expense, the quantity of
replacement grain when such replacement stocks are in place in CCC-approved farm storage. Producers who request
approval to replace existing FOR loan collateral with existing stocks in CCC-approved farm storage shall not receive
approval to remove the existing FOR loan collateral until the replacement stocks have been inspected and measured.



24. Section 1421.211 is revised to read as follows: 


 1421.211

Redemption requirements and emergency call. 


(a) A producer may redeem the commodity pledged as collateral for a FOR loan at any time by repaying the principal amount
of the FOR loan and other charges plus interest as provided in this part or, if CCC so announces, an amount less than the
principal amount of the FOR loan and other charges plus interest in accordance with  1421.25(d)(2). 
(b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this part, the Secretary may require producers to repay FOR loans prior
to the maturity date of such loans if the Secretary determines that emergency conditions exist which require that
the commodity which is serving as collateral for the FOR loan be made available in the market to meet urgent domestic
or international needs and such determination and the reasons therefore are reported to the President, the Committee
on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry of the Senate, and the Committee on Agriculture of the House of Representatives
at least fourteen days before taking such action. Repayment shall consist of the amount in accordance with paragraph
(a) of this section. If the called loan is not redeemed within the time prescribed by the Secretary, CCC may take title
to the commodity without any further action by the producer.



25. Section 1421.215 is revised to read as follows: 


 1421.215

Loss or damage to the commodity. 


The producer is responsible for any and all loss in quantity or quality of the commodity pledged for a FOR loan. CCC shall
not assume any loss in quantity or quality of the FOR farm-stored loan collateral.

Background



REA issues publications titled ``Bulletin'' which serve to guide borrowers regarding already codified policy,
procedures, and requirements needed to manage loans, loan guarantee programs, and the security instruments which
provide for and secure REA financing. REA issues standards and specifications for the construction of telephone
facilities financed with REA Loan Funds. REA is rescinding Bulletin 345-90, ``REA Specification for Totally
Filled Fiber Optic Cable, PE-90,'' and codifying this specification at 7 CFR 1755.900, REA Specification for
Filled Fiber Optic Cables.

Filled fiber optic cable is used in outside plant by REA telephone borrowers as a physical transport medium for voice
and data. The current REA Specification PE-90 limits the type of single mode fiber to dispersion-unshifted.
The limitation was established because REA borrowers' lightwave systems operate at the 1310 nanometer wavelength
for which the dispersion-unshifted fiber is optimally designed. The dispersion-unshifted single mode fiber can
also be used in lightwave systems operating at the 1550 nanometer wavelength window but with a degradation in signal
transmission. To provide REA borrowers with a quality fiber optic cable to be used in lightwave systems operating
at 1550 nanometers without signal degradation, the revised specification will include single mode dispersion-shifted
fiber as an option to single mode dispersion-unshifted fiber.

The current REA Specification PE-90 limits multimode fiber to 50/125 micrometers because at the time the specification
was written, it was the only diameter multimode fiber in existence. Since that time the fiber optic industry has developed
several multimode fiber designs of which the 62.5/125 micrometer design has become the de facto standard. Now that
62.5/125 micrometer multimode fiber is an accepted industry standard, the revised specification will include the
62.5/125 multimode fiber as an option to the 50/125 multimode fiber.

The current REA Specification PE-90 does not include a self-supporting aerial fiber optic cable because when
the specification was written, no such cable design existed. Since issuance of the current specification, fiber
optic cable manufacturers have developed such cable designs. These designs have been installed in operating telephone
systems and are providing satisfactory field performance. The installation cost of self-supporting aerial fiber
optic cable is less than the installation cost of lashed aerial fiber optic cable. To provide REA borrowers with a less
costly aerial fiber optic cable installation, the revised specification will include a section on self-supporting
aerial fiber optic cable.

The current specification includes only end product requirements associated with filled fiber optic cable utilizing
only dispersion-unshifted single mode fibers and 50/125 micrometers multimode fibers and lashed aerial fiber optic
cables. Since the revised specification will allow dispersion-shifted single mode fibers, 62.5/125 micrometers
multimode fibers, and self-supporting aerial fiber optic cables, end product requirements have been included to
assure quality products for these applications.

This action establishes REA requirements for a wider range of filled fiber optic cables without affecting current
designs or manufacturing techniques. This widened selection of cables will afford REA telephone borrowers the opportunity
to increase subscriber services in an economical and efficient manner through enhanced cable designs brought about
by technological advancements made during the past seven years.

Comments



On September 1, 1993, REA published a proposed rule (58 FR 46097) to rescind REA Bulletin 345-90, REA Specification
for Totally Filled Fiber Optic Cable, PE-90, and to codify the revised specification at 7 CFR 1755.900, REA Specification
for Filled Fiber Optic Cables. Comments on this proposed rule were due by October 1, 1993. Comments and recommendations
were received from several companies by this due date. The comments, recommendations, and responses are summarized
as follows:

One respondent commented that the language in paragraphs (a)(1)(i) through (a)(1)(iv) of 7 CFR 1755.900 should be
changed to reflect fiber optic cable designs currently being used by REA borrowers.



Response: 

REA reviewed the proposed language submitted by the commenter and as a result of our review will change the present
language in paragraphs (a)(1)(i) through (a)(1)(iv) of 7 CFR 1755.900 to the language proposed by the commenter.

One respondent commented that the language ``twenty-four colors'' in paragraph (a)(2) of the specification should
be changed to ``twelve colors'' because the Electronic Industries Association/Telecommunications Industries
Association (EIA/TIA) 598 Standard, Color Coding of Fiber Optic Cables, defines twelve standard colors with black
and yellow striping used to expand identification up to twenty-four colors.



Response: 

Since the EIA/TIA 598 Standard allows for identification of twenty-four fibers using a twenty-four color coding
scheme that is identical to the twenty-four color coding scheme specified in 7 CFR 1755.900, REA will not change the
language ``twenty-
four colors'' to the commenter proposed language of ``twelve colors.''

Three respondents commented that the issue dates of the Electronic Industries Association (EIA) and the Electronic
Industries Association/Telecommunications Industries Association (EIA/TIA) Standards referenced in paragraphs
(a)(8) and (a)(9) of the specification should be changed to reflect their current issue dates.



Response: 

REA agrees with the commenters recommendations and will change paragraphs (a)(8) and (a)(9) of the specification
to reflect the current issue dates of the EIA and EIA/TIA Standards.

One respondent commented that the mode-field diameter requirement of 7.5

#

1.3 micrometers for dispersion-shifted single mode fibers specified in paragraph (b)(4) of the specification will
eliminate the use of their currently manufactured dispersion-shifted single mode fiber by REA borrowers.



Response: 

Since it is not REA's intent to eliminate the use of dispersion-shifted single mode fibers which are currently manufactured
and used on non-REA telecommunication systems with satisfactory results, REA will change the mode-field diameter
requirement for dispersion-shifted single mode fibers from 7.5

#

1.3 micrometers to 7.5+1.5 micrometers/^1.3 micrometers to allow use of the manufacturer's dispersion-shifted
single mode fiber by REA borrowers.

Two commenters recommended that paragraph (b)(14) of the specification which requires that all optical fibers in
any single length of cable of the same type be eliminated from the specification because it would deny REA borrowers
the opportunity of purchasing hybrid cables which contain both single mode and multimode fibers.



Response: 

In reviewing past REA 515 Contracts containing fiber optic cables, REA borrowers never purchased hybrid cables containing
both single mode and multimode optical fibers. Review of current REA 515 Contracts reveal that REA borrowers are still
not purchasing these hybrid fiber optic cables. In fact REA borrowers only purchase single mode fiber optic cables.
Since there is no current interest by REA borrowers in purchasing hybrid cables containing both single mode and multimode
optical fibers, REA at this time will not eliminate paragraph (b)(14) from the specification as recommended by the
commenters.

Two respondents commented on the shrinkback test to be performed on both loose tube and tight tube buffers. The first
respondent indicated that tight tube buffers containing the optical fibers cannot meet criterion specified in the
specification. The second respondent recommended that the shrinkback test be eliminated from the specification
because they consider this test to be a cable component test and not a completed cable performance test.



Response: 

In regard to the first commenter's comment, REA has no data from other manufacturers indicating that tight tube buffers
containing the optical fibers cannot comply with the shrinkback requirement of the specification. In addition the
respondent did not provide test data as to what the requirement should be for tight tube buffers containing the optical
fibers. Finally paragraph (c)(6) of the specification allows the manufacturer the option of removing the optical
fibers from the tight tube buffers prior to performance of the shrinkback test. Since the respondent did not provide
an alternative requirement and the fact that the specification allows for removal of the fibers from the buffer tubes
prior to shrinkback testing, REA will not change the shrinkback requirement specified in the specification.

Regarding the second respondent's comment, REA considers the shrinkback test for loose and tight tube buffers to
be a completed cable performance test because the shrinkback test provides REA with one means of assuring that the
buffer tubes can withstand the rigors of the field cable splicing operation. Since REA considers the performance
of the buffer tubes to be a critical requirement of the field cable splicing operation, REA will not eliminate the shrinkback
test from the specification as recommended by the respondent.

One respondent recommended that the cold bend test for loose and tight tube buffers be eliminated from the specification
because they consider this test to be a cable component test and not a completed cable performance test. The same respondent
also recommended that if REA maintained the cold bend test that the mandrel diameter be changed from 5 times the tube
diameter to 10 times the tube diameter.



Response: 

REA considers the cold bend test for loose and tight tube buffers to be a completed cable performance test because the
cold bend test provides REA with one means of assuring that the buffer tubes can withstand the rigors of the field cable
splicing operation. Since REA considers the performance of the buffer tubes to be a critical requirement of the field
cable splicing operation, REA will not eliminate the cold bend test from the specification as recommended by the respondent.

In response to the commenter's recommendation for changing the size of the test mandrel diameter, REA would like to
point out that mandrel diameter of 5 times the buffer tube diameter is the same mandrel diameter as specified in REA
Bulletin 345-90. Since manufacturers have been performing the cold bend test using the mandrel diameter of
5 times the buffer tube diameter as specified in REA Bulletin 345-90 for more than seven years without any reported
problems, REA will not change the mandrel diameter for the cold bend test specified in 7 CFR 1755.900 to the mandrel
diameter recommended by the commenter.

Three respondents recommended that reference in paragraph (d)(2) of the specification for defining the color limits
of the colored optical fibers be changed from EIA-359-A-1984 to EIA/TIA-598.



Response: 

The reason that REA referenced the EIA-359-A-1984 copper cable standard for defining the color
limits of the colored optical fibers except for rose and aqua colors in 7 CFR 1755.900 is because at the time of its writing
no EIA standard existed for defining the color limits for fiber optic cables. Since EIA has now published a color coding
standard solely for fiber optic cables which includes the rose color, REA will change the reference in paragraph (d)(2)
of 7 CFR 1755.900 from EIA-359-A-1984 to EIA/TIA-
598.

Five respondents recommended that the color limits specified in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of the specification for rose
be eliminated and the aqua limits be changed to the proposed EIA limits.



Response: 

The reason for specifying the rose and aqua color limits in 7 CFR 1755.900 was because the EIA-359-A-1984
standard did not contain limits for these colors. Since the EIA/TIA-598 Standard specifies the rose color limits,
REA will eliminate the rose color limits from paragraph (d)(2)(i) of 7 CFR 1755.900.

Regarding the aqua color limit, EIA/TIA-598 contains a color limit for aqua but the fiber optic cable industry
is dissatisfied with the limits of the EIA/TIA standard. In fact EIA/TIA is revising the current standard to reflect
the new aqua limits being proposed by the industry. Therefore to assure that the aqua color limits of 7 CFR 1755.900
will coincide with the proposed aqua limits of the revised EIA/TIA-598 Standard, REA will change the aqua limits
currently specified in 7 CFR 1755.900 to the aqua color limits proposed for incorporation into the revised EIA/TIA-598
Color Standard.

One respondent commented that paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of the specification which states that REA will not accept alternative
coloring schemes which deviate from the color coding scheme specified in paragraph (d)(1) of 7 CFR 1755.900 be eliminated
from the specification.



Response: 

The reason for this requirement is to provide REA borrowers with one color coding standard for identification of buffer
tubes and optical fibers to facilitate the splicing of fiber optic cables in the field. If REA allowed alternative
coloring schemes for identification of buffer tubes and optical fibers as recommended by the commenter, REA would
be doing a disservice to our borrowers by negating the requirement's intended purpose of facilitating field splicing
of fiber optic cables by REA borrowers. Since this requirement will facilitate the splicing of fiber optic cables
in the field by REA borrowers, REA will not eliminate paragraph (d)(2)(ii) from the specification as recommended
by the commenter.

Two respondents commented on the splicing of strength members as specified in paragraph (e)(4) of the specification.
The first respondent recommended that the 1 kilometer splicing limitation for strength members be changed to 500
meters. The second respondent questioned the rationale for limiting the number of strength member splices. 



Response: 

REA limits the number of strength member splices to 1 per kilometer in the completed cable to avoid strength member
splices being in close proximity to one another which in the opinion of REA could lead to failure of the cable during
installation as a result of splice breakage. Since REA borrowers have been installing fiber optic cables with the
above strength member splice requirement for the past seven years without any reported installation failures, REA
will not change the requirement specified in paragraph (e)(4) of 7 CFR 1755.900. 

Two respondents commented that the language of paragraph (f)(3) should be modified to allow the cable manufacturer
the option of using natural colored threads and tapes as core binders. 



Response: 

REA has reviewed the suggested change in language and the reasons for the change in language presented by the commentators.
Because REA agrees with the reasons for their suggested change in language, REA will modify the language in paragraph
(f)(3) of the specification to allow manufacturers the option of providing natural colored threads and tapes as core
binders. 

One respondent commented that the language in paragraph (f)(4) of 7 CFR 1755.900 should be changed to better reflect
the functional needs of fiber optic cables currently being used by REA borrowers. 



Response: 

REA reviewed the reason for the proposed change in language submitted by the commenter and as a result of our review
will change the present language in paragraph (f)(4) of 7 CFR 1755.900 to the language proposed by the commenter. 

Two respondents commented on the core wrap section of 7 CFR 1755.900. The first commenter recommended that the core
wrap section (paragraph (h) of the specification) be revised to more clearly indicate that the use of core wraps in
the manufacture of fiber optic cable is an option. The second commenter recommended that the core wrap section be further
modified to allow one or more core wraps in the manufacture of fiber optic cable. 



Response: 

In regards to the first respondent's comment, REA has reviewed the present language of paragraph (h) and agrees with
the respondent's comment that the core wrap section does not clearly indicate that the use of a core wrap in the manufacture
of the cable is at the option of the manufacturer. Since REA agrees with the commenter's comment, REA will revise paragraph
(h) of 7 CFR 1755.900 to clearly indicate that the use of a core wrap is at the option of the manufacturer. 

Regarding the second respondent's comment, the latest issues of REA's copper cable specifications covered under
7 CFR 1755.390 and 7 CFR 1755.890 allow the use of multiple core wraps in manufacture of these type cables provided at
the filling compound is applied between each core wrap layer. Since REA allows the use of multiple core wraps in the
manufacture of copper cables, REA will also allow the use of multiple core wraps in the manufacture of fiber optic cables.
Therefore paragraph (h) of 7 CFR 1755.900 will be modified to allow the use of multiple core wraps by fiber optic cable
manufacturers. REA will also modify paragraph (h) to indicate that when multiple core wraps are used that the filling
compound must be applied between each core wrap layer to prevent the ingress of water between each core wrap layer.


Two respondents commented that the testing of the inner jacket for fungus resistance as specified in paragraph (i)(3)
of the specification should be eliminated because the polyethylene compounds used for the inner jackets are inherently
resistant to fungus attack. 



Response: 

The current REA Bulletin 345-90 allows fiber optic cable manufacturers the option of using any available material
for producing inner jackets. To assure that these inner jacket materials would provide satisfactory field service,
the bulletin required that they pass a fungus resistance test. Since 7 CFR 1755.900 now specifies that only polyethylene
compounds can be used to produce inner jackets and REA knows that these compounds are inherently resistant to fungus
attack, REA will eliminate the fungus resistance test, paragraph (i)(3), for inner jacket materials from 7 CFR 1755.900.


One respondent commented that paragraph (j)(2) of 7 CFR 1755.900 should be modified to indicate that a flooding compound
is only required for armored cable and that jacket slip test reference in the paragraph be clarified to indicate that
it only applies to flooded cable designs. 



Response: 

In reviewing the present language of the flooding compound section, paragraphs (j)(1) through (j)(4), of 7 CFR 1755.900,
paragraph (j)(1) clearly indicates that flooding compound applies only to armored fiber optic cable designs. Also
the present language of the jacket slip test, paragraph (III)(3), Appendix A, clearly indicates that this test is
only performed on flooded cable designs. Because the present language in both paragraphs clearly indicate the intent
of the commenter's recommendation, REA will not revise paragraph (j)(2) of 7 CFR 1755.900 as recommended by the commenter.


One respondent commented that ``water blocking tape'' language of paragraph (j)(4) be changed to ``water blocking
material'' to allow for the use of water blocking tapes or powders in lieu of a flooding compound. 



Response: 

REA has allowed the use of water blocking tapes in place of flooding compounds in filled fiber optic cables for several
years with satisfactory field performance, but the use of water blocking powders in place of the flooding compound
is a new application for fiber optic cables with limited field experience. Until fiber optic cables using water blocking
powders as replacements for flooding compounds gain more field experience to assure reliable service, REA will not
change the language in paragraph (j)(4) of 7 CFR 1755.900 to the language recommended by the commenter.

One respondent recommended that armor overlap be changed from 3.0 millimeters to either 1.8 millimeters or sufficient
to meet the requirements of paragraph (q) of 7 CFR 1755.900. 



Response: 

The reason 7 CFR 1755.900 specifies a minimum armor overlap of 3.0 millimeters is to assure proper forming of the armor
overlap is achieved to avoid longitudinal splitting of the jacket during installation. Since REA is concerned that
armor overlaps less than 3.0 millimeters can result in longitudinal splitting of the jacket during installation
because of improper forming, REA will not change the present requirement of 3.0 millimeters to the recommended comments
of the respondent. 

One commenter recommended that reduction in thickness of the armoring material due either to corrugating or the application
process be changed from 10 percent to 5 percent. 



Response: 

REA would like to point out that the 10 percent requirement for the reduction in armor thickness is the same requirement
as specified in REA Bulletin 345-90. Since manufacturers have been meeting the 10 percent armor reduction thickness
requirement as specified in REA Bulletin 345-90 for more than seven years without any reported problems, REA
will not change the 10 percent armor reduction thickness requirement in 7 CFR 1755.900 to the 5 percent armor reduction
thickness requirement as recommended by the commenter. 

Two respondents recommended changing the present language of paragraph (k)(6) to more clearly define the intent
of the requirement. 


Response: 

REA has reviewed the proposed language submitted by both commentators and agrees that their proposed language will
more clearly define the intent of the requirement. Therefore, REA will change the present language of paragraph (k)(6)
specified in 7 CFR 1755.900 to the proposed language recommended by the commenters. 

One respondent recommended that paragraphs (k)(8), (k)(9), and (k)(10) of the specification be eliminated from
the specification because they consider these tests to be cable component tests and not completed cable performance
tests. 



Response: 

REA considers the tests specified in paragraphs (k)(8), (k)(9), and (k)(10) of the specification to be completed
cable performance tests because these tests provide REA with the means of assuring that the plastic coated steel armor
of the cable will withstand the rigors of the installation as well as a means of assuring that the plastic coated steel
armor of the cable will provide satisfactory service over the life of the completed cable. Since REA considers the
performance of the plastic coated steel armor to be a critical requirement in the installation and service life of
completed cables, REA will not eliminate paragraphs (k)(8), (k)(9), and (k)(10) from 7 CFR 1755.900 as recommended
by the respondent. 

One respondent recommended that paragraph (k)(10) of 7 CFR 1755.900 be modified to exclude from the 90 percent calculation
the area of the armor under the strength members for cables containing embedded strength members in the outer jacket
because these type cables can still pass the armor to jacket bond strength requirement specified in paragraph (k)(10)
of the specification. 



Response: 

A review of recent armor to jacket bond strength data for cables containing embedded strength members in the outer
jacket when the area of the armor under the strength members is excluded from the 90 percent calculation revealed that
these type cables can pass the requirement specified in paragraph (k)(10) of the specification without difficulty.
Since test data indicate that these type cables can pass the armor to jacket bond strength requirement, REA will modify
paragraph (k)(10) of 7 CFR 1755.900 to allow the exclusion of the area of the armor under the strength members for cables
containing embedded strength members in the outer jacket from the 90 percent calculation. 

One respondent recommended that low density polyethylene, low density ethylene copolymer, and linear low density
polyethylene compounds not be allowed as outer jacket materials. The reason for their comment is that installation
damage to the cable can occur as a result of the above materials becoming soft at the high temperatures experienced
during hot summer weather. 



Response: 

Low density polyethylene, low density ethylene copolymer, and linear low density polyethylene compounds have been
used by REA as outer jacket materials for copper cables for over twenty years and for fiber optic cables for over seven
years without any reported high temperature installation problems associated with hot summer weather. Since REA
has never received complaints from borrowers installing cables using any one of the above compounds during hot summer
weather, REA will not eliminate the use of low density polyethylene, low density ethylene copolymer, and linear low
density polyethylene compounds as outer jacket materials from the specification as recommended by the commenter.


One respondent recommended that melt flow rate, environmental stress crack, and impact tests for jacketing materials
be eliminated from the specification because they consider these tests to be cable component tests and not completed
cable performance tests. 



Response: 

REA considers the melt flow rate, environmental stress crack, and impact tests for jacketing materials to be completed
cable performance tests because these tests provide REA with the means of assuring that the jacketing material of
the cable will withstand the rigors of installation as well as a means of assuring that the jacketing material of the
cable will provide satisfactory service over the life of the completed cable. Since REA considers the performance
of jacket material to be a critical requirement in the installation and service life of completed cables, REA will
not eliminate the melt flow rate, environmental stress crack, and impact tests for jacketing materials from 7 CFR
1755.900 as recommended by the respondent. 

One commenter recommended replacing the ASTM D 4565-90a test method referenced for both jacket tensile strength/elongation
and jacket shrinkback in 7 CFR 1755.900 with the EIA-455-89A test method for jacket tensile strength/elongation
and the EIA-455-86 test method for jacket shrinkback because these test methods are the current fiber
optic industry standards for these jacket properties. 



Response: 

A review of the ASTM and EIA test methods for jacket tensile strength/elongation and jacket shrinkback properties
indicates that the EIA test methods are more applicable for the testing of fiber optic cables than the ASTM test method.
Since the EIA test methods are more applicable to the testing of fiber optic cables, REA will replace the reference
to ASTM D 4565-90a in paragraphs (m)(5)(ii) and (m)(5)(iv) of 7 CFR 1755.900 with EIA-455-89A and
EIA-455-86, respectively. 

One respondent recommended that the minimum jacket thickness over the strength members for cables containing embedded
strength members in the outer jacket be changed from 0.5 millimeter to 0.9 millimeter. 



Response: 

REA has accepted one manufacturer of fiber optic cable containing embedded strength members in the outer jacket using
the 0.5 millimeter minimum jacket thickness over the embedded strength members. That manufacturer's cable has been
used by REA borrowers for over four years without any reported field failures. Since REA has satisfactory field performance
history on fiber optic cables with embedded strength members using the minimum 0.5 millimeter jacket thickness over
the embedded strength members, REA will not change the 0.5 millimeter minimum jacket thickness specified in 7 CFR
1755.900 to the minimum jacket thickness recommended by the commenter.

One respondent recommended that the maximum tolerance limit for the web width of self-supporting cable be changed
from +0.51 millimeters to +1.58 millimeters. 



Response:

 The reason that the maximum tolerance limit for the web width of self-supporting cables is specified at +0.51 millimeters
is to assure that the web of self-supporting cables can be slit by craftpersons during installation using existing
slitting tools. Increasing the maximum web width tolerance to +1.58 millimeters as recommended by the commenter
would require the development of special slitting tools to assure satisfactory installation of these thicker webbed
self-supporting cables by craftpersons. Since it is not the intent of REA to burden craftpersons with special tools
needed to install theses thicker webbed self-supporting cables, REA will not change the maximum tolerance limit
for the web width of self-supporting cables specified in 7 CFR 1755.900 to the maximum tolerance limit recommended
by the respondent. 

One respondent recommended that the sheath slitting cord be made a mandatory component of the cable instead of an optional
cable component. 



Response

: The reasons 7 CFR 1755.900 specifies that the sheath slitting cord is an optional component of the cable are because
not all cable installers use the sheath slitting cord to open the cable jacket during installation and during extremely
cold weather installation. The sheath slitting cord does not aid the installer in opening the cable jacket because
of the stiffness of the jacket. Because of the above reasons, REA will not make the sheath slitting cord a mandatory
cable component in 7 CFR 1755.900. 

Two respondents commented that the language in paragraph (n)(2) of 7 CFR 1755.900 should be changed to better reflect
the functional needs of fiber optic cables currently being used by REA borrowers and to quantify the sheath slitting
cord requirement. 



Response

: REA reviewed the reasons for the proposed change in language submitted by the commentators and as a result of our review
will change the present language in paragraph (n)(2) of 7 CFR 1755.900 to better reflect the functional needs of fiber
optic cables currently being used by REA borrowers and to quantify the sheath slitting cord requirement. 

One respondent recommended that the numbering sequence for re-marked cables be changed from 3,000 to 1,000. 



Response

: REA would like to point out that the 3,000 numbering sequence for re-marked cables specified in 7 CFR 1755.900 is the
same numbering sequence for re-marked cables as specified in REA Bulletin 345-90. Since manufacturers have
been using the 3,000 numbering sequence for re-marked cables as specified in REA Bulletin 345-90 for more than
seven years without any reported problems, REA will not change the numbering sequence for re-marked cables specified
in 7 CFR 1755.900 to the numbering sequence for re-marked cables recommended by the commenter. 

One respondent recommended adding a new identification marking requirement to 7 CFR 1755.900 that requires a telephone
handset symbol to be marked on the outer jacket of fiber optic cables intended for direct burial installation in accordance
with Rule 350G of the 1993 National Electric Safety Code (NESC). 



Response

: Since the REA Form 515 Construction Contract requires that all types of construction comply with the safety requirements
specified in the NESC, REA will change paragraph (o)(2) in 7 CFR 1755.900 to require that all direct buried fiber optic
cables be marked with the telephone handset symbol in accordance with Rule 350G of the 1993 NESC. This change will cause
existing paragraphs (o)(2) through (o)(11) to be renumbered as paragraphs (o)(3) through (o)(12) in 7 CFR 1755.900.


Two respondents commented on the attenuation requirements specified in paragraph (p)(1)(i) of 7 CFR 1755.900. The
first respondent recommended deleting the reference to EIA/TIA-455-59 because this standard is used
to determine point discontinuities and not attenuation. The second respondent recommended changing the attenuation
values specified in 7 CFR 1755.900 for dispersion-unshifted and dispersion-shifted single mode optical fibers
to 0.4 dB/km and 0.25 dB/km, respectively. 



Response

: With regard to the EIA/TIA-455-59 reference, REA agrees with the commenter and will eliminate the reference
to EIA/TIA-455-59 in paragraph (p)(1)(i) of 7 CFR 1755.900. 

In regard to the change in attenuation requirements, REA is satisfied that the 0.5 dB/km maximum attenuation requirement
for both dispersion-unshifted and dispersion-shifted single mode optical fibers, although considered very loose
when compared to other industry standards, will provide REA borrowers with satisfactory optical signal transmission.
REA would also like to point out that the REA Form 515 Construction Contract allows REA borrowers the opportunity to
specify lower attenuation values than the 0.5 dB/km maximum specification value for these type optical fibers and
when such values are specified in the contract they must be met by the cable supplier to execute the contract. 

Since REA is satisfied that 0.5 dB/km maximum attenuation for both dispersion-unshifted and dispersion-shifted
single mode optical fibers will provide satisfactory optical transmission and the knowledge that REA borrowers
can specify lower attenuation values than the specification value to successfully execute the REA Form 515 Construction
Contract, REA will not change the attenuation values specified in 7 CFR 1755.900 to values recommended by the commenter.


One respondent recommended deleting the requirement to conduct attenuation measurements at the wavelength specified
for the application as stated in paragraphs (p)(1)(iv) and (p)(2)(iii) of 7 CFR 1755.900. The reason for the respondent's
recommendation is the possibility of REA borrowers specifying attenuation requirements at nonstandard wavelengths
which would require the development of new test equipment. The development of this new equipment would in turn result
in added cable costs.

Response: 

A review of past REA Form 515 Construction Contracts indicated that REA borrowers were specifying attenuation requirements
at the accepted industry wavelengths of 850 and 1300 nanometers for multimode fibers, and 1310 and 1550 for single
mode fibers. A review of present construction contracts also reveals that REA borrowers are still specifying attenuation
requirements at the accepted industry wavelengths of 850 and 1300 nanometers for multimode fibers, and 1310 and 1550
for single mode fibers. 

Since REA borrowers are specifying attenuation requirements at the industry accepted wavelengths and not at nonstandard
wavelengths, the requirement to conduct attenuation measurements at the wavelength specified in paragraphs (p)(1)(iv)
and (p)(2)(iii) of 7 CFR 1755.900 will not be deleted from the specification as recommended by the commenter. 

One respondent commented that the dispersion and dispersion slope requirements of 2.7 ps/nm




km and 0.085 ps(nm2




km), respectively for dispersion-shifted single mode fibers specified in paragraph (p)(1)(vii) of the specification
will eliminate the use of their currently manufactured dispersion shifted single mode fiber by REA borrowers. 



Response: 

Since it is not REA's intent to eliminate the use of dispersion-shifted single mode fibers which are currently manufactured
and used on non-REA telecommunication systems with satisfactory results, REA will change the dispersion and dispersion
slope requirements for dispersion-shifted single mode fibers from 2.7 ps/nm




km and 0.085 ps(nm2




km), respectively to 3.5 ps/nm




km and 0.095 ps(nm2




km), respectively to allow use of the manufacturer's dispersion shifted single mode fiber by REA borrowers. 

Three respondents recommended changing the 1250 nanometer cut-off wavelength for single mode fibers specified
in paragraph (p)(1)(viii) of 7 CFR 1755.900 to the industry accepted wavelength of 1260 nanometers. 



Response: 

If 7 CFR 1755.900 maintained the 1250 nanometer cut-off wavelength for single mode fibers, REA would force manufacturers
to maintain two separate fiber optic cable inventories based solely on the different cut-off wavelength requirements.
This in turn would result in higher fiber optic cable prices to REA borrowers. By changing the cut-off wavelength requirement
for single mode fibers from 1250 nanometers to 1260 nanometers, REA would eliminate the need for manufacturers to
maintain separate fiber optic cable inventories. This change would reduce fiber optic cable costs to REA borrowers.
Therefore, REA will change the single mode fiber cut-off wavelength requirement in paragraph (p)(1)(viii) of 7 CFR
1755.900 from 1250 nanometers to 1260 nanometers. 

One respondent commented on the mechanical requirements for multimode fiber optic cables specified in 7 CFR 1755.900.
The first comment recommended deleting the mechanical requirements for multimode fiber optic cables specified
in paragraphs (q)(1) through (q)(5) of the specification because they feel that the qualification of single mode
fiber optic cable designs to the mechanical requirements are adequate to qualify multimode fiber optic cable designs.
The second comment recommended that if REA retained the mechanical requirements for multimode fiber optic cables
that the allowable change in attenuation be changed from a maximum of 0.030 dB to a maximum of 0.040 dB since this is the
present de facto industry requirement for multimode optical fibers. 



Response: 

In regards to the first comment, 7 CFR 1755.900 requires both multimode and single mode fiber optic cables to be tested
for the mechanical properties specified in paragraphs (q)(1) through (q)(5) of the specification to assure that
both cable types will withstand the rigors of field installation and provide satisfactory service over their useful
lives. REA is of the opinion that both multimode and single mode fiber optic cable designs must be tested for the mechanical
requirements specified in paragraphs (q)(1) through (q)(5) of the specification to assure REA borrowers that these
designs will withstand the rigors of field installation and provide satisfactory performance over their useful
service lives. Therefore, REA will not eliminate the mechanical requirements for multimode fiber optic cables specified
in paragraphs (q)(1) through (q)(5) of 7 CFR 1755.900. 

Regarding the second comment, since it is REA's intent to use de facto industry requirements; where applicable, REA
will change the maximum allowable change in attenuation for multimode fiber optic cables from 0.30 dB to 0.40 dB in
paragraphs (q)(1) through (q)(5) of 7 CFR 1755.900. 

Two respondents recommended that mechanical testing specified in paragraphs (q)(1) through (q)(5) of 7 CFR 1755.900
for dispersion-unshifted single mode fiber optic cables be performed at only the 1550 nanometer wavelength in place
of the required testing at both 1310 and 1550 nanometer wavelengths. The reasons for their comments are based on the
data indicating that testing of optical fibers at the 1550 nanometer wavelength is considered the worst case condition
because the fibers are more sensitive to bends at this wavelength.

Response: 

7 CFR 1755.900 requires mechanical testing of 
dispersion-unshifted single mode fiber optic cables at both the 1310 
nanometer and 1550 nanometer wavelengths. The reason for the 
mechanical testing of dispersion-unshifted single mode fiber optic 
cables at both the 1310 and 1550 nanometer wavelengths is to assure 
satisfactory transmission of the optical signals at these 
wavelengths when specified by REA borrowers. Although REA agrees with the 
commentators comments, data from the REA Form 515 Construction 
Contracts indicate that the majority of lightwave systems installed 
by REA borrowers operate at the 1310 nanometer wavelength and not 
at the 1550 nanometer wavelength. 
Since the majority of REA borrower lightwave systems operate 
at the 1310 nanometer wavelength, REA must require mechanical 
testing of dispersion-unshifted single mode fiber optic cables at the 
1310 nanometer wavelength to assure that cables installed by REA 
borrowers with lightwave systems operating at the 1310 nanometer 
wavelength will provide satisfactory optical signal transmission. 
Therefore, REA will not eliminate the mechanical testing of 
dispersion-unshifted single mode fiber optic cables at the 1310 nanometer 
wavelength as recommended by the commenters. 
One respondent recommended changing the cable bend test 
temperature of ^46
 C, Test Condition C of EIA/TIA-455-37A, specified 
in paragraph (q)(1)(iii) of 7 CFR 1755.900 to ^30
 C, Test Condition 
E of EIA/TIA-455-37A, because this is the de facto industry test 
temperature for fiber optic cables. 





Response: 

Since it is REA's intent to use de facto industry 
requirements where applicable, REA will change the cable bend test 
temperature of ^46
 C, Test Condition C of EIA/TIA-455-37A, to ^30
 C, Test Condition E of EIA/TIA-455-37A, in paragraph (q)(1)(iii) 
of 7 CFR 1755.900. 


Three respondents recommended replacing the cable bend test 
mandrel diameter of 15 times the cable diameter specified in 
paragraph (q)(1)(iii)(A) of 7 CFR 1755.900 with a test mandrel diameter 
of 20 times the cable diameter because this is the de facto 
industry requirement for fiber optic cables. 
 



Response: 

Since it is REA's intent to use de facto industry 
requirements where applicable, REA will change the cable bend test 
mandrel diameter of 15 times the cable diameter to a test mandrel 
diameter of 20 times the cable diameter in paragraph 
(q)(1)(iii)(A) of 7 CFR 1755.900. 
Two respondents recommending deleting the cable bend test 
requirement that the armor overlap be on the outside of the bend 
when bend testing armored cables in accordance with paragraph 
(q)(1)(iii)(C) of 7 CFR 1755.900. 


Response: 

REA would like to point out that the cable bend 
test requirement stipulating that the armor overlap be on the 
outside of the bend when bend testing armored cables specified in 7 CFR 
1755.900 is the same requirement for armored cables as specified 
in REA Bulletin 345-90. Since manufacturers have been bend testing 
armored cables using this requirement in REA Bulletin 345-90 for 
more than seven years without any reported problems, REA will not 
delete the requirement that the armor overlap be on the outside of 
the bend when bend testing armored cables in 7 CFR 1755.900. 
One respondent recommended that the requirement that there 
be no delamination of jacket bond after cable bend testing 
specified in paragraph (q)(1)(iv) of 7 CFR 1755.900 be deleted from the 
specification. 


Response: 

REA would like to point out that the cable bend 
test requirement stipulating that there be no delamination of 
jacket bond after cable bend testing specified in 7 CFR 1755.900 is the 
same requirement as specified in REA Bulletin 345-90. Since 
manufacturers have been bend testing cables using this requirement in 
REA Bulletin 345-90 for more than seven years without any reported 
problems, REA will not delete the requirement that there be no 
delamination of jacket bond after cable bend testing in paragraph 
(q)(1)(iv) of 7 CFR 1755.900. 
Two respondents commented on the cable compression test, 
paragraph (q)(3)(iii), of 7 CFR 1755.900. The first respondent 
recommended changing the rate for applying the compressive force from a 
nominal of 5 millimeters per minute to a range of 3 millimeters to 
20 millimeters per minute to make the cable compression test of 7 
CFR 1755.900 compatible with the de facto industry standard. The 
second respondent recommended changing holding time of the 
compressive force from 15 minutes to 10 minutes because the 10 minute 
requirement is the de facto industry requirement for fiber optic 
cables.

Response: 

Since it is REA's intent to use de facto industry 
requirements where applicable, REA will change the rate for 
applying the compressive force from a nominal of 5 millimeters per 
minute to a range of 3 millimeters to 20 millimeters per minute and 
will also change the holding time of the compressive force from 15 
minutes to 10 minutes in paragraph (q)(3)(iii) of 
7 CFR 1755.900. 
Three respondents commented on the cable flex test 
requirements specified in paragraph (q)(5)(iv) of 7 CFR 1755.900. Two of 
the respondents recommended that a fracture length of no more than 
5 millimeters be allowed on the armor after flexing since this is 
the de facto industry requirement for fiber optic cables. The 
third respondent recommended deleting the requirement that there be 
no delamination of jacket to armor bond in nonflooded cables after 
flex testing. 


Response: 

7 CFR 1755.900 requires that there be no visible 
evidence of fracture of the armor after flexing. Reason for the 
requirement is one means of assuring that continuity of the armor 
will be maintained after the rigors of installation. Maintaining 
the armor continuity after installation is important requirement in 
assuring protection of the telephone equipment and telephone 
company personnel against hazardous electrical currents. If REA 
allowed a minimum fracture length of the armor after flexing but before 
installation, the possibility exists that these small fracture 
lengths in the armor could develop into complete breaks of the armor 
at these fractured locations as a result of difficulties 
encountered during installation. These breaks in the armor would result in 
loss of armor continuity. The loss of armor continuity in turn 
would subject the telephone equipment and telephone company 
personnel to possible hazardous electrical currents which could result in 
damaged equipment or personal injury to telephone company 
personnel. Since REA has a responsibility to its borrowers to assure that 
their telephone equipment and personnel are protected against 
hazardous electrical currents, REA will not change the present 
requirement of no visible evidence of fracture of the armor after flexing 
specified in 7 CFR 1755.900 to the recommendation requested by the 
first two commenters. 
In regard to the requirement that there be no delamination 
of jacket to armor bond in nonflooded cables after flex testing, 
REA specified this requirement on nonflooded cables to assure that 
the bond strength between the outer jacket and the plastic coated 
armor would be maintained after installation to assure that water 
could not enter nonflooded cables at the outer jacket/armor 
interface. If REA eliminated this requirement as recommended by the 
third commenter, voids at the outer jacket/armor interface could 
develop in nonflooded cables after installation. These voids could 
allow the entry of water into nonflooded cables resulting in possible 
degradation of the optical signal over time. Since REA has a 
responsibility to our borrowers to assure that optical signal of 
nonflooded cables will not degrade as a result of water entry, REA will 
not eliminate the requirement that there be no delamination of 
jacket to armor bond in nonflooded cables after flex testing as 
recommended by the third commenter. 
Seven respondents recommended replacing Appendix A of 7 CFR 
1755.900 with de facto industry tests to determine the long term 
stability of their fiber optic cables. 


Response: 

The tests specified in Appendix A of 7 CFR 
1755.900 have been used by REA for over sixteen years for determining 
the long term performance of copper cables with satisfactory 
results. Since these test have proven invaluable for determining the 
long term stability of copper cables, REA decided to apply these same 
proven tests to determine the long term stability of fiber optic 
cables. Therefore REA will not replace Appendix A with de facto 
industry tests as recommended by the commenters.

3. Section 1755.900 is added to read as follows: 


 1755.900 

REA specification for filled fiber optic cables. 


(a) 

Scope.

 (1) This section covers the requirement for filled fiber optic cables intended for aerial installation either by
attachment to a support strand or by an integrated self-supporting arrangement, for underground application by
placement in a duct, or for buried installations either by trenching or by direct plowing. 
(i) The optical waveguides are glass fibers having directly-applied protective coatings, and are called ``fibers'',
herein. These fibers may be assembled in either loose fiber bundles with a protective core tube, encased in several
protective buffer tubes, or in tight buffer tubes. 
(ii) Fillers, strength members, core wraps, and bedding tapes may complete the cable core. 
(iii) The core or buffer tubes containing the fibers and the interstices between the buffer tubes, fillers, and strength
members in the core structure are filled with a suitable material to exclude water. 
(iv) The cable structure is completed by an extruded overall plastic jacket. This jacket may have strength members
embedded in it, in some designs. 
(v) Buried installation requires an armor under the outer jacket. 
(vi) For self-supporting cable the outer jacket may be extruded over the support messenger and cable core. 
(2) The cable is fully color coded so that each fiber is distinguishable from every other fiber. A basic color scheme
of twenty-four colors allows individual fiber identification. Colored tubes, binders, threads, stripings, or
markings provide fiber group identification. 
(3) Cable manufactured to this section must demonstrate compliance with the qualification testing requirements
to ensure satisfactory end-use performance characteristics for the intended applications. 
(4) Optical cable designs not specifically addressed by this section may be allowed if accepted by REA. Justification
for acceptance of a modified design must be provided to substantiate product utility and long term stability and endurance.

(5) All cables sold to REA borrowers for projects involving REA loan funds under this section must be accepted by REA
Technical Standards Committee ``A'' (Telephone). For cables manufactured to the specification of this section,
all design changes to an accepted design must be submitted for acceptance. REA will be the sole authority on what constitutes
a design change.

comments will be published as ``direct final'' rules. ``Adverse comments'' are comments that suggest that a rule
should not be adopted or suggest that a change should be made to the rule. Each direct final rule will advise the public
that no adverse comments are anticipated and that unless written adverse comments or written notice of intent to submit
adverse comments are received within 30 days, the revision made by the rule will be effective 60 days from the date the
direct final rule is published in the 

Federal Register

. This new policy should expedite the promulgation of routine or otherwise noncontroversial rules by reducing the
time that would be required to develop, review, clear, and publish separate proposed and final rules.

 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) is committed to improving the efficiency of our regulatory process.
As such, we plan to adopt the rulemaking technique known as ``direct final rulemaking,'' which will be used to promulgate
some of FSIS' rules. 



The Direct Final Rule Process 



Rules that FSIS judges to be noncontroversial and unlikely to generate adverse comments will be published as direct
final rules. Such direct final rules will advise the public that no adverse comments are anticipated and that unless
written adverse comments or written notice of intent to submit adverse comments are received within 30 days, the revision
made by the rule will be effective 60 days from the date the direct final rule is published in the 

Federal Register

. 

``Adverse comments'' are comments that suggest that the rule should not be adopted or that a change should be made to
the rule. A comment expressing support for the rule as published would not be considered adverse. Also, a comment suggesting
that requirements in the rule should, or should not, be employed by FSIS in programs or situations outside the scope
of the direct final rule would not be considered adverse.

In accordance with the rulemaking provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553), this procedure
gives the public general notice of FSIS' intent to revise or adopt a new rule and gives interested persons an opportunity
to participate in the rulemaking through submission of comments. The major feature of direct final rulemaking is
that if FSIS receives no written adverse comments within 30 days of the publication of a direct final rule or any written
notice of intent to submit adverse comments, the rule will become effective without the need to publish a separate
final rule. However, FSIS will publish notice in the 

Federal Register

 stating that no written adverse comments and no written notice of intent to submit adverse comments were received
regarding the direct final rule, and confirming that the direct final rule is effective on the date stated in the direct
final rule. 

If FSIS receives written adverse comments or written notice of intent to submit adverse comments within 30 days of
the publication of a direct final rule, FSIS will publish in the 

Federal Register

 a notice of withdrawal of the direct final rule. If FSIS intends to proceed with the rulemaking, the direct final rule
will be republished as a proposed rule, and we will proceed through the normal notice-and-comment rulemaking procedures.




Determining When To Use Direct Final Rulemaking 



Not all FSIS rules are good candidates for direct final rulemaking. We intend to use the direct final procedure only
for rules that we consider noncontroversial and unlikely to generate adverse comments. The decision to use direct
final rulemaking for particular situations will be based on FSIS' experience with similar rules.

Risk Disclosure by Futures Commission Merchants, Introducing Brokers, Commodity Pool Operators and Commodity
Trading Advisors to Customers; Bankruptcy Disclosure



<AGENCY>

 Commodity Futures Trading Commission.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rules.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (Commission or CFTC) is amending its rules to permit registrants to deliver
to customers a generic risk disclosure statement which will satisfy risk disclosure requirements applicable to
domestic and foreign commodity futures and commodity option transactions subject to regulation by the Commission.
The Commission also is permitting such statement to substitute for the special disclosure requirement related to
futures-style margining of the options premium permitted on certain foreign exchanges. The generic statement may
be used by firms subject to CFTC jurisdiction in lieu of the separate disclosure statements that will continue to be
authorized by Commission rules. The statement, which was developed in cooperation with various international regulators,
also is intended to satisfy the risk disclosure requirements of certain foreign jurisdictions who have implemented
the language of this proposed risk disclosure statement in their jurisdictions in accordance with their domestic
law.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:


Background



On March 30, 1993, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (Commission) approved for publication in the 

Federal Register

 amendments to its rules 1.55, 30.6, 33.7, 180.3, 190.06 and 190.10.
 Among other things, the rule amendments consolidated the foreign futures and foreign commodity options risk disclosure
statement required by rule 30.6 with the domestic futures risk disclosure statement required by rule 1.55.





In addition, rule 1.55 was amended to provide in paragraph (c) that the Commission may approve for use in lieu of the
prescribed rule 1.55 disclosure statement a risk disclosure statement approved by one or more foreign regulatory
agencies or self-regulatory organizations if the Commission determines that such statement is reasonably calculated
to provide the disclosures specified by rule 1.55. Rule 1.55(c) was adopted by the Commission to permit firms doing
multinational business to use the same risk disclosure statement for foreign and U.S.-based business, thereby reducing
duplicative disclosure requirements without sacrificing important customer protections or obscuring any special
risks of trading outside the U.S.






Although initially addressed to the approval of the individual disclosure statements of a particular jurisdiction,
the Commission in proposing the amendments to, among others, rule 1.55, stated that the rule contemplates a mechanism
for eventually substituting a uniform disclosure format, accepted internationally, that could be used on a general
basis and supplemented as warranted for particular kinds of transactions or special markets.






The Commission also noted that it was considering development of a ``plain language'' option disclosure statement
and requested comment concerning the desirability of developing a simpler options disclosure statement and other
possible improvements.
 Generally, the commenters who addressed this issue supported the development of a plain language generic options
risk disclosure statement and also encouraged the Commission to consider incorporating the required options disclosure
into the revised rule 1.55 statement. However, the Commission deferred taking such action pending the outcome of
international efforts to develop a consolidated futures and options statement.







In this connection, the Commission stated that certain international regulators were endeavoring to develop a single
risk disclosure statement that would be acceptable in multiple jurisdictions for domestic and cross-border transactions
in futures and options and stated that:





The Commission is monitoring developments in this area and anticipates that if a universal statement of this nature
is developed, it will consider permitting the use of such a statement in lieu of the new consolidated rule 1.55 risk
disclosure statement as well as the options disclosure statement required by rule 33.7.

On January 5, 1994, the Commission approved for publication in the 

Federal Register

 an advance notice of proposed rulemaking which requested comment on the text of a two-page generic risk disclosure
statement then the subject of multilateral discussions among international regulators.

7

 The proposed text was intended to meet the risk disclosure requirements for both domestic and foreign commodity futures
and commodity option products subject to regulation by the CFTC and thereby substitute for the statements required
by rules 1.55, 33.7 and 190.10 as well as the special disclosures related to futures-style margining of options permitted
on certain foreign exchanges.

8

 






Comments on Advance Notice and Related Text Modifications 



The Commission received comments from the National Futures Association (NFA), the Futures Industry Association
(FIA), the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), the Business Law Section of the American Bar Association (ABA), and
Schulte Roth & Zabel (SRZ), a law firm. All commenters generally supported the Commission's proposal for a broader
consolidated risk disclosure statement. The commenters particularly supported substituting the generic risk
disclosure statement for the current rule 33.7 statement for domestic exchange-traded commodity options. The commenters
generally believed that consolidation of risk disclosure statements into one concise document could increase the
clarity of generic disclosure to customers and make the disclosure statement a more effective customer protection
mechanism by focusing customers' attention on particular risks and upon obtaining adequate information on risks.

In response to the Commission's query whether use of the generic statement should be made mandatory or discretionary,
and whether any distinctions should be made with respect to the type of firm that should be permitted to use the generic
statement, commenters urged the Commission not to eliminate the current risk disclosure statement(s) but rather
to permit firms to choose which disclosure statement(s) to provide to customers. For example, firms may not wish to
redesign and reprint disclosure statements. 

The Commission, therefore, agrees that all firms (without regard to whether the firms engage in cross-border business)
should have the flexibility to determine whether they distribute to customers the new generic disclosure statement
or the existing separate risk disclosure statements referred to above. 

Several commenters stated that the section on electronic execution systems needed clarification. Specifically,
as published in the advance notice, paragraph 11 of the generic statement on electronic trading referred to the possibility
that losses resulting from systems failure may be subject to limitations on liability. Commenters noted that liability
limitations are not unique to electronic trade execution systems and may have the unintended implication that such
systems are less safe than floor-based systems. They recommended that this language appear in the section on trading
facilities (paragraph 10), which applies to all trading systems (floor and electronic). The Commission agrees that
both floor and electronic trading venues are supported by systems for which certain types of features are beyond the
control of the exchange and that liability limitations may apply to such features. As a consequence it believes that
the foregoing alteration of the text is appropriate and is more satisfactory to the international regulators who
are considering adoption of the generic risk disclosure statement, some of which only have electronic systems.

9

 The Commission therefore has amended the language accordingly. 





The advance notice of proposed rulemaking on the generic risk disclosure statement noted that an additional topic
addressed in the generic statement was the risks of off-exchange trading. In particular, the informational working
group drafting the generic statement concluded that such a provision, if worded appropriately, would not mislead
or confuse customers in those jurisdictions which, for example, do not permit retail customers to participate in
off-exchange markets. Although the Commission received no comments on this provision, in view of current public
discussions related to over-the-counter derivatives, the Commission has decided to add the words ``and attendant
risks'' at the end of paragraph 12 to enhance relevant disclosure in this regard. The Commission notes in this regard
that the generic risk statement is intended to cause a customer to ask additional questions of its broker. 

Some commenters raised concerns as to the reference in paragraph 1 of the proposed disclosure statement regarding
the time frame for meeting margin calls. They believed the reference could be construed as overriding the terms set
forth in a customer account agreement between the firm and its customer. The Commission wishes to clarify that the
language of the generic risk disclosure statement is not intended to modify the terms and conditions of a firm's customer
account agreement concerning the timing of margin payments (provided that these are consistent with the Commodity
Exchange Act (CEA)) but to call to the customer's attention generally that failure to post margin can have significant
consequences. 

One commenter suggested that in order to alleviate the paperwork burden on registrants, the Commission should not
require inclusion in the risk disclosure statement that is delivered to customers the Addendum that sets forth the
participating jurisdictions which have adopted the generic statement and the products for which the statement may
be used. Although the Commission believes that the Addendum is necessary to enable firms to ensure that use of the generic
statement for a particular product is in compliance with the applicable risk disclosure requirements of various
jurisdictions, the Addendum ordinarily should not be necessary for customers who should receive additional or different
disclosure if the generic statement is not accepted by a particular jurisdiction or for a particular product.

10

 Otherwise, although the Commission intends to publish, amend and update, as appropriate, the Addendum to the generic
risk disclosure statement, the Commission agrees that apart from the limitations on its use in the U.S. to futures,
options on futures and options on commodities, the Addendum listing participating jurisdictions need not be made
part of the disclosure document itself. Firms may, however, elect to include the Addendum as long as it appears on a
separate page after the actual risk disclosure text.

<TEXT>
 

In its advance notice, the Commission noted that the elimination of a Commission mandated description of options
trading and other educational material from the mandated risk disclosure statement does not mean that firms do not
have the obligation to provide all material disclosures consistent with the product traded and level of experience,
sophistication and financial capacity of customers in compliance with Commission and NFA rules.

11

 One commenter believed that the streamlined disclosure statement was sufficient and that if the Commission believes
that additional disclosures are necessary that it provide specific guidance on this issue. 





As discussed by the Commission when it adopted rule 1.55(d) (currently rule 1.55(f)), the obligations of a futures
commission merchant (FCM) and introducing broker (IB) to disclose material information to customers arise under
the CEA and other applicable law. The Commission further noted that the essential purpose of the rule was to confirm
the existing obligations of an FCM or IB under the law and to make clear that distribution of a standard disclosure statement
was not intended to alter those obligations.

12

 






Because the nature and extent of the disclosure which an FCM or IB may be required to make to a customer necessarily must
depend on the facts and circumstances of the particular transaction and also on the precise nature of the FCM's or IB's
relationship to the customer, any attempt by the Commission to enumerate the precise scope and form of disclosure
for all conceivable customer relationships, products and trading strategies would be difficult to accomplish and
would diminish the impact of the generic statement which is intended to highlight the significant risks of futures
and options trading and the areas where customers should seek additional particularized information.

13

 These considerations continue to apply to the current rulemaking, which is intended to consolidate and improve the
mandated disclosure process. Accordingly, nothing in the current rulemaking should be construed as reducing the
existing obligation to make all disclosures required under applicable law. 





Finally, one commenter suggested that the acknowledgement requirement should be eliminated with respect to sophisticated
investors. The CFTC has determined not to address this matter at this time. 



Procedure_Final Rule Amendments 




When the Commission issued its advance notice concerning the proposed text of a generic disclosure statement that
could be adopted by several jurisdictions regulating futures and options transactions, the Commission contemplated
that a further comment process could be necessary. However, for the reasons noted below, the Commission believes
that a complete rulemaking record has been compiled and that further proposal of the text of the generic risk disclosure
statement is unnecessary. 


Public comments received on the advance notice were unanimous in recommending the adoption of the generic risk disclosure
statement (subject to minor revision), including substituting the proposed generic statement for the rule 33.7
statement for domestic exchange-traded commodity options and the statement required by rule 190.10 for non-cash
deposits as margin.

14

 Second, the Commission received comment on the generic risk disclosure proposal in connection with the recent amendments
consolidating rules 1.55 and 30.6, which contemplated Commission approval of the substitution of a document which
can be used in multiple jurisdictions.

15

 Third, as provided herein, the use of the generic risk disclosure is not mandatory, 

i.e., 

the language 

may 

be used but is not required to be substituted for the statements now required by rules 1.55, 33.7 and 190.10(c) and other
disclosure requirements set forth in the advance notice.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940705-0-00055 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940705-0-00005 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Accordingly, the final rules amend   1.55(c), 33.7 and 190.10(c) to incorporate text which permits registrants
to satisfy the requirements of rules 1.55, 33.7 and 190.10(c) by substituting the generic risk disclosure statement
as set forth below, which will be published in a new appendix to part 1 of the Commission's regulations. The Commission
also clarifies herein that the generic risk disclosure statement may be used in lieu of the special disclosure addendum
to rule 33.7 in connection with transactions on certain foreign exchanges which do not collect the full option premium.




Effect of Alternate Disclosure Statement 



The Commission is hereby permitting the generic risk disclosure statement set forth herein in appendix A to rule 1.55(c)
to be used in lieu of the statements required by rules 1.55 (which incorporates the risk-disclosure contained in Commission
rule 30.6 for foreign futures and foreign commodity options), rule 33.7 (domestic exchange-traded commodity options)
and the special bankruptcy disclosures of Commission rule 190.10(c) related to the acceptance of non-cash margin.


The approval of the generic risk disclosure statement is not intended to alter disclosure requirements other than
those specifically addressed. For example, the disclosure statement would be required to be delivered prior to the
opening of the account and the acknowledgement and manner of delivery of the disclosure statement (

i.e.,

 as a separate written statement or in a booklet) would not be altered. The Commission also would not change the requirement
that compliance with requirements related to providing customers with risk disclosure statements does not relieve
an FCM or IB from any other disclosure obligation it may have under applicable law.
 Similarly, the single signature acknowledgment procedure contained in rule 1.55(d) would continue to apply
 as will the amendment to CFTC rule 190.10(c) eliminating the requirement that the prescribed disclosure concerning
the treatment of non-cash margin in FCM bankruptcies be acknowledged.









The distribution of the generic risk disclosure statement also could substitute for the special disclosure requirements
related to futures-style margining of option premiums permitted on certain foreign exchanges.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940705-0-00056 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940705-0-00005 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The generic risk disclosure statement would not, however, alter the separate disclosure requirements concerning
electronic trading systems or trading linkages between domestic and foreign futures exchanges that may be mandated
by U.S. self-regulatory 
organizations.
 





Finally, the Commission notes that if a firm elects to use the generic risk disclosure statement rather than the statement
required by rule 190.10(c), and uses a separate subordination agreement required by Financial and Segregation Interpretation
No. 12_``Deposit of Customer Funds in Foreign Depositories'' for customers depositing margin in foreign depositories,
 that statement must be separately acknowledged.
 A separate signature also would continue to be necessary where subordination or similar consent to contractual modification
of certain rights is required for other purposes, such as for participation in cross-margining programs.








Separate Statement 


In its previous revision of rule 1.55, the Commission included an amendment intended to clarify that the prescribed
risk disclosure statement may be provided as a physically separate document or in a booklet containing other commodity
interest account materials, as long as the rule 1.55 risk disclosure statement appears as the cover page or the first
page, and is the only material on such page, by which it means the page immediately following the cover page. 
As the generic statement requires approximately two pages of printed text, the statement may appear on more than one
page, provided that it is the only text that appears on those pages. 


Application to Rule 30.3 and 30.10 Orders 


After the effective date of these rule amendments, all firms operating pursuant to confirmed rule 30.10 relief,
 and firms complying with the terms of an outstanding order under rule 30.3 may elect to use the generic risk disclosure
statement or the risk disclosure statements mandated by rules 1.55 and 33.7 and applicable Commission orders, as
appropriate.
 






Timetable for Implementation 


Under the most recent disclosure revisions, the Commission stated that firms would be permitted to use existing disclosure
statements (

i.e.

, either separate rule 1.55, 30.6, 33.7 and 190.10(c) documents) up to and including July 1, 1994.
 





Although the Commission intends for the current rulemaking to take effect upon the publication of this 

Federal Register

 release, the Commission is permitting firms for a period not to exceed sixty days after the date herein to continue
to use the separate statements contained in rules 1.55 and 30.6. Accordingly, after the date herein, firms may use
either the new generic risk disclosure statement or the revised rule 1.55 risk disclosure statement (which incorporates
the rule 30.6 disclosure statement) or, for a period not to exceed sixty days after the effective date of this 

Federal Register

 release, the separate rule 1.55 and rule 30.6 risk disclosure statements to comply with relevant risk disclosure
obligations.

Amendment of CFR 


A. Paperwork Reduction Act 


The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (PRA), 44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq.

, imposes certain requirements on federal agencies (including the Commission) in connection with their conducting
or sponsoring any collection of information as defined by the Paperwork Reduction Act. The amendments to rules 1.55,
33.7 and 190.10 do not change the burdens associated with those rules. The groups of rules of which they are a part have
the following burdens: 



Rule 33.7_(3038-0007) 


Average Burden Hours Per Response_50.32 
Number of Respondents_190,197 
Frequency of Response_Occasionally 


Rule 190.10_(3038-0021) 


Average Burden Hours_0.35 
Number of Respondents_802 
Frequency of Response_Occasionally 
No additional burden is associated with the amendments to rules 33.7 and 190.10. 



The burden associated with the group which encompasses rules 1.55, 180.3 and rule 1.65 is: 



Rules 1.55, 180.3 and 1.65_(3038-0022) 


Average Burden Hours Per Response_613.26 
Number of Respondents_4295 
Frequency of Response_Occasionally 



No additional burden is associated with the amendments to rule 1.55. 


B. Regulatory Flexibility Act 


The Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), 5 U.S.C.  601 

et seq.

, requires that agencies, in proposing rules, consider the impact of these rules on small business. In this connection,
the Commission previously has determined that FCMs and Commodity Pool Operators should not be considered small entities
for purposes of the RFA.
 With respect to IBs and Commodity Trading Advisors (CTAs), the Commission has stated that it would evaluate within
the context of each proposal whether all or some IBs and CTAs should be considered small entities, and if so, that it
would analyze the economic impact on them of any rule.
 Because the proposed amendments to the Commission rules discussed herein will not result in any significant additional
burdens to the above mentioned registrants and may in practice result in a reduction of certain existing burdens,
the Commission believes that the proposed rule amendments will not have a significant economic impact on such entities.
Therefore, pursuant to section 3(a) of the RFA, 5 U.S.C.  605(b), the Acting Chairman of the Commission certifies
that these proposed rule amendments will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.

Risk Disclosure Statement for Futures and Options 




This brief statement does not disclose all of the risks and other significant aspects 
of trading in futures and options. In light of the risks, you should undertake such transactions only if you understand
the nature of the contracts (and contractual relationships) into which you are entering and the extent of your exposure
to risk. 
Trading in futures and options is not suitable for many members of the public. 
You should carefully consider whether trading is appropriate for you in light of 
your experience, objectives, financial resources and other relevant circumstances. 


Futures 


1. Effect of `Leverage' or `Gearing' 


Transactions in futures carry a high degree of risk. The amount of initial margin is small relative to the value of the
futures contract so that transactions are `leveraged' or `geared'. A relatively small market movement will have
a proportionately larger impact on the funds you have deposited or will have to deposit: this may work against you as
well as for you. You may sustain a total loss of initial margin funds and any additional funds deposited with the firm
to maintain your position. If the market moves against your position or margin levels are increased, you may be called
upon to pay substantial additional funds on short notice to maintain your position. If you fail to comply with a request
for additional funds within the time prescribed, your position may be liquidated at a loss and you will be liable for
any resulting deficit. 


2. Risk-reducing orders or strategies 


The placing of certain orders (e.g. `stop-loss' orders, where permitted under local law, or `stop-limit' orders)
which are intended to limit losses to certain amounts may not be effective because market conditions may make it impossible
to execute such orders. Strategies using combinations of positions, such as `spread' and `straddle' positions may
be as risky as taking simple `long' or `short' positions. 


Options 


3. Variable degree of risk 


Transactions in options carry a high degree of risk. Purchasers and sellers of options should familiarize themselves
with the type of option (i.e. put or call) which they contemplate trading and the associated risks. You should calculate
the extent to which the value of the options must increase for your position to become profitable, taking into account
the premium and all transaction costs. 
The purchaser of options may offset or exercise the options or allow the options to expire. The exercise of an option
results either in a cash settlement or in the purchaser acquiring or delivering the underlying interest. If the option
is on a future, the purchaser will acquire a futures position with associated liabilities for margin (see the section
on Futures above). If the purchased options expire worthless, you will suffer a total loss of your investment which
will consist of the option premium plus transaction costs. If you are contemplating purchasing deep-out-of-the-money
options, you should be aware that the chance of such options becoming profitable ordinarily is remote. 
Selling (`writing' or `granting') an option generally entails considerably greater risk than purchasing options.
Although the premium received by the seller is fixed, the seller may sustain a loss well in excess of that amount. The
seller will be liable for additional margin to maintain the position if the market moves unfavorably. The seller will
also be exposed to the risk of the purchaser exercising the option and the seller will be obligated to either settle
the option in cash or to acquire or deliver the underlying interest. If the option is on a future, the seller will acquire
a position in a future with associated liabilities for margin (see the section on Futures above). If the option is `covered'
by the seller holding a corresponding position in the underlying interest or a future or another option, the risk may
be reduced. If the option is not covered, the risk of loss can be unlimited. 
Certain exchanges in some jurisdictions permit deferred payment of the option premium, exposing the purchaser to
liability for margin payments not exceeding the amount of the premium. The purchaser is still subject to the risk of
losing the premium and transaction costs. When the option is exercised or expires, the purchaser is responsible for
any unpaid premium outstanding at that time. 


Additional risks common to futures and options 


4. Terms and conditions of contracts 


You should ask the firm with which you deal about the terms and conditions of the specific futures or options which you
are trading and associated obligations (e.g. the circumstances under which you may become obligated to make or take
delivery of the underlying interest of a futures contract and, in respect of options, expiration dates and restrictions
on the time for exercise). Under certain circumstances the specifications of outstanding contracts (including
the exercise price of an option) may be modified by the exchange or clearing house to reflect changes in the underlying
interest.

5. Suspension or restriction of trading and pricing relationships 



Market conditions (e.g. illiquidity) and/or the operation of the rules of certain markets (e.g. the suspension of
trading in any contract or contract month because of price limits or ``circuit breakers'') may increase the risk of
loss by making it difficult or impossible to effect transactions or liquidate/offset positions. If you have sold
options, this may increase the risk of loss. 

Further, normal pricing relationships between the underlying interest and the future, and the underlying interest
and the option may not exist. This can occur when, for example, the futures contract underlying the option is subject
to price limits while the option is not. The absence of an underlying reference price may make it difficult to judge
``fair'' value. 



6. Deposited cash and property 



You should familiarize yourself with the protections accorded money or other property you deposit for domestic and
foreign transactions, particularly in the event of a firm insolvency or bankruptcy. The extent to which you may recover
your money or property may be governed by specific legislation or local rules. In some jurisdictions, property which
had been specifically identifiable as your own will be pro-rated in the same manner as cash for purposes of distribution
in the event of a shortfall. 



7. Commission and other charges 



Before you begin to trade, you should obtain a clear explanation of all commission, fees and other charges for which
you will be liable. These charges will affect your net profit (if any) or increase your loss. 



8. Transactions in other jurisdictions 



Transactions on markets in other jurisdictions, including markets formally linked to a domestic market, may expose
you to additional risk. Such markets may be subject to regulation which may offer different or diminished investor
protection. Before you trade you should enquire about any rules relevant to your particular transactions. Your local
regulatory authority will be unable to compel the enforcement of the rules of regulatory authorities or markets in
other jurisdictions where your transactions have been effected. You should ask the firm with which you deal for details
about the types of redress available in both your home jurisdiction and other relevant jurisdictions before you start
to trade. 



9. Currency risks 



The profit or loss in transactions in foreign currency-denominated contracts (whether they are traded in your own
or another jurisdiction) will be affected by fluctuations in currency rates where there is a need to convert from the
currency denomination of the contract to another currency. 



10. Trading facilities 



Most open-outcry and electronic trading facilities are supported by computer-based component systems for the order-routing,
execution, matching, registration or clearing of trades. As with all facilities and systems, they are vulnerable
to temporary disruption or failure. Your ability to recover certain losses may be subject to limits on liability imposed
by the system provider, the market, the clearing house and/or member firms. Such limits may vary: you should ask the
firm with which you deal for details in this respect. 



11. Electronic trading 



Trading on an electronic trading system may differ not only from trading in an open-outcry market but also from trading
on other electronic trading systems. If you undertake transactions on an electronic trading system, you will be exposed
to risks associated with the system including the failure of hardware and software. The result of any system failure
may be that your order is either not executed according to your instructions or is not executed at all. 



12. Off-exchange transactions 



In some jurisdictions, and only then in restricted circumstances, firms are permitted to effect off-exchange transactions.
The firm with which you deal may be acting as your counterparty to the transaction. It may be difficult or impossible
to liquidate an existing position, to assess the value, to determine a fair price or to assess the exposure to risk.
For these reasons, these transactions may involve increased risks. Off-exchange transactions may be less regulated
or subject to a separate regulatory regime. Before you undertake such transactions, you should familiarize yourself
with applicable rules and attendant risks. 

I hereby acknowledge that I have received and understood this risk disclosure statement.

Active Military Service Certified Under Section 401 of Public Law 95-202 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Department of Veterans Affairs.

 

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has amended its regulations concerning persons who are included as having
served on active duty. The need for this action results from recent decisions of the Secretary of the Air Force that
the service of the group known as ``U.S. Civilian Flight Crew and Aviation Ground Support Employees of Northwest Airlines,
Who Served Overseas as a Result of Northwest Airline's Contract with the Air Transport Command during the Period December
14, 1941 through August 14, 1945,'' and the group known as ``U.S. Civilian Female Employees of the U.S. Army Nurse Corps
While Serving in the Defense of Bataan and Corregidor during the Period January 2, 1942 to February 3, 1945,'' constitutes
active military service in the Armed Forces of the United States for purposes of all laws administered by VA. The effect
of this action is to confer veteran status for VA benefit purposes on former members of these groups who were discharged
under honorable conditions. 




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Section 401 of Public Law 95-202 authorized the Secretary of Defense to determine whether the service of members
of civilian or contractual groups shall be considered active duty for the purposes of all laws administered by VA.




A notice of certification of the following group by the Secretary of the Air Force appeared in the 

Federal Register

 of January 4, 1994 (59 FR 297): U.S. Civilian Flight Crew and Aviation Ground Support Employees of Northwest Airlines,
Who Served Overseas as a Result of Northwest Airline's Contract with the Air Transport Command during the Period December
14, 1941 through August 14, 1945. 

A notice of certification of the following group by the Secretary of the Air Force appeared in the 

Federal Register

 of January 4, 1994 (59 FR 298): U.S. Civilian Female Employees of the U.S. Army Nurse Corps While Serving in the Defense
of Bataan and Corregidor During the Period January 2, 1942 to February 3, 1945. 

VA is issuing a final rule to amend the provisions of 38 CFR 3.7(x). Because this change implements determinations
of the Secretary of the Air Force in accordance with Public Law 95-202, which are binding on VA, publication as
a proposal is unnecessary. 

Since a notice of proposed rulemaking is unnecessary and will not be published, this amendment is not a ``rule'' as
defined in and made subject to the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), 5 U.S.C. 601(2). In any case, this regulatory
amendment will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities as they are defined
in the RFA, 5 U.S.C. 601-612. This amendment will not directly affect any small entity. 

There is no affected Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance program number.

Clean Air Act Approval and Promulgation of Title V, Section 507, Small Business Stationary Source Technical and Environmental
Compliance Assistance Program for Region 2 States: New Jersey, New York, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 EPA is finalizing the conditional approvals to each state implementation plan (SIP) revision submitted by the States
of New Jersey and the U.S. Virgin Islands, and the full approvals to each state SIP revision submitted by New York and
the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico as proposed in the 

Federal Register

 on December 21, 1993 for the purpose of establishing State Small Business Stationary Source Technical and Environmental
Compliance Assistance Programs (PROGRAMs). The implementation plans were submitted by the states to satisfy the
Federal mandate of the Clean Air Act (CAA) to ensure that small businesses have access to the technical assistance
and regulatory information necessary to comply with the CAA. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
I. Background 


Implementation of the provisions of the Clean Air Act (CAA), as amended in 1990, will require regulation of many small
businesses so that areas may attain and maintain the national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) and reduce the
emission of air toxics. Small businesses frequently lack the technical expertise and financial resources necessary
to evaluate such regulations and to determine the appropriate mechanisms for compliance. In anticipation of the
impact of these requirements on small businesses, the CAA requires that states adopt a Small Business Stationary
Source Technical and Environmental Compliance Assistance Program (PROGRAM), and submit this PROGRAM as a revision
to the Federally approved SIP. In addition, the CAA directs the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to oversee
these small business assistance programs and report to Congress on their implementation. The requirements for establishing
a PROGRAM are set out in section 507 of Title V of the CAA. In February 1992, EPA issued Guidelines for the Implementation
of Section 507 of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments (Final Guidelines) in order to delineate the federal and state roles
in meeting the new statutory provisions and as a tool to provide further guidance to the states on submitting acceptable
SIP revisions. 
The States of New Jersey, New York, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands have submitted SIP revisions to EPA in order
to satisfy the requirements of section 507. In order to gain full approval, the state submittal must provide for each
of the following PROGRAM components: (1) The establishment of a Small Business Assistance Program (SBAP) to provide
technical and compliance assistance to small businesses; (2) the establishment of a State Small Business Ombudsman
to represent the interests of small businesses in the regulatory process; and (3) the creation of a Compliance Advisory
Panel (CAP) to determine and report on the overall effectiveness of the SBAP. 
EPA proposed to conditionally approve New Jersey's and the U.S. Virgin Islands' SIPs and fully approve New York's
and Puerto Rico's SIPs for the establishment of State PROGRAMs on December 21, 1993 (58 FR 67383). A detailed discussion
of each state's PROGRAM and EPA's evaluations of the PROGRAMs is contained in the above cited 

Federal Register

. 
In addition, a thirty day public comment period was provided in the December 21, 1993 

Federal Register

. Comments were received only on New York's PROGRAM. For New Jersey, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands, no comments
were received. 


II. Summary of Submittals 


A. New Jersey 


New Jersey has met all of the requirements of section 507 of the CAA by submitting a SIP revision on January 11, 1993 that
implements all required PROGRAM elements or delineates milestone dates for when any remaining PROGRAM elements
will be enacted by November 15, 1994. The final plan was adopted by the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection
and Energy (DEPE) on January 11, 1993.

<DOCNO> FR940705-0-00065 </DOCNO>

<TEXT>
 

New Jersey has met the first PROGRAM component by locating the SBAP within DEPE's Office of Permit Information and
Assistance and by committing in its SIP to meet the six requirements set forth in section 507(a) of the CAA. New Jersey
has met the second PROGRAM component and the seventh requirement of section 507(a) of the CAA by designating the New
Jersey Department of Commerce and Economic Development, Office of Business Advocacy, to be the Small Business Ombudsman's
Office. To meet the third PROGRAM component and section 507(e) of the CAA, New Jersey will enact legislation in order
to authorize the establishment of a CAP, and members to the CAP will be appointed no later than November 15, 1994. 
EPA finds that New Jersey presently lacks the requisite authority to establish a CAP. Therefore, EPA is conditionally
approving New Jersey's section 507 program. Full approval will be granted once authority to establish a CAP has been
enacted and submitted as a SIP revision. 


B. New York 


New York has met all of the requirements of section 507 of the CAA by submitting a SIP revision on January 11, 1993 that
implements all required PROGRAM elements or delineates milestone dates for when any remaining PROGRAM elements
will be enacted by November 15, 1994. A copy of New York's adopted legislation authorizing the PROGRAM was sent as a
supplement to the SIP on August 26, 1993. The final plan was adopted by the New York State Department of Environmental
Conservation (DEC) on January 11, 1993. 
New York has met the first PROGRAM component by locating the SBAP within the New York State Environmental Facilities
Corporation (EFC) with oversight provided by DEC's Small Business Section. New York has also committed in its SIP
to meet the six requirements set forth in section 507(a) of the CAA for the Small Business Assistance Program. New York
has met the second PROGRAM component and the seventh requirement of section 507(a) of the CAA by designating the New
York State Department of Economic Development, Division of Small Business, to be the Small Business Ombudsman's
Office. To meet the third PROGRAM component and section 507(e) of the CAA, New York has enacted legislation which authorizes
the duties of the CAP and the appointment of members. Because New York has met all requisite requirements and has the
authority to implement all PROGRAM elements, EPA is approving New York's section 507 program. However, New York still
needs to appoint members to the CAP, which must occur no later than November 15, 1994. 
EPA received two comments on New York's revised SIP during the 30 day public comment period. The comments have been
evaluated by EPA, and a summary of the comments and EPA's responses are set forth below.
 


Comment 

#



1:

 The Environmental Facilities Corporation (EFC), New York's SBAP Office, commented that New York's PROGRAM could
be strengthened if the following changes were made to the SIP: (1) The SBAP is evaluated by the CAP only and not by the
state Ombudsman; and (2) the SBAP is able to address the CAP directly as its own representative instead of the Ombudsman
acting as the representative of the SBAP before the CAP. EFC believes that in order for the PROGRAM to function most
effectively, the Ombudsman and SBAP must be partners with a mutually beneficial relationship. However, this equal
partnership is disturbed under New York's PROGRAM because: the Ombudsman has evaluative power over the SBAP; and
the SBAP does not have the power to represent itself, its program and its efforts directly to the CAP, but is indirectly
represented by a third voice, the Ombudsman. 


Response:

 The two suggestions raised by EFC have been carefully considered by EPA and DEC, and EPA is providing the following
specific responses. 
With regards to the first suggestion, EPA disagrees with the concept of a state Ombudsman not evaluating the SBAP.
In EPA's Final Guidelines, EPA delineates several suggested duties of an Ombudsman's office. Two of the duties include:
conducting independent evaluations of all aspects of the SBAP; and periodically reviewing the work and services
provided by the SBAP with trade associations and small business representatives. One of EPA's criteria in determining
whether the state office chosen as Ombudsman can adequately serve in its duties is whether the Ombudsman's office
has been granted sufficient independent authority to identify problems and make recommendations as they relate
to the implementation of the SBAP. New York has met EPA's criteria by granting the Ombudsman the above evaluative roles.
Furthermore, the Ombudsman's office, in its role as the representative of small businesses, is the place where small
businesses go if they have grievances regarding the SBAP or are not getting the necessary technical assistance. The
Ombudsman must, therefore, have the authority to make recommendations on how the SBAP can be more effective. Thus,
EPA believes New York's SIP should not be revised to remove the Ombudsman's ability to evaluate the SBAP as such an evaluative
role is imperative for the Ombudsman's Office to be a true representative of the small business community. 
With regards to the second suggestion, New York had always intended that the SBAP could present itself, its program
and its efforts directly to the CAP. The SIP also allows for each small business office (including the SBAP, Ombudsman,
and DEC) to provide input to the CAP in the form of progress reports, pending issues and proposed actions for the CAP
to use during its quarterly or semiannual meetings. Nevertheless, in order to alleviate any confusion, New York submitted
a supplement to its SIP which clarifies what New York meant when stating that the ``Ombudsman will serve as the representative
of the SBAP to the Compliance Advisory Panel.'' The word ``representative'' in this phrase means ``overall evaluator''.
In other words, the Ombudsman will provide the CAP with an overall evaluation of the SBAP. The word ``representative''
is not meant to infer that the Ombudsman will act as the agent of the SBAP before the CAP. The supplement further clarifies
that the SBAP can present itself before the CAP to explain its accomplishments, make recommendations, and express
any program needs.

EPA finds that the structure as provided in New York's SIP is acceptable based on section 507 of the CAA and EPA's 

Final Guidelines.

 Therefore, EPA is finalizing its approval of New York's PROGRAM. 


Comment 

#



2: 

 The Erie County Environmental Compliance Services Program commented that New York's SBAP should be encouraged to
utilize the services of local agencies that already provide assistance to small businesses in the State. The Erie
County program, as well as several other local programs throughout New York State, already successfully provide
many of the services/functions in rendering technical assistance to small businesses as proposed for the SBAP. The
Erie County program endorses that local programs continue to receive state and federal funds, including funds to
be supported by Title V fees, so that the local programs can work with the SBAP on technical assistance to the small business
community. 


Response:

 EPA supports Erie County's endorsement that New York use existing local infrastructures as a means to reach out to
the small business community. New York also endorses the concept. One reason DEC chose EFC as the SBAP is that EFC has
the ability to subcontract with local agencies. EFC fully intends to limit the size of its in-house staff working on
the SBAP and will use existing local programs to perform audits and conduct other field activities where the scope
and volume of those activities exceed EFC's in-house staff capacity. 


C. Puerto Rico 


Puerto Rico has met all of the requirements of section 507 of the CAA by submitting a SIP revision on November 16, 1992
that implements all required PROGRAM elements or delineates milestone dates for when any remaining PROGRAM elements
will be enacted by November 15, 1994. Supplemental information was sent on January 14, 1993 and October 25, 1993, which
included Puerto Rico's adopted legislation authorizing the PROGRAM. The final plan was adopted by the Puerto Rico
Environmental Quality Board (EQB) on November 4, 1992. 
Puerto Rico has met the first PROGRAM component by locating the SBAP within EQB's Planning Division and committing
in its SIP to meet the six requirements set forth in section 507(a) of the CAA. Puerto Rico has met the second PROGRAM
component and the seventh requirement of section 507(a) of the CAA by recommending that the Governor choose the existing
Citizen's Ombudsman's, the Puerto Rico Citizen's Investigating Official as Puerto Rico's Ombudsman's Office.
Legislation has been enacted which provides authority for the Ombudsman's duties. To meet the third PROGRAM component
and section 507(e) of the CAA, Puerto Rico has enacted legislation which authorizes the duties of the CAP and the appointment
of members. Because Puerto Rico has met all the requisite requirements and has the authority to implement all PROGRAM
elements, EPA is approving Puerto Rico's section 507 program. However, Puerto Rico still needs to have an Ombudsman's
Office in place and appoint members to the CAP, which must occur no later than November 15, 1994. 


D. The U.S. Virgin Islands 


The U.S. Virgin Islands has met all of the requirements of section 507 of the CAA by submitting a SIP revision on January
15, 1993 that implements all required PROGRAM elements or delineates milestone dates for when any remaining PROGRAM
elements will be enacted by November 15, 1994. The final plan was adopted by the Virgin Islands Department of Planning
and Natural Resources (DPNR) on January 14, 1993. 
The U.S. Virgin Islands has met the first PROGRAM component by locating the SBAP within DPNR's Division of Environmental
Protection and by committing in its SIP to meet the six requirements set forth in section 507(a) of the CAA. The U.S.
Virgin Islands has met the second PROGRAM component and the seventh requirement of section 507(a) of the CAA by designating
the Virgin Islands Small Business Development Agency to be the Small Business Ombudsman's Office. The Ombudsman's
Office will be assisted by the Small Business Development Center of the University of the Virgin Islands. To meet the
third PROGRAM component and section 507(e) of the CAA, the U.S. Virgin Islands will enact legislation to authorize
the establishment of a CAP, and members to the CAP will be appointed no later than November 15, 1994. 
EPA finds that the U.S. Virgin Islands presently lacks the requisite authority to establish a CAP. Therefore, EPA
is conditionally approving the U.S. Virgin Islands' section 507 program. Full approval will be granted once authority
to establish a CAP has been enacted and submitted as a SIP revision. 


III. Final Action 


EPA is conditionally approving the SIP revisions submitted by the States of New Jersey and the U.S. Virgin Islands,
and fully approving the SIP revisions submitted by New York and Puerto Rico. The revisions were made to satisfy the
requirements of section 507 of the CAA. 
Because New Jersey and the U.S. Virgin Islands have made commitments that EPA believes meet the requirements necessary
for EPA to grant conditional approval, EPA is granting a conditional approval under section 110(k)(4) of the Act.
New Jersey and the U.S. Virgin Islands must meet their commitment to have their programs fully operational by November
15, 1994 and submit these requirements to EPA by that date. If New Jersey or the U.S. Virgin Islands fails to adopt or
submit any of these requirements to EPA within this time frame, this approval will become a disapproval on that date.
EPA will notify the State by letter that this action has occurred. At that time, this commitment will no longer be a part
of the approved New Jersey or U.S. Virgin Islands SIP. EPA subsequently will publish a notice in the notice section
of the 

Federal Register

. If the state adopts and submits these requirements to EPA within the applicable time frame, the conditionally approved
submission will remain a part of the SIP until EPA takes final action approving or disapproving the new submittal.
If EPA disapproves the new submittal, the conditionally approved Small Business Plan will also be removed from the
SIP. If EPA approves the submittal, those newly approved rules will become a part of the SIP and will modify or replace
the commitment and the Small Business Plan on which the conditional approval is based.

If the conditional approval is converted to a disapproval, the sanctions clock under section 179(a) will begin. This
clock will begin at the time EPA issues the final disapproval or on the date the State fails to meet its commitment. In
the latter case, EPA will notify the State by letter that the conditional approval has been converted to a disapproval
and that the sanctions clock has begun. If the State does not submit and EPA does not approve the rule on which the disapproval
was based within 18 months of the disapproval, EPA must impose one of the sanctions under section 179(b)_highway funding
restrictions or the offset sanction. In addition, the final disapproval triggers the federal implementation plan
(FIP) requirement under section 110(c). 
This action has been classified as a Table 3 Action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in
the 

Federal Register

 on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214-2225) as revised by an October 4, 1993 memorandum from Michael H. Shapiro, Acting
Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. A future notice will inform the general public of these tables. On
January 6, 1989 the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived Table 2 and 3 SIP revisions (54 FR 2222) from the requirements
of Section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for a period of two years. The EPA has submitted a request for a permanent waiver
for Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions. The OMB has agreed to continue the temporary waiver until such time as it rules
on EPA's request. This request continues in effect under Executive Order 12866 which superseded Executive Order
12291 on September 30, 1993. 
Nothing in this action shall be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for a revision to any state implementation plan. Each request for revision to the state implementation plan shall
be considered separately in light of specific technical, economic, and environmental factors and in relation to
relevant statutory and regulatory requirements. 
Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 et. seq., EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing
the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities. 5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify that
the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small
businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government entities with jurisdiction over populations of
less than 50,000. 
By today's action, EPA is conditionally or fully approving four (4) State programs created for the purpose of assisting
small businesses in complying with existing statutory and regulatory requirements. The programs being conditionally
or fully approved today do not impose any new regulatory burden on small businesses; these are programs under which
small businesses may elect to take advantage of assistance provided by the state. Therefore, because the EPA's conditional
or full approvals of these four programs do not impose any new regulatory requirements on small businesses, EPA certifies
that this action does not have a significant economic impact on any small entities affected. 
Under section 307(b)(1) of the CAA, petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed in the United States
Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit within 60 days from date of publication. Filing a petition for reconsideration
by the Administrator of this final rule does not affect the finality of this rule for the purposes of judicial review,
nor does it extend the time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed, and shall not postpone the effectiveness
of such rule or action. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements (see section
307(b)(2)).

Glycol Ethers Category; Toxic Chemical Release Reporting; Community Right-to-Know 



 

<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 EPA is redefining the glycol ethers category list of toxic chemicals subject to reporting under section 313 of the
Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act of 1986 (EPCRA). EPA is changing the present definition of the
glycol ethers category to exclude the high molecular weight glycol ethers that do not, in EPA's judgement, meet the
criteria set out in EPCRA section 313(d). This redefinition of the glycol ethers category, which is based on EPA's
review of available human health data on short-chain length glycol ethers, eliminates the EPCRA section 313 reporting
requirements for those glycol ethers known as surfactant glycol ethers. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 


I. Introduction 


A. Statutory Authority


This action is issued under section 313(d) of the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act of 1986 (42 U.S.C.
11023, ``EPCRA''). EPCRA is also referred to as Title III of the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act (SARA)
of 1986. 


B. Background


Section 313 of EPCRA requires certain facilities manufacturing, processing, or otherwise using toxic chemicals
to report their environmental releases of such chemicals annually. Beginning with the 1991 reporting year, such
facilities also must report pollution prevention and recycling data for such chemicals, pursuant to section 6607
of the Pollution Prevention Act (42 U.S.C. 13106). Section 313 established an initial list of toxic chemicals that
was comprised of more than 300 chemicals and 20 chemical categories. Section 313(d) authorizes EPA to add chemicals
to or delete chemicals from the list, and sets forth criteria for these actions. Under section 313(e), any person may
petition EPA to add chemicals to or delete chemicals from the list. EPA has added to and deleted chemicals from the original
statutory list.
EPA issued a statement of petition policy and guidance in the 

Federal Register

 of February 4, 1987 (52 FR 3479), to provide guidance regarding the recommended content and format for petitions.
On May 23, 1991 (56 FR 23703), EPA published guidance regarding the recommended content of petitions to delete individual
members of the section 313 metal compound categories. 


II. Effective Date 


This action becomes effective immediately. Thus, the last year in which facilities had to report releases of high
molecular weight glycol ethers now excluded from the list was 1993, covering releases that occurred in 1992. The effect
of this category redefinition is that, since the high molecular weight glycol ethers being excluded from the category
will not be on the section 313 list when facilities report in 1994 for releases that occurred in 1993, these reports
and all subsequent reports need not include release data for these glycol ethers. Facilities will therefore not have
to collect release information for any releases of the excluded glycol ethers that occurred during the 1993 reporting
year or for any releases that occur in the future. Section 313(d)(4) provides that ``[a]ny revision [to the section
313 list] made on or after January 1 and before December 1 of any calendar year shall take effect beginning with the next
calendar year. Any revision made on or after December 1 and before January 1 shall take effect beginning with the calendar
year following the next calendar year.'' The Agency interprets this delayed effective date provision to apply only
to actions that add chemicals to the section 313 list. For deletions, the Agency may, in its discretion, make such actions
immediately effective. An immediate effective date is authorized, in these circumstances, under 5 U.S.C. section
553(d)(1) since a deletion from the section 313 list relieves a regulatory restriction. 
The Agency believes that the purpose behind the section 313(d)(4) effective date provision is to allow facilities
adequate planning time to incorporate newly added chemicals to their Toxic Release Inventory (TRI) release data
collection processes. A facility would not need additional planning time to not report releases of a given chemical.
Thus, a reasonable construction of section 313(d)(4), given the overall purpose and structure of EPCRA _ to provide
the public with information about chemicals which meet the criteria for inclusion on the section 313 list _ is to apply
the delayed effective date requirement only to additions to the list. Where the Agency has determined, as it has with
the excluded glycol ethers, that a chemical does not satisfy the criteria of section 313(d)(2)(A)-(C), no purpose
is served by requiring facilities to collect release data or file release reports for that chemical, or, therefore,
by leaving that chemical on the section 313 list for any additional period of time. Nothing in the legislative history
suggests that section 313(d)(4) was intended to apply to deletions as well as additions; indeed, such a construction
would be incongruous, since deleted chemicals, by definition, do not satisfy the criteria for being on the section
313 list and their deletion from that list should not be delayed in the absence of any compelling reason to the contrary.
This construction of section 313(d)(4) is also consistent with previous rules deleting chemicals from the section
313 list. Indeed, the Agency has not given any of its rules deleting chemicals from the section 313 list the delayed
effective dates specified in section 313(d)(4). 
EPA has not deleted all glycol ethers from reporting requirements under EPCRA section 313. Reporting will still be
required for those glycol ethers which meet the revised definition. 


III. Description of the EPCRA Section 313 Glycol Ethers Category


In the 

Federal Register

 of July 6, 1993 (58 FR 36180), EPA issued a proposed rule to redefine the glycol ethers category on the EPCRA section
313 list of toxic chemicals. EPA has evaluated the current scope of the section 313 glycol ethers category and believes
that it is overly broad. The existing category includes substances that traditionally have not been considered glycol
ethers. Also, it is apparent that this category contains members that do not meet the EPCRA section 313(d)(2) criteria
for listing. EPA has reviewed the current glycol ethers category and is redefining it to exclude the surfactant glycol
ethers. Surfactant glycol ethers are those glycol ethers with pendant alkyl groups which typically consist of eight
or more carbon atoms (i.e., high molecular weight glycol ethers). However, EPA does not believe that the category
can be more narrowly defined at this time. 
EPA's revised glycol ethers category for which section 313 reporting is required, consists of those glycol ethers
which meet the following definition: 




Certain Glycol Ethers:


R - (OCH

2

CH

2

)

n

 - OR







Where: 


n = 1, 2, or 3; 
R = alkyl C7 or less, or 
R = phenyl or alkyl substituted phenyl; 
R' = H or alkyl C7 or less; or 
OR' consisting of carboxylic acid ester, sulfate, phosphate, nitrate, or sulfonate. 



IV. Rationale for Redefinition 


EPA's concerns for the included chemicals is based on a review of available human health data on short-chain length
glycol ethers. Specifically, EPA believes that these chemicals meet the criterion of EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B)
because the individual members of this category can be reasonably anticipated to cause one or more of the following
effects: Kidney toxicity, liver toxicity, adverse blood effects, adverse central nervous system effects, reproductive
effects, and developmental effects. EPA believes that the category can be redefined to exclude those glycol ethers
known as surfactant glycol ethers because these high molecular weight glycol ethers do not meet the listing criteria
in section 313(d)(2)(A) or (B). None of the chemicals in the current glycol ethers category meet the toxicity criterion
of section 313(d)(2)(C) based on their ecotoxicity. EPA's rationale for this redefinition is detailed in the proposed
rule and is based on the Agency's review of various relevant materials. 


V. Response to Comments 


EPA received 11 comments on the proposed rule, all in support of the proposed redefinition of the glycol ethers category.
However, several of the commenters expressed the opinion that the proposed rule does not narrow the definition sufficiently,
and that EPA should consider a further narrowing of the definition in the future. As discussed below, EPA does not believe
that it currently has sufficient data to further narrow the category definition. 
Two commenters, the Chemical Manufacturers Association (CMA), Propylene Glycol Ethers Panel, and CMA Ethylene
Glycol Ethers Panel, stated that the name of the category should be changed to ``certain glycol ethers'' to more accurately
characterize the chemicals that are within the category. EPA has incorporated this comment, since this category
does not consist of all chemicals that contain the glycol ether functionality. 
One commenter, General Electric, suggested that the definition should not identify reportable glycol ethers by
molecular structure. Instead, the commenter recommended listing the glycol ethers of concern individually, and
identifying those which must be reported on an individual basis. All remaining glycol ethers would then be reported
in an aggregate form. EPA believes this approach to defining the category is inappropriate and unnecessary. EPA has
identified by molecular formula a specific group of glycol ethers having a common structure that pose similar hazards.
EPA currently believes that the most appropriate way to report on this group of glycol ethers is in aggregate by category.
A listing of glycol ethers as proposed by the commenter may exclude from reporting certain glycol ethers within the
scope of the definition in this rulemaking that meet the section 313(d)(2) criterion. Therefore, EPA is adopting
the redefinition of the glycol ethers category based on a molecular structure formula. A reporting facility must
make aggregate reporting threshold and estimated release determinations for all glycol ethers in the category.

The Soap and Detergent Association proposed that the revised definition exclude sulfonate in the category of OR'
because ``carbon sulfur bonds are not easily broken and, therefore, sulfonates are not readily hydrolyzable from
surfactants.'' EPA proposed the inclusion of sulfonate not because of the possible reaction at the carbon sulfur
bond in the sulfonate, e.g., desulfonation of aromatic sulfonates, but rather because the sulfonate ion is a reactive
leaving group and thus can reasonably be anticipated to be hydrolyzed to yield a glycol ether of concern. Specifically
hydrolysis of R-(OCH

2

CH

2

)

n

OSO

2

R









 (where R









 is any organic substituent) yields R-(OCH

2

CH

2

)

n

OH and R''SO

2

OH. Therefore, EPA reaffirms its inclusion of sulfonate as an appropriate member in the category of OR




. 
The Chemical Manufacturers Association stated that the category should be limited to four specific ethylene glycol
ether solvents: 2-Methoxyethanol, 2-ethoxyethanol, and their acetates. As stated in the proposed rule, with respect
to the glycol ethers and developmental effects, there is evidence that the toxicity is reduced going from the methyl
to the butyl ether. However, data for other toxic effects on glycol ethers with pendant alkyl groups of one to seven
carbons or a phenyl group do not indicate a trend towards increased toxicity based on chain length for other toxic effects.
Low molecular weight ethylene glycol ethers disturb the hemopoiesis and the blood picture at low doses. Hemolysis
has been reported in varying degrees for ethylene glycol ethers of one to five carbons in the alkyl chain. The optimum
alkyl chain length for hemolysis is four carbons. 2-Phenoxyethanol has also been found to cause intravascular hemolysis.
Therefore, the concerns for ethylene glycol ethers are not limited to the four specific compounds mentioned by the
commenter. 
In the proposed rule, EPA requested comment on whether the definition of R' should include only straight chained alkyl
groups of seven of fewer carbons or both straight and branched alkyl groups of seven or fewer carbons. No comments on
this issue were received. Therefore, the definition of R' will include both straight and branched alkyl groups of
seven or fewer carbons. Rochester Midland, Soap and Detergent Association, Henkel Corporation, and Union Carbide
Corporation asked that the definition also exclude alkylated phenols containing seven or more carbon atoms. As stated
in the proposed rule, 2-phenoxyethanol is known to cause hemolysis. No data have been found for alkyl substituted
phenoxyethanol derivatives. Henkel Corporation stated that ``[t]he C

8

, C

9

, and C

12

 alkyl phenol ethoxylates have also been used for many years as surfactants. There is no evidence that they present
adverse human effects such as those which caused the listing of the glycol ether category or would otherwise meet the
section 313 criteria.'' However, this commenter did not supply data to substantiate this assertion. The Soap and
Detergent Corporation provided two studies to support its position (Smyth and Calandra, 1969; Dudek and Ribelin,
1988). Neither of these studies specifies the composition of the test material by number of ethylene oxide units.
The commenter did provide the typical weight percent of the test substances as sold in commerce. Even if EPA assumed
these typical compositions represent the test materials of these two studies, the dose levels presented in the studies
would not be considered adequate to establish the lack of toxicity associated with ethylene glycol ethers with alkyl
groups consisting of seven or greater carbon atoms. 
Because only phenoxyethanol has been tested for systemic toxicity, change in the glycol ethers category definition
which would exclude alkylphenol ethoxylates is not supportable, based on the available data. To evaluate the alkylphenol
ethoxylates subcategory of the ethylene glycol ether category, EPA would require subchronic toxicity data for one
or more specific members of the category (e.g., 2-nonylphenoxyethanol). In the absence of these data, the Agency
believes that the glycol ethers category should continue to include these substances. 
General Electric contended that individual glycol ethers should be listed in lieu of a category because EPCRA section
313 ``clearly states that additions to the EPCRA section 313 list must be done on a chemical-by-chemical basis. Each
statutory provision that deals with revising the section 313 list speaks only in terms of a chemical-by-chemical
basis, and EPCRA is silent on the issue of regulating by chemical categories.'' The Agency believes that the statutory
authority to add ``a chemical'' to the list may be reasonably interpreted to include the authority to add groups or
categories of chemicals to the list, particularly in light of the fact that the original list adopted by Congress in
section 313(c) of EPCRA included 20 chemical categories. These consist mostly of metal compounds categories, but
also include categories of organic chemicals, such as glycol ethers (as noted in the proposed rule, Congress listed
this category without a delimiting definition).
General Electric further contended that Congress listed ``glycol ethers'' in addition to the two individually listed
glycol ethers, ``2-methoxyethanol'' and ``2-ethoxyethanol,'' to allow facilities the option of aggregating the
releases of the two individually listed glycol ether chemicals and filing one TRI Form R report for ``glycol ether''
rather than two separate Form R reports. EPA does not accept this interpretation of Congress' intent in listing 20
chemical categories on the original EPCRA section 313(c) list of chemicals subject to TRI reporting. There is no clear
statement of Congressional intent to adopt the type of ``optional'' reporting scheme advocated by General Electric.
Indeed, the legislative history cited by General Electric supports EPA's current interpretation and implementation
of EPCRA's reporting structure, i.e., persons manufacturing, processing, or otherwise using more than one member
of a chemical category above the applicable reporting threshold may report the releases of all such chemicals, in
the aggregate, on a single Form R report, rather than listing data separately for each chemical in the group. 
Furthermore, contrary to General Electric's contention, several of the original chemical categories did not have
corresponding ``individual'' chemicals listed on the original (CAS number specific) section 313(c) list. In their
comments, General Electric acknowledged this to be the case only with regard to the polybrominated biphenyls (PBBs)
category. However, there was no individual listing for any barium compounds, cadmium compounds, chromium compounds,
or several other metal compounds in the original list transmitted to EPA by Congress. See 53 FR 4500; February 16, 1988.
Taken to its logical conclusion, General Electric's interpretation would result in no reporting of any members of
the PBBs category unless and until EPA listed individual members of that category. EPA does not believe that this would
be consistent with Congress' intent in listing this category on the initial section 313(c) list. If Congress had intended
to include category listings as an optional method of reporting individually listed chemicals, it could have clearly
stated so in the statute. At a minimum, some members of all the listed chemical categories would have been included
in the CAS number specific list. In sum, EPA believes that its interpretation of the category reporting structure
is a reasonable reading of EPCRA. 
General Electric objected to the continued listing of a glycol ethers category because categories are difficult
for EPA to administer and/or for the public and industry to understand. In addition, the commenter contended that
industry compliance with reporting and supplier notification requirements is more difficult for categories, such
as glycol ethers, because facilities are not provided with discrete chemical names and Chemical Abstract Service
(CAS) registry numbers. The commenter contended that these problems are magnified in the case of the glycol ethers
category because the category is defined by molecular structure formula. 
Since the glycol ethers category consists of chemicals that are similar chemically and in potential effect, EPA believes
that this category will not be difficult for the public or industry to understand or for the Agency to administer. The
Agency will work with the public and the regulated community to develop, as appropriate, any interpretations and
guidance the Agency determines are necessary to facilitate accurate reporting for the ``certain glycol ethers''
category. The Agency does not believe that the glycol ethers category is unique in that it is defined by molecular structure
formula. All of the metal compound categories are defined based on molecular structure formula, i.e., to be considered
a member of a metal compound category, the compound must consist of the parent metal and at least one substituent group.
Both the chlorophenols and cyanide compound categories are defined by molecular structure formulas on the EPCRA
section 313 list. EPA believes that defining the category by molecular structure formula ensures that all members
of the category that meet the EPCRA section 313(d)(2) criteria are included and thus reportable. 
Three commenters, the Soap and Detergent Association, Proctor and Gamble Co., and Union Carbide contended that EPA
should be consistent between EPCRA and TSCA on its treatment of identical materials. Union Carbide cited the TSCA
section 8(b) Inventory provisions. EPA believes that the differing treatment of glycol ether species with a low degree
of ethoxylation under EPCRA and TSCA is appropriate given the differing purposes and standards of TSCA section 8(b)
and EPCRA section 313. TSCA is concerned with the regulation of unreasonable risks to human health and the environment
posed by chemical substances and mixtures in commerce; the section 8(b) Inventory, with few exceptions, provides
a list of those chemical substances and mixtures. For purposes of developing an inventory of chemical substances
in commerce, it is less important to specify whether those substances consist of a discrete species, e.g., chloroform,
or a species with a range of molecular weights. EPCRA's goal is to provide the general public with a broad range of information
on releases of certain chemicals. 
Under TSCA, for example, glycol ether surfactant ``mixtures'' are considered as a single entity for purposes of entry
on the Inventory; however, for purposes of reviewing the potential health or environmental unreasonable risks posed
by activities involving such chemical substances, the impacts of their various components would be considered.
Because the intent of EPCRA section 313 is community right-to-know, EPA wants to ensure that the public has access
to information on each listed toxic chemical or chemical category to which the public could be exposed, regardless
of whether it is in a mixture. Therefore, where a surfactant contains species with a low degree of ethoxylation that
fit the glycol ether category definition, EPA requires that those chemicals be reported. 
Union Carbide also contended that ``[a]s a legal matter, the current and proposed definitions exclude polymers from
the category of glycol ethers. Since polymers potentially include their low molecular weight species (n = 1, 2, 3),
the exemption for polymers precludes the need to report low molecular weight species under [s]ection 313.'' 
EPA disagrees with Union Carbide's conclusion regarding species with low degrees of ethoxylation. The proposed
definition being finalized today continues to exclude polymer molecules (i.e., those molecules which include at
least four covalently linked subunits at least two of which are internal subunits), and to include low molecular weight
glycol ethers with a low degree of ethoxylation. The change in regulatory text deleting the phrase ``polymers are
excluded from this category,'' does not change EPA's position regarding the scope of the glycol ethers category.


One commenter, the Cosmetic, Toiletry, and Fragrance Association, stated support for the proposal to change the
definition of glycol ethers on other EPA lists. Today's action is not intended, and should not be inferred to affect
the definition or regulatory requirements for glycol ethers under any statute or EPA program other than the Toxic
Release Inventory reporting requirements under EPCRA section 313 and the Pollution Prevention Act section 6607.
Specifically, the redefinition of glycol ethers on the EPCRA section 313 list does not in any way alter their definition
under section 112(b) of the Clean Air Act (CAA), 42 U.S.C. section 7412(b) as amended, or, by virtue of their status
as ``hazardous air pollutants'' (HAP) under the CAA, as ``hazardous substances'' under section 101(14) of the Comprehensive
Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), 42 U.S.C section 9601(14). 



 VI. Rulemaking Record


The record supporting this final rule is contained in the docket number OPPTS-400073B. All documents, including
an index of the docket, are available for viewing and photocopying in the TSCA Nonconfidential Information Center
(NCIC), also known as the TSCA Public Docket Office, from noon to 4 p.m., Monday through Friday, excluding legal holidays.
The TSCA NCIC is located at EPA Headquarters, Rm. NE-B607, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460.



VII. Regulatory Assessment Requirements 


A. Executive Order 12866


Under Executive Order (E.O.) 12866 (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory
action is ``significant'' and therefore subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the requirements
of the Executive Order. Section 3(f) of the Order defines a ``significant regulatory action'' as an action likely
to lead to a rule (1) Having an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely and materially affecting
a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local
or tribal governments or communities (also referred to as ``economically significant''); (2) creating serious
inconsistency or otherwise interfering with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially altering
the budgetary impacts of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs; or (4) raising novel legal or policy issues
arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in this Executive Order. 
Pursuant to the terms of this Executive Order, it has been determined that this final rule is not ``significant'' and
therefore not subject to OMB review. 


B. Regulatory Flexibility Act



The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 requires each Federal agency to perform a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis
for all rules that are likely to have a ``significant impact on a substantial number of small entities.''
40 CFR part 372 exempts certain small businesses (specifically, those facilities with fewer than 10 full-time employees)
from reporting. This exclusion exempts abo
