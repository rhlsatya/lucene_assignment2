OFFICE OF PERSONNEL MANAGEMENT











Recruitment and Relocation Bonuses and Retention Allowances



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Office of Personnel Management.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Proposed rule with request for comments.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is issuing proposed regulations to provide agencies with greater flexibility
in paying recruitment and relocation bonuses and retention allowances (the 3 R's). The proposed regulations revise
certain requirements in the current regulations to maximize agency discretion in using these flexibilities. The
3 R's were authorized by the Federal Employees Pay Comparability Act of 1990 (FEPCA).



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

On August 19, 1992, OPM published final regulations at 57 FR 37394 to authorize the payment of recruitment and relocation
bonuses and retention allowances (the 3 R's) under the Federal Employees Pay Comparability Act of 1990 (FEPCA). These
regulations finalized interim regulations that were published on March 28, 1991 (56 FR 12833). Overall, use of the
3 R's has been limited.



In a memorandum to the Interagency Advisory Group on October 24, 1991, OPM advised agencies to consider using the 3
R's before requesting new or increased special salary rates under 5 U.S.C. 5305. In most situations, the use of the
3 R's to solve staffing problems will be less expensive than special rates. Special rates are basic pay for such purposes
as retirement benefits, premium pay, and promotions, whereas the 3 R's are not basic pay for any purposes. The 3 R's
are also generally less expensive than superior qualifications appointments. Superior qualifications appointments,
like special salary rates, have a lasting effect on future pay entitlements.

When necessary, the 3 R's may be used in combination with special salary rates and superior qualifications appointments.
However, payment of one of the 3 R's alone may be the most appropriate solution for a staffing problem. For example,
a candidate may prefer a lump-sum payment to address his or her immediate needs instead of an increase in basic pay that
would be received in relatively small amounts over a long period of time.

Agencies have found it difficult to use the 3 R's and have requested changes in the current regulations. OPM also has
approved variations to the requirements bonus regulations. (This is discussed below under appointments required
for recruitment bonus purposes.) OPM is proposing the regulatory changes discussed below to increase agencies'
discretion in administering the 3 R's.



Recruitment Bonuses





Candidate quality.

 In   575.101, 575.104(b)(2), 575.104(c)(1) and (c)(2) (i) and (iii), and 575.108(b), the current regulations
allow payment of a recruitment bonus only when, in the absence of such a bonus, agencies would encounter difficulty
in filling the position with a 

high quality candidate.

 Same agencies' recruitment needs are not limited to high quality candidates. Therefore, they have not considered
offering recruitment bonuses before requesting approval of special salary rates. (OPM approval of special rates
is not dependent upon the recruitment of high quality candidates.) The proposed regulations would allow an agency
to pay a recruitment bonus to any qualified candidate the agency wishes to recruit for a difficult-to-fill position.
The agency would determine the level of candidate quality it needs to target.



Length of appointment and service agreement.

 In  575.103, the current definition of ``employee'' for recruitment bonus purposes requires an appointment
of at least 2 years. The proposed regulations would delete the language regarding the minimum length of appointment;
however, since, in  575.106(b), the proposed regulations require a service agreement of at least 6 months,
any appointment would have to be at least that long. Currently, a minimum 12-month service agreement is required.
Reducing the requirement to 6 months would give agencies more flexibility.



Break-in service.

 To meet the current definition of ``newly appointed'' in  575.103, a candidate with prior Federal Government
service must have a break in service of at least 1 year. The proposed regulations would reduce this break-in-service
restriction to 90 days. This parallels the 90-day-break-in-service restriction for superior qualifications appointments
in  531.203(b)(2). It allows agencies to consider paying a recruitment bonus in more circumstances as an alternative
to paying advanced in-hire rates for superior qualifications.

The proposed regulations add two authorized exceptions to the break-in-service rule in  575.103. The first
is a permanent appointment that follows a provisional appointment (as defined in  316.403). The second is an
appointment that follows a temporary appointment, provided the temporary appointment was neither full-time nor
the principal employment of the candidate. This would allow agencies to pay recruitment bonuses in situations like
those approved by OPM as variations to the current regulations. Under the variations, bonuses were paid to medical
officers who served in temporary appointments prior to being offered permanent appointments. The medical officers
did not meet the break-in-service requirement under current regulations. OPM determined that payment of recruitment
bonuses was appropriate because the temporary positions were neither full-time nor the candidates' principal employment.
Also, the inability of the hiring officials to take advantage of such opportunities would have resulted in lengthy
recruitment efforts to find qualified candidates with the required specialized skills. (These variations were
reported in former Federal Personnel Manual Bulletins 575-4, April 20, 1993; 575-5, October 25, 1993;
and 575-6, November 12, 1993; and in OPM's Provisional Notice No. 575-1, May 25, 1994.)



Written determination.

 In  575.104(c)(1), the current regulations for recruitment bonuses require a written determination made
on a case-by-case basis for each employee. The proposed regulations would allow an agency to make a single written
determination applicable to a group of candidates for positions that the agency targets as difficult to fill. This
would not require OPM's prior approval.



Reporting requirement.

 In  575.108(b), the current regulations for recruitment bonuses require an annual written report by each agency
on its use of recruitment bonuses. The proposed regulations would remove this requirement. However, each agency
would retain responsibility for monitoring its use of recruitment bonuses.

Relocation Bonuses





Candidate quality.

 In   575.201, 575.204 (c)(1) and (c)(2) (i) and (iii), and 575.208(b), the current regulations allow
payment of a relocation bonus only when, in the absence of such a bonus, difficulty would be encountered in filling
the position with a ``high quality candidate.'' As for recruitment bonuses (discussed above), payment of relocation
bonuses should be considered before requesting approval of special salary rates for difficult-to-fill positions.
The proposed regulations would allow an agency to pay a relocation bonus to any employee the agency wishes to relocate
to a position that would otherwise be difficult to fill.



Length of appointment.

 In  575.203, the current definition of ``employee'' for relocation bonus purposes requires an appointment
of at least 2 years. The proposed regulation would allow the employee's appointment to be any length of time determined
appropriate by the agency. Also, the proposed definition would make a technical change to clarify that a relocation
bonus may be paid to an employee whose duty station is changed to a different commuting area permanently as well as temporarily.



Written determination.

 In  575.204(d), the current regulations provide for exceptions to case-by-case approvals of relocation bonuses
with prior OPM approval. The proposed regulations would allow such exceptions without prior OPM approval.



Reporting requirement.

 In  575.208(b), the current regulations for relocation bonuses require an annual written report by each agency
on its use of relocation bonuses. The proposed regulations would remove this requirement.



Retention Allowances





Length of appointment.

 In  575.303, the current definition of ``employee'' for retention allowance purposes requires an appointment
of at least 2 years. The proposed regulations would allow the employee's appointment to be any length of time determined
appropriate by the agency.



Length of service.

 In  575.304(a), the current regulations permit payment of a retention allowance only to an employee who (1)
has completed 1 year of continuous service with the agency immediately prior to such payment, or (2) has completed
a period of employment established under a service agreement for a recruitment or relocation bonus. the proposed
regulations would allow an agency to pay a retention allowance to an employee with less than 1 year of continuous service.
However, the proposed regulations continue to require that an employee under a service agreement for a recruitment
or relocation bonus complete such an agreement before receiving a retention allowance.



Reason for being likely to leave.

 In   575.304(b) and 575.305(c), the current regulations permit payment of a retention allowance to an
employee only if he or she is likely to leave the Federal service for employment outside the executive, legislative,
or judicial branch of the Federal Government. The proposed regulations would allow payment of a retention allowance
to an employee who is likely to leave not only for employment outside the Federal Government, but for a reason other
than employment, such as retirement.



Reporting requirement.

 In  575.308(b), the current regulations for retention allowances require an annual written report by each
agency on its use of retention allowances. The proposed regulations would remove this requirement.



Miscellaneous



In  575.103, the definition of ``commuting area'' is not germane to the payment of recruitment bonuses and would
be removed by the proposed regulations. (The definition would remain in  575.203 for payment of relocation
bonuses.) Finally, the proposed regulations add a new paragraph (d) in  575.306 to clarify that a retention
allowance is not pay for purposes of a lump-sum payment for annual leave under 5 U.S.C. 5551. (See Comptroller General
opinion B-249816, March 8, 1993.)



E.O. 12866, Regulatory Review



This rule has been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget in accordance with E.O. 12866.



Regulatory Flexibility Act



I certify that these regulations would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities
because they would apply only to Federal agencies and employees.

Nutrition Labeling of Ground Beef and Hamburger 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Extension of comment period. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 On May 24, 1994, the Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) published a proposed rule (59 FR 26916) to amend the Federal
meat inspection regulations by permitting percentage labeling for lean and fat on ground beef and hamburger, provided
such product labeling contains nutrition information. FSIS has received a request to extend the comment period on
the proposed rule so that additional data and information can be provided. FSIS has determined that the request should
be granted and, therefore, is extending the comment period on the proposed rule for 45 days. FSIS is continuing to evaluate
the effect that this extension will have on issues such as the survey for significant participation for voluntary
nutrition labeling and the approval of labeling for ground beef and hamburger pending the outcome of this rulemaking.




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On May 24, 1994, FSIS published in the 

Federal Register

 a proposed rule (59 FR 26916) to amend the Federal meat inspection regulations by permitting percentage labeling
for lean and fat on ground beef and hamburger, provided such product labeling contains nutrition information. The
proposed rule would provide increased flexibility in the labeling of ground beef and hamburger, and would also allow
consumers to readily identify and differentiate between the varying lean/fat percentages of these products. 



Interested persons were given until July 8, 1994, in which to comment on the proposed rule. FSIS has received a request
from a consumer interest group to extend the comment period on the proposed rule to allow additional time for consumer
survey data to be gathered and submitted. FSIS noted in its proposed rule on percentage labeling for lean/fat on ground
beef and hamburger (59 FR 26916) that it had not assessed whether multiple uses of the term ``percent lean'' might result
in consumer misunderstanding that would limit informed consumer choice. The consumer survey will provide information
on consumer perceptions of the terms ``lean,'' ``extra lean,'' ``percent lean,'' ``reduced fat,'' and ``percent
daily value.'' FSIS is interested in receiving such data to assist in its efforts to develop comprehensive nutrition
labeling regulations that will help consumers make informed purchasing decisions. FSIS believes that it would be
a disservice to consumers and industry for FSIS to deny an opportunity for further input into a decision on the labeling
of ground beef and hamburger. Therefore, FSIS is extending the comment period on the proposed rule for 45 days so that
any labeling decision resulting from its proposed rule reflects the greatest amount of data and information available
on this important issue. FSIS is continuing to evaluate the effect that this extension will have on issues such as the
survey for significant participation for voluntary nutrition labeling and the approval of labeling for ground beef
and hamburger pending the outcome of this rulemaking.

Airworthiness Directives; Raytheon Corporate Jets Model BAe 125-1000A Series 
Airplanes 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM). 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain Raytheon
Corporate Jets Model BAe 125-1000A series airplanes. This proposal would require modification of the galley
feeder cables and toilet services fuse. This proposal is prompted by a report that the gauge size of the existing galley
feeder cable is not compatible with the rating of the currently used toilet services fuse. The actions specified by
the proposed AD are intended to ensure that the subject cables are compatible with the toilet services fuse in order
prevent overheating of the cables, which could result in smoke and fire in the cabin.

Discussion 


The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), which is the airworthiness authority for the United Kingdom, recently notified
the FAA that an unsafe condition may exist on certain Raytheon Corporate Jets Model BAe 125-1000A series airplanes.
The CAA advises that the gauge size of the galley feeder cables installed on these airplanes is not compatible with
the rating of the toilet services fuses. In the event of a fault condition, the incompatibility of these items could
result in the cables becoming overheated, which could lead to the generation of smoke and fire in the cabin. There have
been no in-service incidents of such faults or consequent smoke and fire, however. 
Hawker-Raytheon Corporate Jets has issued Service Bulletin 
SB.25-75-25A698A&B, dated February 10 1994, that describes procedures for installing Modification
25A698A&B on airplanes that were furnished with an ``open plan'' galley. This modification consists of changing
the gauge size of the galley feeder cables (from fuses F1 and F2 on panel WFA to the left and right galley) from size 10
to size 8; changing the toilet services fuse F3 from 50A to 30A amperage; and adding a new 20A fuse to the left and right
galley. 
Hawker-Raytheon Corporate Jets also has issued Service Bulletin 
SB.25-75-25A699A, dated February 10 1994, that describes procedures for installing Modification 25A699A
on airplanes that were furnished with a ``traditional'' galley. This modification consists of changing the gauge
size of the galley feeder cables (from fuses F1 and F2 on panel WFA to the galley) from size 10 to size 8; changing the toilet
services fuse F3 from 50A to 30A amperage; and adding a new 20A fuse to the galley. 
The CAA classified both of these service bulletins as mandatory. 
This airplane model is manufactured in the United Kingdom and is type certificated for operation in the United States
under the provisions of section 21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.29) and the applicable bilateral
airworthiness agreement. 
Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, the CAA has kept the FAA informed of the situation described
above. The FAA has examined the findings of the CAA, reviewed all available information, and determined that AD action
is necessary for products of this type design that are certificated for operation in the United States. 
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes of the same type
design registered in the United States, the proposed AD would require modification of the galley feeder cables and
toilet services fuses. The actions would be required to be accomplished in accordance with the service bulletins
described previously. 
The FAA estimates that 4 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD, that it would take approximately
16 work hours per airplane to accomplish the proposed actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour.
Required parts would cost approximately $500 per airplane. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed
AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $5,520, or $1,380 per airplane. 
The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the
proposed requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this
AD were not adopted. 
The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action''
under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44
FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative,
on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility 
Act. A copy of the draft regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it

Approval and Promulgation of Implementation Plans; California
State Implementation Plan Revision; Ventura County Air Pollution Control District


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM).



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

EPA is proposing to approve revisions to the California State Implementation Plan (SIP) for ozone. The revisions
concern the control of oxides of nitrogen (NO

x

) from electric utilities and stack monitoring requirements for making compliance determinations in Ventura County.
The intended effect of proposing approval of these rules is to regulate emissions of NO

x

 in accordance with the requirements of the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1990 (CAA or the Act). EPA's final action on this
notice of proposed rulemaking will incorporate these rules into the federally approved SIP. EPA has evaluated each
of these rules and is proposing to approve them under provisions of the CAA regarding EPA actions on SIP submittals,
SIPs for national primary and secondary ambient air quality standards, and plan requirements for nonattainment
areas. 






COMMENTS:

 Comments on this proposed action must be received in writing on or before August 4, 1994.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
Background:


On November 15, 1990, the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (CAA) were enacted. Pub. L. 101-549, 104 Stat. 2399,
codified at 42 U.S.C. 7401-7671q. The air quality planning requirements for the reduction of NO

X

 emissions through reasonably available control technology (RACT) are set out in section 182(f) of the CAA. On November
25, 1992, EPA published a notice of proposed rulemaking entitled ``State Implementation Plans; Nitrogen Oxides
Supplement to the General Preamble; Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 Implementation of Title I; Proposed Rule,''
(the NO

X

 Supplement) which describes the requirements of section 182(f). The November 25, 1992, notice should be referred
to for further information on the NO

X

 requirements and is incorporated into this document by reference. 
Section 182(f) of the Clean Air Act requires States to apply the same requirements to major stationary sources of NO

X

 (``major'' as defined in section 302 and sections 182(c), (d), and (e)) as are applied to major stationary sources
of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), in moderate or above ozone nonattainment areas. Ventura County is classified
as a severe nonattainment area for ozone,

1

 therefore subject to the RACT requirements of section 182(b)(2), cited above. 





Section 182(b)(2) requires submittal of RACT rules for major stationary sources of VOC emissions (not covered by
a pre-enactment control technologies guidelines (CTG) document or a post-enactment CTG document) by November 15,
1992. There were no NO

X

 CTGs issued before enactment and EPA has not issued a CTG document for any NO

X

 sources since enactment of the CAA. The RACT rules covering NO

X

 sources and submitted as SIP revisions are expected to require final installation of the actual NO

X

 controls by May 31, 1995 for those sources where installation by that date is practicable.

This document addresses EPA's proposed action for Ventura County Air Pollution Control District (VCAPCD), Rule
59, Electrical Power Generating Equipment_Oxides of Nitrogen Emissions and Rule 103, Stack Monitoring. Rule 59
and Rule 103 were respectively adopted by VCAPCD on September 15, 1992 and June 4, 1991. The California Air Resources
Board (CARB) submitted these revisions to EPA on November 18, 1993 and October 25, 1991, respectively. The submissions
were found to be complete on December 23, 1993 (Rule 59) and December 18, 1991 (Rule 103), pursuant to EPA's completeness
criteria that are set forth in 40 CFR Part 51 Appendix V,

2

 and are being proposed for approval into the SIP.





NO

X

 emissions contribute to the production of ground level ozone and smog. Rule 59 limits nitrogen oxide emissions from
utility boilers in Ventura County, while Rule 103 specifies stack monitoring requirements. The rules were adopted
as part of Ventura County's efforts to achieve the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for ozone and in
response to the CAA requirements cited above. The following is EPA's evaluation and proposed action for these rules.



EPA Evaluation and Proposed Action 


In determining the approvability of a NO

X

 rule, EPA must evaluate the rule for consistency with the requirements of the CAA and EPA regulations, as found in section
110 and part D of the CAA and 40 CFR part 51 (Requirements for Preparation, Adoption and Submittal of Implementation
Plans). The EPA interpretations of these requirements, which form the basis for this action, appear in the NO

X

 Supplement and various other EPA policy guidance documents.

3

 Among these provisions is the requirement that a NO

X

 rule must, at a minimum, provide for the implementation of RACT for stationary sources of NO

X

 emissions.





For the purposes of assisting state and local agencies in developing NO

X

 RACT rules, EPA prepared the NO

X

 Supplement to the General Preamble, cited above (57 FR 55620). In the NO

X

 Supplement, EPA provides guidance on how RACT should be determined for major stationary sources of NO

X

 emissions. While most of the guidance issued by EPA on what constitutes RACT for stationary sources has been directed
towards application for VOC sources, much of the guidance is also applicable to RACT for stationary sources of NO

X

 (see section 4.5 of the NO

X

 Supplement). In addition, pursuant to section 183(c), EPA is issuing alternative control techniques documents
(ACTs), that identify alternative controls for all categories of stationary sources of NO

X

. The ACT documents will provide information on control technology for stationary sources that emit or have the potential
to emit 25 tons per year or more of NO

X

. However, the ACTs will not establish a presumptive norm for what is considered RACT for stationary sources of NO

X

. In general, the guidance documents cited above, as well as other relevant and applicable guidance documents, have
been issued by EPA to ensure that submitted NO

X

 RACT rules are fully enforceable and strengthen or maintain the SIP.
The current SIP-approved version of Rule 59, Electrical Power Generating Equipment_Oxides of Nitrogen Emissions,
has four parts: ``A'' regarding emission limits; ``B'' regarding applicability; ``D'' regarding definitions (approved
on June 6, 1980); and ``C'' regarding exceedance provisions (approved into the SIP on April 11, 1983). The significant
changes in the September 15, 1992 version involve more stringent emission limits, fuel oil provisions, natural gas
curtailment issues, 24-hour rolling average compliance determinations, start-up exemptions, and increments
of progress provisions. In addition, new recordkeeping requirements, test methods, and definitions have been included.

Specifically, the rule limits NO

X

 emissions from boilers rated less than 2150 million British Thermal Units (MMBtu) to 0.20 pounds per megawatt-hour
(lb/MW-hr) produced, and limits NO

X

 emissions from units greater than or equal to 2150 MMBtu to 0.10lb/MW-hr. Final compliance with these limits is required
by June 4, 1996 and June 4, 1994, respectively. Interim NO

X

 limits are required for units burning natural gas as well as fuel oil. However, operation on any amount of fuel oil as
of April 1, 1993 is prohibited except during system tests or a force majeure natural gas curtailment. Compliance with
the hourly emission limits is determined using a 24-hour rolling average in which the 24 hourly measurements immediately
preceding the current hour are used to calculate the average for that hour. Emissions and power production are required
to be continuously monitored pursuant to Rule 103. For implementation by 1995, all the limits specified in Rule 59
are more stringent than RACT except for the pre-1996 limits established for units less than 2150MMBtu/hr. The pre-1996
limits for these units, however, meet RACT. Although all limits post-1996 are more stringent than the NO

X

 RACT limits for utility boilers specified in the NO

X

 Supplement, all additional reductions obtained beyond those attributable to RACT are assumed necessary for VCAPCD's
attainment planning purposes. 

A more detailed discussion of the sources controlled, the controls required, and the analysis of how these controls
meet RACT can be found in the Technical Support Document (TSD) for Rule 59 and Rule 103, dated June 1994.


Rule 103, Stack Monitoring was originally adopted by VCAPCD on November 22, 1977. A revised version was approved into
the SIP on October 16, 1985. The rule adopted on June 4, 1991 requires all large boilers, regardless of their use rate,
to be monitored.

EPA has evaluated the submitted rules and has determined that they are consistent with the CAA, EPA regulations and
EPA policy. Therefore, both VCAPCD Rule 59, Electrical Power Generating Equipment_Oxides of Nitrogen Emissions
and VCAPCD Rule 103, Stack Monitoring are being proposed for approval under section 110(k)(3) of the CAA as meeting
the requirements of section 110(a) and part D. 

Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for revision to any state implementation plan. Each request for revision to the state implementation plan shall be
considered separately in light of specific technical, economic and environmental factors and in relation to relevant
statutory and regulatory requirements. 



Regulatory Process



Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 et seq., EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing
the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities. 5 U.S.C sections 603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify
that the rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities
include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government entities with jurisdiction over populations
of less than 50,000.

SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter I, Part D of the CAA do not create any new requirements, but simply approve
requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal SIP-approval does not impose any
new requirements, it does not have a significant impact on affected small entities. Moreover, due to the nature of
the federal-state relationship under the CAA, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis would constitute
federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of state action. The CAA forbids EPA to base its actions concerning
SIPs on such grounds.

427 U.S. 246, 256-66 (S.Ct. 1976); 42 U.S.C. section 7410 (a)(2).

This action has been classified as a Table 2 action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in
the

Approval and Promulgation of Air Quality Implementation Plans; 
District of Columbia; Oxygenated Gasoline Program 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).

 

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule.

 


</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 EPA is proposing a limited approval/limited disapproval of a State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision submitted
by the District of Columbia. This revision implements an oxygenated gasoline program in the District of Columbia.
The intended effect of this action is to propose approval of those subsections of the District of Columbia Municipal
Regulations (DCMR) which pertain to oxygenated gasoline for the limited purpose of strengthening the District of
Columbia SIP which currently has no requirements for an oxygenated gasoline program. In addition, this action is
intended to propose disapproval of those subsections of the DCMR which pertain to oxygenated gasoline for the limited
purpose of allowing the District of Columbia the opportunity to correct the deficiencies in the regulation which
result in its failure to meet all requirements of the Clean Air Act. This action is being taken under Section 110 of the
Clean Air Act.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

I. Introduction 



Motor vehicles are significant contributors of carbon monoxide emissions. An important measure toward reducing
these emissions is the use of cleaner-burning oxygenated gasoline. Extra oxygen enhances fuel combustion and helps
to offset fuel-rich operating conditions, particularly during vehicle starting, which are more prevalent in the
winter. 

Section 211(m) of the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. 7401 

et seq.

 (the Act), requires that various states submit revisions to their SIPs, and implement oxygenated gasoline programs
by no later than November 1, 1992. This requirement applies to all states with carbon monoxide nonattainment areas
with design values of 9.5 parts per million or more based generally on 1988 and 1989 data. Each state's oxygenated gasoline
program must require gasoline for the specified control area(s) to contain not less than 2.7 percent oxygen by weight
during that portion of the year in which the areas are prone to high ambient concentrations of carbon monoxide. Under
section 211(m)(2), the oxygenated gasoline requirements are to generally cover all gasoline sold or dispensed in
the larger of the Consolidated Metropolitan Statistical Area (CMSA) or the Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA)
in which the nonattainment area is located. Under section 211(m)(2), the length of the control period, to be established
by the EPA Administrator, shall not be less than four months in length unless a state can demonstrate that, because
of meteorological conditions, a reduced control period will assure that there will be no carbon monoxide exceedances
outside of such reduced period. EPA announced guidance on the establishment of control periods by area in the 

Federal Register

 on October 20, 1992.

In addition to the guidance on establishment of control period by area, EPA has issued additional guidance related
to the oxygenated gasoline program. On October 20, 1992, EPA announced the availability of oxygenated gasoline credit
program guidelines in the 

Federal Register

.
 Under a credit program, marketable oxygen credits may be generated from the sale of gasoline with a higher oxygen content
than is required (i.e. an oxygen content greater than 2.7 percent by weight). These oxygen credits may be used to offset
the sale of gasoline with a lower oxygen content than is required. Where a credit program has been adopted, EPA's guidelines
provide that no gallon of gasoline should contain less than 2.0% oxygen by weight.





EPA issued labeling regulations under section 211(m)(4) of the Act. These labeling regulations were published in
the 

Federal Register

 on October 20, 1992.






II. Background for this Action



EPA has determined that the 1988 and 1989 data for the Washington, DC area is invalid because of poor data quality and
therefore inadequate to properly characterize the ambient concentrations of carbon monoxide (CO). Therefore,
EPA used data from 1987 and 1988 to designate the Washington, DC area as a CO nonattainment area with a design value of
11.4 ppm.
 Under section 211(m) of the Act, the District of Columbia was required to submit a revised SIP under section 110 and
part D of title I of the Act which includes an oxygenated gasoline program for the entire District of Columbia by November
15, 1992.







On October 27, 1993, the District of Columbia Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs submitted a revision
to its SIP for an oxygenated gasoline program. The revision included additions or amendments to 20 District of Columbia
Municipal Regulations (DCMR) Chapter 1, Section 199; Chapter 5, Section 500, Subsections 500.4 and 500.5; Chapter
5, Section 502, Subsection 502.18; Chapter 9, Section 904, Subsections 904.1 and 904.2. These regulatory revisions
were adopted by the District of Columbia on July 16, 1993 and became effective on September 30, 1993. EPA summarizes
its analysis of the state submittal below. A more detailed analysis of the state submittal is contained in a Technical
Support Document (TSD) dated February 23, 1994, which is available from the Region III office, listed in the 

ADDRESSES

 section.

III. EPA's Analysis of the District of Columbia's Oxygenated Gasoline Program 



As discussed above, section 211(m)(2) of the Act requires that gasoline sold or dispensed for use in the specified
control areas contain not less than 2.7 percent oxygen by weight. Under section 211(m)(5), the EPA Administrator
issued guidelines for credit programs allowing the use of marketable oxygen credits. The District of Columbia has
elected to adopt a regulation requiring 2.7% oxygen content for each gallon of gasoline sold in a control area. The
following sections of this notice address some specific elements of the state's submittal. Parties desiring more
specific information should consult the TSD.



Applicability and Program Scope



Section 211(m)(2) requires oxygenated gasoline to be sold during a control period based on air quality monitoring
data and established by the EPA Administrator. The District of Columbia has established the control period as November
1 to the last day of February control period which is consistent with the EPA guidance. The District of Columbia oxygenated
gasoline regulations require oxygenated gasoline to be sold in the entire District of Columbia, consistent with
the requirements of section 211(m)(2) of the Act. 20 DCMR Section 500, Subsection 500.4 requires all parties in the
gasoline distribution network, including ``carriers'', to generate and maintain records detailing compliance.
However, the definition of ``carriers'' is not found in Section 199, entitled Definitions and Abbreviations, or
any other section of 20 DCMR. The lack of a definition for ``carriers'' compromises the enforceability of the regulation
and is a deficiency under Section 110(a)(2) of the Act.



Transfer Documents



The District of Columbia has included requirements related to transfer documentation in its regulation. These transfer
document requirements will enhance the enforcement of the oxygenated gasoline regulation, by providing a paper
trail for each gasoline sample taken by state enforcement personnel.



Enforcement and Penalty Schedules



State oxygenated gasoline regulations must be enforceable by the state oversight agency. EPA recommends that states
will visit at least 20% of regulated parties during a given control period. Inspections should consist of product
sampling and record review. In addition, each state should devise a comprehensive penalty schedule. Penalties should
reflect the severity of a party's violation, the compliance history of the party, as well as the potential environmental
harm associated with the violation.

The District of Columbia's enforcement strategies and penalty provisions are found in 20 DCMR Chapter 1, Sections
100, 101, 102, 104 and 105. 20 DCMR Chapter 1, Sections 101 and 102 give the authority to inspect and issue notice of violations
to the alleged violator. 20 DCMR Chapter 1, Section 104 provides the alleged violator the opportunity for a hearing.
20 DCMR Chapter 1, Section 105 provides penalties which include a fine of up to $5,000 per violation or imprisonment
not to exceed 90 days, or both. The District of Columbia's enforcement and penalty provisions are acceptable.



Test Methods and Laboratory Review



EPA's sampling procedures are detailed in Appendix D of 40 C.F.R. Part 80. EPA has recommended that states adopt these
sampling procedures. The District of Columbia has not adopted EPA sampling procedures or any other sampling procedure
which would be acceptable to EPA. In addition, the District of Columbia has failed to include in its' regulation procedures
for the calculation of oxygen content in the gasoline sampled. Both the lack of sampling procedures and oxygen content
calculations compromise the enforceability of the regulation and are a deficiency under Section 110(a)(2) of the
Clean Air Act.

Each state regulation must include a test method. EPA's guidelines recommend the use of the OFID test, although parties
may elect to use ASTM-D4815-89 or another method, if approved by EPA. The District of Columbia has elected
to use the ASTM-D4815-89 method which is consistent with EPA guidelines.



Labeling



EPA was required to issue federal labeling regulations under section 211(m)(4) of the Act. These regulations, published
in the 

Federal Register

 on October 20, 1992,
 required the following statement be posted for a per-gallon program or credit program with minimum oxygen content
requirement:





``The gasoline dispensed from this pump is oxygenated and will reduce carbon monoxide pollution from motor vehicles.''

The Federal regulation also specifies the appearance and placement requirements for the labels.

EPA has strongly recommended that states adopt their own labeling regulations, consistent with the Federal regulation.
The District of Columbia has adopted labeling regulations consistent with the federal regulation. 



EPA Analysis



EPA is proposing a limited approval of the additions or amendments to 20 DCMR Chapter 1, Section 199, definitions for
the terms ``blending plant'', ``distributor'', ``non-oxygenated gasoline'', ``oxygenate'', ``oxygenated gasoline'',
``oxygenated gasoline control period'', ``oxygenated gasoline control area'', ``refiner'', ``refinery'', ``retailer'',
``retail outlet'', ``terminal'', and ``wholesale purchaser consumer''; Chapter 5, Section 500, Subsections 500.4
and 500.5; Chapter 5, Section 502, Subsection 502.18; Chapter 9, Section 904, Subsections 904.1 and 904.2 into the
District of Columbia SIP, which was submitted on October 27, 1993. EPA is also proposing to disapprove the additions
or amendments to 20 DCMR Chapter 1, Section 199, definitions for the terms ``blending plant'', ``distributor'',
``non-oxygenated gasoline'', ``oxygenate'', ``oxygenated gasoline'', ``oxygenated gasoline control period'',
``oxygenated gasoline control area'', ``refiner'', ``refinery'', ``retailer'', ``retail outlet'', ``terminal'',
and ``wholesale purchaser-consumer''; Chapter 5, Section 500, Subsections 500.4 and 500.5; Chapter 5, Section
502, Subsection 502.18; Chapter 9, Section 904, Subsections 904.1 and 904.2 for the limited purpose of allowing the
District of Columbia the opportunity to correct certain deficiencies. These deficiencies are located in Section
199 (lack of definition for the term ``carrier'') and Section 502 (lack of sampling procedure and lack of a procedure
to calculate the oxygen content of the gasoline sampled). EPA is soliciting public comments on the issues discussed
in this notice or on other relevant matters. These comments will be considered before taking final action.

Interested parties may participate in the Federal rulemaking procedure by submitting written comments to the EPA
Regional office listed in the 

Addresses

 section of this notice. 

20 DCMR Section 500, Subsection 500.4 requires all parties in the gasoline distribution network, including ``carriers'',
to generate and maintain records detailing compliance. However, the definition of ``carriers'' is not found in 20
DCMR Section 199, entitled Definitions and Abbreviations, or any other section of 20 DCMR. Therefore, EPA is proposing
to disapprove both Section 199, because it lacks a definition for the term ``carriers'', and Subsection 500.4, because
the term ``carriers'' which is used in this section is not defined in the subsection or any other section of 20 DCMR.
The lack of a definition of ``carriers'' compromises the enforceability of the regulation and is a deficiency under
Section 110(a)(2) of the Clean Air Act.
 
EPA's sampling procedures are detailed in Appendix D of 40 CFR Part 80. EPA has recommended that states adopt these
sampling procedures. The District of Columbia has not adopted EPA sampling procedures or any other sampling procedure
which would be acceptable to EPA. In addition, the District of Columbia has failed to include in its' regulation procedures
for the calculation of oxygen content in the gasoline sampled. Both the lack of a sampling procedure and oxygen content
calculation procedure compromise the enforceability of the regulation and are a deficiency under Section 110(a)(2)
of the Clean Air Act. Therefore, EPA is proposing to disapprove 20 DCMR Section 502, Subsection 502.18 because it lacks
both a sampling procedure and a procedure for calculating the oxygen content in the gasoline sampled.

Because of the above deficiencies, EPA cannot grant full approval of this rule under section 100(k)(3) and Part D.
Also, because the submitted rule is not composed of separable parts which meet all the applicable requirements of
the Act, EPA cannot grant partial approval of the rule under section 110(k)(3). However, EPA may grant a limited approval
of the submitted rule under section 110(k)(3) in light of EPA's authority pursuant to section 301(a) to adopt regulations
necessary to further air quality by strengthening the SIP. The approval is limited because EPA's action also contains
a simultaneous limited disapproval, due to the fact that the rule does not meet the section 110(a)(2) requirement
because of the noted enforcement deficiencies. Thus, in order to strengthen the SIP, EPA is proposing a limited approval
of the District of Columbia's submitted additions or amendments to 20 DCMR Chapter 1, Section 199; Chapter 5, Section
500, Subsections 500.4 and 500.5; Chapter 5, Section 502, Subsection 502.18; Chapter 9, Section 904, Subsections
904.1 and 904.2 under section 110(k)(3) and 301(a) of the Act. 

At the same time, EPA is also proposing a limited disapproval of this rule because it contains deficiencies under section
110(a)(2) of the Act, and, as such, the rule does not fully meet the requirements of the Act. Under section 179(a)(2),
if the Administrator disapproves a submission under section 110(k) for an area designated nonattainment, based
on the submission's failure to meet one or more of the elements required by the Act, the Administrator must apply one
of the sanctions set forth in section 179(b) unless the deficiency has been corrected within 18 months of such disapproval.
Section 179(b) provides two sanctions available to the Administrator: highway funding and offsets. The 18 month
period referred to in section 179(a) will begin at the time EPA publishes final notice of this disapproval. Moreover,
the final disapproval triggers the federal implementation plan (FIP) requirement under section 110(c). 



III. Proposed Action 



For the above stated reasons, EPA is proposing a limited approval/limited disapproval of the District of Columbia's
SIP for an oxygenated gasoline program. In order to correct the deficiencies in 20 DCMR Chapter 1, Section 199; Chapter
5, Section 500, Subsections 500.4 and 500.5; Chapter 5, Section 502, Subsection 502.18; Chapter 9, Section 904, Subsections
904.1 and 904.2 which EPA is proposing as a limited disapproval, the District of Columbia must include a definition
for the term ``carrier'', include a sampling procedure, and include procedures for the calculation of oxygen content
in the gasoline sampled. If the District of Columbia submits a SIP revision which is deemed administratively and technically
complete and corrects the deficiencies listed above prior to the time that EPA finalizes this action, EPA will propose
full approval of the October 27, 1993 submittal and the subsequent submittal which corrects the deficiencies. 

Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for revision to any state implementation plan. Each request for revision to the state implementation plan shall be
considered separately in light of specific technical, economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant
statutory and regulatory requirements.

Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 

et seq.

, EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities.
5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial
number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government
entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000. 

SIP approvals under sections 110 and 301, and subchapter I, Part D of the Act do not create any new requirements but simply
approve requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal SIP approval does not impose
any new requirements, EPA certifies that it does not have a significant impact on any small entities affected. Moreover,
due to the nature of the Federal-State relationship under the Act, preparation of a flexibility analysis would constitute
Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of state action. The Clean Air Act forbids EPA to base its actions
concerning SIPs on such grounds. 

Union Electric Co. v. U.S. EPA,

 427 U.S. 246, 255-66 (1976); 42 U.S.C. 7410(a)(2). 

EPA's disapproval of the State request under section 110 and subchapter I, part D of the Act does not affect any existing
requirements applicable to small entities. Any pre-existing federal requirements remain in place after this disapproval.
Federal disapproval of the state submittal does not affect its state-enforceability. Moreover, EPA's disapproval
of the submittal does not impose any new Federal requirements. Therefore, EPA certifies that this disapproval action
does not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities because it does not remove existing requirements
and impose any new Federal requirements. 

This action has been classified as a Table 2 action for signature by the Regional Administrator under the procedures
published in the 

Federal Register

 on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214-2225), as revised by an October 4, 1993 memorandum from Michael H. Shapiro, Acting
Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. OMB has exempted this regulatory action from E.O. 12866 review. 

The Administrator's decision to approve or disapprove the District of Columbia's oxygenated gasoline SIP revision
will be based on whether it meets the requirements of section 110(a)(2)(A)-(K) and of the Clean Air Act, as amended,
and EPA regulations in 40 CFR part 51.
