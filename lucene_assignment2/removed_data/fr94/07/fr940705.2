<DOCTITLE>Oil Country Tubular Goods From Canada, Final Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review </DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 International Trade Administration/Import 
Administration/Department of Commerce.

 

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of final results of antidumping duty 
administrative review.

 


</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 
On April 20, 1994, the Department of Commerce (the Department) 
published the preliminary results of review of the antidumping 
duty order on oil country tubular goods from Canada (51 FR 21782; 
June 16, 1986). The review covers one manufacturer/exporter, 
IPSCO Inc. (IPSCO), and the period June 1, 1992, through 
May 31, 1993. 



We gave interested parties an opportunity to comment on the 
preliminary results. Since the Department received no comments, 
the final results remain unchanged from the preliminary results. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

Background 



On June 25, 1993, IPSCO requested that the Department conduct an 
administrative review of the antidumping duty order on oil 
country tubular goods (OCTG) from Canada. The Department 
initiated the review on July 21, 1993 (58 FR 39007), covering the 
period June 1, 1992, through May 31, 1993. On April 20, 1994, 
the Department published the preliminary results of review (59 FR 
18798). The Department has now completed this review in 
accordance with section 751 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended 
(the Act). 



Scope of the Review 



The products covered by this review include shipments of OCTG 
from Canada. This includes American Petroleum Institute (API) 
specification OCTG and all other pipe with the following 
characteristics except entries which the Department determined 
through its end use certification procedure were not used in OCTG 
applications: Length of at least 16 feet; outside diameter of 
standard sizes published in the API or proprietary specifications 
for OCTG with tolerances of plus 1/8 inch for diameters less than 
or equal to 85/8 inches and plus 1/4 inch for diameters greater than 
85/8 inches, minimum wall thickness as identified for a given outer 
diameter as published in the API or proprietary specifications 
for OCTG; a minimum of 40,000 PSI yield strength and a minimum 
60,000 PSI tensile strength; and if with seams, must be electric 
resistance welded. Furthermore, imports covered by this review 
include OCTG with non-standard size wall thickness greater than 
the minimum identified for a given outer diameter as published in 
the API or proprietary specifications for OCTG, with surface 
scabs or slivers, irregularly cut ends, ID or OD weld flash, or 
open seams; OCTG may be bent, flattened or oval, and may lack 
certification because the pipe has not been mechanically tested 
or has failed those tests. 

This merchandise is currently classifiable under the Harmonized 
Tariff Schedules (HTS) item numbers 7304.20, 7305.20, and 
7306.20. The HTS item numbers are provided for convenience and 
Customs purposes. The written description remains dispositive. 



Final Results of Review 



We gave interested parties an opportunity to comment on the 
preliminary results. The Department received no comments. 
Accordingly, we have determined that a final margin of zero 
percent exists for IPSCO for the period June 1, 1992 through 
May 1, 1993. 

The Department will issue appraisement instructions directly to 
the Customs Service. 

Furthermore, the following deposit requirements will be effective 
for all shipments of the subject merchandise, entered or 
withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after the 
publication date of these final results of review, as provided by 
section 751(a)(1) of the Act: (1) the cash deposit rate for 
IPSCO will be zero percent; (2) for merchandise exported by 
manufacturers or exporters not covered in this review but covered 
in a previous review or the original less-than-fair-value (LTFV) 
investigation, the cash deposit rate will continue to be the rate 
published in the most recent final results or determination for 
which the manufacturer or exporter received a company-specific 
rate; (3) if the exporter is not a firm covered in this review, 
earlier reviews, or the original investigation, but the 
manufacturer is, the cash deposit rate will be that established 
for the manufacturer of the merchandise in these final results of 
review, earlier reviews, or the original investigation, whichever 
is the most recent; and (4) the ``all others'' rate will be 16.65 
percent, as explained below. 

On May 25, 1993, the Court of International Trade, in 

Floral 
Trade Council 

v. 

United States

, Slip Op. 93-79, and 

Federal-Mogul 
Corporation 

v. 

United States

, 822 F. Supp. 782 (1993), decided 
that once an ``all others'' rate is established for a company it 
can only be changed through an administrative review. The 
Department has determined that in order to implement these 
decisions, it is appropriate to reinstate the original ``all 
others'' rate from the LTFV investigation (or that rate as amended 
for correction of clerical errors or as a result of litigation) 
in proceedings governed by antidumping duty orders. Accordingly, 
the cash deposit rate for any future entries from all other 
manufacturers or exporters, who are not covered in this or prior 
administrative reviews and who are unrelated to the reviewed 
firms or any previously reviewed firm, will be the ``all others'' 
rate established in the original LTFV investigation, which is 
16.65 percent. 

These deposit requirements, when imposed, shall remain in effect 
until publication of the final results of the next administrative 
review. 

This notice also serves as a reminder to importers of their 
responsibility under 19 CFR 353.26 to file a certificate 
regarding the reimbursement of antidumping duties prior to 
liquidation of the relevant entries during this review period. 
Failure to comply with this requirement could result in the 
Secretary's presumption that reimbursement of antidumping duties 
occurred and the subsequent assessment of double antidumping 
duties. 

This notice also serves as a reminder to parties subject to 
administrative protective orders (APOs) of their responsibility 
concerning the disposition of proprietary information disclosed 
under APO in accordance with 19 CFR 353.34(d). Timely written 
notification of return/destruction of APO materials or conversion 
to judicial protective order is hereby requested. Failure to 
comply with the regulations and the terms of an APO is a 
sanctionable violation. 

This administrative review and notice are in accordance with 
section 751(a)(1) of the Act (19 U.S.C. 1675(a)(1)) and 
19 CFR 353.22.

Proposed Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) for Application Profile for the Government Information
Locator Service (GILS)



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Commerce.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice; request for comments.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This proposed Federal Information Processing Standard describes an application profile for the Government Information
Locator Service (GILS). This application profile is based primarily on the American National Standard for Information
Retrieval Application Service Definition and Protocol Specification for Open Systems Interconnection (ANSI/NISO
Z39.50-1992), developed by the National Information Standards Organization. The Government Information
Locator Service (GILS) is a decentralized collection of servers and associated information services that will be
used by the public either directly or through intermediaries to find public information throughout the Federal government.



Prior to the submission of this proposed FIPS to the Secretary of Commerce for review and approval, it is essential
to assure that consideration is given to the needs and views of federal organizations, vendors, the public, and State
and local governments. The purpose of this notice is to solicit such views.

The proposed FIPS contains two sections: (1) an announcement section, which provides information concerning the
applicability, implementation, and maintenance of the standard; and (2) a specifications section which deals with
the technical requirements of the standard.

Only the announcement section of the standard is provided in this notice. Interested parties may obtain copies of
the technical specifications for this proposed FIPS for Application Profile for the Government Information Locator
Service (GILS) from Standards Processing Coordinator (ADP), Computer Systems Laboratory, National Institute
of Standards and Technology, Technology Building, Room B-64, Gaithersburg, MD 20899, telephone (301) 975-2816.

Proposed Federal Information Processing Standards Publication


XXXXXX




(date)


Announcing the Standard for Application Profile for the Government Information Locator Service (GILS)




Federal Information Processing Standards Publications (FIPS PUBS) are issued by the National Institute of Standards
and Technology (NIST) after approval by the Secretary of Commerce pursuant to Section 111(d) of the Federal Property
and Administrative Services Act of 1949 as amended by the Computer Security Act of 1987, Public Law 100-235.


1. Name of Standard. Application Profile for the Government Information Locator Service (GILS).

2. Category of Standard. Software Standard, Information Interchange.

3. Explanation. This standard describes an application profile for the Government Information Locator Service
(GILS). This application profile is based primarily on the American National Standard for Information Retrieval
Application Service Definition and Protocol Specification for Open Systems Interconnection (ANSI/NISO Z39.50-1992),
developed by the National Information Standards Organization (NISO). The Government Information Locator Service
(GILS) is a decentralized collection of servers and associated information services that will be used by the public
either directly or through intermediaries to find public information throughout the Federal government.

This GILS Profile specifies the use of ANSI/NISO Z39.50-1992 in information service applications and provides
specifications for the overall GILS application, including the GILS Core and other aspect of a GILS server operating
in the Internet environment. This GILS profile will enable GILS client systems to interconnect and to interoperate
with any GILS server. This profile addresses intersystem interactions and information interchange for the GILS,
but does not specify user interface requirements, the internal structure of databases that contain GILS Locator
Records, or search engine functionality.

GILS servers will support search and retrieval by accepting a search query and returning a result set or diagnostic
messages. GILS servers may also support browsing by accepting a well-known search query and returning a list of Locator
Records in brief display format.

Some of the information resources pointed to by GILS Locator Records, as well as the GILS server itself, may be available
electronically through other communications protocols including the common Internet protocols that facilitate
electronic information transfer such as remote login (Telnet), File Transfer Protocol (FTP), and electronic mail.
The use of SMTP and MIME protocols or other communications paths is outside the scope of the GILS Profile.

The GILS Profile was developed by a group of industry and government experts in ANSI/NISO Z39.50-1992 implementations,
system implementations, and the organization of information. The specifications included in the GILS Profile reflect
the consensus of this group based on its work and input from a range of stakeholders.

Proposed Federal Information Processing Standards Publication 125-2 (Supersedes FIPS PUB 125-1_1993
June 10)



(date)



Announcing the Standard for M (Also Known as MUMPS [MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL UTILITY MULTI-PROGRAMMING SYSTEM])



Federal Information Processing Standards Publications (FIPS PUBS) are issued by the National Institute of Standards
and Technology (NIST) after approval by the Secretary of Commerce pursuant to Section 111(d) of the Federal Property
and Administrative Services Act of 1949, as amended by the Computer Security Act of 1987, Public Law 100-235.

1. Name of Standard. M (also known as MUMPS [MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL UTILITY MULTI-PROGRAMMING SYSTEM])
(FIPS PUB 125-2).

2. Category of Standard. Software Standard, Programming Language.

3. Explanation. This publication announces the adoption of American National Standard for M, ANSI/MDC X11.1-199X,
as a Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS). The American National Standard for M, ANSI/MDC X11.1-199X,
specifies the form and establishes the interpretation of programs written in the M programming language. The purpose
of the standard is to promote portability of M programs for use on a variety of data processing systems. The standard
is for use by implementors as the reference authority in developing compilers, interpreters, or other forms of high
level language processors; and by other computer professionals who need to know the precise syntactic and semantic
rules adopted by ANSI. This publication is a revision of FIPS PUB 125-1 and supersedes that document in its entirety.

4. Approving Authority. Secretary of Commerce.

5. Maintenance Agency. U.S. Department of Commerce, National Institute 
of Standards and Technology (NIST), Computer Systems Laboratory (CSL).

6. Cross Index. American National Standard for Information System_Programming Language_M (also known as MUMPS
[MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL UTILITY MULTI-PROGRAMMING SYSTEM]), ANSI/MDC X11.1-199X.

7. Related Documents.*





a. Federal Information Resources Management Regulations subpart 201-20.303, Standards, and subpart 201-39.1002,
Federal Standards.

b. FIPS PUB 29-3, Interpretation Procedures for Federal Information Processing Standards for Software.

c. NBS Special Publication 500-117, Selection and Use of General-Purpose Programming Languages.

d. NIST, Validated Products List, (republished quarterly). Available by subscription from the National Technical
Information Service (NTIS).


8. Objectives. Federal standards for high level programming languages permit Federal departments and agencies
to exercise more effective control over the production, management, and use of the Government's information resources.
The primary objectives of Federal programming language standards are:




_To encourage more effective utlilization and management of programmers by ensuring that programming skills acquired
on one job are transportable to other jobs, thereby reducing the cost of programmer retraining.

_To reduce the cost of program development by achieving the increased programmer productivity that is inherent in
the use of high level programming languages;

_To reduce the overall software costs by making it easier and less expensive to maintain programs and to transfer programs
among different computer systems, including replacement systems; and

_To protect the existing software assets of the Federal Government by ensuring to the maximal feasible extent that
Federal programming language standards are technically sound and that subsequent revisions are compatible with
the installed base.




Government wide attainment of the above objectives depends upon the widespread availability and use of comprehensive
and precise standard language specifications.

9. Applicability.

a. Federal standards for high level programming languages are applicable for computer applications and programs
that are either developed or acquired for government use. FIPS M is one of the high level programming language standards
provided for use by all Federal departments and agencies. FIPS M is suitable for the data processing applications
which include but are not limited to:



_Those involving the creation and manipulation of string-oriented or text-oriented collections of data;
_Those requiring interactive data management.



b. The use of FIPS high level programming languages applies when one or more of the following situations exist:



_It is anticipated that the life of the program will be longer than the life of the presently utilized equipment.
_The application or program is under constant review for updating of the specifications, and changes may result frequently.
_The program is to be understood and maintained by programmers other than the original ones.
_The advantages of improved program design, debugging, documentation and intelligibility can be obtained through
the use of this high level language regardless of interchange potential.
_The program is or is likely to be used by organizations outside the Federal Government (

i.e.

, State and local governments, and others).
_The program is being used for ``cooperative'' processing across multiple processing platforms (e.g., desktops,
servers, and mainframes).



c. Nonstandard language features should be used only when the needed operation or function cannot reasonably be implemented
with the portable features alone. Although nonstandard language features can be very useful, it should be recognized
that their use may make the interchange of programs and future conversion to a revised standard or replacement processor
more difficult and costly.
d. Programmatic requirements also may be more economically and efficiently satisfied by the use of automatic program
generators. However, if the final output of a program generator is a M source program, then the resulting program should
conform to the conditions and specifications of FIPS M.
10. Specifications. FIPS M (also known as MUMPS [MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL UTILITY MULTI-PROGRAMMING SYSTEM])
specifications are the language specifications continued in American National Standard for Information System_Programming
Language_M (also known as MUMPS, [MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL UTILITY MULTI-PROGRAMMING SYSTEM]), ANSI/MDC
X11.1-199X.
a. The ANSI/MDC X11.1-199X document specifies the representation, syntax, and semantics for M programs; the
representation of input and output data processed by M programs; and the restrictions and limitations imposed by
an implementation of M conforming to the ANSI/MDC X11.1-199X standard.
b. The standard does not specify:



_The mechanisms by which M programs are transformed or invoked for use by a data processing system;

_The mechanisms by which input data are transformed for use by a M program or output data are transformed after being
produced by a M program;
_The limits on program size or complexity except when and where applicable to an application as specified in Part 2:
M Portability Requirements of ANSI/MDC X11.1-199X;
_The results when the rules of the standard fail to establish an interpretation;
_The minimal requirements of a data processing system that is capable of supporting a conforming implementation.



11. Implementation. The implementation of FIPS M involves four areas of consideration: the effective date, acquisition
of M processors, interpretation of FIPS M, and validation of processors.
1.1 Effective Date. This revised standard becomes effective six (6) months after the publication in the 

Federal Register

 announcing approval by the Secretary of Commerce. M Processors acquired for Federal use after this date should conform
to FIPS PUB 125-2.
A transition period provides time for industry to produce M language processors conforming to the standard. The transition
period begins on the effective date and continues for 90 days thereafter. The provisions of FIPS PUB 125-2 apply
to orders placed after the effective date of this publication. If, during the transition period, a processor conforming
to FIPS PUB 125-2 is not available, a processor conforming to FIPS PUB 125-1 may be acquired for interim
use during the transition period.
This transition period is intended to give implementations time to make the enhancements necessary to enable conformance
to FIPS PUB 125-2. No further transitional period is necessary.
11.2 Acquisition of M Processors. Conformance of FIPS M should be considered whether M processors are developed
internally, acquired as part of an ADP system procurement, acquired by separate procurement, used under an ADP leasing
arrangement, or specified for use in contracts for programming services. Recommended terminology for procurement
of FIPS M is contained in the U.S. General Services Administration publication Federal ADP & Telecommunications
Standards Index, Chapter 4 Part 1.

11.3 Interpretation of FIPS M. The National Institute of Standards and Technology provides for the resolution
of questions (see FIPS PUB 29-3, Interpretation Procedures for FIPS Software, 29 October 1992) regarding the
specifications and requirements, and issues official interpretations as needed. All questions about the interpretation
of this standard should be addressed to: Director, Computer Systems Laboratory, Attn: FIPS M Interpretation, National
Institute of Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, MD 20899, Voice: 301-975-2490, Fax: 301-948-6213,
E-mail: dashiell@ecf.ncsl.nist.gov.

11.4 Validation of M Processors. Implementations of FIPS M shall be validated in accordance with the NIST
Computer Systems Laboratory (CSL) validation procedures for FIPS M. Recommended procurement terminology for validation
of FIPS M is contained in the U.S. General Service Administration (GSA) publication 

Federal ADP & Telecommunications Standards Index

, Chapter 4 Part 2. This GSA publication provides terminology for three validation options: Delayed Validation,
Prior Validation Testing, and Prior Validation. The agency shall select the appropriate validation option and shall
specify whether a Validation Summary Report or Certificate of Validation is required. The agency shall specify appropriate
time frames for validation and correction of nonconformities. The agency is advised to refer to the NIST publication


Validated Product List 

for information about the validation status of M products. This information may be used to specify validation time
frames that are not unduly restrictive of competition.

The agency shall specify the criteria used to determine whether a Validation Summary Report (VSR) or Certificate
is applicable to the hardware/software environment of the M implementation offered. The criteria for applicability
of a VSR or Certificate should be appropriate to the size and timing of the procurement. A large procurement may require
that the offered version/release of the M implementation shall be validated in a specified hardware/software environment
and that the validation shall be conducted with specified hardware/software features or parameter settings; e.g.
the same parameter settings to be used in a performance benchmark. An agency with a single/license procurement may
review the 

Validated Products List 

to determine the applicability of existing VSRs or Certificates to the agency's hardware/software environment.

M implementations shall be evaluated using a NIST approved test suite.

For further information contact: Director, Computer Systems Laboratory, Attn: FIPS M Validation, National Institute
of Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, MD 20899, Voice: 301-975-2490, Fax: 301-948-6213,
E-mail: dashiell@ecf.ncsl.nist.gov.

12. Waivers. Under certain exceptional circumstances, the heads of Federal departments and agencies may approve
waivers to Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS). The head of such agency may redelegate such authority
only to a senior official designated pursuant to section 3506(b) of title 44, U.S. Code. Waivers shall be granted only
when:

a. Compliance with a standard would adversely affect the accomplishment of the mission of an operator of a Federal
computer system, or 

b. Cause a major adverse financial impact on the operator which is not offset by Government wide savings.

Agency heads may act upon a written waiver request containing the information detailed above. Agency heads may also
act without a written waiver request when they determine that conditions for meeting the standard cannot be met. Agency
heads may approve waivers only by a written decision which explains the basis on which the agency head made the required
finding(s). A copy of each such decision, with procurement sensitive or classified portions clearly identified,
shall be sent to: National Institute of Standards and Technology; Attn: FIPS Waiver Decisions, Technology Building,
Room B-154; Gaithersburg, MD 20899.

In addition, notice of each waiver granted and each delegation of authority to approve waivers shall be sent promptly
to the Committee on Government Operations of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Governmental Affairs
of the Senate and shall be published promptly in the 

Federal Register

.

When the determination on a waiver applies to the procurement of equipment and/or services, a notice of the waiver
determination must be published in the Commerce Business Daily as a part of the notice of solicitation for offers of
an acquisition or, if the waiver determination is made after that notice is published, by amendment to such notice.

<USBUREAU>Department of the Navy</USBUREAU>


<DOCTITLE>Notice of Intent to Prepare an Environmental Impact Statement/Environmental Impact Report For Disposal and Reuse
of Marine Corps Air Station, Tustin, CA </DOCTITLE>



Pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act as implemented by the Council on Environmental Quality regulations
(40 CFR Parts 1500-08), and pursuant to the California Environmental Quality Act (CA Public Resources Code
Sections 21000 et seq.), the U.S. Marine Corps and the City of Tustin intend to prepare a joint Environmental Impact
Statement/Environmental Impact Report (EIS/EIR) to evaluate the environmental effects of the disposal and reuse
of Marine Corps Air Station (MCAS) Tustin. This action is being conducted in accordance with the Defense Base Closure
and Realignment Act of 1990, and the specific 1993 base closure and realignment decisions approved by the Congress
in September 1993. 

The proposed action to be evaluated in the EIS/EIR is the disposal of land, buildings, and infrastructure of MCAS Tustin
for subsequent reuse. The Marine Corps and City of Tustin intend to analyze the environmental effects of the disposal
of MCAS Tustin based on the reasonable foreseeable reuse of the property, taking into account uses to be identified
by the City of Tustin Base Closure Task Force. 

The Task Force has developed a Specific Plan/Reuse Plan to guide the reuse of MCAS Tustin in a variety of uses, including
public and private housing, commercial, light industrial, and recreation uses. Some of the existing structures
and facilities, including housing, are anticipated to be reused. A number of facilities, including the airfield
operation facilities, are proposed for removal. Agricultural and vacant areas on MCAS Tustin are proposed to be developed
with urban uses. 

Full buildout of the proposed land uses will result in a maximum of 4,601 dwelling units and about 12.3 million square
feet of non-residential uses such as commercial business, light industrial, and recreational uses (about 2.1 million
square feet is existing floor area on the base, and 10.2 million square feet is potential new floor area). It is also
currently estimated that about 25 percent of the site would be used for public uses. 

The project also will include the extension of major arterials through the base including Tustin Ranch Road to Von
Karman, Warner Avenue from Red Hill to west of Jamboree Road, and creation of a secondary interior loop roadway and
local roadways to facilitate local circulation. The Specific/Reuse Plan will also address possible variations
to the Tustin Ranch Road and Warner Avenue extensions in the event the southerly blimp hangar is removed. 

Alternatives to be addressed in the EIS/EIR can be characterized as follows: 

1. Arterial Grid Pattern/High Residential_land uses are driven by a grid pattern of major arterial extensions. This
alternative has the greatest number of residential units. This alternative also has no community core land use flexibility.
The alternative could pose limitations in responding to market absorption and soil clean-up phasing. 

2. Ideal Interior Loop Pattern/Low Residential_the alignment of arterial highways and the proposed looped system
would be modified to show its optimum alignment if the southeast blimp hangar could not be reused, and would include
possible variations to the Tustin Ranch Road and Warner Avenue extensions. This alternative would have the fewest
number of residential units and would result in the highest commercial retail and office square footage, particularly
at the southerly portion of the site. 

3. No action_retention of the property by the Marine Corps in a caretaker status. However, because of the process mandated
by the Base Closure and Realignment Act, selection of the no action alternative would be considered impracticable
for the Marine Corps to implement. 

Major environmental issues that will be addressed in the EIS/EIR include land use, housing, utilities, noise, transportation/circulation,
public services, airfield operations, hazardous materials, water resources, air quality, biological resources,
and cultural resources. 

The Marine Corps and City of Tustin will initiate a scoping process to determine the extent of issues to be addressed
and identifying the significant issues related to this action. The Marine Corps and City of Tustin will hold a public
scoping meeting on July 20, 1994, beginning at 7:00 p.m., at the City of Tustin Community Center located in the Tustin
Civic Center, 300 Centennial Way. This meeting will be advertised in area newspapers. 

A brief presentation will precede the request for public comment. Marine Corps and City of Tustin representatives
will be available at this meeting to receive comments from the public regarding issues of concern to the public. It
is important that federal, state, and local agencies and interested individuals take this opportunity to identify
environmental concerns that should be addressed during the preparation of the EIS/EIR. In the interest of available
time, each speaker will be asked to limit oral comments to 5 minutes. 

Agencies and the public are also invited and encouraged to provide written comment on scoping issues in addition to,
or in lieu of, oral comments at the public meeting. To be most helpful, scoping comments should clearly describe specific
issues or topics which the author/speaker believes the EIS/EIR should address. Written statements and questions
regarding the scoping process should be mailed to: Christine Shingleton, Assistant City Manager, City of Tustin,
300 Centennial Way, Tustin, CA 92680, telephone number (714) 573-3116. All comments must be received no later
than August 5, 1994.

<DOCTITLE>Naval Research Advisory Committee; Closed Meeting</DOCTITLE>



Pursuant to the provisions of the Federal Advisory Committee Act (5 U.S.C. App.), notice is hereby given that the Naval
Research Advisory Committee will meet on July 18 through 22, and July 25 through 29, 1994, at the Naval Command, Control
and Ocean Surveillance Center, Research, Development, Test and Evaluation Division, San Diego, California. The
sessions on July 18 through 22, and July 25 through 28, 1994, will commence at 8:00 a.m. and terminate at 5:00 p.m.; and
the session on July 29, 1994, will commence at 8:30 a.m. and terminate at 11:30 a.m. All sessions of these meetings will
be closed to the public.

The purpose of these meetings is to discuss basic and advanced research. All sessions of the meetings will be devoted
to briefings, discussions, and technical examination of information related to Naval research and development,
and modeling and simulation technology. Premature public disclosure of this information would be likely to significantly
frustrate implementation of proposed policy actions by the Department of the Navy. The information involved is specifically
authorized by Executive Order to be withheld from the public if the agency determines it to be in their best interest.
It therefore is
 appropriate that all sessions of the meetings be closed to the
 general public. The agency-protected information to be discussed is so inextricably intertwined with unclassified
matters as to preclude opening any portion of these meetings. Accordingly, the Secretary of the Navy has determined
in writing that the public interest requires that all sessions of these meetings be closed to the public because they
will be concerned with matters listed in section 552b(c)(9)(B) of title 5, United States Code.

For further information concerning these meetings contact:
 Captain M. J. Brinkac, U. S. Navy, Office of Naval Research,
 800 North Quincy Street, Arlington, VA 22217-5660,
 Telephone Number: (703) 696-4870.

<DOCTITLE>Avoca Natural Gas Storage; Facility Design Changes for the Proposed Avoca Gas Storage Field Project and Request for
Comments on Environmental Issues </DOCTITLE>



June 27, 1994. 



On June 3 and 17, 1994, Avoca Natural Gas Storage (Avoca) filed an updated description of its proposed Avoca Gas Storage
Field Project, in Docket No. CP94-161-000. Avoca's filing contained significant design changes in the
proposed storage field project. This notice updates the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's (FERC or Commission)
``Notice of Intent To Prepare An Environmental Assessment for the Proposed Avoca Gas Storage Field Project and Request
for Comments on Environmental Issues'' (NOI) issued February 1, 1994. 



Summary of the Proposed Changes in Facility Design 



Avoca proposes the following changes in the Avoca Gas Storage Field Project: 

 new locations for the brine disposal wells, brine disposal pipeline, water source pipeline, and the solution-mined
cavern wells; 

 a change in the design of the cavern system_instead of developing 10 individual caverns, Avoca would solution-mine
5 caverns using 10 wells (2 wells per cavern); and 

 Avoca proposes to increase its solution-mining rate by withdrawing up to 3 million gallons of water per day
(2,000 gallons per minute), rather than limiting its withdrawal to 2 million gallons of water per day. The total leaching
period for all five caverns is approximately 3 years. 

Avoca has moved several of its proposed facilities. The new proposed location of these facilities is shown in appendix
1.

1

 Avoca states that the proposed changes in facility locations are a result of negotiations with local landowners.






Avoca proposes the change in cavern design and the increase in leaching rate to reduce the time required to solution-mine
the proposed caverns. Avoca states that it has obligations to have certain facilities in service for the 1996 winter
heating season. Avoca believes that reducing the time required to solution-mine its caverns will allow it to place
some of the proposed facilities in service for the 1996 winter heating season. 



The EA Process 



The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) requires the Commission to take into account the environmental impacts
that could result from an action whenever it considers the issuance of a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity.
NEPA also requires us to discover and address concerns the public may have about proposals. We call this ``scoping.''
The main goal of the scoping process is to focus the analysis in the EA on the important environmental issues. By this
Notice of Intent, the Commission requests public comments on the scope of the issues it will address in the EA. All comments
received are taken into account during the preparation of the EA. 

The EA will discuss impacts that could occur as a result of the construction and operation of the proposed project under
these general headings: 

 


 geology and soils 

 water resources, fisheries, and wetlands 

 vegetation and wildlife 

 endangered and threatened species 

 land use 

 cultural resources 

 air quality and noise 

 hazardous waste 

 


We will also evaluate possible alternatives to the proposed project or portions of the project, and make recommendations
on how to lessen or avoid impacts on the various resource areas. 

Our independent analysis of the issues will be in the EA. Depending on the comments received during the scoping process,
the EA may be published and mailed to Federal, state, and local agencies, public interest groups, interested individuals,
affected landowners, newspapers, libraries, and the Commission's official service list for this proceeding. A
comment period will be allotted for review if the EA is published. We will consider all comments on the EA before we recommend
that the Commission approve or not approve the project. 



Additional Environmental Issues 



We have already identified several environmental issues that we think deserve attention based on a preliminary review
of the proposed facilities and the information provided by Avoca. These were listed in the Commission's February
1, 1994 NOI. 

As a result of Avoca's modified proposal, the following additional environmental issues will be addressed: 

 Avoca proposes to use up to 3,000,000 gallons of water per day for the solution-mining process. This may have
an impact on groundwater availability. Testing of wells in the local aquifers indicates that the water supply recharges
up to 14,600,000 gallons of water per day. 

 Avoca's brine disposal pipelines would cross five wetlands. 

 Moving the facilities to the new locations may have an impact on cultural resources. 



Public Participation 



You can make a difference by sending a letter addressing your specific comments or concerns about the project. You
should focus on the potential environmental effects of the proposal, alternatives to the proposal (including alternative
routes), and measures to avoid or lessen environmental impact. The more specific your comments, the more useful they
will be. 

Please follow the instructions below to ensure that your comments are received and properly recorded: 

 Address your letter to: Lois Cashell, Secretary, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol
St., NE., Washington, DC 20426; 

 Reference Docket No. CP94-161-000;

 Send a copy of your letter to: Mr. Steven G. Grape, EA Project Manager, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission,
825 North Capitol St., NE. Room 7312, Washington, D.C. 20426; and 

 Mail your comments so that they will be received in Washington, D.C. on or before July 14, 1994. 

 


If you wish to receive a copy of the EA, you should request one from Mr. Grape at the above address. 



Becoming an Intervenor 



In addition to involvement in the EA scoping process, you may want to become an official party to the proceeding or become
an ``intervenor.'' Among other things, intervenors have the right to receive copies of case-related Commission
documents and filings by other intervenors. Likewise, each intervenor must provide copies of its filings to all other
parties. If you want to become an intervenor you must file a Motion to Intervene according to Rule 214 of the Commission's
Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.214) attached as appendix 2. 

The date for filing timely motions to intervene in this proceeding has passed. Therefore, parties now seeking to file
late interventions must show good cause, as required by section 385.214(b)(3), why this time limitation should be
waived. Environmental issues have been viewed as good cause for late intervention. You do not need intervenor status
to have your scoping comments considered. 



Additional Questions? 



Additional information about the proposed project is available from Mr. Steven G. Grape, EA Project Manager, at (202)
208-1046.

<DOCTITLE>Ketchikan Public Utilities ; Availability of Final Environmental Assessment</DOCTITLE>


June 27, 1994.


In accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's
(Commission's) regulations, 18 CFR Part 380 (Order No. 486, 52 FR 47897), the Office of Hydropower Licensing has reviewed
the application for a new major license for the existing Beaver Falls Hydroelectric Project, located on Beaver Falls
Creek near the city of Ketchikan, in the First Judicial District of Alaska. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
and the U.S. Forest Service, Ketchikan Ranger District, have prepared a Final Environmental Assessment (FEA) for
the project that analyzes existing and potential future environmental impacts of the existing project and has concluded
that approval of the project, with appropriate enhancement measures, would not constitute a major federal action
significantly affecting the quality of the human environment. 
Copies of the FEA are available for review in the Public Reference Branch, Room 3104, of the Commission's offices at
941 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426.

<DOCTITLE>Public Utility District No. 2 of Grant County; Intent to Prepare an Environmental Impact Statement and to Conduct
a Scoping Meeting</DOCTITLE>


June 27, 1994.



In accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's
regulations, 18 CFR part 380 (Order No. 486, 52 F.R. 47910), the Office of Hydropower Licensing has evaluated four
downstream fish passage alternatives addressed in the Mid-Columbia Proceeding (Docket No. E-9569-003)
for the Priest Rapids Project. Staff's initial evaluation of the proposed modifications was issued on May 25, 1994,
in an environmental assessment (EA). The June 3, 1994 transmittal letter for the EA stated our intent to prepare an
environmental impact statement (EIS).

A draft EIS will be issued and circulated for review by all interested parties. All comments filed on the draft EIS will
be analyzed by staff and considered in the final EIS. Staff's conclusions and recommendations will then be presented
for the consideration of the Commission in reaching its final decision.



Scoping Meetings



To obtain information from the public regarding relevant environmental issues that should be analyzed in the EIS,
the Commission will conduct two public scoping meetings. The first scoping meeting will be held on Monday July 25,
1994 in Portland Oregon, at the Portland Building, 2nd Floor Auditorium, 1120 SW 5th Avenue, from 1 pm to 5 pm. The second
scoping meeting will be held on Wednesday July 27, 1994 in Ephrata, Washington at the City of Ephrata Recreation Center,
112 Basin Street SW, from 7:00 pm to 11 pm. All interested individuals, organizations, and agencies are invited to
attend.

The EA will be considered the initial coping document. Copies of the EA have been mailed to all entities who have expressed
interest in this proceeding. The EA is also available in the Commission's Reference and Information Center, Room
3308, of the Commission's offices at 941 North Capitol Street, N.E. Washington, D.C. 20426 and will be available at
the scoping meeting. We encourage all interested parties to read the EA prior to the scoping meeting.



Objectives



At the meeting the staff will: (1) describe the range of issues being considered in this post-licensing proceeding
(2) review the conclusions and recommendations in the EA; (3) receive input from meeting participants on the alternatives
considered in the EA; (4) identify any additional issues that should be included in the EIS; and (5) obtain any additional
information that any entity feels should be considered during the preparation of the EIS.



Procedures



The scoping meeting will be recorded by a stenographer and all statements (oral and written) will become part of the
Commission's public record for this proceeding. Interested persons who are unable to attend, or do not choose to speak
at the scoping meeting, may submit written statements for inclusion in the public record. All written comments must
be filed with the Secretary, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capital Street N.E., Washington, DC
20426, on or before August 30, 1994.

All written correspondence should clearly show on the first page of each document the following caption: Priest Rapids
Project, FERC Project No. 2114-024.

Further, please note the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure, requires all entities to file an original
and eight copies of any filing with the Commission. Parties filing documents must also serve the documents on each
person whose name is on the official service list.

<DOCTITLE>Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corporation, et al.; Natural Gas Certificate Filings </DOCTITLE>



June 27, 1994. 



Take notice that the following filings have been made with the Commission: 



1. Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corporation 



[Docket No. CP94-619-000] 



Take notice that on June 21, 1994, Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corporation (TGPL), P.O. Box 1396, Houston, Texas
77251, filed in Docket No. CP94-619-000 an application pursuant to Section 7(b) of the Natural Gas Act
for permission and approval to abandon a transportation service for Public Service Electric & Gas Company (PSE&G),
which was authorized in Docket No. CP79-389, as amended, all as more fully set forth in the application on file
with the Commission and open to public inspection. 

TGPL proposes to abandon firm and interruptible transportation carried out under its Rate Schedule X-222 for
PSE&G. TGPL is authorized to transport up to 75,000 dt equivalent of natural gas per day (or a greater amount if
mutually agreed upon) on an interruptible basis for PSE&G and 
up to 6,600 dt equivalent of natural gas per day on a firm basis. 
Both firm and interruptible services were for transportation from offshore and onshore Louisiana to various delivery
points in New Jersey. PSE&G has notified TGPL of its intent to terminate the service under Rate Schedule X-222
with an effective date of June 22, 1994. It is stated that the service proposed for abandonment would be replaced by
TGPL's existing Part 284 transportation on an interruptible service under TGPL's Rate Schedule IT. It is asserted
that PSE&G can receive equivalent service this way with the same quality and flexibility as other Rate Schedule
IT shippers. 



Comment date: 

July 18, 1994, in accordance with Standard Paragraph F at the end of this notice. 



2. ANR Pipeline Company Columbia Gulf Transmission Company



Docket No. CP94-623-000 



Take notice that on June 22, 1994, ANR Pipeline Company (ANR), 500 Renaissance Center, Detroit, Michigan 48243, and
Columbia Gulf Transmission Company (Columbia Gulf), P. O. Box 1273, Charleston, West Virginia 25325, filed in Docket
No. CP94-623-000, a joint application pursuant to Section 7(b) of the Natural Gas Act and Part 157 of the
Commission's Regulations for an order permitting and approving the abandonment of a natural gas exchange service
known as ANR's (formerly Michigan Wisconsin Pipe Line Company) Rate Schedule X-39 and as Columbia Gulf's Rate
Schedule X-15, all as more fully set forth in the application which is on file with the Commission and open to public
inspection. 

ANR and Columbia Gulf state that this exchange service, authorized by an October 26, 1973, order in Docket No. CP74-39,
provides for an exchange to take place when a shortage of gas exists on either company's system, which could be alleviated
by deliveries of gas from the system of the other company. ANR and Columbia Gulf state the points of exchange are at an
interconnection in Eugene Island Block 250, off-shore Louisiana, and at an interconnection near Calumet, St. Mary
Parish, Louisiana. ANR and Columbia Gulf maintain there is no abandonment of any facilities pursuant to the instant
application. 

ANR and Columbia Gulf relate that on August 17, 1993, Columbia Gulf gave ANR written notice of its intention to terminate
the exchange service. 



Comment date: 

July 18, 1994, in accordance with Standard Paragraph F at the end of this notice.

[Docket No. CP94-624-000] 



Take notice that on June 23, 1994, Texas Eastern Transmission Corporation (Texas Eastern), 540 Westheimer Court,
Houston, Texas 77056-5301, filed in Docket No. CP94-624 a request pursuant to   157.205 and
157.211 of the Commission's Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (NGA) (18 CFR 157.205, and 157.211) for authorization
to construct a new delivery point to enable Texas Eastern to deliver natural gas to GATX Terminals Corporation (GATX),
end user. It is stated that it would enable Texas to make natural gas deliveries to GATX under Texas Eastern's blanket
certificate issued on November 5, 1982 in Docket No. CP82-535-000, all as more fully set forth in the request
which is on file with the Commission and open to public inspection. 

Pursuant to Section 157.211 of the Commission's regulations, Texas Eastern requests authorization to install a
new delivery point in order to deliver natural gas under the agreement covering service for GATX under Rate Schedule
IT-1 of Texas Eastern's FERC Gas Tariff, Volume No. 1, and that Texas Eastern's existing tariff does not prohibit
the additional volumes. Texas Eastern states that the peak and average day deliveries at the point would be 5,000 Dth
per day. 

Texas Eastern states that the installation of the delivery point will have no effect on Texas Eastern's peak day or
annual deliveries. Texas Eastern submits that its proposal will be accomplished without detriment or disadvantage
to Texas Eastern's other customers. 

The delivery point to be installed by Texas Eastern includes the installation of two 2-inch taps on Texas Eastern's
12-inch Line Nos. 1-C and 1-R at M.P. 2.63 in Richmond County, New York. The approximate cost of such facilities
is $551,500 and would be 100% reimbursable by GATX. 

It is further stated that GATX would cause to be installed a dual 2-inch meter station, including 50 feet of 4-inch pipeline
between the proposed Texas Eastern taps to GATX's proposed meter station and electronic gas measurement equipment.

ACTION:

 Notice of Intended Transfer of Confidential Business Information to a Subcontractor. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) intends to transfer confidential business information (CBI) collected
from the landfills and incinerators industry to Highland Data Services, a subcontractor of Science Applications
International Corporation (SAIC). The information being transferred was collected or will be collected under the
authority of Section 308 of the Clean Water Act. Interested persons may submit comments on this intended transfer
of information to the address noted below. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 EPA intends to transfer information, including CBI, to Highland Data Services for data entry. In accordance with
40 CFR Part 2, Subpart B, SAIC was identified in letters to industry as one of a number of contractors and subcontractors
receiving this information. In effect, this notice merely adds Highland Data Services to the list. 



The information being transferred consists of information previously collected by EPA's Office of Science and Technology
(OST), in connection with the Waste Treatment Industry Phase II Questionnaires, to support the development of effluent
limitations guidelines and standards under the Clean Water Act for the landfills and incinerators industry. 

EPA also intends to transfer to SAIC and Highland Data Services all information listed in this notice, of the type described
above (including CBI) that may be collected in the future under the authority of CWA Section 308, as is necessary to
enable SAIC and Highland Data Services to carry out the work required by their contracts to support EPA's development
of effluent limitations guidelines and standards for the landfills and incinerators industry.

<DOCTITLE>National Air Pollution Control Techniques Advisory Committee; Open Meeting</DOCTITLE>



<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of open meeting.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

A meeting of the National Air Pollution Control Techniques Advisory Committee (NAPCTAC) will be held at the Sheraton
Inn University Center, 2800 Middleton Avenue, Durham, North Carolina 27705. The telephone number is (919) 383-8575.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Section 183(e) of the Clean Air Act of 1990 requires the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to conduct a study
of emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOC's) from consumer and commercial products and to report to Congress
the findings of the study. Upon submittal of the report to the Congress, the EPA must list those categories of products
which contribute at least 80 percent of the VOC emissions from all consumer and commercial products in ozone nonattainment
areas. The EPA must at that time divide the list into 4 groups by priority. Beginning no later than 2 years after publishing
the list, the EPA must regulate one group every 2 years until all 4 groups are regulated.



One objective of the study is to develop criteria for regulating consumer and commercial products under section 183(e).
These criteria are to be used to select products for regulation. Section 183(e) lists 5 factors which must be taken
into consideration when developing the criteria: (1) The uses, benefits, and commercial demand of consumer and commercial
products; (2) any health or safety functions served by the products; (3) those consumer and commercial products which
emit highly reactive VOC's into the ambient air; (4) those products which are subject to the most cost-effective controls;
and (5) the availability of any alternatives to such consumer and commercial products that are of comparable costs,
considering health, safety, and environmental impacts. The EPA has developed criteria based on the 5 factors listed
in section 183(e).

The EPA has not yet exercised the criteria to develop a prioritized list of categories for regulation under section
183(e). In order to ensure consistency and fairness in developing the draft prioritized category list, a decision
was made to convene an independent panel to exercise the criteria.

The National Air Pollution Control Techniques Advisory Committee (NAPCTAC), established in 1968 by the Surgeon
General, is an ongoing advisory group which provides independent views based upon specialized knowledge and skills
unavailable in the EPA. The NAPCTAC consists of the Director, Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards, or his
designee, as chairperson and 11 members appointed by the EPA's Deputy Administrator. The members are selected from
the chemical, engineering, biomedical, and socioeconomic disciplines resident in universities, State and local
governments, research institutions, industry, and public interest groups.

Because of the balance afforded by such a diverse group, the NAPCTAC was considered a logical and convenient choice
for the panel. The panel will consider each category of products subject to section 183(e) and will assign a score of
1 to 5 for each criterion. The output of the scoring exercise will be a draft prioritized category list, with the highest
scored categories receiving the highest priority for regulation.

The draft list will be reviewed by the Administrator who reserves the right to make adjustments to the list. For example,
certain health and safety products may be considered for exemption as provided for in section 183(e)(3)(a). Some
product categories may be grouped in the interest of regulatory efficiency. The criteria and draft prioritized category
list are not final and may be subject to change until regulatory action is taken.

The agenda for the meeting is as follows:





July 18 (Monday)_9 a.m. to 12 p.m.



_Overview of section 183(e) and expectations for the meeting.

_Presentations by interested parties (10 minutes each).



1 to 5 p.m.



_Criteria exercised by the NAPCTAC panel



7 to 10 p.m. Evening Session



_Continue criteria exercise



July 19 (Tuesday)_8 a.m. to 12 p.m.



_Continue criteria exercise



1 to 5 p.m.



_Continue and conclude criteria exercise

_Closing remarks

<DOCTITLE>Proposed Agreement and Covenant Not To Sue Under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability
Act; Peterson/Puritan, Inc. Superfund Site; Lincoln and Cumberland, RI </DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Environmental Protection Agency. 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of proposed agreement and covenant not to sue and request for public comment. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to enter into a prospective purchaser agreement and
covenant not to sue (the ``agreement'') to resolve potential claims under the Comprehensive Environmental Response,
Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended (CERCLA), 42 U.S.C. 9601. Notice is being published to inform the
public of the proposed agreement and of the opportunity to comment. The agreement is intended to resolve the potential
liability under CERCLA of Alpha-Realty Corporation, N.F.A. Corporation and The Rhode Island Industrial Facilities
Corporation (``the Settling Parties'') regarding a portion of the Peterson/Puritan, Inc. Superfund Site in Lincoln
and Cumberland, Rhode Island. The Settling Parties are acquiring the Health-Tex property portion of the Peterson/Puritan,
Inc. Superfund Site. 

 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Notice is hereby given of a proposed agreement concerning the Peterson/Puritan, Inc. Superfund Site in Lincoln and
Cumberland, RI. The agreement was approved by EPA Region I on June 22, 1994 subject to review by the public pursuant
to this Notice. The Settling Parties have executed signature pages committing them to participate in the agreement.
Under the proposed agreement, the Settling Parties are required to pay $150,000 to the Hazardous Substances Superfund;
grant access to the property to EPA, its authorized officers, employees, representatives, and all other persons
performing response actions under EPA oversight; and record institutional controls for the property in the form
of a deed restriction. EPA believes the settlement is fair and in the public interest. 



EPA is entering into this agreement under the inherent settlement authority of CERCLA. CERCLA provides EPA with authority
to consider, compromise, and settle a potential claim under section 107 of CERCLA if the claim has not been referred
to the U.S. Department of Justice for further action. The U.S. Department of Justice approved this settlement in writing
on June 20, 1994. 

EPA will receive written comments relating to this settlement for twenty-one (21) days from the date of publication
of this Notice. 

A copy of the proposed administrative settlement may be obtained in person or by mail from Brian Rohan, U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency, Office of Regional Counsel, JFK Federal Building_RCU, Boston, Massachusetts 02203, (617) 565-3699.


The Agency's response to any comments received will be available for public inspection with the Docket Clerk, U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency, Region I, JFK Federal Building_RCG, Boston, Massachusetts (U.S. EPA Docket No.
I-94-1061).

ACTION: 

Statement of policy.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Commission has determined that it is unnecessary and inappropriate to include in any of its consent decrees any
provision establishing as a defense to an action brought to enforce the consent decree that the defendant's errors
and omissions were inadvertent and unintentional and that the causes and consequences of these errors and omissions
were quickly remedied.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

In each of two previous Consent Decrees, 

Damark International, Inc.,

 Civ. No. 4-91-275 (D. Minn. 1991), and 

Lillian Vernon Co.,

 92 Civ. 7537 (CLB) (S.D.N.Y. 1992), the Commission included a provision that provided a defense against an enforcement
action if the defendant could establish that (1) any order violations arose from inadvertent and unintentional errors
that may have occurred despite the defendant's good faith maintenance of records and procedures to prevent such errors,
and (2) the defendant took prompt action to remedy any cause of, or injury resulting from, those errors. The Commission
now has decided that such provisions are unnecessary in light of the Commission's inherent prosecutorial discretion.



The Commission initiates law enforcement actions under Section 5 of the FTC Act, 15 U.S.C. 45, only when it has reason
to believe both that the law has been violated and that an action is in the public interest. In deciding whether an action
is in the public interest, the Commission considers, among other things, the scope of the alleged violation, the circumstances
in which it occurred and the extent of any resulting injury. Accordingly, the Commission believes that the inclusion
of the language referred to above from the decisions and orders in 

Damark

 and 

Lillian Vernon

 is redundant to its public interest considerations and could cause confusion concerning the Commission's exercise
of prosecutorial discretion within the terms of Section 5. Therefore, the Commission's policy will be to refuse to
approve proposed consent decrees containing provisions designed to circumscribe liability for inadvertent and
promptly remedied errors, or otherwise to delineate the Commission's discretion in initiating law enforcement
proceedings.






Authority:

Dissenting statement of Commissioner Deborah K. Owen, regarding the Commission's policy statement concerning
errors and omissions clauses in consent decrees.

I have voted against the proposed change in Commission policy, which would preclude a defense in consent decrees relating
to inadvertent and unintentional errors by defendants. In my view, such language is harmless with respect to any legitimate
Commission interest, and may serve to reassure parties as to the judicious exercise of our prosecutorial discretion.

<DOCTITLE>Granting of Request for Early Termination of the Waiting Period Under the Premerger Notification Rules</DOCTITLE>


Section 7A of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. 18a, as added by Title II of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements
Act of 1976, requires persons contemplating certain mergers or acquisitions to give the Federal Trade Commission
and the Assistant Attorney General advance notice and to wait designated periods before consummation of such plans.
Section 7A(b)(2) of the Act permits the agencies, in individual cases, to terminate this waiting period prior to its
expiration and requires that notice of this action be published in the 

Federal Register

.
The following transactions were granted early termination of the waiting period provided by law and the premerger
notification rules. The grants were made by the Federal Trade Commission and the Assistant Attorney General for the
Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice. Neither agency intends to take any action with respect to these proposed
acquisitions during the applicable waiting period.

<DOCTITLE>Rescission of Social Security Acquiescence Ruling 86-1(9)_Summy v. Schweiker, 688 F.2d 1233 (9th Cir. 1982)
</DOCTITLE>







<AGENCY>

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Rescission of Social Security Acquiescence Ruling. 





</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 In accordance with 20 CFR 416.1485(e) and 422.406(b)(2), the Commissioner of Social Security gives notice of the
rescission of Social Security Acquiescence Ruling 86-1(9). 




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 A Social Security Acquiescence Ruling explains how we will apply a holding in a decision of a United States Court of
Appeals that we determine conflicts with our interpretation of a provision of the Social Security Act or regulations
when the Government has decided not to seek further review of the case or is unsuccessful on further review. 




As provided by 20 CFR 416.1485(e)(4), a Social Security Acquiescence Ruling may be rescinded as obsolete if we subsequently
clarify, modify or revoke the regulation or ruling that was the subject of the circuit court holding for which the Acquiescence
Ruling was issued. 


On January 23, 1986, we issued Acquiescence Ruling 86-1(9) to reflect the holding in 

Summy

 v. 

Schweiker

, 688 F.2d 1233 (9th Cir. 1982), that an additional pension or compensation payment from the Veterans Administration
(now the Department of Veterans Affairs) as a result of unreimbursed medical expenses is not income for Supplemental
Security Income purposes. 


Concurrent with the rescission of this ruling, we are adding a new paragraph (a)(7) to section 416.1103 of Social Security
Regulations No. 16 (20 CFR 416.1103), which provides that payments from the Department of Veterans Affairs resulting
from unusual medical expenses are not income for Supplemental Security Income purposes. Because the change in the
regulations adopts the court's holding 

Summy

 on a nationwide basis, we are rescinding the current Acquiescence Ruling.

Creve Coeur Lake Memorial Park Draft Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Availability of draft supplemental environmental impact statement for determination of section 6(f) replacement
lands for Creve Coeur Lake Memorial Park, St. Louis County, Missouri. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The National Park Service, in compliance with section 102(2)(c) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1069
(NEPA) [42 United States Code (U.S.C.) 4321 et seq. and 42 U.S.C. 4332, as amended] and with section 6(f) of the Land
and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) Act (Public Law 88-578, as amended), announces the availability of a draft
supplemental environmental impact statement (DSEIS) evaluating additional replacement land for the 184 acres
of Creve Coeur Lake Memorial Park converted from outdoor recreation use. Creve Coeur Lake Memorial Park is a county
park which has received Federal financial assistance from the LWCF program. This DSEIS will supplement the final
environmental impact statement (FEIS) for Page Avenue (Route D) extension, St. Louis and St. Charles Counties, Missouri,
approved in a Record of Decision on January 6, 1993, by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA). 



The FHWA FEIS addressed construction of a ten-land elevated extension of Page Avenue across the southern tip of the
park site assuming all necessary coordination with other Federal agencies has been satisfactorily accomplished.
The National Park Service on December 11, 1992, adopted the FEIS for use in the environmental evaluation requirements
of section 6(f) of the LWCF Act. 

The initial proposal of 265 acres, submitted by the State of Missouri to replace the converted 184 acres was determined
by the National Park Service as not offering ``reasonably equivalent usefulness'' to the extent necessary to reflect
appropriately the loss of this unique natural area. Secretary Babbitt announced on May 18, 1993, in letters to Senators
Danforth and Bond, that he did not intend to use his authority under section 6(f)(3) to block the construction of this
highway project. He further stated that ``. . . it is necessary to identify a significant amount
of additional lands to be included in the mitigation package.'' 

The DSEIS identifies a range of alternative land proposals, including additional substitution properties, and
analyzes the ``equivalent usefulness'' of each candidate replacement land parcel. In addition, each of the replacement
parcels have been evaluated for impacts on natural and cultural resources, the socioeconomic environment, and current
uses. 

The State of Missouri's and the NPS's preferred alternative for additional replacement land is identified in the
DSEIS as Alternative B (Little Creve Coeur Lake Proposal). The alternative, consisting of approximately 440 acres
and located southwest of the present Creve Coeur Lake Memorial Park, consists primarily of wetlands presently in
agricultural use. 

Copies of the DSEIS may be obtained from the responsible official, Mr. William Schenk, Acting Regional Director (refer
to address below). Comments on the DSEIS should be received no later than August 8, 1994.

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Public hearing regarding the federal subsistence sheep season in a portion of Unit 23 in the Baird Mountains, Alaska.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 A public hearing is scheduled regarding the federal subsistence sheep season in the Baird Mountain portion of Unit
23. Dependent upon the status of the sheep population, the Federal Subsistence Board may have to exercise its closure
authority to conserve healthy and natural populations of sheep in the area. If such a closure becomes necessary, this
public meeting will have fulfilled the requirements of 50 CFR 100.19. The purpose of the meeting will be to inform the
public of the status of the sheep population and of potential proposals to the Federal Subsistence Board for action.
Public comment will be accepted.



BACKGROUND:

 Aerial surveys conducted in the Baird Mountains (that area of Unit 23 south and east of the Noatak River) show a dramatic
decline in the sheep population since 1989. In an effort to protect this population and facilitate its recovery, this
area has been closed to all hunting of sheep since 1991, through closure actions of the Federal Subsistence Board.
Survey results from July 1992 indicate the sharp decline has at least temporarily stopped; however, the population
has not significantly grown. A sheep survey by the Alaska Department of Fish and Game and the National Park Service
is scheduled for mid-July 1994. These survey results are expected to be available for discussion at the July 21 meeting.
Should the survey and past biological data indicate a continuing threat to the conservation of a health population
of sheep in the Baird Mountains of Unit 23, a proposal will be advanced to the Federal Subsistence Board to once again
close federal public lands to sport hunting, under Alaska regulations, and, perhaps, to the subsistence seasons
currently scheduled for August 10-September 20, 1994, and October 1-April 30, 1995. The Federal Subsistence
Board will make a final determination on any such proposed closure, if advanced.


The National Park Service is hosting this meeting as the principal federal land manager in the Baird Mountains area.
The federal lands in the Baird Mountain area are within the Noatak National Preserve, Kobuk Valley National Park,
and Kobuk District, Bureau of Land Management.

CSX Transportation, Inc._Trackage Rights Exemption_Wheeling & Lake Erie Railway Company



Wheeling & Lake Erie Railway Company (W&LE) has agreed to grant to CSX Transportation, Inc. (CSXT), overhead
trackage rights over approximately 101 miles of rail line, between W&LE's milepost 73.6, at Harmon, near Brewster,
OH, and W&LE's milepost A-101.5, at Greenwich, OH, where CSXT's and W&LE's lines connect. The trackage
rights will, in effect, substitute for trackage rights CSXT held over another W&LE line, between Brewster and
Creston, OH. CSXT's discontinuance of its trackage rights and W&LE's abandonment of that line were the subject
of a notice of exemption in 

CSX Transportation, Inc._Discontinuance of Trackage Rights Exemption_In Stark and Wayne Counties, OH,

 Docket No. AB-55 (Sub-No. 445) (ICC served Sept. 22, 1992), and a petition for exemption in 

The Wheeling & Lake Erie Railway Company_Abandonment Exemption_In Stark, Wayne, and Medina Counties, OH,

 Docket No. AB-227 (Sub-No. 2X) (ICC served Oct. 1, 1992), respectively. The trackage rights were to become
effective on June 23, 1994.
This notice is filed under 49 CFR 1180.2(d)(7). If the notice contains false or misleading information the exemption
is void 

ab initio

. Petitions to revoke the exemption under 49 U.S.C. 10505(d) may be filed at any time. The filing of a petition to revoke
will not stay the transaction. Pleadings must be filed with the Commission and served on: Charles M. Rosenberger,
CSX Transportation, Inc., 500 Water Street J150, Jacksonville, FL 32202.
As a condition to the use of this exemption, any employees affected by the trackage rights will be protected under

In The United States District Court, District of Wyoming





United States of America, 

Plaintiff, vs. 

Nagel Motors, Inc., Greiner Motor Company, Inc. and Benson Chevrolet, Inc., 

Defendants. Civil No. 94-CV-146.



Competitive Impact Statement



Pursuant to Section 2(b) of the Antitrust Procedures and Penalties Act, 15 U.S.C. 16(b)-(h), the United States
submits this Competitive Impact Statement relating to the proposed Final Judgment submitted for entry with the consent
of Nagel Motors, Inc., Greiner Motor Company, Inc. and Benson Chevrolet, Inc. in this civil antitrust proceeding.



I. Nature and Purpose of the Proceeding



On June 2, 1994, the United States filed a civil antitrust complaint alleging that Nagel Motors, Inc., Greiner Motor
Company, Inc., Benson Chevrolet, Inc. and their co-conspirators conspired to unreasonably restrain competition
among Casper, Wyoming automobile body repair shops in violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. 1. The Complaint
asks the Court to find that Nagel Motors, Inc., Greiner Motor Company, Inc., and Benson Chevrolet, Inc. have violated
Section 1 of the Sherman Act and further requests the Court to enjoin the continuance of the conspiracy.

Entry of the proposed Final Judgment will terminate the action, except that the Court will retain jurisdiction over
the matter for further proceedings which may be required to interpret, enforce or modify the Judgment or to punish
violations of any of its provisions.



II. Practices Giving Rise to the Alleged Violations



Defendants, Nagel Motors, Inc., Greiner Motor Company, Inc. and Benson Chevrolet, Inc. are automobile dealerships
operating in Casper, Wyoming. They each offer a full range of automobile repair services, including automobile body
repair work.

The Government contends, and was prepared to show at trial, that during the period beginning as early as December 1990
and continuing through at least July 1993, the defendants and their co-conspirators agreed, combined and conspired
to unreasonably restrain competition among Casper, Wyoming area automobile body repair shops in violation of Section
1 of the Sherman Act. These agreements, combinations and conspiracies consisted of discussions and information
exchanges aimed at increasing the rates charged for automobile body repair services in the Casper area.

For the purpose of forming and effectuating these agreements, combinations and conspiracies, Nagel Motors, Inc.,
Greiner Motor Company, Inc., Benson Chevrolet, Inc., and their co-conspirators, communicated with each other concerning
the need to increase automobile body repair rates and, in conjunction with these discussions, disseminated to each
other information concerning contemplated changes in automobile body repair rates. As a result of their discussions
and exchange of contemplated changes in repair rates, coordinated rate increases were put into effect.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940705-2-00096 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940705-2-00067 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

These agreements, combinations and conspiracies suppressed price competition among the defendants and their co-conspirators
for providing automobile body repair services in the Casper area and deprived consumers of the benefits of free and
open competition in the purchase of automobile body repair services.


III. Explanation of the Proposed Final Judgment


The United States and Nagel Motors, Inc., Greiner Motor Company, Inc. and Benson Chevrolet, Inc. have stipulated
that the Court may enter the proposed Final Judgment after compliance with the Antitrust Procedures and Penalties
Act, 15 U.S.C. 16(b)-(h). The proposed Final Judgment provides that its entry does not constitute any evidence
against or admission of any party with respect to any issue of fact or law.
Under the provisions of Section 2(e) of the Antitrust Procedures and Penalties Act, 15 U.S.C. 16(e), the proposed
Final Judgment may not be entered unless the Court finds that entry is in the public interest. Section VIII of the proposed
Final Judgment sets forth such a finding.
The proposed Final Judgment is intended to ensure that Nagel Motors, Inc., Greiner Motor Company, Inc. and Benson
Chevrolet, Inc. discontinue all practices which unreasonably restrain competition among automobile body repair
shops.


A. Prohibitions and Obligations


Under Section IV of the proposed Final Judgment, Nagel Motors, Inc., Greiner Motor Company, Inc. and Benson Chevrolet,
Inc. are enjoined and restrained from: (1) Agreeing with any other automobile body repair shop to fix, establish,
raise, stabilize or maintain any hourly rate or part price or discount; (2) participating in any discussion with or
communicating with any other automobile body repair shop concerning adherence to or changes to, or the need or desirability
of adhering to or changing, any hourly rate or part price or discount; and (3) disseminating any information to any
automobile body repair shop concerning any planned or contemplated change in an hourly rate or part price or discount.
Section V of the proposed Final Judgment obligates Nagel Motors, Inc., Greiner Motor Company, Inc. and Benson Chevrolet,
Inc. to implement and maintain an antitrust compliance program. This program would require each defendant to designate
an Antitrust Compliance Officer within 30 days of entry of the Final Judgment. The Antitrust Compliance Officer for
each defendant would be responsible for implementing and supervising the antitrust compliance program and compliance
with the Final Judgment. Section V also obligates Nagel Motors, Inc., Greiner Motor Company, Inc. and Benson Chevrolet,
Inc. to distribute within 60 days from entry of the Final Judgment, a copy of the Final Judgment to all officers and employees
responsible for approving, disapproving, monitoring, recommending, or implementing any hourly rate or part price
or discount, as well as any officer or employee who succeeds to such a position, and briefing those persons annually
on the meaning and requirements of the Final Judgment and the antitrust laws and advising them that the defendant's
legal advisors are available to confer with them regarding compliance with the Final Judgment and the antitrust laws.
Further the Antitrust Compliance Officer must obtain from each such officer or employee, annual written certifications
stating that he or she: (1) Has read, understands, and agrees to abide by the terms of the Final Judgment; (2) has been
advised and understands that his or her failure to comply with the Final Judgment may result in conviction for criminal
contempt of court; and (3) is not aware of any violation of the Final Judgment that has not been reported to the Antitrust
Compliance Officer. The Antitrust Compliance Officer must maintain a record of recipients to whom the Final Judgment
has been distributed and from whom certifications have been obtained. He or she must also report to the Department
of Justice any violation of the Final Judgment. Finally, the Antitrust Compliance Officer must also distribute copies
of the Final Judgment to the owner or manager of each automobile body repair shop, located within 50 miles of Casper,
Wyoming, which is presently in business and has purchased parts or body repair services from the defendant in the last
five years.
In addition to the prohibitions and obligations contained in Section IV and V, Nagel Motors, Inc., Greiner Motor Company,
Inc. and Benson Chevrolet, Inc. are further obligated, under Section VI, to certify, within 75 days after the entry
of the Final Judgment, that they have designated an Antitrust Compliance Officer and have distributed the Final Judgment
in accordance with the Section V requirement. Section VI also requires Nagel Motors, Inc., Greiner Motor Company,
Inc. and Benson Chevrolet, Inc., for a period of ten years after the entry of the Final Judgment, on or before its anniversary
date, to file with the Government, a statement as to the fact and manner of compliance with the provisions of Section
V of the Final Judgment.

B. Scope of the Proposed Final Judgment



Section VIII of the proposed Final Judgment provides that the Final Judgment shall remain in effect for ten years.

Section III of the proposed Final Judgment provides that the Final Judgment shall apply to Nagel Motors, Inc., Greiner
Motor Company, Inc. and Benson Chevrolet, Inc. and to each of their successors, assigns, and to all other persons in
active concert or participation with any of them who shall have received actual notice of the Final Judgment by personal
service or otherwise.



C. Effect of the Proposed Final Judgment on Competition



The relief set out in the proposed Final Judgment is designed to prevent recurrence of the activities alleged in the
Complaint. The proposed Final Judgment's provisions are designed to remove the artificial restraints that the defendants
have imposed on competition among automobile body repair shops and create an environment in which more vigorous competition
may take place. It is intended to ensure that marketing and pricing decisions of Nagel Motors, Inc., Greiner Motor
Company, Inc. and Benson Chevrolet, Inc. are made independently, without any discussions and conversations with
each other. The Department of Justice believes that the proposed Final Judgment contains sufficient provisions
to prevent further violations of the type alleged in the Complaint.



IV. Alternatives to the Proposed Final Judgment



The alternative to the proposed Final Judgment would be a full trial of the case. In the view of the Department of Justice,
such a trial would involve substantial cost to the United States and is not warranted because the proposed Final Judgment
provides relief that will remedy the violations of the Sherman Act alleged in the United States' Complaint.



V. Remedies Available to Private Litigants



Section 4 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. 15, provides that any person who has been injured as a result of conduct prohibited
by the antitrust laws may bring suit in federal court to recover three times the damages suffered, as well as costs and
reasonable attorney's fees. Under the provisions of Section 5(a) of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. 16(a), the Final Judgment
has no 

prima facie

 effect in any subsequent lawsuits that may be brought against any defendant in this matter.



VI. Procedures Available for Modification of the Proposed Judgment



As provided by the Antitrust Procedures and Penalties Act, any person believing that the proposed judgment should
be modified may submit written comments to Gary R. Spratling, Chief, San Francisco Office, Department of Justice,
Antitrust Division, 450 Golden Gate Avenue, San Francisco, California 94102, within the 60-day period provided
by the Act. These comments, and the Government's responses to them, will be filed with the Court and published in the


Federal Register

. All comments will be given due consideration by the Department of Justice, which remains free to withdraw its consent
to the proposed judgment at any time prior to its entry if it should determine that some modification of the judgment
is necessary to the public interest. The proposed judgment itself provides that the Court will retain jurisdiction
over this action, and that the parties may apply to the court for such orders as may be necessary or appropriate for the
modification or enforcement of the judgment.



VII. Determinative Documents



No materials and documents of the type described in Section 2(b) of the Antitrust Procedures and Penalties Act, 15
U.S.C. 16(b), were considered in formulating the proposed judgment. Consequently, none are filed herewith.

<USDEPT>NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION</USDEPT>





Connecticut Yankee Atomic Power Company; Haddam Neck Plant Environmental Assessment and Finding of No Significant
Impact


The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an amendment to Facility Operating
License No. DPR-61, issued to Connecticut Yankee Atomic Power Company (CYAPCO, the licensee), for operation
of the Haddam Neck Plant, located in Middlesex County, Connecticut.


Environmental Assessment


Identification of the Proposed Action


The proposed amendment will revise Technical Specification (TS) Section 3/4.5.1, ``ECCS Subsystems_Tavg Greater
Than or Equal to 350 
 F,'' by adding a new ACTION Statement ``a'' which increases the allowed outage time for the centrifugal charging
pumps from 72 hours to 7 days. The Technical Specification changes will reduce the risk of an unnecessary shutdown
to perform charging pump repairs. The proposed action is in accordance with the licensee's amendment request dated
November 2, 1993, as supplemented February 28, 1994, and May 31, 1994.


The Need for the Proposed Action


The current TS allows a charging pump to be inoperable for a period of up to 72 hours. Experience at the plant has shown
that 72 hours may not be sufficient to accomplish certain repairs such as rebuilding the rotating assembly or complete
pump replacement. Increasing the allowed outage time to 7 days provides sufficient time to perform such repairs without
having to shut the plant down.


Environmental Impacts of the Proposed Action


The Commission has completed its evaluation of the proposed revision to the TS. The increase in the core damage frequency
due to internal events as result of the increased allowed outage time is 3.0E-7 per year or less than 1 percent
of the current core damage frequency of 1.8E-4 per year for internal events. The increase in the core damage frequency
due to external events as result of the increased outage time has been determined to be insignificant for external
events. The unavailability of the charging pumps has limited effects on the risk because the charging pumps are not
credited for during the injection phase of a design basis accident and are the backup to the high-pressure safety injection
pumps during the recirculation phase if power is available. The only use of the charging pumps credited in the safety
analysis is for two path sump recirculation, which is later in the accident and is manually initiated.
The TS change will not increase the probability or consequences of accidents, no changes are being made in the types
of any effluents that may be released offsite, and there is no significant increase in the allowable individual or
cumulative occupational radiation exposure. Therefore, the Commission concludes that there are no significant
radiological environmental impacts associated with this proposed TS amendment.
With regard to potential nonradiological impacts, the proposed amendment involves features located entirely within
the restricted area as defined in 10 CFR Part 20. It does not affect nonradiological plant effluents and has no other
environmental impact. Therefore, the Commission concludes that there are no significant nonradiological environmental
impacts associated with the proposed amendment.


Alternatives to the Proposed Action


Since the Commission has concluded there is no measurable environmental impact associated with the proposed amendment,
any alternatives with equal or greater environmental impact need not be evaluated. The principal alternative to
the amendment would be to deny the amendment request. Such action would not enhance the protection of the environment
and would result in unjustified cost to the licensee.


Alternative Use of Resources


This action does not involve the use of resources not considered previously in the Final Environmental Statement
for the Haddam Neck Plant.


Agencies and Persons Consulted


The NRC staff consulted with the Connecticut State official regarding the environmental impact of the proposed action.
The State official had no comments.


Finding of No Significant Impact


Based upon the environmental assessment, the Commission concludes that the proposed action will not have a significant
effect on the quality of the human environment. Accordingly, the Commission has determined not to prepare an environmental
impact statement for the proposed amendment.
For further details with respect to this proposed action, see the licensee's letters dated November 2, 1993, as supplemented
February 28, and May 31, 1994. These letters are available for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document
Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street NW., Washington, DC 20555, and at the local public document room located at
the Russell Library, 123 Broad Street, Middletown Connecticut 06547.

<DOCTITLE>GPU Nuclear Corporation; Notice of Consideration of Issuance of Amendment to Facility Operating License and Opportunity
for a Hearing</DOCTITLE>





The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an amendment to Facility Operating
License No. DPR-16 issued to GPU Nuclear Corporation (GPUN, the licensee) for operation of the Oyster Creek
Nuclear Generating Station located in Ocean County, New Jersey.



The proposed amendment would revise Technical Specification Section 2.3.D to change the setpoints ``Reactor High
Pressure, Relief Valve Initiation'' by increasing the setpoint value by 15 psig for each of the Electromatic Relief
Values in the Automatic Depressurization System.

Before issuance of the proposed license amendment, the Commission will have made findings required by the Atomic
Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act) and the Commission's regulations.

By August 4, 1994, the licensee may file a request for a hearing with respect to issuance of the amendment to the subject
facility operating license and any person whose interest may be affected by this proceeding and who wishes to participate
as a party in the proceeding must file a written request for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene. Requests
for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's ``Rules of Practice
for Domestic Licensing Proceedings'' in 10 CFR Part 2. Interested persons should consult a current copy of 10 CFR 2.714
which is available at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street NW., Washington,
DC 20555 and at the local public document room located at Ocean County Library, Reference Department, 101 Washington
Street, Toms River, New Jersey 08753. If a request for a hearing or petition for leave to intervene is filed by the above
date, the Commission or an Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, designated by the Commission or by the Chairman of the
Atomic Safety and Licensing Board Panel, will rule on the request and/or petition; and the Secretary or the designated
Atomic Safety and Licensing Board will issue a notice of hearing or an appropriate order.

As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall set forth with particularity the interest of the
petitioner in the proceeding, and how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding. The petition
should specifically explain the reasons why intervention should be permitted with particular reference to the following
factors: (1) The nature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made a party to the proceeding; (2) the nature and
extent of the petitioner's property, financial, or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect
of any order which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest. The petition should also identify
the specific aspect(s) of the subject matter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Any person
who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has been admitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting
leave of the Board up to 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended
petition must satisfy the specificity requirements described above.

Not later than 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file
a supplement to the petition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions which are sought to be litigated
in the matter. Each contention must consist of a specific statement of the issue of law or fact to be raised or controverted.
In addition, the petitioner shall provide a brief explanation of the bases of the contention and a concise statement
of the alleged facts or expert opinion which support the contention and on which the petitioner intends to rely in proving
the contention at the hearing. The petitioner must also provide references to those specific sources and documents
of which the petitioner is aware and on which the petitioner intends to rely to establish those facts or expert opinion.
Petitioner must provide sufficient information to show that a genuine dispute exists with the applicant on a material
issue of law or fact. Contentions shall be limited to matters within the scope of the amendment under consideration.
The contention must be one which, if proven, would entitle the petitioner to relief. A petitioner who fails to file
such a supplement which satisfies these requirements with respect to at least one contention will not be permitted
to participate as a party.

Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subject to any limitations in the order granting leave
to intervene, and have the opportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, including the opportunity
to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses.

A request for a hearing or a petition for leave to intervene must be filed with the Secretary of the Commission, U.S.
Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Docketing and Services Branch, or may be delivered
to the Commission's Public Document Room, The Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555, by the above
date, Where petitions are filed during the last 10 days of the notice period, it is requested that the petitioner promptly
so inform the Commission by a toll-free telephone call to Western Union at 1-(800) 248-5100 (in Missouri
1-(800) 342-6700). The Western Union operator should be given Datagram Identification Number N1023
and the following message addressed to John F. Stolz: petitioner's name and telephone number; date petition was mailed;
plant name; and publication date and page number of this 

Federal Register

 notice. A copy of the petition should also be sent to the Office of the General Counsel, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,
Washington, DC 20555, and to Ernest L. Blake, Jr., Esquire, Shaw, Pittman, Potts & Trowbridge, 2300 N Street,
NW., Washington, DC 20037 attorney for the licensee.

Nontimely filings of petitions for leave to intervene, amended petitions, supplemental petitions and/or requests
for hearing will not be entertained absent a determination by the Commission, the presiding officer or the presiding
Atomic Safety and Licensing Board that the petition and/or request should be granted based upon a balancing of the
factors specified in 10 CFR 2.714(a)(1)(i)-(v) and 2.714(d).

If a request for a hearing is received, the Commission's staff may issue the amendment after it completes its technical
review and prior to the completion of any required hearing if it publishes a further notice for public comment of its
proposed finding of no significant hazards consideration in accordance with 10 CFR 50.91 and 50.92.

For further details with respect to this action, see the application for amendment dated June 15, 1994, which is available
for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington,
DC 20555, and at the local public document room located at the Ocean County Library, Reference Department, 101 Washington
Street, Toms River, New Jersey 08753.

<DOCTITLE>Nuclear Support Services, Inc., EA 93-236: Order Requiring the Removal of an Individual From NRC Licensed or
Regulated Activities and Order Directing Review of Personnel Security Files (Effective Immediately) and Robert
C. Dailey IA 94-003: Order Prohibiting Involvement in Certain NRC-Licensed or Regulated Activities
(Effective Immediately); Hearing and Prehearing Conference</DOCTITLE>



This Licensing Board has been established to preside over the hearing requested on April 29, 1994 by Nuclear Support
Services, Inc. (NSSI) and Mr. Robert C. Dailey, challenging two enforcement actions issued by the NRC Staff on March
22, 1994. The enforcement actions were published at 59 FR 14429 (March 28, 1994) (NSSI) and 59 FR 14688 (March 29, 1994)
(Dailey). The first of these actions would order NSSI to remove an individual from NRC-licensed or regulated activities
for five years; the second would prohibit that same individual from participating in NRC-licensed or regulated activities
for the same period. In each case, the issue for hearing, as specified in the respective enforcement actions, is whether
the particular order should be sustained.

By Memorandum and Order (Consolidating Proceedings and Granting Extension of Time), dated May 4, 1994 (unpublished),
the Licensing Board granted the hearing requests and consolidated the two proceedings.

Notice is hereby given that the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board will conduct a prehearing conference in this consolidated
proceeding on Tuesday, July 12, 1994, beginning at 2:00 p.m. The conference will be held in the new Commission hearing
room, 3rd floor, Two White Flint North, 11545 Rockville Pike, North Bethesda, Maryland. Members of the public are
invited to attend but may not participate in the course of the conference.

Among matters to be discussed will be the precise issues for the hearing, discovery, and scheduling. Parties are invited
to submit proposed agenda for the conference, to be in the hands of Board members by close of business Thursday, July
7, 1994.

As permitted by 10 CFR 2.715(a), persons who are not parties to the proceeding are invited to submit limited appearance
statements. Such statements do not constitute testimony or evidence but, to the extent pertinent to issues in these
proceedings, may assist the Board and/or parties in their deliberations as to scope of the issues to be considered.
Such statements should be submitted to the Secretary, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, D.C. 20555,
Attention: Docketing and Service Branch. A copy should also be served on the Chairman of this Licensing Board, Atomic
Safety and Licensing Board Panel, Mail Station T-3F23, Washington, D.C. 20555. Oral limited appearance statements
may be heard during the course of the proceeding but will not be entertained at the July 12, 1994 prehearing conference.

<DOCTITLE>Washington Public Power Supply System; Notice of Partial Denial of Amendment to Facility Operating License and Opportunity
for Hearing</DOCTITLE>


The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) has denied a portion of a request by the Washington Public
Power Supply System, (the licensee) for an amendment to Facility Operating License No. NPF-21 issued to the
licensee for operation of the Washington Nuclear Project No. 2, located in Benton County, Washington. Notice of Consideration
of Issuance of this amendment was published in the 

Federal Register

 on April 13, 1994 (59 FR 17609).
The purpose of the licensee's amendment request was to revise the Technical Specifications (TS) to reflect management
and organizational changes at the Washington Public Power Supply System (the licensee) for operation of the WNP-2
facility. The proposed changes would (1) modify the reporting responsibility of the quality assurance organization
from the Managing Director to the Assistant Managing Director, Operations (AMDO), and (2) modify the appointment
authority for the Corporate Nuclear Safety Review Board (CNSRB) from the Managing Director to the AMDO. These changes
are proposed to reflect the current designation of the AMDO as the licensee's designated official with corporate
responsibility for overall plant nuclear safety, and as the direct report for the CNSRB.
In addition, the proposed change would (1) delete the specific requirement for health physics/chemistry program
procedures, (2) modify the titles of two positions on the Plant Operations Committee (POC) to reflect revised organizational
titles, (3) modify the CNSRB composition requirements from nine personnel to a minimum of nine personnel, and (4)
delete the requirement that the CNSRB Executive Secretary be designated from the CNSRB membership. The NRC staff
has concluded that part of the licensee's request cannot be granted. The staff denied the proposed change to modify
the CNSRB composition requirements from nine personnel to a minimum of nine personnel, because the proposed change
does not specify a maximum number of CNSRB members and is inconsistent with the existing TS provision that 5 persons
shall constitute a quorum of the CNSRB. The licensee was notified of the Commission's partial denial of the proposed
change by a letter dated June 28, 1994.
By August 4, 1994, the licensee may demand a hearing with respect to the denial described above. Any person whose interest
may be affected by this proceeding may file a written petition for leave to intervene.
A request for hearing or petition for leave to intervene must be filed with the Secretary of the Commission, U.S. Nuclear
Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Docketing and Services Branch, or may be delivered to the
Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555, by the above date.
A copy of any petitions should also be sent to the Office of the General Counsel, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,
Washington, DC 20555, and to M.H. Philips, Jr., Esq., Winston and Strawn, 1400 L Street NW., Washington, DC 20005-3502,
attorney for the licensee.
For further details with respect to this action, see (1) the application for amendment dated February 17, 1994, and
(2) the Commission's letter to the licensee dated June 28, 1994.
These documents are available for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building,
2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555, and at the Richland Public Library, 955 Northgate Street, Richland, Washington
99352. A copy of item (2) may be obtained upon request addressed to the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington,
DC 20555, Attention: Document Control Desk.

<USDEPT>SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION</USDEPT>






Self-Regulatory Organizations; Notice of Filing of Proposed Rule Change by the Chicago Board Options Exchange,
Inc., Relating to Equity and SPX RAES Participation Requirements



June 28, 1994.



Pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``ACT''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby
given that on January 22, 1994, the Chicago Board Options Exchange, Inc. (``CBOE'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I,
II and III below, which Items have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization. The Commission is publishing
this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons.



I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change



The CBOE proposes to amend its rules to impose fees on market makers who fail to observe certain participation duties
on the Retail Automated Execution System (``RAES'') for equity and Standard & Poor's 500 Index (``SPX'') classes
of options. Specifically, the CBOE proposes to amend CBOE Rules 8.16m, ``RAES Eligibility in Equity Options'' and
24.16, ``RAES Eligibility in SPX/NDX,'' to impose the following fees for failures to satisfy the rules' log-off requirements:
(1) a fee of $100.00 for one to three failures within one twelve-month period; (2) a fee of $250.00 for four to six failures
within one twelve-month period; and (3) a fee of $500.00 for seven or more failures within one twelve-month period.
In addition, the CBOE proposes to issue a Regulatory Circular clarifying market makers' RAES responsibilities with
respect to equity and SPX options classes and indicating that members who fail to meet the long-on requirements of
CBOE Rules 8.16(b) or 24.16(b) ordinarily will be suspended from participation on RAES at the applicable trading
station for a period of 21 consecutive business days.






The text of the proposal is available at the Office of the Secretary, CBOE and at the Commission.



II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose
of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text
of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The self-regulatory organization has
prepared summaries, set forth in sections (A), (B), and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.



(A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



The CBOE stats that the purpose of the proposed rule change is to impose fees on members who fail to observe the RAES log-off
requirements set forth in CBOE Rules 8.16(a) and 24.16(a) relative to equity options and SPX index options. The CBOE
proposes to incorporate the following fee schedule into CBOE Rules 8.16(a) for equity options) and 24.16(a) (for
SPX options) for failures to comply with the log-off requirements: (1) a fee of $100.00 for one to three failures within
one twelve-month period; (2) a fee of $250.00 for four to six failures within one twelve-month period; and (3) a fee
of $500.00 for seven or more failures within one twelve-month period.

The proposed fees for failures to observe the log-off requirements for equity and SPX RAES are identical in amounts
and graduated structure to the fees proposed for Standard & Poor's 100 Index (``OEX'') options in File No. SR-CBOE-94-12.
Under both proposals, the fee amounts will increase in relation to the number of times each calendar year that a member
does not log off as required.

As is the case of fees applicable to OEX RAES participants under existing CBOE Rule 24.17, ``RAES Eligibility in ``OEX,''
the proposed fees do not constitute disciplinary action, although the CBOE's review procedures in Chapter XIX, ``Hearings
and Review.'' of the CBOE's rules will be available for review of fees assessed under the proposal. The Commission
has noted the appropriateness of such fees and appeal rights in a related context.






In addition to establishing a fee schedule, the CBOE proposes to issue a Regulatory Circular that will reaffirm the
nature of CBOE market makers' RAES log-on and log-off responsibilities in respect of equity and SPX options classes
and will describe the consequences that attach to any market maker's failure to observe these responsibilities.
The Regulatory Circular addresses four points. First, CBOE Rules 8.16(a)(iii) and 24.16(a)(iii) require any market
maker who has logged onto RAES at a trading station on any given trading day to log off RAES whenever the market maker
leaves the trading crowd for more than ``a brief interval.'' The Regulatory Circular interprets ``a brief interval''
to mean ``five consecutive minutes.'' Under this interpretation any market maker who signs onto RAES at a particular
trading station during a trading session must log off the system prior to leaving that station for more than five consecutive
minutes. The CBOE believes that this interpretation should eliminate ambiguity about the amount of time a market
maker may be away from the trading crowd without signing off RAES.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940705-2-00111 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940705-2-00078 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Second, the Regulatory Circular notes that graduated fees will be assessed under CBOE Rules 8.16(a) and 24.16(a)
for failure to observe the RAES log-off requirement.

Third, the Regulatory Circular reflects the MPC's designation pursuant to CBOE Rules 8.16(b) and 24.16(b) that the
expiration month log-on requirements reflected in those rules will be enforced in all classes of equity and SPX options
for which RAES is available. Accordingly, any market maker who has logged onto RAES in accordance with CBOE Rules 8.16(a)
or 24.16(a) during an expiration month for a given class of options must log on whenever present at the applicable trading
station, until expiration.

Fourth, the Regulatory Circular reflects a determination by the MPC, pursuant to its authority under CBOE Rules 8.16(d)
and 24.16(d), that any market maker who fails to meet the log-on requirements under CBOE Rules 8.16(b) or 24.16(b)
ordinarily will be suspended from participation on RAES at the applicable trading station for a period of 21 consecutive
business days.






The CBOE believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6(b) of the Act, in general, and furthers
the objectives of Section 6(b)(5), in particular, in that it is designed to enable the CBOE to enforce compliance with
the Act, to promote just and equitable principles of trade, and to protect investors and the public interest by assuring
that equity and SPX options market makers are aware of and meet their responsibilities pertaining to RAES.



(B) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition



The CBOE does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any burden on competition.



(C) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants
or Others



No written comments were solicited or received with respect to the proposed rule change.



III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action



Within 35 days of the date of publication of this notice in the 

Federal Register

 or within such longer period (i) as the Commission may designate up to 90 days of such date if it finds such longer period
to be appropriate and publishes its reason for so finding or (ii) as to which the self-regulatory organization consents,
the Commission will:





(a) By order approve such proposed rule change, or

(b) Institute proceedings to determine whether the proposed rule change should be disapproved.



IV. Solicitation of Comments



Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying at the Commission's
Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC. Copies of such filing will also be available for
inspection and copying at the principal office of the above-mentioned self-regulatory organization. All submissions
should refer to the file number in the caption above and should be submitted by July 26, 1994.





For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Notice of Filing of Proposed Rule Change by the Chicago Stock Exchange, Inc., Relating
to Disclosure of Pending Formal Exchange Disciplinary Proceeding to the CRD</DOCTITLE>


June 28, 1994.




Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice if hereby
given that on May 6, 1994, the Chicago Stock Exchange, Inc. (``CHX'') or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission (``Commission'' or ``SEC'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II and III below,
which Items have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization. The Commission is publishing this notice to
solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons.


I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change




The CHX proposes to add Rule 9 to Article XII of the Exchange's Rules. Rule 9 to Article XII is proposed to be provided
as follows:


The initiation of, and all significant changes in the status of, a formal disciplinary proceeding brought by the Exchange
shall be reported by the Exchange to the Central Registration Depository operated by the National Association of
Securities Dealers, Inc. For purposes of this Rule, significant changes in the status of a pending formal disciplinary
proceeding shall include, but are not limited to, issuance of a decision by the President, the filing of an appeal;
to and/or the issuance of a decision by, a Judiciary Committee, the Exchange's Executive Committee or Board of Governors.


II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change




In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements governing the purpose
of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text
of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The self-regulatory organization has
prepared summaries, set forth in Sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.


A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change


(1) Purpose



The proposed rule change authorizes the Exchange to provide information to the Central Registration Depository
(``CRD'')
 concerning pending formal Exchange disciplinary proceedings for disclosure to the public. A formal disciplinary
proceeding is considered to be pending from the time charges are issued
 until the proceeding is completed.
 Currently, the Exchange discloses information only on final Exchange disciplinary actions to the CRD.






Information concerning final disciplinary actions taken by the Exchange and other SROs and regulatory organizations
and certain criminal convictions contained in the CRD has been disclosed to the public pursuant to the NASD's 800 number
service since October 1991.





On July 1, 1993, the SEC approved an NASD rule change to make more information available to the general public regarding
pending disciplinary proceedings or actions taken by federal or state securities agencies and SROs that relate to
securities or commodities transactions, and regarding criminal indictments and informations.





Information on pending SRO disciplinary proceedings, among other events, is currently also in the CRD, to the extent
that reports are made by members, member organizations and associated persons pursuant to their reporting obligations
on the Uniform Application for Securities Industry Registration or Transfer (Form U-4) and Form BD, the uniform
applications form for broker-dealer registration. However, the Exchange does not currently report such pending
events to the CRD.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940705-2-00113 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940705-2-00079 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The submission of information concerning pending formal disciplinary proceedings directly by the Exchange would
enhance the CRD database since the CRD would not have to rely solely on reports from members, member organizations
and associated persons.



(2) Statutory Basis



The Exchange believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6(b)(5) of the Act in that it is designed
to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to remove impediments and to perfect the mechanism of a free and
open market and a national market system, and in general, to protect investors and the public interest.

<DOCTITLE>Self Regulatory Organizations; National Securities Clearing Corporation; Notice of Filing and Immediate Effectiveness
of Proposed Rule Change Modifying Fund/Serv Fee</DOCTITLE>



June 24, 1994.



Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
 notice is hereby given that on June 21, 1994, National Securities Clearing Corporation (``NSCC'') filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II, and III
below, which Items have been prepared primarily by NSCC. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments
on the proposed rule change from interested persons.





I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change



The text of the proposed rule change is as follows:





Italicized

 text indicates additions 

Bracketed text indicates deletions





Addendum A.



* * * * *



IV. Other Service Fees



* * * * *



Q. Fund/Serv (FN10), $0.40 per side per order.



* * * * *



(10) This fee applies to Members utilizing the revised Fund/Serv service available after December 31, 1992. [Members
not utilizing the revised service will continue to be charged $.50 per side per settled transaction.] Effective July
1, 1994 for Members who do not convert to the revised Fund/Serv service by July 31, 1994, the fee will be $.75 per side
per settled transaction.



* * * * *



II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



In its filing with the Commission, NSCC included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule
change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined
at the places specified in Item IV below. NSCC has prepared summaries, set forth in sections A, B, and C below, of the
most significant aspects of such statements.



A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



NSCC advised its members that it would discontinue the old Fund/Serv service on June 30, 1994. Because some members
have not completed the conversion from the old Fund/Serv service to the new Fund/Serv service, NSCC has determined
not to discontinue the old Fund/Serv service on June 30, 1994, as originally planned.

The purpose of the proposed rule change is to modify the fees charged by NSCC for the old Fund/Serv service so as to reflect,
in part, the additional cost of simultaneously maintaining both versions of the Fund/Serv system. Currently, old
Fund/Serv transactions are $.50 per side per settled transaction. Effective July 1, 1994, for members who do not convert
to the revised Fund/Serv service by July 31, 1994, the fee will be $.75 per side per settled transaction. Members who
successfully achieve conversion from the old Fund/Serv service to the new Fund/Serv service by July 31, 1994, therefore,
are being given an additional one-month grace period from the effectiveness of the new fee.



B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition



NSCC does not believe that the proposed rule change will have an impact on or impose a burden on competition.



C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received from Members, Participants,
or Others



No written comments have been solicited or received. NSCC will notify the Commission of any written comments received
by NSCC.



III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action



The foregoing rule change has become effective pursuant to Section 19(b)(3)(A)(ii) of the Act and subparagraph (e)(2)
of Securities Exchange Act Rule 19b-4 in that the proposed rule change establishes or changes a due, fee, or other
charge imposed by NSCC. At any time within sixty days of the filing of such proposed rule change, the Commission may
summarily abrogate such rule change if it appears to the Commission that such action is necessary or appropriate in
the public interest, for the protection of investors, or otherwise in furtherance of the purposes of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934.



IV. Solicitation of Comments



Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views, and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying in the Commission's Public
Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of such filing will also be available for inspection
and copying at the principal office of the above-mentioned self-regulatory organization. All submissions should
refer to File No. SR-NSCC-94-11 and should be submitted by July 26, 1994.




For the Commission by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Notice of Filing of Proposed Rule Change by the New York Stock Exchange, Inc., Relating
to Audit Trail Account Identification Codes</DOCTITLE>



June 28, 1994.



Pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby
given that on April 20, 1994, the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (``NYSE'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities
and Exchange (``Commission'' or ``SEC'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II and III below, which
Items have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit
comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons.



I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change



The proposed rule change consists of the addition of identification codes to the Exchange's audit trail to indicate
transactions that are exempt from the short sale rules.



II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose
of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text
of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The self-regulatory organization has
prepared summaries, set forth in Sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.



A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



(a) Purpose



NYSE Rule 132 requires a clearing member firm submitting a trade to comparison to include specified audit trail data
elements, including a specification of the account type for which that trade was effected according to specified
account categories. Currently, the Exchange uses 12 identifiers. Three additional account type identifiers, relating
to orders of competing dealers, have been approved by the Commission, but have not yet been implemented.
 These three identifiers would be implemented upon Commission approval of the new identifiers being proposed herein.





The Exchange is proposing to expand use of the audit trail account type field to require designation of a type of trade,
namely, ``short exempt'' trades. Four identifiers would be added to the audit trail account type field to identify
``short exempt'' trades for:

 The proprietary account of a clearing member organization or an affiliated member/member organization_to
be designated E.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940705-2-00116 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940705-2-00081 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

 The proprietary account of an unaffiliated member/member organization_to be designated F.

 An Individual customer account_to be designated H.

 Other agency customer account_to be designated B.

In addition, three identifiers would be added to identify ``short exempt'' trades of competing dealers. A competing
dealer is defined as a registered specialist on another stock exchange or a marker-maker bidding and offering over-the-counter
in a NYSE traded security. The identifiers, as proposed, are:




L_to designate a ``short exempt'' transaction for the account of a competing dealer that is a member or member organization
trading for its own account

X_to designate a ``short exempt'' transaction where one member is acting as agent for another member's competing
dealer account

Z_to designate a ``short exempt'' transaction for the account of a non-member competing dealer.




The Exchange is proposing the addition of older type identifiers to enhance its ability to identify violations of
SEC Rule 10a-1
 and Exchange Rule 440B, which prohibit short selling under specified circumstances. The rules require orders to
sell to be marked as ``long,'' or ``short,'' or ``exempt.''







SEC Rule 10a-1(e)
 provides exemptions for certain orders to the prohibitions against short selling. These are limited to types of trades
that are believed to be beneficial to the market or that carry little risk of the kind of manipulative or destabilizing
trading that Rule 10a-1 was designed to address. By requiring identification of ``short exempt'' orders in
the Exchange's post trade audit trail process, the Exchange will enhance its ability to examine whether trades effected
pursuant to such orders were in compliance with the exceptions set forth in SEC Rule 10a-1(e).





Member firms would be given a reasonable period of time (approximately six months) to make their own system enhancements
so that they may be in compliance with the new trade type identification requirements.

The Exchange is also proposing to amend its definition of competing dealer and to change the term ``competing dealer''
to ``competing market-maker'' in order to correspond more closely with the definition of market-maker included
in the Act.






(b) Statutory Basis



The basis under the Act for this proposed rule change is the requirement under Section 6(b)(5) that an Exchange have
rules that are designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to remove impediments to and perfect the
mechanism of a free and open market and a national market system and, in general, to protect investors and the public
interest. The Exchange believes the addition of the identifiers for ``short exempt'' trades will add to the protection
of investors by enhancing the Exchange's surveillance capabilities with respect to ``short'' sales.



B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition



The Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any burden on competition that is not necessary
or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act.



C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants
or Others



The Exchange has neither solicited nor received written comments on the proposed rule change.



III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action



Within 35 days of the publication of this notice in the 

Federal Register

 or within such other period (i) as the Commission may designate up to 90 days of such date if it finds such longer period
to be appropriate and publishes its reasons for so finding or (ii) as to which the self-regulatory organization consents,
the Commission will:

(A) by order approve the proposed rule change, or

(B) institute proceedings to determine whether the proposed rule change should be disapproved.



IV. Solicitation of Comments



Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying at the Commission's
Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20549. Copies of such filing will also be available
for inspection and copying at the principal office of the NYSE. All submissions should refer to File No. SR-NYSE-94-16
and should be submitted by July 26, 1994.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Notice of Filing and Immediate Effectiveness of Proposed Rule Change by Pacific
Stock Exchange, Inc., Relating to Assessments and Fees on Members </DOCTITLE>



June 28, 1994.



Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'')
 and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,
 notice is hereby given that on June 24, 1994, the Pacific Stock Exchange Incorporated (``PSE'' or ``Exchange'') filed
with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'' or ``SEC'') the proposed rule change as described in
Items I, II and III below, which Items have been prepared by the PSE. The PSE has designated this proposal as one establishing
or changing a fee under Section 19(b)(3)(A)(ii) of the Act, which renders the rule effective upon the Commission's
receipt of this filing. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from
interested persons.






I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change



The PSE is proposing to add new Rule 12.32 to the Rules of the Board of Governors of the PSE to require that any member named
as a party to an arbitration proceeding shall be assessed a $200 non-refundable surcharge when the Arbitration Department
perfects service of the claim naming the member on any party to the proceeding. Below is the text of the proposed rule
change. Proposed new language is italicized.



* * * * *



Member Surcharge



Rule 12.32





(a) Each member, member organization, or associated person who is named as a party to an arbitration proceeding, whether
in a Claim, Counterclaim, Third-Party Claim, or Crossclaim, shall be assessed a $200 non-refundable surcharge when
the Arbitration Department perfects service of the claim naming the member, member organization or associated person
on any party to the proceeding. For each associated person who is named, the surcharge shall be assessed against the
member(s) or member organization(s) which employed the associated person at the time of the events which gave rise
to the dispute, claim or controversy. No member or member organization shall be assessed more than a single surcharge
in any arbitration proceeding. The surcharge shall not be subject to reimbursement under Rule 12.31.

(b) For the purposes of this Rule, service is perfected when the Arbitration Department properly serves the Respondent(s)
to the arbitration proceeding under Rule 12.13(c).





* * * * *



II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis For, The Proposed Rule Change



In its filing with the Commission, the PSE included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed
rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be
examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The PSE has prepared summaries, set forth in Sections (A), (B), and
(C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.



(A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



The PSE is proposing to add new Rule 12.32 to provide that any member, member organization or associated person named
as a party to an arbitration proceeding shall be assessed a $200 non-refundable surcharge when the Arbitration Department
perfects service of the claim naming the member, member organization or associated person on any party to the proceeding.
In addition, the firm whose associated persons are named in an arbitration proceeding will be assessed the surcharge.

Historically, the revenue-to-expense ratio of the PSE's arbitration service has resulted in a deficit, which has
been subsidized by other revenues of the PSE. Although the deficit has declined in recent years, the Arbitration Department
has determined in a recent review of the arbitration process that the deficit will begin to rise in the immediate future
as a result of significantly increased resourcing needs. The PSE anticipates such needs to be ongoing. The increased
resourcing needs result from a number of factors, including case growth, more complex cases being filed, more selective
arbitrator recruitment, increased arbitrator training, and increased arbitrator compensation. Cost recovery
for increased resourcing needs should be directed at those member firms using the PSE's arbitration service.

Proposed new Rule 12.32(a) would require each member, member organization or associated person who is named as a party
to an arbitration proceeding, as a Claimant or a Respondent, in a Claim, Counterclaim, Third-Party Claim, or Crossclaim,
to be assessed a $200 non-refundable surcharge when the Arbitration Department perfects service of the Claim naming
the member, member organization or associated person on any party to the proceeding. This fee would be in addition
to fees assessed pursuant to Rule 12.31. The fee applies both to members, member organizations and associated persons
who file as Claimants and to members, member organizations and associated persons who are served by the Arbitration
Department as Respondents. In a claim brought by a member, member organization or associated person against a customer,
the $200 fee would be assessed in addition to the $500 claim filing fee described in the current fee schedule in Rule
12.31. For an associated person who is named as a party to an arbitration proceeding, the fee would be assessed against
the member or member organization which employed the associated person at the time of the events which gave rise to
the claim. However, no member or member organization will be assessed more than a single charge in any arbitration
proceeding. Finally, Rule 12.32(a) clarifies that the surcharge is not subject to reimbursement under Rule 12.31.

Proposed new Rule 12.32(b) clarifies that service is considered to have been perfected when the Arbitration Department
serves the Claim under Rule 12.13.

The PSE believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with the provisions of Section 6(b)(5) of the Act, which
require that the rules of the Exchange provide for the equitable allocation of reasonable dues, fees and other charges
among members, member organizations and associated persons in that the proposed rule equitably assesses a surcharge
on each member, member organization and associated person who is named and for whom service is perfected in an arbitration
proceeding and applies such revenue to additional costs resulting from increased arbitration resourcing needs.



(B) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition



The Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any burden on competition that is not necessary
or appropriate in furtherance the purposes of the Act.



(C) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received from Members, Participants,
or Others



Written comments on the proposed rule change were neither solicited nor received.



III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing For Commission Action



The foregoing rule change has become effective pursuant to Section 19(b)(3)(A)(ii) of the Act and subparagraph (e)
of Rule 19b-4 thereunder in that it constitutes a due, fee or other charge. At any time within 60 days of the filing
of such proposed rule change, the Commission may summarily abrogate such rule change if it appears to the Commission
that such action is necessary or appropriate in the public interest, for the protection of investors, or otherwise
in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. 



IV. Solicitation of Comments



Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying in the Commission's
Public Reference Room. Copies of such filing will also be available for inspection and copying at the principal office
of the PSE. All submissions should refer to File No. SR-PSE-94-14 and should be submitted by July
26, 1994.

<USDEPT>DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY</USDEPT>



<DOCTITLE>Debt Management Advisory Committee; Meeting </DOCTITLE>



Notice is hereby given, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. App. 10(a)(2), that a meeting will be held at the U.S. Treasury Department,
15th and Pennsylvania Avenue, NW., Washington, DC, on August 2 and 3, 1994, of the following debt management advisory
committee: 


Public Securities Association, Treasury Borrowing Advisory Committee 



The agenda for the meeting provides for a technical background briefing by Treasury staff on August 2, followed by
a charge by the Secretary of the Treasury or his designate that the committee discuss particular issues, and a working
session. On August 3, the committee will present a written report of its recommendations. 

The background briefing by Treasury staff will be held at 11:30 a.m. Eastern time on August 2 and will be open to the public.
The remaining sessions on August 2 and the committee's reporting session on August 3 will be closed to the public, pursuant
to 5 U.S.C. App. 10(d). 

This notice shall constitute my determination, pursuant to the authority placed in heads of departments by 5 U.S.C.
App. 10(d) and vested in me by Treasury Department Order No. 101-05, that the closed portions of the meeting are
concerned with information that is exempt from disclosure under 5 U.S.C. 552b(c)(9)(A). The public interest requires
that such meetings be closed to the public because the Treasury Department requires frank and full advice from representatives
of the financial community prior to making its final decision on major financing operations. Historically, this
advice has been offered by debt management advisory committees established by the several major segments of the financial
community. When so utilized, such a committee is recognized to be an advisory committee under 5 U.S.C. App. 3. 


Although the Treasury's final announcement of financing plans may not reflect the recommendations provided in reports
of the advisory committee, premature disclosure of the committee's deliberations and reports would be likely to
lead to significant financial speculation in the securities market. Thus, these meetings fall within the exemption
covered by U.S.C. 552b(c)(9)(A).

The Office of the Under Secretary for Domestic Finance is responsible for maintaining records of debt management
advisory committee meetings and for providing annual reports setting forth a summary of committee activities and
such other matters as may be informative to the public consistent with the policy of 5 U.S.C. 552b.

<DOCTITLE>Renegotiation Board Interest Rate, Prompt Payment Interest Rate, Contracts Disputes Act</DOCTITLE>



Although the Renegotiation Board is no longer in existence, other Federal Agencies are required to use interest rates
computer under the criteria established by the Renegotiation Act of 1971 (P.L. 92-41). For example, the Contracts
Disputes Act of 1978 (P.L. 95-563) and the Prompt Payment Act (P.L. 97-177) are required to calculate interest
due on claims at a rate established by the Secretary of the Treasury pursuant to Public Law 92-41 (85 Stat. 97)
for the Renegotiation Board (31 U.S.C. 3902).

Therefore, notice is hereby given that, pursuant to the above mentioned sections, the Secretary of the Treasury has
determined that the rate of interest applicable for the purpose of said sections, for the period beginning July 1,
1994 and ending on December 31, 1994, is 7% per centum per annum.

Environmental Protection Agency





Sole Source Aquifer Designation of the Vashon-Maury Island Aquifer System, King County, Washington; Notice










Federal Register

  Vol. 59, No. 127  Tuesday, July 5, 1994  Notices 




<USDEPT>ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY </USDEPT>






Sole Source Aquifer Designation of the Vashon-Maury Island Aquifer System, King County, Washington
 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final determination. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Region 10 Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has determined that the Vashon-Maury Island
Aquifer System is a sole or principal source of drinking water, and if contaminated, would create a significant hazard
to public health. This action was taken under the authority of section 1424(e) of the Safe Drinking Water Act in response
to a petition submitted to EPA by the Seattle-King County Department of Public Health on April 2, 1992. As a result of
this determination, all federal financially assisted projects proposed in the designated area will be subject to
EPA review to ensure that they do not create a significant hazard to public health. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 This action is being taken under the authority of section 1424(e) of the Safe Drinking Water Act (42 United States Code,
300f, 300h-3(e), Public Law 93-523). The information upon which EPA is issuing this final determination has
been summarized in the ``Support Document for Sole Source Aquifer Designation of the Vashon-Maury Island Aquifer
System'', EPA 910/K-94-002. 



I. Background 



Section 1424(e) of the Safe Drinking Water Act states: 




If the Administrator determines, on his own initiative or upon petition, that an area has an aquifer which is the sole
or principal drinking water source for the area and which, if contaminated, would create a significant hazard to public
health, he shall publish notice of that determination in the 

Federal Register

. After the publication of any such notice, no commitment for federal financial assistance (through a grant, contract,
loan guarantee, or otherwise) may be entered into for any project which the Administrator determines may contaminate
such aquifer through a recharge zone so as to create a significant hazard to public health, but a commitment for federal
assistance may, if authorized under another provision of law, be entered into to plan or design the project to assure
that it will not so contaminate the aquifer. 




Although EPA has the authority to initiate ``sole source aquifer'' designations, the Agency has a policy of acting
only in response to petitions. Petitions may be submitted to EPA by any individual or organization and must address
procedures and criteria outlined in EPA's ``Sole Source Aquifer Designation Petitioner Guidance'', EPA 440/6-87-003.


On April 2, 1992, EPA Region 10 received a petition from the Seattle-King County Department of Public Health requesting
that EPA designate Vashon-Maury Island as a sole source aquifer. The petition was developed in cooperation with the
Vashon-Maury Island Ground Water Advisory Committee and the Vashon-Maury Island Water Utilities Coordinating
Committee. Recognizing the value of the aquifer as a present and future source of drinking water, the petition was
submitted as an additional way to protect the Island's ground water resources. 

EPA's initial review of the petition led to a request for additional hydrogeologic and water usage information. This
information was subsequently submitted to EPA by the petitioner. On October 21, 1992, the petition was considered
complete enough to undergo a more detailed technical review. The technical review was completed in April of 1994 and
EPA's findings and basis for the proposed designation were documented in EPA's Support Document.

II. Basis for Determination 



The Region 10 Administrator has determined that the Vashon-Maury Island Aquifer System meets all applicable sole
source aquifer designation criteria established through Federal statute and EPA guidance documents, as follows:


(1) Sole or Principal Source of Drinking Water: Sole source aquifers must supply at least 50 percent of the drinking
water to persons living in the area overlying the aquifer and in areas supplied by the aquifer. The Vashon-Maury Island
Aquifer System supplies approximately 71 percent of the drinking water to persons living on the Island. 

(2) Potential Public Health Hazard: Contamination of the sole source aquifer must create a significant hazard to
public health. As the principal drinking water source for the area, contamination of the Vashon-Maury Island Aquifer
System would create a significant hazard to public health. 

(3) Definable Aquifer Boundaries: EPA guidance allows designations to be made for entire aquifers, hydrogeologically
connected aquifers (aquifer systems), or part of an aquifer if that portion is hydrogeologically separated from
the rest of the aquifer. The Vashon-Maury Aquifer System boundary is based on hydrogeological principles and EPA's
interpretation of available data. The Island's hydrogeology is representative of an aquifer system, as data indicate
that water from shallow aquifers infiltrates to underlying deeper aquifers. The sole source aquifer boundary is
coincident with the shoreline of the Island, and at depth includes all geologic units that can supply significant
quantities of drinking water to wells. This boundary is assumed because stratigraphic data are not available to fully
map the vertical extent of the aquifer materials. 

(4) No Alternative Source of Drinking Water: There can be no physical, legal, or economically feasible alternative
source(s) of drinking water of sufficient volume that could replace the sole source aquifer, should it become contaminated.
EPA has determined that there are no reasonably available alternative source(s) of drinking water that could replace
the aquifer. 



III. Description of the Vashon-Maury Island Aquifer System 





Note: 

Information in this section represents an unfootnoted summary from EPA's Support Document, EPA 910/K-94-002.





Vashon-Maury Island is located near the southern end of Puget Sound in the southwestern corner of King County, Washington.
The Island covers an area of 36.7 square miles and its population has been estimated at approximately 7,800 persons.
Recorded data indicates an average rainfall of 46.53 inches. 

The aquifer system is composed of both interbedded glacial and non-glacial deposits. In general, the water table
elevation reflects the surface topography and the ground water moves radially outward from the interior to the shorelines
of the Island. 

The uppermost and most recent deposits (Quaternary Vashon unit) are mainly stratified sand and gravel overlying
glacial till and sandy gravel interbedded with medium and fine-grained sand. The Vashon unit contains a surficial
aquifer comprised primarily of glacial till which has poor water-bearing characteristics, and the uppermost fresh
water aquifer (Principal Aquifer) comprised of outwash sand and gravel beds. The Principal Aquifer is found at an
elevation of between 0 and 400 feet above mean sea level. Recharge of the Principal Aquifer is probably highest along
a north-south corridor of west-central Vashon Island, and is estimated to be approximately 9 million gallons per
day. The Principal Aquifer supplies ninety-five percent of the wells located on the Island. 

Underlying the Vashon unit are non-glacial deposits (Quaternary Olympia beds) generally consisting of thin-bedded
sand and silt with local layers of gravel, massive silt and clayey silt. The Olympia beds serve as a leaky aquitard between
the upper Principal Aquifer and the lower Deep Aquifer. The Deep Aquifer underlies the Olympia beds and consists of
a variety of interbedded glacial tills, sand and gravel units and laminated silts and clays. The Deep Aquifer is located
at an elevation of between about 100 to 300 feet below mean sea level. Recharge to the Deep Aquifer is estimated at between
1.73 and 3.46 million gallons per day. 

Ground water quality data was sampled from 72 wells in the aquifer area. In general, deeper wells exhibited higher
specific conductance values. Elevated chloride concentrations were found in near-shore wells on the northern and
eastern edges of the Island. Ground water quality trend data is limited, but combined water system and spring data
indicate that source water nitrate concentrations show a generally increasing trend. 

The sand interbeds within the surficial glacial till deposits allow easy infiltration, and although discontinuous,
make much of the Principal Aquifer vulnerable to contamination. The Deep Aquifer is also vulnerable to contamination
from activities occurring on the land surface, as evidence suggests that it receives recharge from the Principal
Aquifer. 

Potential sources of contamination include landfill leachate, on-site sewage disposal systems, leaky sewer lines,
underground storage tanks, agricultural chemicals, small hazardous waste generators, accidental spills, seawater
intrusion, and improper household, forestry and farm practices.

<TEXT>
 

The Island has one publicly-owned water well (the largest water system on the Island), at least six large private water
systems, and more than 100 smaller water systems. Some purveyors use both surface water and ground water to supply
their distribution system. In addition, private wells provide water to a considerable number of houses and businesses
across the Island. It is estimated that 71% of the water supplied to households on the Island is from ground water and
29% is from surface water sources. There are no alternative sources of drinking water for the Island that can be physically,
legally, and economically supplied. 


IV. Project Reviews 


Designation of a sole source aquifer authorizes EPA to review federal financially-assisted projects proposed within
the designated area. The principal mechanism used by EPA Region 10 to identify projects for review are Memorandums
of Understanding (MOUs) with federal funding agencies. These MOUs outline procedures for screening and referring
projects to EPA in order to ensure that only projects which may have a significant impact to ground water quality are
reviewed. 
Most projects referred to EPA for review meet all federal, state, and local ground water protection standards and
are approved without any additional conditions being imposed. Occasionally, site or project-specific concerns
for ground water quality protection lead to specific recommendations or additional pollution prevention requirements
as a condition of funding. In rare cases, federal funding has been denied when the applicant has been either unwilling
or unable to modify the project. 
Whenever feasible, EPA coordinates the review of proposed projects with other offices within EPA and with various
federal, state, or local agencies that have a responsibility for ground water quality protection. Relevant information
from these sources is given full consideration in the sole source aquifer review process. Such coordination can complement,
support, and strengthen existing ground water protection mechanisms. 


V. Public Comments 


EPA issued a news release (April 12, 1994) and a public notice (April 14, 1994) to request comments and announce the
proposed designation. Both stated that a public hearing would be held if sufficient interest were expressed to EPA
in advance. No requests for a formal hearing were received and it was subsequently cancelled. 
Five written comments were received prior to the expiration of the public comment period on June 1, 1994. Three letters
were from Vashon Island residents and expressed support for the proposed designation. One letter was from the King
County Department of Public Works, Roads and Engineering Division, and requested information and coordination
of future federal financially-assisted road projects on the Island. Another letter was from the Bureau of Reclamation
and stated there were no ongoing or proposed federal financially-assisted projects within the area. No controversial
issues were raised as a result of this proposed action. 


VI. Summary 


This determination affects only the Vashon-Maury Island Aquifer System located in King County, Washington. As a
result of this determination, all federal financially-assisted projects proposed in the designated area will be
subject to EPA review to ensure that they do not create a significant hazard to public health.

 National Institutes of Health, PHS, DHHS.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of actions under the National Institutes of Health Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant DNA Molecules
(NIH Guidelines). 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This notice sets forth four actions to be taken by the Director, National Institutes of Health (NIH), under the May
7, 1986, NIH Guidelines (51 FR 16958).


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Today four actions are being promulgated under the NIH Guidelines. These four proposed actions were published for
comment in the 

Federal Register

 announcements of August 11, 1987 (52 FR 29800); April 18, 1988 (53 FR 12752); December 30, 1988 (53 FR 53262); April
29, 1991 (56 FR 19776); November 9, 1993 (58 FR 59612); and February 11, 1994 (59 FR 6702). These proposed actions were
reviewed and recommended for approval by the NIH Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee (RAC) at its meetings on September
21, 1987; December 3, 1988; January 30, 1989; May 30-31, 1991; December 2-3, 1993; and March 3-4,
1994. 


In accordance with Section IV-C-1-b of the NIH Guidelines, these actions have been found to comply with the NIH Guidelines
and to present no significant risk to health or the environment. 
A revised version of the NIH Guidelines is published in a separate section of the 

Federal Register

 following this announcement. These revised NIH Guidelines differ from the previous version promulgated on May 7,
1986 (51 FR 16958) by incorporating within them the major actions to the NIH Guidelines that were promulgated on August
24, 1987 (52 FR 31848); July 29, 1988 (53 FR 28819); October 26, 1988 (53 FR 43410); March 13, 1989 (54 FR 10508); March

18, 1993 (58 FR 9102); April 23, 1993 (58 FR 21738); September 13, 1993 (58 FR 47906); October 18, 1993 (58 FR 53814);
and the changes that are promulgated in this announcement. 


I. Background Information and Decision on Action Under the NIH Guidelines 


A. Amendment to Sections II, III-C, III-D, V, Appendices C-I, and G and Addition of Appendix P, Physical
and Biological Containment for Recombinant DNA Research Involving Plants, and Appendix Q, Physical and Biological
Containment for Recombinant DNA Research Involving Animals of the NIH Guidelines 


The NIH Guidelines were originally developed to cover research in laboratories in which recombinant DNA techniques
were used. It is recognized today that these techniques are being used by scientists working with plants and large
animals, and that procedures for containment of these plants and animals have not been specifically described in
the NIH Guidelines. Institutional Biosafety Committees (IBCs) have requested guidance on the containment procedures
that should be recommended for specific experiments with these organisms since they have the responsibility of approving
such experiments under containment appropriate for the organisms. The principles of biological safety that are
used to categorize experiments involving microorganisms, for example, are equally applicable to plants and animals.
These safety procedures have been employed successfully for many years and have been recognized for their efficacy
in biological containment.

Appendices P and Q are the result of several years of meetings and discussions involving research scientists and representatives
from university, government, and industrial research sectors with expertise in several disciplines, including
plant genetics, plant physiology, plant pathology, entomology, animal (including arthropod and aquatic species)
physiology and reproduction, molecular biology, veterinary medicine, and human biomedical research. The Federal
agencies involved in the development of Appendices P and Q include the NIH, the National Science Foundation (NSF),
and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). 
The process of developing Appendices P and Q was initiated when the USDA published an Advanced Notice of Proposed USDA
Guidelines (USDA Guidelines) in the 

Federal Register

 on June 26, 1986 (51 FR 23367). This notice was followed by an announcement by the USDA regarding its intent to propose
new guidelines for conducting all phases of research with domestic agriculture species, including both plants and
animals modified through the application of genetic engineering techniques, in the 

Federal Register

 on December 9, 1986 (51 FR 44397). At that time, the NIH Guidelines did not include specific descriptions for containment
conditions for research involving recombinant DNA containing whole plants and animals. The USDA convened a working
group composed of university, government, and industrial scientists on December 13-14, 1986, with the purpose
of discussing and redrafting guidelines for physical and biological containment of transgenic plant and animal
species, and associated microorganisms. This meeting came to be known as the ``Arlington House Workshop.'' 
Participants of the ``Arlington House Workshop,'' including former members of the RAC, agreed that the USDA Guidelines
should be incorporated into the NIH Guidelines. The workshop participants noted that merging these two documents
would offer the distinct advantage of providing a single comprehensive source of information regarding conduct
of research involving organisms containing recombinant DNA and plants and animals exposed to microorganisms containing
recombinant DNA. 
A staff working group representing the Office of Recombinant DNA Activities, NIH, and the Cooperative State Research
Service, USDA, held meetings during the following six months. This working group met with the purpose of revising
the containment section and developing a final incorporated document for RAC review, approval by the NIH Director,
and incorporation into the NIH Guidelines. 
On June 28, 1987, and July 16, 1987, the RAC appointed the Working Group on Revision of the NIH Guidelines to meet and
consider the draft documents, Appendices P and Q, and minor modifications to the NIH Guidelines, that would accommodate
the proposed appendices. Appendices P and Q and the proposed revisions to the NIH Guidelines were published for public
comment in the 

Federal Register

 on August 11, 1987 (52 FR 29800). Additional revisions to Appendices P and Q were proposed by the RAC and the Agricultural
Research Service, USDA, at the September 17, 1987, RAC meeting. These modifications were published for public comment
in the 

Federal Register

 on December 30, 1988 (53 FR 53262). The RAC Working Group on Transgenic Animals proposed additional modifications
to Appendices P and Q which were published for public comment in the 

Federal Register

 on April 18, 1988 (53 FR 12752). Further revisions were approved by the RAC at its January 30, 1989, meeting. 
Throughout all of the meetings, discussions, and revisions, the intent of the Federal agencies and interested parties
has been to describe working conditions that would minimize the risk to both the researcher and the environment from
any possible harm or adverse effects due to the conduct of research involving recombinant DNA containing organisms.

On June 24, 1994, an Environmental Assessment of Appendices P and Q was completed by the NIH and USDA, and there was a
finding of no significant impact. Copies of the Environmental Assessment are available from the Office of Recombinant
DNA Activities, National Institutes of Health, Building 31, room 4B11, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, (301) 496-9838.

The actions are detailed in Section II_Summary of Actions. I accept these recommendations, and the NIH Guidelines
will be amended accordingly.

B. Amendment to Sections I-C-1-b-(2) and Deletion of Section III-A-2 of the NIH Guidelines Regarding
Deliberate Release 



On December 6, 1990, the RAC Planning Subcommittee recommended that the requirement for RAC review of experiments
involving deliberate environmental release of organisms containing recombinant DNA be eliminated from the NIH
Guidelines. This recommendation reflects the fact that the Federal regulatory agencies, the USDA, and the Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA), are responsible for the review and approval of environmental release experiments. The
proposed amendment was published for public comment in the 

Federal Register 

on April 29, 1991 (56 FR 19776). The RAC reviewed and recommended approval of the proposed amendment at its May 30-31,
1991, meeting. 

The actions are detailed in Section II_Summary of Actions. I accept these recommendations, and the NIH Guidelines
will be amended accordingly. 



C. Amendments to Sections I, III, IV, and V, and Appendix M of the NIH Guidelines Regarding NIH/ORDA Review and Approval
of Certain Categories of Human Gene Transfer Experiments That Qualify for the Accelerated Review Process 



On December 3, 1993, and March 3-4, 1994, the Working Group on Accelerated Review Protocols presented an overview
of the proposed amendments to the NIH Guidelines. The proposed amendments will: (1) Establish an accelerated review
process for certain categories of human gene transfer experiments, (2) allow the NIH/Office of Recombinant DNA Activities
to assign the appropriate review category to all human gene transfer proposals that are submitted in compliance with
the NIH Guidelines, (3) allow the NIH/Office of Recombinant DNA Activities to approve those categories of human gene
transfer experiments that qualify for the accelerated review process in consultation with the Chair and one or more
RAC members, as necessary, and (4) exempt certain experiments involving the transfer of recombinant DNA or DNA or
RNA derived from recombinant DNA into one or more human subjects which are not covered by Section V-U. All human
gene transfer experiments approved by the NIH/Office of Recombinant DNA Activities through the accelerated review
process will be provided in a report by the RAC Chair at the next regularly scheduled RAC meeting and will be included
in the list of approved experiments which is available from the Office of Recombinant DNA Activities, National Institutes
of Health, Building 31, Room 4B11, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, (301) 496-9838. 

The proposed amendments were published for public comment in the 

Federal Register

 on November 9, 1993 (58 FR 59612) and February 11, 1994 (59 FR 6702). The RAC reviewed and unanimously recommended approval
of the proposed amendments at its March 3-4, 1994, meeting. 

The actions are detailed in Section II_Summary of Actions. I accept these recommendations, and the NIH Guidelines
will be amended accordingly. 



D. Amendments to Section V-U of the NIH Guidelines Regarding Recombinant DNA Vaccines 



On March 3, 1994, the Working Group on Vaccines presented an overview of the proposed amendment to the footnote in Section
V-U. The proposed amendment will define those categories of experiments involving the administration of recombinant
DNA vaccines that are exempt from RAC review and NIH and Institutional Biosafety Committee approval. 

The proposed amendment was published for public comments in the 

Federal Register 

on February 11, 1994 (59 FR 6702). The proposed amendment was revised by the RAC at its March 3-4, 1994, meeting.
The revised amendment was unanimously approved. 

The action is detailed in Section II_Summary of Actions. I accept this recommendation, and the NIH Guidelines will
be amended accordingly.

A. Amendment to Section I, Scope of the NIH Guidelines 



The amended version of Section I reads as follows: 



Section I. Scope of the NIH Guidelines 

Section I-A. Purpose 



The purpose of the NIH Guidelines is to specify practices for constructing and handling: (i) Recombinant deoxyribonucleic
acid (DNA) molecules, and (ii) organisms and viruses containing recombinant DNA molecules. 

Section I-A-1. Any recombinant DNA experiment, which according to the NIH Guidelines requires approval
by the NIH, must be submitted to the NIH or to another Federal agency that has jurisdiction for review and approval.
Once approval, or other applicable clearances, has been obtained from a Federal agency other than the NIH (whether
the experiment is referred to that agency by the NIH or sent directly there by the submitter), the experiment may proceed
without the necessity for NIH review or approval (see exceptions in Sections I-A-2 and I-A-3).


Section I-A-2. Certain experiments that involve the deliberate transfer of recombinant DNA or DNA or
RNA derived from recombinant DNA into one or more human subjects (see Section V-U) shall be considered Major
Actions (see Section IV-C-1-b-(1)), and shall require RAC review and NIH Director approval, if determined by NIH/ORDA
in consultation with the RAC Chair and/or one or more RAC members, as necessary, to: (i) Represent novel characteristics
(e.g., target disease or vector), (ii) represent an uncertain degree of risk to human health or the environment, or
(iii) contain information determined to require further public review (see Section III-A-2). 

Section I-A-3. Experiments involving the transfer of recombinant DNA to one or more human subjects that
are not considered under Section III-A-2 may qualify for Accelerated Review (see Section III-B-2
and Appendix M-V) and will be considered as Minor Actions (see Section IV-C-1-b-(2)-(a)). Actions that qualify
for Accelerated Review will be reviewed and approved by NIH/ORDA in consultation with the RAC Chair and/or one or more
RAC members, as necessary. 

Certain experiments involving the transfer of recombinant DNA or DNA or RNA derived from recombinant DNA into one
or more human subjects (see Section V-U) may be considered exempt from RAC and/or NIH/ORDA review and/or NIH
Director approval and only require registration with NIH/ORDA (see Section III-C-7). 



Section I-B. Definition of Recombinant DNA Molecules 



In the context of the NIH Guidelines, recombinant DNA molecules are defined as either: (i) Molecules that are constructed
outside living cells by joining natural or synthetic DNA segments to DNA molecules that can replicate in a living cell,
or (ii) molecules that result from the replication of those described in (i) above. 

Synthetic DNA segments which are likely to yield a potentially harmful polynucleotide or polypeptide (e.g., a toxin
or a pharmacologically active agent) are considered as equivalent to their natural DNA counterpart. If the synthetic
DNA segment is not expressed 

in vivo

 as a biologically active polynucleotide or polypeptide product, it is exempt from the NIH Guidelines. 

Genomic DNA of plants and bacteria that have acquired a transposable element, even if the latter was donated from a
recombinant vector no longer present, are not subject to the NIH Guidelines unless the transposon itself contains
recombinant DNA. 



Section I-C. General Applicability 



Section I-C-1. The NIH Guidelines are applicable to: 

Section I-C-1-a. All recombinant DNA research within the United States (U.S.) or its territories that is conducted
at or sponsored by an institution that receives any support for recombinant DNA research from the NIH, including research
performed directly by the NIH. An individual who receives support for research involving recombinant DNA must be
associated with or sponsored by an institution that assumes the responsibilities assigned in the NIH Guidelines.


Section I-C-1-b. All recombinant DNA research performed abroad: Specifically: 

Section I-C-1-b-(1). Research supported by NIH funds. 

Section I-C-1-b-(2). If they involve testing in humans of materials containing recombinant DNA developed with NIH
funds and if the institution that developed those materials sponsors or participates in those projects. Participation
includes research collaboration or contractual agreements, not mere provision of research materials. 

Section I-C-1-b-(3). If the host country has established rules for the conduct of recombinant DNA research, then
the research must be in compliance with those rules. If the host country does not have such rules, the proposed research
must be reviewed and approved by an NIH-approved Institutional Biosafety Committee or equivalent review body and
accepted in writing by an appropriate national governmental authority of the host country. The safety practices
that are employed abroad must be reasonably consistent with the NIH Guidelines.

B. Amendment to Section II, Containment, of the NIH Guidelines 
The amended version of Section II reads as follows: 


Section II. Containment 


Effective biological safety programs have been operative in a variety of 
laboratories for many years. Considerable information already exists about the design of physical containment
facilities and selection of laboratory procedures applicable to organisms carrying recombinant DNA (see Section
V-A). The existing programs rely upon mechanisms that can be divided into two categories: (i) A set of standard practices
that are generally used in microbiological laboratories; and (ii) special procedures, equipment, and laboratory
installations that provide physical barriers that are applied in varying degrees according to the estimated biohazard.
Four biosafety levels are described in Appendix G. These biosafety levels consist of combinations of laboratory
practices and techniques, safety equipment, and laboratory facilities appropriate for the operations performed
and are based on the potential hazards imposed by the agents used and for the laboratory function and activity. Biosafety
Level 4 provides the most stringent containment conditions, Biosafety Level 1 the least stringent. 
Experiments involving recombinant DNA lend themselves to a third containment mechanism, namely, the application
of highly specific biological barriers. Natural barriers exist that limit either: (i) The infectivity of a vector
or vehicle (plasmid or 
virus) for specific hosts, or (ii) its dissemination and survival in the environment. 
Vectors, which provide the means for recombinant DNA and/or host cell 
replication, can be genetically designed to decrease, by many orders of magnitude, the probability of dissemination
of recombinant DNA outside the laboratory (see Appendix I). 
Since these three means of containment are complementary, different levels of containment can be established that
apply various combinations of the physical and biological barriers along with a constant use of standard practices.
Categories of containment are considered separately in order that such combinations can be conveniently expressed
in the NIH Guidelines. 
Physical containment conditions within laboratories, described in Appendix G, may not always be appropriate for
all organisms because of their physical size, the number of organisms needed for an experiment, or the particular
growth requirements of the organism. Likewise, biological containment for 
microorganisms described in Appendix I may not be appropriate for all organisms, particularly higher eukaryotic
organisms. However, significant information exists about the design of research facilities and experimental procedures
that are applicable to organisms containing recombinant DNA that is either integrated into the genome or into microorganisms
associated with the higher organism as a symbiont, pathogen, or other relationship. This information describes
facilities for 
physical containment of organisms used in non-traditional laboratory settings and special practices for limiting
or excluding the unwanted establishment, transfer of genetic information, and dissemination of organisms beyond
the intended location, based on both physical and biological containment principles. Research conducted in accordance
with these conditions effectively confines the organism. 


For research involving plants, four biosafety levels (BL1-P through BL4-P) are described in Appendix
P. BL1-P is designed to provide a moderate level of 
containment for experiments for which there is convincing biological evidence that precludes the possibility of
survival, transfer, or dissemination of recombinant DNA into the environment, or in which there is no recognizable
and predictable risk to the environment in the event of accidental release. BL2-P is designed to provide a greater
level of containment for experiments involving plants and certain associated organisms in which there is a recognized
possibility of survival, transmission, or dissemination of recombinant DNA containing organisms, but the consequence
of such an inadvertent release has a predictably minimal biological impact. BL3-P and BL4-P describe
additional containment conditions for research with plants and certain pathogens and other organisms that require
special containment because of their recognized potential for significant detrimental impact on managed or natural
ecosystems. BL1-P relies upon accepted scientific practices for conducting research in most ordinary greenhouse
or growth chamber facilities and incorporates accepted procedures for good pest control and cultural practices.
BL1-P facilities and procedures provide a modified and protected environment for the propagation of plants
and microorganisms associated with the plants and a degree of containment that adequately controls the potential
for release of biologically viable plants, plant parts, and microorganisms associated with them. BL2-P and
BL3-P rely upon accepted scientific practices for conducting research in greenhouses with organisms infecting
or infesting plants in a manner that minimizes or prevents inadvertent contamination of plants within or surrounding
the greenhouse. BL4-P describes facilities and practices known to provide containment of certain exotic plant
pathogens.

For research involving animals, which are of a size or have growth requirements that preclude the use of conventional
primary containment systems used for small laboratory animals, four biosafety levels (BL1-N through BL4-N)
are described in Appendix Q. BL1-N describes containment for animals that have been modified by stable introduction
of recombinant DNA, or DNA derived therefrom, into the germ-line (transgenic animals) and experiments involving
viable recombinant DNA-modified microorganisms and is designed to eliminate the possibility of sexual transmission
of the modified genome or transmission of recombinant DNA-derived viruses known to be transmitted from animal parent
to offspring only by sexual reproduction. Procedures, practices, and facilities follow classical methods of avoiding
genetic exchange between animals. BL2-N describes containment which is used for transgenic animals associated
with recombinant DNA-derived organisms and is designed to eliminate the possibility of vertical or horizontal transmission.
Procedures, practices, and facilities follow classical methods of avoiding genetic exchange between animals or
controlling arthropod transmission. BL3-N and BL4-N describe higher levels of containment for research
with certain transgenic animals involving agents which pose recognized hazard. 
In constructing the NIH Guidelines, it was necessary to define boundary conditions for the different levels of physical
and biological containment and for the classes of experiments to which they apply. These definitions do not take into
account all existing and anticipated information on special procedures that will allow particular experiments
to be conducted under different conditions than indicated here without affecting risk. Individual investigators
and Institutional Biosafety Committees are urged to devise simple and more effective containment procedures and
to submit recommended changes in the NIH Guidelines to permit the use of these procedures.'' 



C. Amendment to Section III, Experiments Covered by the NIH Guidelines 

The previous version of Section III-A-2 will be deleted as follows: Section III-A-2. Deliberate release
into the environment of any organism containing recombinant DNA except those listed below. The term `deliberate
release' is defined as a planned introduction of recombinant DNA-containing microorganisms, plants, or animals
into the environment. 
Section III-A-2-a. Introduction conducted under conditions considered to be accepted scientific practices
in which there is adequate evidence of biological and/or physical control of the recombinant DNA-containing organisms.
The nature of such evidence is described in Appendix L. 
Section III-A-2-b. Deletion derivatives and single base changes not otherwise covered by the NIH Guidelines.

Section III-A-2-c. For extrachromosomal elements and microorganisms (including viruses), rearrangements
and amplifications within a single genome. Rearrangements involving the introduction of DNA from different strains
of the same species would not be covered by this exemption.'' 
The amended version of Section III reads as follows: 
Section III. Experiments Covered by the NIH Guidelines. 
This section describes five categories of experiments involving recombinant DNA: (i) Those that require RAC review
and NIH and Institutional Biosafety Committee approval before initiation (see Section III-A), (ii) those that require
NIH/ORDA and Institutional Biosafety Committee approval before initiation (see Section III-B); (iii) those that
require Institutional Biosafety Committee approval before initiation (see Section III-C), (iv) those that require
Institutional Biosafety Committee notification simultaneous with initiation (see Section III-D), and (v) those
that are exempt from the NIH Guidelines (see Section III-E). 






Note: 

If an experiment falls into either Section III-A or Section III-B and one of the other categories, the rules pertaining
to Section III-A or Section III-B shall be followed. If an experiment falls into Section III-E and into either Sections
III-C or III-D categories as well, the experiment is considered exempt from the NIH Guidelines. 




Any change in containment level, which is different from those specified in the NIH Guidelines, may not be initiated
without the express approval of NIH/ORDA (see Minor Actions, Section IV-C-1-b-(2) and its subsections). 



Section III-A. Experiments That Require Institutional Biosafety Committee Approval, RAC Review, and NIH
Approval Before Initiation 



Experiments in this category are considered Major Actions (see Section IV-C-1-b-(1)) and cannot be initiated
without submission of relevant information on the proposed experiment to the Office of Recombinant DNA Activities,
National Institutes of Health, Building 31, Room 4B11, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, (301) 496-9838, the publication
of the proposal in the 

Federal Register

 for 15 days of comment, reviewed by the RAC, and specific approval by the NIH (not applicable for Expedited Review single
patient human gene transfer experiments considered under Appendix M-VI). The containment conditions for such experiments
will be recommended by the RAC and set by the NIH at the time of approval. Such experiments require Institutional Biosafety
Committee approval before initiation. Specific experiments already approved are included in Appendix D which may
be obtained from the Office of Recombinant DNA Activities, National Institutes of Health, Building 31, Room 4B11,
Bethesda, Maryland 20892, (301) 496-9838.

Section III-A-1. Deliberate transfer of a drug resistance trait to microorganisms 
that are not known to acquire the trait naturally (see Section V-B), if such 
acquisition could compromise the use of the drug to control disease agents in 
humans, veterinary medicine, or agriculture. 
Section III-A-2. Certain experiments involving the deliberate transfer of 
recombinant DNA or DNA or RNA derived from recombinant DNA into one or 
more human subjects (see Section V-U) shall be considered Major Actions (see 
Section IV-C-1-b-(1) and Appendix M-III), and shall require RAC review and NIH 
Director approval, if determined by NIH/ORDA, in consultation with the RAC 
Chair and one or more RAC members, as necessary, to: (i) represent novel 
characteristics (e.g., target disease or vector), (ii) represent an uncertain degree of 
risk to human health or the environment, or (iii) contain information determined 
to require further public review. The requirement for RAC review shall not be 
considered to preempt any other required review or approval of experiments with 
one or more human subjects. Relevant Institutional Biosafety Committee and 
Institutional Review Board reviews and approvals of the proposal should be 
completed before submission to NIH. Certain experiments involving deliberate 
transfer of recombinant DNA or DNA or RNA derived from recombinant DNA 
into one or more human subjects may qualify for the Accelerated Review process 
(see Section III-B-2). Certain categories of experiments involving the deliberate 
transfer of recombinant DNA or DNA or RNA derived from recombinant DNA 
into one or more human subjects and that are not covered by Section V-U, may be 
considered exempt from RAC and/or NIH/ORDA review and/or NIH Director 
approval and only require registration with NIH/ORDA (see Section III-C-7). 


Section III-B. Experiments That Require NIH/ORDA and Institutional Biosafety 
Committee Approval Before Initiation 
Section III-B-1. Experiments Involving the Cloning of Toxin Molecules with LD

50

 of Less Than 100 Nanograms per Kilogram Body Weight 


Deliberate formation of recombinant DNA containing genes for the biosynthesis 
of toxin molecules lethal for vertebrates at an LD

50

 of less than 100 nanograms per 
kilogram body weight (e.g., microbial toxins such as the botulinum toxins, tetanus 
toxin, diphtheria toxin, and 

Shigella dysenteriae 

neurotoxin). Specific approval has 
been given for the cloning in 

Escherichia coli 

K-12 of DNA containing genes coding 
for the biosynthesis of toxic molecules which are lethal to vertebrates at 100 
nanograms to 100 micrograms per kilogram body weight. Specific experiments 
already approved under this section may be obtained from the Office of 
Recombinant DNA Activities, National Institutes of Health, Building 31, Room 
4B11, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, (301) 496-9838. 
Section III-B-1-(a). Experiments in this category cannot be initiated without 
submission of relevant information on the proposed experiment to NIH/ORDA. 
The containment conditions for such experiments will be determined by 
NIH/ORDA in consultation with ad hoc experts. Such experiments require 
Institutional Biosafety Committee approval before initiation (see Section IV-B-2-b-(1)).



Section III-B-2. Accelerated Review of Human Gene Transfer Experiments 


As determined by NIH/ORDA, in consultation with the RAC Chair and one or 
more RAC members, as necessary, certain categories of human gene transfer 
experiments may be considered as Minor Actions and qualify for Accelerated Review 
and approval (see Section IV-C-1-b-(2)-(a), Appendix M-III-A, and Appendix
M- 
V). The RAC Chair will present a report of all NIH/ORDA approved human 
gene transfer protocols at the next regularly scheduled RAC meeting. If 
NIH/ORDA determines that an experiment does not qualify for the Accelerated 
Review process, the Principal Investigator must submit the proposal for full RAC review " 8 weeks prior to the next
scheduled RAC meeting (See Section III-A-2). 


Section III-B-3. Minor Modifications to Human Gene Transfer Experiments 


A minor modification in a human gene transfer protocol is a modification that 
does not significantly alter the basic design of the protocol and that does not 
increase risk to human subjects or the environment. After approval has been 
obtained by the relevant Institutional Biosafety Committee and Institutional 
Review Board, NIH/ORDA will consider the change in consultation with the RAC 
Chair and one or more RAC members, as necessary. Submit minor modifications 
to the Office of Recombinant DNA Activities, National Institutes of Health, 
Building 31, Room 4B11, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, (301) 496-9838. The RAC 
Chair will provide a report on any such approvals at the next regularly scheduled RAC meeting. 


Section III-C. Experiments That Require Institutional Biosafety Committee 
Approval Before Initiation 


Prior to the initiation of an experiment that falls into this category, the Principal 
Investigator must submit a registration document to the Institutional Biosafety 
Committee which contains the following information: (i) The source(s) of DNA; 
(ii) the nature of the inserted DNA sequences; (iii) the host(s) and vector(s) to be 
used; (iv) if an attempt will be made to obtain expression of a foreign gene, and if 
so, indicate the protein that will be produced; and (v) the containment conditions 
that will be implemented as specified in the NIH Guidelines. For experiments in 
this category, the registration document shall be dated, signed by the Principal 
Investigator, and filed with the Institutional Biosafety Committee. The Institutional 
Biosafety Committee shall review and approve all experiments in this category 
prior to their initiation. Requests to decrease the level of containment specified 
for experiments in this category will be considered by NIH (see Section 
IV-C-1-b-(2)-(c)). 


Section III-C-1. Experiments Using Human or Animal Pathogens (Class 2, Class 
3, Class 4, or Class 5 Agents (See Section V-A) as Host-Vector Systems 


Section III-C-1-a. Experiments involving the introduction of recombinant DNA 
into Class 2 agents shall be conducted at Biosafety Level (BL) 2 containment. 
Experiments with such agents shall be conducted with whole animals at BL2 or 
BL2-N (Animals) containment. 
Section III-C-1-b. Experiments involving the introduction of recombinant DNA 
into Class 3 agents shall be conducted at BL3 containment. Experiments with such 
agents shall be conducted with whole animals at BL3 or BL3-N containment. 
Section III-C-1-c. Experiments involving the introduction of recombinant DNA 
into Class 4 agents shall be conducted at BL4 containment. Experiments with such 
agents shall be conducted with whole animals at BL4 or BL4-N containment. 
Section III-C-1-d. Containment conditions for experiments involving the 
introduction of recombinant DNA into Class 5 agents shall be set on a case-by-case basis following NIH/ORDA review.
A U.S. Department of Agriculture permit is required for work with Class 5 agents (see Sections V-R and V-T).
Experiments with such agents shall be conducted with whole animals at BL4 or BL4-N containment. 


Section III-C-2. Experiments in Which DNA From Human or Animal Pathogens 
(Class 2, Class 3, Class 4, or Class 5 Agents (See Section V-A) is Cloned Into 
Nonpathogenic Prokaryotic or Lower Eukaryotic Host-Vector Systems 


Section III-C-2-a. Experiments in which DNA from Class 2 or Class 3 agents (see 
Section V-A) is transferred into nonpathogenic prokaryotes or lower eukaryotes 
may be performed under BL2 containment. Experiments in which DNA from 
Class 4 agents is transferred into nonpathogenic prokaryotes or lower eukaryotes 
may be performed under BL2 containment after demonstration that only a totally 
and irreversibly defective fraction of the agent's genome is present in a given 
recombinant. In the absence of such a demonstration, BL4 containment shall be 
used. The Institutional Biosafety Committee may approve the specific lowering of 
containment for particular experiments to BL1. Many experiments in this category 
are exempt from the NIH Guidelines (see Section III-E). Experiments involving 
the formation of recombinant DNA for certain genes coding for molecules toxic for 
vertebrates require NIH/ORDA approval (see Section III-B-1) or shall be 
conducted under NIH specified conditions as described in Appendix F.

Section III-C-3. Experiments Involving the Use of Infectious Animal or Plant DNA or RNA Viruses or Defective
Animal or Plant DNA or RNA Viruses in the Presence of Helper Virus in Tissue Culture Systems


Caution: Special care should be used in the evaluation of containment levels for experiments which are likely to either
enhance the pathogenicity (e.g., insertion of a host oncogene) or to extend the host range (e.g., introduction of
novel control elements) of viral vectors under conditions that permit a productive infection. In such cases, serious
consideration should be given to increasing physical containment by at least one level. 





Note: 

Recombinant DNA or RNA molecules derived therefrom, which contain less than two-thirds of the genome of any
eukaryotic virus (all viruses from a single Family (see Section V-Q) being considered identical (see Section
V-S), are considered defective and may be used in the absence of helper under the conditions specified in Section
III-D-1. 



Section III-C-3-a. Experiments involving the use of infectious or defective Class 2 animal viruses
(see Section V-A, Appendix B-II, and Appendix B-II-E) in the presence of helper virus may be

Section V-A and Appendix B-V) in the presence of helper virus shall be determined on a case-by-case basis
following NIH/ORDA review. A U.S. Department of Agriculture permit is required for work with Class 5 agents (see Sections
V-R and V-T).
Section III-C-3-e. Experiments involving the use of infectious or defective animal or plant viruses
in the presence of helper virus are not covered in Sections III-C-3-a through III-C-3-d
and may be conducted at BL1.

Section III-C-4. Experiments Involving Whole Animals 



This section covers experiments involving whole animals in which the animal's genome has been altered by stable introduction
of recombinant DNA, or DNA derived therefrom, into the germ-line (transgenic animals) and experiments involving
viable recombinant DNA-modified microorganisms tested on whole animals. For the latter, other than viruses which
are only vertically transmitted, the experiments may not be conducted at BL1-N containment. A minimum containment
of BL2 or BL2-N is required. 

Caution_Special care should be used in the evaluation of containment conditions for some experiments with transgenic
animals. For example, such experiments might lead to the creation of novel mechanisms or increased transmission
of a recombinant pathogen or production of undesirable traits in the host animal. In such cases, serious consideration
should be given to increasing the containment conditions. 

Section III-C-4-a. Recombinant DNA, or DNA or RNA molecules derived therefrom, from any source
except for greater than two-thirds of eukaryotic viral genome may be transferred to any non-human vertebrate or any
invertebrate organism and propagated under conditions of physical containment comparable to BL1 or BL1-N
and appropriate to the organism under study (see Section V-B). 

Animals that contain sequences from viral vectors, which do not lead to transmissible infection either directly
or indirectly as a result of complementation or recombination in animals, may be propagated under conditions of physical
containment comparable to BL1 or BL1-N and appropriate to the organism under study. Experiments involving
the introduction of other sequences from eukaryotic viral genomes into animals are covered under Section III-C-4-b.
For experiments involving recombinant DNA-modified Class 2, 3, 4, or 5 organisms, see Section V-A. It is important
that the investigator demonstrate that the fraction of the viral genome being utilized does not lead to productive
infection. A U.S. Department of Agriculture permit is required for work with Class 5 agents (see Section V-R
and V-T). 

Section III-C-4-b. For experiments involving recombinant DNA, or DNA or RNA derived therefrom,
involving whole animals, including transgenic animals, and not covered by Sections III-C-1 or III-C-4-a,
the appropriate containment shall be determined by the Institutional Biosafety Committee. 



Section III-C-5. Experiments Involving Whole Plants 



Experiments to genetically engineer plants by recombinant DNA methods, to use such plants for other experimental
purposes (e.g., response to stress), to propagate such plants, or to use plants together with microorganisms or insects
containing recombinant DNA, may be conducted under the containment conditions described in Sections III-C-5-a
through III-C-5-e. If experiments involving whole plants are not described in Section III-C-5
and do not fall under Sections III-A, III-B, or III-E, they are included in Section III-D.






Note

. For recombinant DNA experiments falling under Sections III-C-5-a through III-C-5-d,
physical containment requirements may be reduced to the next lower level by appropriate biological containment
practices, such as conducting experiments on a virus with an obligate insect vector in the absence of that vector or
using a genetically attenuated strain.




Section III-C-5-a. BL3-P (Plants) or BL2-P + biological containment is recommended
for experiments involving most exotic (see Section V-W) infectious agents with recognized potential for serious
detrimental impact on managed or natural ecosystems when recombinant DNA techniques are associated with whole plants.


Section III-C-5-b. BL3-P or BL2-P + biological containment is recommended for experiments
involving plants containing cloned genomes of readily transmissible exotic (see Section V-W) infectious
agents with recognized potential for serious detrimental effects on managed or natural ecosystems in which there
exists the possibility of reconstituting the complete and functional genome of the infectious agent by genomic complementation


in planta. 

Section III-C-5-c. BL4-P containment is recommended for experiments with a small number
of readily transmissible exotic (see Section V-W) infectious agents, such as the soybean rust fungus (Phakospora
pachyrhizi

) and maize streak or other viruses in the presence of their specific arthropod vectors, that have the potential of
being serious pathogens of major U.S. crops. 

Section III-C-5-d. BL3-P containment is recommended for experiments involving sequences
encoding potent vertebrate toxins introduced into plants or associated organisms. Recombinant DNA containing
genes for the biosynthesis of toxin molecules lethal for vertebrates at an LD

50

 of <100 nanograms per kilogram body weight fall under Section III-B-1 and require NIH/ORDA and Institutional
Biosafety Committee approval before initiation. 

Section III-C-5-e. BL3-P or BL2-P + biological containment is recommended for experiments
with microbial pathogens of insects or small animals associated with plants if the recombinant DNA-modified organism
has a recognized potential for serious detrimental impact on managed or natural ecosystems.

The appropriate containment will be decided by the Institutional Biosafety 
Committee. Where appropriate, Appendix K, Physical Containment for Large Scale Uses of Organisms Containing Recombinant
DNA Molecules, shall be used. 
Appendix K describes containment conditions Good Large Scale Practice through 
BL3-Large Scale. 



Section III-C-7. Human Gene Transfer Experiments Not Covered by Sections III-A-2, III-B-2,
III-B-3, and Not Considered Exempt Under Section V-U 



Certain experiments involving the transfer of recombinant DNA or DNA or RNA derived from recombinant DNA into one
or more human subjects that are not 
covered by Sections III-A-2, III-B-2, III-B-3, and that are not considered exempt
under Section V-U must be registered with NIH/ORDA. The relevant 
Institutional Biosafety Committee and Institutional Review Board must review and approve all experiments in this
category prior to their initiation. 



Section III-D. Experiments That Require Institutional Biosafety Committee Notice Simultaneous With Initiation




Experiments not included in Sections III-A, III-B, III-C, III-E, and their 
subsections are considered in Section III-D. All such experiments may be 
conducted at BL1 containment. For experiments in this category, a registration document (see Section III-C)
shall be dated and signed by the investigator and filed with the local Institutional Biosafety Committee at the time
the experiment is initiated. The Institutional Biosafety Committee reviews and approves all such proposals, but
Institutional Biosafety Committee review and approval prior to initiation of the experiment is not required (see
Section IV-A). For example, experiments in which all components derived from non-pathogenic prokaryotes
and non-pathogenic lower eukaryotes fall under Section III-D and may be conducted at BL1 containment. 



Section III-D-1. Experiments Involving the Formation of Recombinant DNA 
Molecules Containing No More Than Two-Thirds of the Genome of Any Eukaryotic 
Virus 



Recombinant DNA molecules containing no more than two-thirds of the genome 
of any eukaryotic virus (all viruses from a single Family (see Section V-Q) being considered identical (see
Section V-S)) may be propagated and maintained in cells in tissue culture using BL1 containment. For such experiments,
it must be demonstrated that the cells lack helper virus for the specific Families of defective viruses being used.
If helper virus is present, procedures specified under Section III-C-3 should be used. The DNA may contain
fragments of the genome of viruses from more than one Family but each fragment shall be less than two-thirds of a genome.

Section III-D-2. Experiments Involving Whole Plants 


This section covers experiments involving recombinant DNA-modified whole plants, and/or experiments involving
recombinant DNA-modified organisms associated with whole plants, except those that fall under Section III-A, III-B,
III-C, or III-E. It should be emphasized that knowledge of the organisms and judgment based on accepted scientific
practices should be used in all cases in selecting the appropriate level of containment. For example, if the genetic
modification has the objective of increasing pathogenicity or converting a non-pathogenic organism into a pathogen,
then a higher level of containment may be appropriate depending on the organism, its mode of dissemination, and its
target organisms. By contrast, a lower level of containment may be appropriate for small animals associated with
many types of recombinant DNA-modified plants. 
Section III-D-2-a. BL1-P is recommended for all experiments with recombinant DNA-containing plants and plant-associated
microorganisms not covered in Section III-D-2-b or other sections of the NIH Guidelines. Examples of such experiments
are those involving recombinant DNA-modified plants that are not noxious weeds or that cannot interbreed with noxious
weeds in the immediate geographic area, and experiments involving whole plants and recombinant DNA-modified non-exotic
(see Section V-W) microorganisms that have no recognized potential for rapid and widespread dissemination or for
serious detrimental impact on managed or natural ecosystems (e.g., 

Rhizobium 

spp. and 

Agrobacterium 

spp.).
Section III-D-2-b. BL2-P or BL1-P + biological containment is recommended for the following experiments:

Section III-D-2-b-(1). Plants modified by recombinant DNA that are noxious weeds or can interbreed with noxious
weeds in the immediate geographic area. 
Section III-D-2-b-(2). Plants in which the introduced DNA represents the 
complete genome of a non-exotic infectious agent (see Section V-W). 
Section III-D-2-b-(3). Plants associated with recombinant DNA-modified non-exotic microorganisms that
have a recognized potential for serious detrimental 
impact on managed or natural ecosystems (see Section V-W). 
Section III-D-2-b-(4). Plants associated with recombinant DNA-modified exotic microorganisms that have
no recognized potential for serious natural ecosystems (see Section V-W). 
Section III-D-2-b-(5). Experiments with recombinant DNA-modified arthropods or small animals associated
with plants, or with arthropods or small animals with recombinant DNA-modified microorganisms associated with
them if the recombinant DNA-modified microorganisms have no recognized potential for serious detrimental impact
on managed or natural ecosystems (see Section V-W). 


Section III-E. Exempt Experiments 


The following recombinant DNA molecules are exempt from the NIH Guidelines 
and registration with the Institutional Biosafety Committee is not required:

The following new footnote, V-W is added to Section V: 

Section V-W. In accordance with accepted scientific and regulatory practices of the discipline of plant pathology,
an exotic plant pathogen (e.g., virus, bacteria, or fungus) is one that is unknown to occur within the U.S. (see Section
V-R). Determination of whether a pathogen has a potential for serious detrimental impact on managed (agricultural,
forest, grassland) or natural ecosystems should be made by the Principal Investigator and the Institutional Biosafety
Committee, in consultation with scientists knowledgeable of plant diseases, crops, and ecosystems in the geographic
area of the research.



F. Addition to Appendix C-I, Recombinant DNA in Tissue Culture, of the NIH Guidelines



The amended version of Appendix C-I reads as follows:

Appendix C-I. Recombinant DNA in Tissue Culture

Recombinant DNA molecules containing less than one-half of any eukaryotic viral genome (all viruses from a single
family (see Appendix C-VI-D) being considered identical (see Appendix C-VI-E), that are
propagated and maintained in cells in tissue culture are exempt from these NIH Guidelines with the exceptions listed
in Appendix C-I-A. 



Appendix C-I-A. Exceptions

Appendix G-I. Standard Practices and Training



The first principle of containment is strict adherence to good microbiological practices (see Appendices G-III-A
through G-III-J). Consequently, all personnel directly or indirectly involved in experiments using
recombinant DNA shall receive adequate instruction (see Sections IV-B-1-e and IV-B-4-d).
At a minimum, these instructions include training in aseptic techniques and in the biology of the organisms used in
the experiments so that the potential biohazards can be understood and appreciated.

Any research group working with agents that are known or potential biohazards shall have an emergency plan that describes
the procedures to be followed if an accident contaminates personnel or the environment. The Principal Investigator
shall ensure that everyone in the laboratory is familiar with both the potential hazards of the work and the emergency
plan (see Sections IV-B-4-d and IV-B-4-e). If a research group is working with
a known pathogen for which there is an effective vaccine, the vaccine should be made available to all workers. Serological
monitoring, when clearly appropriate, will be provided (see Section IV-B-1-f).

The Laboratory Safety Monograph (see Appendix G-III-O) and Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical
Laboratories (see Appendix G-III-B) describe practices, equipment, and facilities in detail.



H. Addition of Appendix P, Physical and Biological Containment for Recombinant DNA Research Involving Plants, to
the NIH Guidelines



The following new appendix, Appendix P, reads as follows:

Appendix P specifies physical and biological containment conditions and practices suitable to the greenhouse conduct
of experiments involving recombinant DNA-containing plants, plant-associated microorganisms, and small animals.
All provisions of the NIH Guidelines apply to plant research activities with the following modifications:

Appendix P shall supersede Appendix G when the research plants are of a size, number, or have growth requirements that
preclude the use of containment conditions described in Appendix G. The plants covered in Appendix P include but are
not limited to mosses, liverworts, macroscopic algae, and vascular plants including terrestrial crops, forest,
and ornamental species.

Plant-associated microorganisms include viroids, virusoids, viruses, bacteria, fungi, protozoans, certain
small algae, and microorganisms that have a benign or beneficial association with plants, such as certain 

Rhizobium 

species and microorganisms known to cause plant diseases. The appendix applies to microorganisms which are being
modified with the objective of fostering an association with plants.

Plant-associated small animals include those arthropods that: (i) Are in obligate association with plants, (ii)
are plant pests, (iii) are plant pollinators, or (iv) transmit plant disease agents, as well as other small animals
such as nematodes for which tests of biological properties necessitate the use of plants. Microorganisms associated
with such small animals (e.g., pathogens or symbionts) are included.

The Institutional Biosafety Committee shall include at least one individual with expertise in plant, plant pathogen,
or plant pest containment principles when experiments utilizing Appendix P require prior approval by the Institutional
Biosafety Committee.



Appendix P-I. General Plant Biosafety Levels



Appendix P-I-A. The principal purpose of plant containment is to avoid the unintentional transmission
of a recombinant DNA-containing plant genome, including nuclear or organelle hereditary material or release of
recombinant DNA-derived organisms associated with plants.

Appendix P-I-B. The containment principles are based on the recognition that the organisms that are used
pose no health threat to humans or higher animals (unless deliberately modified for that purpose), and that the containment
conditions minimize the possibility of an unanticipated deleterious effect on organisms and ecosystems outside
of the experimental facility, e.g., the inadvertent spread of a serious pathogen from a greenhouse to a local agricultural
crop or the unintentional introduction and establishment of an organism in a new ecosystem.

Appendix P-I-C. Four biosafety levels, referred to as Biosafety Level (BL) 1_Plants (P), BL2-P,
BL3-P, and BL4-P, are established in Section II. The selection of containment levels required for research
involving recombinant DNA molecules in plants or associated with plants is specified in Section III. These biosafety
levels are described in Appendix P-II. This appendix describes greenhouse practices and special greenhouse
facilities for physical containment.

Appendix P-I-D. BL1-P through BL4-P are designed to provide differential levels of biosafety
for plants in the absence or presence of other experimental organisms that contain recombinant DNA. These biosafety
levels, in conjunction with biological containment conditions described in Appendix P-III, provide flexible
approaches to ensure the safe conduct of research.

Appendix P-I-E. For experiments in which plants are grown at the BL1 through BL4 laboratory settings,
containment practices shall be followed as described in Appendix G. These containment practices include the use
of plant tissue culture rooms, growth chambers within laboratory facilities, or experiments performed on open benches.
Additional biological containment practices should be added by the Greenhouse Director or Institutional Biosafety
Committee as necessary (see Appendix P-III), if botanical reproductive structures are produced that have
the potential of being released.

Appendix P-III-B. Biological Containment Practices (Microorganisms)


Appendix P-III-B-1. Effective dissemination of microorganisms beyond the confines of the greenhouse can
be prevented by one or more of the following procedures: (i) Confine all operations to injections of microorganisms
or other biological procedures (including genetic manipulation) that limit replication or reproduction of viruses
and microorganisms or sequences derived from microorganisms, and confine these injections to internal plant parts
or adherent plant surfaces; (ii) ensure that organisms, which can serve as hosts or promote the transmission of the
virus or microorganism, are not present within the farthest distance that the airborne virus or microorganism may
be expected to be effectively disseminated; (iii) conduct experiments at a time of year when plants that can serve
as hosts are either not growing or are not susceptible to productive infection; (iv) use viruses and other microorganisms
or their genomes that have known arthropod or animal vectors, in the absence of such vectors; (v) use microorganisms
that have an obligate association with the plant; or (vi) use microorganisms that are genetically disabled to minimize
survival outside of the research facility and whose natural mode of transmission requires injury of the target organism,
or assures that inadvertent release is unlikely to initiate productive infection of organisms outside of the experimental
facility.


Appendix P-III-C. Biological Containment Practices (Macroorganisms)


Appendix P-III-C-1. Effective dissemination of arthropods and other small animals can be prevented by using
one or more of the following procedures: (i) Use non-flying, flight-impaired, or sterile arthropods; (ii) use non-motile

organisms; (iv) use animals that have an obligate association with a plant that is not present within the dispersal
range of the organism; or (v) prevent the escape of organisms present in run-off water by chemical treatment or evaporation
of run-off water.


I. Addition of Appendix Q, Physical and Biological Containment for Recombinant DNA Research Involving Animals,
to the NIH Guidelines


The following new appendix, Appendix Q, reads as follows:
Appendix Q specifies containment and confinement practices for research involving whole animals, both those in
which the animal's genome has been altered by stable introduction of recombinant DNA, or DNA derived therefrom, into
the germ-line (transgenic animals) and experiments involving viable recombinant DNA-modified microorganisms
tested on whole animals. The appendix applies to animal research activities with the following modifications:
Appendix Q shall supersede Appendix G when research animals are of a size or have growth requirements that preclude
the use of containment for laboratory animals. Some animals may require other types of containment (see Appendix
Q-III-D). The animals covered in Appendix Q are those species normally categorized as animals including but not limited
to cattle, swine, sheep, goats, horses, and poultry.
The Institutional Biosafety Committee shall include at least one scientist with expertise in animal containment
principles when experiments utilizing Appendix Q require Institutional Biosafety Committee prior approval.
The institution shall establish and maintain a health surveillance program for personnel engaged in animal research
involving viable recombinant DNA-containing microorganisms that require Biosafety Level (BL) 3 or greater containment
in the laboratory.

Appendix Q-II-D-1-g-(9). The life support system for the ventilated suit or head hood is equipped with alarms
and emergency back-up air tanks. The exhaust air from the suit area shall be filtered by two sets of high efficiency
particulate air/HEPA filters installed in series or incinerated. A duplicate filtration unit, exhaust fan, and
an automatically starting emergency power source shall be provided. The air pressure within the suit shall be greater
than that of any adjacent area. Emergency lighting and communication systems shall be provided. A double-door autoclave
shall be provided for decontamination of waste materials to be removed from the suit area.
Appendix Q-II-D-1-g-(10). Needles and syringes shall be used only for parenteral injection and aspiration
of fluids from laboratory animals and diaphragm bottles. Only needle-locking syringes or disposable syringe-needle
units (i.e., needle is integral to the syringe) shall be used for the injection or aspiration of fluids containing
organisms that contain recombinant DNA. Extreme caution shall be used when handling needles and syringes to avoid
autoinoculation and the generation of aerosols during use and disposal. Following use, needles shall not be bent,
sheared, replaced in the needle sheath or guard, or removed from the syringe. The needles and syringes shall be promptly
placed in a puncture-resistant container and decontaminated, preferably by autoclaving, before discard or reuse.
Appendix Q-II-D-1-g-(11). An essential adjunct to the reporting-surveillance system is the availability
of a facility for quarantine, isolation, and medical care of personnel with potential or known laboratory-associated
illnesses.
Appendix Q-II-D-1-g-(12). A biosafety manual shall be prepared or adopted. Personnel shall be advised of special
hazards and required to read and follow instructions on practices and procedures.
Appendix Q-II-D-1-g-(13). Vacuum lines shall be protected with high efficiency particulate air/HEPA filters
and liquid disinfectant traps.



Appendix Q-II-D-2. Animal Facilities (BL4-N) 



Appendix Q-II-D-2-a. Animals shall be contained within an enclosed structure (animal room or equivalent)
to minimize the possibility of theft or unintentional release and avoid arthropod access.
Appendix Q-II-D-2-b. The interior walls, floors, and ceilings shall be impervious to water and resistant to
acids, alkalis, organic solvents, and moderate heat, to facilitate cleaning. Penetrations in these structures
and surfaces (e.g., plumbing and utilities) shall be sealed.
Appendix Q-II-D-2-c. Windows in the animal facility shall be closed, sealed, and breakage resistant (e.g.,
double-pane tempered glass or equivalent).
Appendix Q-II-D-2-d. An autoclave, incinerator, or other effective means to decontaminate animals and wastes
shall be available, preferably within the containment area. If feasible, a double-door autoclave is preferred and
should be positioned to allow removal of material from the containment area.
Appendix Q-II-D-2-e. Access doors to the containment area shall be self-closing.
Appendix Q-II-D-2-f. All perimeter joints and openings shall be sealed to form an arthropod-proof structure.
Appendix Q-II-D-2-g. The BL4-N laboratory provides a double barrier to prevent the release of recombinant
DNA containing microorganisms into the environment. Design of the animal facility shall be such that if the barrier
of the inner facility is breached, the outer barrier will prevent release into the environment. The animal area shall
be separated from all other areas. Passage through two sets of doors shall be the basic requirement for entry into the
animal area from access corridors or other contiguous areas. Physical separation of the animal containment area
from access corridors or other laboratories or activities shall be provided by a double-door clothes change room
equipped with integral showers and airlock.
Appendix Q-II-D-2-h. A necropsy room shall be provided within the BL4-N containment area.
Appendix Q-II-D-2-i. Liquid effluent from containment equipment, sinks, biological safety cabinets, animal
rooms, primary barriers, floor drains, and sterilizers shall be decontaminated by heat treatment before being released
into the sanitary system. Liquid wastes from shower rooms and toilets shall be decontaminated with chemical disinfectants
or heat by methods demonstrated to be effective. The procedure used for heat decontamination of liquid wastes shall
be monitored with a recording thermometer. The effectiveness of the heat decontamination process system shall be
revalidated every 30 days with an indicator organism. Liquid wastes from the shower shall be chemically decontaminated
using an Environmental Protection Agency-approved germicide.

The efficacy of the chemical treatment process shall be validated with an indicator organism. Chemical disinfectants
shall be neutralized or diluted before release into general effluent waste systems.

Appendix Q-II-D-2-j. A ducted exhaust air ventilation system shall be provided that creates directional airflow
that draws air into the laboratory through the entry area. The exhaust air, which is not recirculated to any other area
of the building, shall be discharged to the outside and dispersed away from the occupied areas and air intakes. Personnel
shall verify that the direction of the airflow (into the animal room) is proper.

Appendix Q-II-D-2-k. Exhaust air from BL4-N containment area shall be double high efficiency particulate
air/HEPA filtered or treated by passing through a certified HEPA filter and an air incinerator before release to the
atmosphere. Double HEPA filters shall be required for the supply air system in a BL4-N containment area.

Appendix Q-II-D-2-l. All high efficiency particulate air/HEPA filters' frames and housings shall be certified
to have no detectable smoke [dioctylphthalate] leaks when the exit face (direction of flow) of the filter is scanned
above 0.01 percent when measured by a linear or logarithmic photometer. The instrument must demonstrate a threshold
sensitivity of at least 1 x 10

^3

 micrograms per liter for 0.3 micrometer diameter dioctylphthalate particles and a challenge concentration of 80-120
micrograms per liter. The air sampling rate should be at least 1 cfm (28.3 liters per minute).

Appendix Q-II-D-2-m. If an air incinerator is used in lieu of the second high efficiency particulate air/HEPA
filter, it shall be biologically challenged to prove all viable test agents are sterilized. The biological challenge
must be minimally 1 x 10

8

 organisms per cubic foot of airflow through the incinerator. It is universally accepted if bacterial spores are used
to challenge and verify that the equipment is capable of killing spores, then assurance is provided that all other
known agents are inactivated by the parameters established to operate the equipment. Test spores meeting this criterion
are 

Bacillus subtilis 

var. 

niger 

or 

Bacillus stearothermophilis. 

The operating temperature of the incinerator shall be continuously monitored and recorded during use.

Appendix Q-II-D-2-n. All equipment and floor drains shall be equipped with deep traps (minimally 5 inches).
Floor drains shall be fitted with isolation plugs or fitted with automatic water fill devices.

Appendix Q-II-D-2-o. Each animal area shall contain a foot, elbow, or automatically operated sink for hand
washing. The sink shall be located near the exit door.

Appendix Q-II-D-2-p. Restraining devices for animals may be required to avoid 
damage to the integrity of the containment animal facility. 

Appendix Q-II-D-2-q. The supply water distribution system shall be fitted with a 
back-flow preventer or break tank. 

Appendix Q-II-D-2-r. All utilities, liquid and gas services, shall be protected with 
devices that avoid back-flow. 

Appendix Q-II-D-2-s. Sewer and other atmospheric ventilation lines shall be 
equipped minimally with a single high efficiency particulate/HEPA filter. 
Condensate drains from these type housings shall be appropriately connected to a 
contaminated or sanitary drain system. The drain position in the housing dictates 
the appropriate system to be used. 



Appendix Q-III. Footnotes and References for Appendix Q 



Appendix Q-III-A. If recombinant DNA is derived from a Class 2 organism 
requiring BL2 containment, personnel shall be required to have specific training in 
handling pathogenic agents and directed by knowledgeable scientists. 

Appendix Q-III-B. Personnel who handle pathogenic and potentially lethal agents 
shall be required to have specific training and be supervised by knowledgeable 
scientists who are experienced in working with these agents. BL3-N containment 
also minimizes escape of recombinant DNA-containing organisms from exhaust air 
or waste material from the containment area. 

Appendix Q-III-C. Classes 4 and 5 microorganisms pose a high level of individual 
risk for acquiring life-threatening diseases to personnel and/or animals. To import 
Class 5 agents, special approval must be obtained from U.S. Department of 
Agriculture, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, Import-Export Products, 
Room 756, Federal Building, 6505 Belcrest Road, Hyattsville, Maryland 20782. 

Laboratory staff shall be required to have specific and thorough training in 
handling extremely hazardous infectious agents, primary and secondary 
containment, standard and special practices, and laboratory design characteristics. 
The laboratory staff shall be supervised by knowledgeable scientists who are 
trained and experienced in working with these agents and in the special 
containment facilities. 

Within work areas of the animal facility, all activities shall be confined to the 
specially equipped animal rooms or support areas. The maximum animal 
containment area and support areas shall have special engineering and design 
features to prevent the dissemination of microorganisms into the environment via 
exhaust air or waste disposal. 

Appendix Q-III-D. Other research with non-laboratory animals, which may not 
appropriately be conducted under conditions described in Appendix Q, may be 
conducted safely by applying practices routinely used for controlled culture of these 
biota. In aquatic systems, for example, BL1 equivalent conditions could be met by 
utilizing growth tanks that provide adequate physical means to avoid the escape of 
the aquatic species, its gametes, and introduced exogenous genetic material. A 
mechanism shall be provided to ensure that neither the organisms nor their 
gametes can escape into the supply or discharge system of the rearing container 
(e.g., tank, aquarium, etc.) Acceptable barriers include appropriate filtration, 
irradiation, heat treatment, chemical treatment, etc. Moreover, the top of the 
rearing container shall be covered to avoid escape of the organism and its gametes. 
In the event of tank rupture, leakage, or overflow, the construction of the room 
containing these tanks should prevent the organisms and gametes from entering the 
building's drains before the organism and its gametes have been inactivated. 

Other types of non-laboratory animals (e.g., nematodes, arthropods, and certain 
forms of smaller animals) may be accommodated by using the appropriate BL1 
through BL4 or BL1-P through BL4-P containment practices and procedures as 
specified in Appendices G and P.

OMB's ``Mandatory Information Requirements for Federal Assistance Program 
Announcements'' (45 FR 39592) requires a statement concerning the official 
government programs contained in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance. 
Normally NIH lists in its announcements the number and title of affected 
individual programs for the guidance of the public. Because the guidance in this 
notice covers not only virtually every NIH program but also essentially every 
Federal research program in which DNA recombinant molecule techniques could 
be used, it has been determined to be not cost effective or in the public interest to 
attempt to list these programs. Such a list would likely require several additional 
pages. In addition, NIH could not be certain that every Federal program would be 
included as many Federal agencies, as well as private organizations, both national 
and international, have elected to follow the NIH Guidelines. In lieu of the 
individual program listing, NIH invites readers to direct questions to the 
information address above about whether individual programs listed in the Catalog 
of Federal Domestic Assistance are affected.

Section I-A-1. Any recombinant DNA experiment, which according to the NIH 
Guidelines requires approval by the NIH, must be submitted to the NIH or to 
another Federal agency that has jurisdiction for review and approval. Once 
approval, or other applicable clearances, has been obtained from a Federal agency 
other than the NIH (whether the experiment is referred to that agency by the NIH 
or sent directly there by the submitter), the experiment may proceed without the 
necessity for NIH review or approval (see exceptions in Sections I-A-2 and I-A-3). 
Section I-A-2. Certain experiments that involve the deliberate transfer of 
recombinant DNA or DNA or RNA derived from recombinant DNA into one or 
more human subjects (see Section V-U) shall be considered Major Actions (see 
Section IV-C-1-b-(1)), and shall require RAC review and NIH Director approval, if 
determined by NIH/ORDA in consultation with the RAC Chair and/or one or 
more RAC members, as necessary, to: (i) Represent novel characteristics (e.g., 
target disease or vector), (ii) represent an uncertain degree of risk to human health 
or the environment, or (iii) contain information determined to require further public 
review (see Section III-A-2). 
Section I-A-3. Experiments involving the transfer of recombinant DNA to one or 
more human subjects that are not considered under Section III-A-2 may qualify for 
Accelerated Review (see Section III-B-2 and Appendix M-V) and will be considered 
as Minor Actions (see Section IV-C-1-b-(2)-(a)). Actions that qualify for Accelerated

Review will be reviewed and approved by NIH/ORDA in consultation with the RAC 
Chair and/or one or more RAC members, as necessary. 
Certain experiments involving the transfer of recombinant DNA or DNA or RNA 
derived from recombinant DNA into one or more human subjects (see Section V-U) 
may be considered exempt from RAC and/or NIH/ORDA review and/or NIH 
Director approval and only require registration with NIH/ORDA (see Section III-C-7). 


Section I-B. Definition of Recombinant DNA Molecules 



In the context of the NIH Guidelines, recombinant DNA molecules are defined as 
either: (i) Molecules that are constructed outside living cells by joining natural or 
synthetic DNA segments to DNA molecules that can replicate in a living cell, or (ii) 
molecules that result from the replication of those described in (i) above. 
Synthetic DNA segments which are likely to yield a potentially harmful 
polynucleotide or polypeptide (e.g., a toxin or a pharmacologically active agent) are 
considered as equivalent to their natural DNA counterpart. If the synthetic DNA 
segment is not expressed 

in vivo

 as a biologically active polynucleotide or 
polypeptide product, it is exempt from the NIH Guidelines. 
Genomic DNA of plants and bacteria that have acquired a transposable element, 
even if the latter was donated from a recombinant vector no longer present, are not 
subject to the NIH Guidelines unless the transposon itself contains recombinant 
DNA. 
Section I-C. General Applicability 
Section I-C-1. The NIH Guidelines are applicable to: 
Section I-C-1-a. All recombinant DNA research within the United States (U.S.) or 
its territories that is conducted at or sponsored by an institution that receives any 
support for recombinant DNA research from the NIH, including research performed 
directly by the NIH. An individual who receives support for research involving 
recombinant DNA must be associated with or sponsored by an institution that 
assumes the responsibilities assigned in the NIH Guidelines. 
Section I-C-1-b. All recombinant DNA research performed abroad: Specifically: 
Section I-C-1-b-(1). Research supported by NIH funds. 
Section I-C-1-b-(2). If they involve testing in humans of materials containing 
recombinant DNA developed with NIH funds and if the institution that developed 
those materials sponsors or participates in those projects. Participation includes 
research collaboration or contractual agreements, not mere provision of research 
materials. 
Section I-C-1-b-(3). If the host country has established rules for the conduct of 
recombinant DNA research, then the research must be in compliance with those 
rules. If the host country does not have such rules, the proposed research must be 
reviewed and approved by an NIH-approved Institutional Biosafety Committee or 
equivalent review body and accepted in writing by an appropriate national 
governmental authority of the host country. The safety practices that are employed 
abroad must be reasonably consistent with the NIH Guidelines. 



Section I-D. General Definitions 


The following terms, which are used throughout the NIH Guidelines, are defined as 
follows: 
 
Section I-D-1. An ``institution'' is any public or private entity (including Federal, 
state, and local government agencies). 
Section I-D-2. An ``Institutional Biosafety Committee'' is a committee that: (i) Meets 
the requirements for membership specified in Section IV-B-2, and (ii) reviews, 
approves, and oversees projects in accordance with the responsibilities defined in 
Section IV-B-2. 
Section I-D-3. The ``Office of Recombinant DNA Activities (ORDA)'' is the office 
within the NIH that is responsible for: (i) Reviewing and coordinating all activities 
relating to the NIH Guidelines, and (ii) performing other duties as defined in 
Section IV-C-3. 
Section I-D-4. The ``Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee'' is the public advisory 
committee that advises the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) 
Secretary, the DHHS Assistant Secretary for Health, and the NIH Director 
concerning recombinant DNA research. The RAC shall be constituted as specified 
in Section IV-C-2. 
Section I-D-5. The ``NIH Director'' is the Director of the National Institutes of 
Health, or any other officer or employee of NIH to whom authority has been 
delegated. 
Section I-D-6. ``Deliberate release'' is defined as a planned introduction of 
recombinant DNA-containing microorganisms, plants, or animals into the 
environment.

Section II. Containment 



Effective biological safety programs have been operative in a variety of laboratories for many years. Considerable
information already exists about the design of physical containment facilities and selection of laboratory procedures
applicable to organisms carrying recombinant DNA (see section V-A). The existing programs rely upon mechanisms
that can be divided into two categories: (i) A set of standard practices that are generally used in microbiological
laboratories; and (ii) special procedures, equipment, and laboratory installations that provide physical barriers
that are applied in varying degrees according to the estimated biohazard. Four biosafety levels are described in
Appendix G. These biosafety levels consist of combinations of laboratory practices and techniques, safety equipment,
and laboratory facilities appropriate for the operations performed and are based on the potential hazards imposed
by the agents used and for the laboratory function and activity. Biosafety Level 4 provides the most stringent containment
conditions, Biosafety Level 1 the least stringent. 

Experiments involving recombinant DNA lend themselves to a third containment mechanism, namely, the application
of highly specific biological barriers. Natural barriers exist that limit either: (i) The infectivity of a vector
or vehicle (plasmid or virus) for specific hosts, or (ii) its dissemination and survival in the environment. Vectors,
which provide the means for recombinant DNA and/or host cell replication, can be genetically designed to decrease,
by many orders of magnitude, the probability of dissemination of recombinant DNA outside the laboratory (see Appendix
I). 

Since these three means of containment are complementary, different levels of containment can be established that
apply various combinations of the physical and biological barriers along with a constant use of standard practices.
Categories of containment are considered separately in order that such combinations can be conveniently expressed
in the NIH Guidelines. 

Physical containment conditions within laboratories, described in Appendix G, may not always be appropriate for
all organisms because of their physical size, the number of organisms needed for an experiment, or the particular
growth requirements of the organism. Likewise, biological containment for microorganisms described in Appendix
I may not be appropriate for all organisms, particularly higher eukaryotic organisms. However, significant information
exists about the design of research facilities and experimental procedures that are applicable to organisms containing
recombinant DNA that is either integrated into the genome or into microorganisms associated with the higher organism
as a symbiont, pathogen, or other relationship. This information describes facilities for physical containment
of organisms used in non-traditional laboratory settings and special practices for limiting or excluding the unwanted
establishment, transfer of genetic information, and dissemination of organisms beyond the intended location,
based on both physical and biological containment principles. Research conducted in accordance with these conditions
effectively confines the organism. 

For research involving plants, four biosafety levels (BL1-P through BL4-P) are described in Appendix
P. BL1-P is designed to provide a moderate level of containment for experiments for which there is convincing
biological evidence that precludes the possibility of survival, transfer, or dissemination of recombinant DNA
into the environment, or in which there is no recognizable and predictable risk to the environment in the event of accidental
release. BL2-P is designed to provide a greater level of containment for experiments involving plants and certain
associated organisms in which there is a recognized possibility of survival, transmission, or dissemination of
recombinant DNA containing organisms, but the consequence of such an inadvertent release has a predictably minimal
biological impact. BL3-P and BL4-P describe additional containment conditions for research with plants
and certain pathogens and other organisms that require special containment because of their recognized potential
for significant detrimental impact on managed or natural ecosystems. BL1-P relies upon accepted scientific
practices for conducting research in most ordinary greenhouse or growth chamber facilities and incorporates accepted
procedures for good pest control and cultural practices. BL1-P facilities and procedures provide a modified
and protected environment for the propagation of plants and microorganisms associated with the plants and a degree
of containment that adequately controls the potential for release of biologically viable plants, plant parts, and
microorganisms associated with them. BL2-P and BL3-P rely upon accepted scientific practices for conducting
research in greenhouses with organisms infecting or infesting plants in a manner that minimizes or prevents inadvertent
contamination of plants within or surrounding the greenhouse. BL4-P describes facilities and practices known
to provide containment of certain exotic plant pathogens. 

For research involving animals, which are of a size or have growth requirements that preclude the use of conventional
primary containment systems used for small laboratory animals, four biosafety levels (BL1-N through BL4-N)
are described in Appendix Q. BL1-N describes containment for animals that have been modified by stable introduction
of recombinant DNA, or DNA derived therefrom, into the germ-line (transgenic animals) and experiments involving
viable recombinant DNA-modified microorganisms and is designed to eliminate the possibility of sexual transmission
of the modified genome or transmission of recombinant DNA-derived viruses known to be transmitted from animal parent
to offspring only by sexual reproduction. Procedures, practices, and facilities follow classical methods of avoiding
genetic exchange between animals. BL2-N describes containment which is used for transgenic animals associated
with recombinant DNA-derived organisms and is designed to eliminate the possibility of vertical or horizontal transmission.
Procedures, practices, and facilities follow classical methods of avoiding genetic exchange between animals or
controlling arthropod transmission. BL3-N and BL4-N describe higher levels of containment for research
with certain transgenic animals involving agents which pose recognized hazard.

In constructing the NIH Guidelines, it was necessary to define boundary conditions for the different levels of physical
and biological containment and for the classes of experiments to which they apply. These definitions do not take into
account all existing and anticipated information on special procedures that will allow particular experiments
to be conducted under different conditions than indicated here without affecting risk. Individual investigators
and Institutional Biosafety Committees are urged to devise simple and more effective containment procedures and
to submit recommended changes in the NIH Guidelines to permit the use of these procedures. 



Section III. Experiments Covered by the NIH Guidelines 



This section describes five categories of experiments involving recombinant DNA: (i) Those that require RAC review
and NIH and Institutional Biosafety Committee approval before initiation (see section III-A), (ii) those
that require NIH/ORDA and Institutional Biosafety Committee approval before initiation (see section III-B);
(iii) those that require Institutional Biosafety Committee approval before initiation (see section III-C),
(iv) those that require Institutional Biosafety Committee notification simultaneous with initiation (see section
III-D), and (v) those that are exempt from the NIH Guidelines (see section III-E).

 




Note: 

If an experiment falls into either section III-A or section III-B and one of the other categories, the rules
pertaining to section III-A or section III-B shall be followed. If an experiment falls into section III-E
and into either sections III-C or III-D categories as well, the experiment is considered exempt from the
NIH Guidelines. 



Any change in containment level, which is different from those specified in the NIH Guidelines, may not be initiated
without the express approval of NIH/ORDA (see Minor Actions, section IV-C-1-b-(2) and its
subsections). 



Section III-A. Experiments that Require Institutional Biosafety Committee Approval, RAC Review, and NIH
Approval Before Initiation 



Experiments in this category are considered Major Actions (see section IV-C-1-b-(1)) and
cannot be initiated without submission of relevant information on the proposed experiment to the Office of Recombinant
DNA Activities, National Institutes of Health, Building 31, room 4B11, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, (301) 496-9838,
the publication of the proposal in the 

Federal Register

 for 15 days of comment, reviewed by the RAC, and specific approval by the NIH (not applicable for Expedited Review single
patient human gene transfer experiments considered under Appendix M-VI). The containment conditions for
such experiments will be recommended by the RAC and set by the NIH at the time of approval. Such experiments require
Institutional Biosafety Committee approval before initiation. Specific experiments already approved are included
in Appendix D which may be obtained from the Office of Recombinant DNA Activities, National Institutes of Health,
Building 31, room 4B11, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, (301) 496-9838. 

Section III-A-1. Deliberate transfer of a drug resistance trait to microorganisms that are not known
to acquire the trait naturally (see section V-B), if such acquisition could compromise the use of the drug to
control disease agents in humans, veterinary medicine, or agriculture. 

Section III-A-2. Certain experiments involving the deliberate transfer of recombinant DNA or DNA or
RNA derived from recombinant DNA into one or more human subjects (see section V-U) shall be considered Major
Actions (see section IV-C-1-b-(1) and Appendix M-III), and shall require RAC review
and NIH Director approval, if determined by NIH/ORDA, in consultation with the RAC Chair and one or more RAC members,
as necessary, to: (i) Represent novel characteristics (e.g., target disease or vector), (ii) represent an uncertain
degree of risk to human health or the environment, or (iii) contain information determined to require further public
review. The requirement for RAC review shall not be considered to preempt any other required review or approval of
experiments with one or more human subjects. Relevant Institutional Biosafety Committee and Institutional Review
Board reviews and approvals of the proposal should be completed before submission to NIH. Certain experiments involving
deliberate transfer of recombinant DNA or DNA or RNA derived from recombinant DNA into one or more human subjects may
qualify for the Accelerated Review process (see section III-B-2). Certain categories of experiments
involving the deliberate transfer of recombinant DNA or DNA or RNA derived from recombinant DNA into one or more human
subjects and that are not covered by section V-U, may be considered exempt from RAC and/or NIH/ORDA review and/or
NIH Director approval and only require registration with NIH/ORDA (see section III-C-7). 



Section III-B. Experiments That Require NIH/ORDA and Institutional Biosafety Committee Approval Before
Initiation 

Section III-B-1. Experiments Involving the Cloning of Toxin Molecules with LD

50

 of Less than 100 Nanograms per Kilogram Body Weight 



Deliberate formation of recombinant DNA containing genes for the biosynthesis of toxin molecules lethal for vertebrates
at an LD

50

 of less than 100 nanograms per kilogram body weight (e.g., microbial toxins such as the botulinum toxins, tetanus
toxin, diphtheria toxin, and 

Shigella dysenteriae 

neurotoxin). Specific approval has been given for the cloning in 

Escherichia coli 

K-12 of DNA containing genes coding for the biosynthesis of toxic molecules which are lethal to vertebrates
at 100 nanograms to 100 micrograms per kilogram body weight. Specific experiments already approved under this section
may be obtained from the Office of Recombinant DNA Activities, National Institutes of Health, Building 31, room 4B11,
Bethesda, Maryland 20892, (301) 496-9838. 

Section III-B-1-(a). Experiments in this category cannot be initiated without submission of relevant
information on the proposed experiment to NIH/ORDA. The containment conditions for such experiments will be determined
by NIH/ORDA in consultation with ad hoc experts. Such experiments require Institutional Biosafety Committee approval
before initiation (see section IV-B-2-b-(1)). 



Section III-B-2. Accelerated Review of Human Gene Transfer Experiments 



As determined by NIH/ORDA, in consultation with the RAC Chair and one or more RAC members, as necessary, certain categories
of human gene transfer experiments may be considered as Minor Actions and qualify for Accelerated Review and approval
(see section IV-C-1-b-(2)-(a), Appendix M-III-A, and Appendix M-V).
The RAC Chair will present a report of all NIH/ORDA approved human gene transfer protocols at the next regularly scheduled
RAC meeting. If NIH/ORDA determines that an experiment does not qualify for the Accelerated Review process, the Principal
Investigator must submit the proposal for full RAC review " 8 weeks prior to the next scheduled RAC meeting (See section
III-A-2).

Section III-B-3. Minor Modifications to Human Gene Transfer Experiments 



A minor modification in a human gene transfer protocol is a modification that does 
not significantly alter the basic design of the protocol and that does not increase risk 
to human subjects or the environment. After approval has been obtained by the 
relevant Institutional Biosafety Committee and Institutional Review Board, 
NIH/ORDA will consider the change in consultation with the RAC Chair and one 
or more RAC members, as necessary. Submit minor modifications to the Office of 
Recombinant DNA Activities, National Institutes of Health, Building 31, Room 
4B11, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, (301) 496-9838. The RAC Chair will provide a 
report on any such approvals at the next regularly scheduled RAC meeting. 



Section III-C. Experiments that Require Institutional Biosafety Committee 
Approval Before Initiation 



Prior to the initiation of an experiment that falls into this category, the Principal 
Investigator must submit a registration document to the Institutional Biosafety 
Committee which contains the following information: (i) The source(s) of DNA; (ii) 
the nature of the inserted DNA sequences; (iii) the host(s) and vector(s) to be used; 
(iv) if an attempt will be made to obtain expression of a foreign gene, and if so, 
indicate the protein that will be produced; and (v) the containment conditions that 
will be implemented as specified in the NIH Guidelines. For experiments in this 
category, the registration document shall be dated, signed by the Principal 
Investigator, and filed with the Institutional Biosafety Committee. The Institutional 
Biosafety Committee shall review and approve all experiments in this category prior 
to their initiation. Requests to decrease the level of containment specified for 
experiments in this category will be considered by NIH (see Section IV-C-1-b-(2)-(c)). 



Section III-C-1. Experiments Using Human or Animal Pathogens (Class 2, Class 3, 
Class 4, or Class 5 Agents (see Section V-A) as Host-Vector Systems 



Section III-C-1-a. Experiments involving the introduction of recombinant DNA into 
Class 2 agents shall be conducted at Biosafety Level (BL) 2 containment. 
Experiments with such agents shall be conducted with whole animals at BL2 or 
BL2-N (Animals) containment. 

Section III-C-1-b. Experiments involving the introduction of recombinant DNA into 
Class 3 agents shall be conducted at BL3 containment. Experiments with such 
agents shall be conducted with whole animals at BL3 or BL3-N containment. 

Section III-C-1-c. Experiments involving the introduction of recombinant DNA into 
Class 4 agents shall be conducted at BL4 containment. Experiments with such 
agents shall be conducted with whole animals at BL4 or BL4-N containment. 

Section III-C-1-d. Containment conditions for experiments involving the 
introduction of recombinant DNA into Class 5 agents shall be set on a case-by-case 
basis following NIH/ORDA review. A U.S. Department of Agriculture permit is 
required for work with Class 5 agents (see Sections V-R and V-T). Experiments 
with such agents shall be conducted with whole animals at BL4 or BL4-N 
containment. 



Section III-C-2. Experiments in Which DNA From Human or Animal Pathogens 
(Class 2, Class 3, Class 4, or Class 5 Agents (see Section V-A) is Cloned Into 
Nonpathogenic Prokaryotic or Lower Eukaryotic Host-Vector Systems 



Section III-C-2-a. Experiments in which DNA from Class 2 or Class 3 agents (see 
Section V-A) is transferred into nonpathogenic prokaryotes or lower eukaryotes may 
be performed under BL2 containment. Experiments in which DNA from Class 4 
agents is transferred into nonpathogenic prokaryotes or lower eukaryotes may be 
performed under BL2 containment after demonstration that only a totally and 
irreversibly defective fraction of the agent's genome is present in a given 
recombinant. In the absence of such a demonstration, BL4 containment shall be 
used. The Institutional Biosafety Committee may approve the specific lowering of 
containment for particular experiments to BL1. Many experiments in this category 
are exempt from the NIH Guidelines (see Section III-E). Experiments involving the 
formation of recombinant DNA for certain genes coding for molecules toxic for 
vertebrates require NIH/ORDA approval (see Section III-B-1) or shall be 
conducted under NIH specified conditions as described in Appendix F. 

Section III-C-2-b. Containment conditions for experiments in which DNA from 
Class 5 agents is transferred into nonpathogenic prokaryotes or lower eukaryotes 
shall be determined by NIH/ORDA following a case-by-case review. A U.S. 
Department of Agriculture permit is required for work with Class 5 agents (see 
Sections V-R and V-T). 



Section III-C-3. Experiments Involving the Use of Infectious Animal or Plant DNA 
or RNA Viruses or Defective Animal or Plant DNA or RNA Viruses in the Presence 
of Helper Virus in Tissue Culture Systems 



Caution: Special care should be used in the evaluation of containment levels for 
experiments which are likely to either enhance the pathogenicity (e.g., insertion of a 
host oncogene) or to extend the host range (e.g., introduction of novel control 
elements) of viral vectors under conditions that permit a productive infection. In 
such cases, serious consideration should be given to increasing physical containment 
by at least one level.

Note: 

Recombinant DNA or RNA molecules derived therefrom, which contain less than two-thirds of the genome of any eukaryotic
virus (all viruses from a single Family (see Section V-Q) being considered identical (see Section V-S), are considered
defective and may be used in the absence of helper under the conditions specified in Section III-D-1. 





Section III-C-3-a. Experiments involving the use of infectious or defective Class 2 animal viruses (see Section
V-A, Appendix B-II, and Appendix B-II-E) in the presence of helper virus may be conducted at BL2. 

Section III-C-3-b. Experiments involving the use of infectious or defective Class 3 animal viruses (see Section
V-A and Appendix B-III-D) in the presence of helper virus may be conducted at BL3. 

Section III-C-3-c. Experiments involving the use of infectious or defective Class 4 animal viruses (see Section
V-A and Appendix B-IV-D) in the presence of helper virus may be conducted at BL4. 

Section III-C-3-d. Experiments involving the use of infectious or defective Class 5 viruses (see Section V-A
and Appendix B-V) in the presence of helper virus shall be determined on a case-by-case basis following NIH/ORDA review.
A U.S. Department of Agriculture permit is required for work with Class 5 agents (see Sections V-R and V-T). 

Section III-C-3-e. Experiments involving the use of infectious or defective animal or plant viruses in the
presence of helper virus are not covered in Sections III-C-3-a through III-C-3-d and may be conducted
at BL1. 



Section III-C-4. Experiments Involving Whole Animals 



This section covers experiments involving whole animals in which the animal's genome has been altered by stable introduction
of recombinant DNA, or DNA derived therefrom, into the germ-line (transgenic animals) and experiments involving
viable recombinant DNA-modified microorganisms tested on whole animals. For the latter, other than viruses which
are only vertically transmitted, the experiments may not be conducted at BL1-N containment. A minimum containment
of BL2 or BL2-N is required. 

Caution_Special care should be used in the evaluation of containment conditions for some experiments with transgenic
animals. For example, such experiments might lead to the creation of novel mechanisms or increased transmission
of a recombinant pathogen or production of undesirable traits in the host animal. In such cases, serious consideration
should be given to increasing the containment conditions. 

Section III-C-4-a. Recombinant DNA, or DNA or RNA molecules derived therefrom, from any source except for greater
than two-thirds of eukaryotic viral genome may be transferred to any non-human vertebrate or any invertebrate organism
and propagated under conditions of physical containment comparable to BL1 or BL1-N and appropriate to the organism
under study (see Section V-B). Animals that contain sequences from viral vectors, which do not lead to transmissible
infection either directly or indirectly as a result of complementation or recombination in animals, may be propagated
under conditions of physical containment comparable to BL1 or BL1-N and appropriate to the organism under study.
Experiments involving the introduction of other sequences from eukaryotic viral genomes into animals are covered
under Section III-C-4-b. For experiments involving recombinant DNA-modified Class 2, 3, 4, or 5 organisms,
see Section V-A. It is important that the investigator demonstrate that the fraction of the viral genome being utilized
does not lead to productive infection. A U.S. Department of Agriculture permit is required for work with Class 5 agents
(see Section V-R and V-T). 

Section III-C-4-b. For experiments involving recombinant DNA, or DNA or RNA derived therefrom, involving
whole animals, including transgenic animals, and not covered by Sections III-C-1 or III-C-4-a, the appropriate
containment shall be determined by the Institutional Biosafety Committee. 



Section III-C-5. Experiments Involving Whole Plants 



Experiments to genetically engineer plants by recombinant DNA methods, to use such plants for other experimental
purposes (e.g., response to stress), to propagate such plants, or to use plants together with microorganisms or insects
containing recombinant DNA, may be conducted under the containment conditions described in Sections III-C-5-a
through III-C-5-e. If experiments involving whole plants are not described in Section III-C-5 and do
not fall under Sections III-A, III-B, or III-E, they are included in Section III-D. 






Note: 

For recombinant DNA experiments falling under Sections III-C-5-a through III-C-5-d, physical containment
requirements may be reduced to the next lower level by appropriate biological containment practices, such as conducting
experiments on a virus with an obligate insect vector in the absence of that vector or using a genetically attenuated
strain. 





Section III-C-5-a. BL3-P (Plants) or BL2-P + biological containment is recommended for experiments
involving most exotic (see Section V-W) infectious agents with recognized potential for serious detrimental impact
on managed or natural ecosystems when recombinant DNA techniques are associated with whole plants.

<DOCNO> FR940705-2-00170 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940705-2-00091 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Section III-C-5-b. BL3-P or BL2-P + biological containment is recommended for experiments involving
plants containing cloned genomes of readily transmissible exotic (see Section V-W) infectious agents with recognized
potential for serious detrimental effects on managed or natural ecosystems in which there exists the possibility
of reconstituting the complete and functional genome of the infectious agent by genomic complementation 

in planta

. 

Section III-C-5-c. BL4-P containment is recommended for experiments with a small number of readily transmissible
exotic (see Section V-W) infectious agents, such as the soybean rust fungus (

Phakospora pachyrhizi

) and maize streak or other viruses in the presence of their specific arthropod vectors, that have the potential of
being serious pathogens of major U.S. crops. 

Section III-C-5-d. BL3-P containment is recommended for experiments involving sequences encoding
potent vertebrate toxins introduced into plants or associated organisms. Recombinant DNA containing genes for
the biosynthesis of toxin molecules lethal for vertebrates at an LD

50

 of <100 nanograms per kilogram body weight fall under Section III-B-1 and require NIH/ORDA and Institutional
Biosafety Committee approval before initiation. 

Section III-C-5-e. BL3-P or BL2-P + biological containment is recommended for experiments with
microbial pathogens of insects or small animals associated with plants if the recombinant DNA-modified organism
has a recognized potential for serious detrimental impact on managed or natural ecosystems. 



Section III-C-6. Experiments Involving More than 10 Liters of Culture 



The appropriate containment will be decided by the Institutional Biosafety Committee. Where appropriate, Appendix
K, Physical Containment for Large Scale Uses of Organisms Containing Recombinant DNA Molecules, shall be used. Appendix
K describes containment conditions Good Large Scale Practice through BL3-Large Scale. 



Section III-C-7. Human Gene Transfer Experiments Not Covered by Sections III-A-2, III-B-2, III-B-3,
and Not Considered Exempt Under Section V-U 



Certain experiments involving the transfer of recombinant DNA or DNA or RNA derived from recombinant DNA into one
or more human subjects that are not covered by Sections III-A-2, III-B-2, III-B-3, and that are not
considered exempt under Section V-U must be registered with NIH/ORDA. The relevant Institutional Biosafety Committee
and Institutional Review Board must review and approve all experiments in this category prior to their initiation.




Section III-D. Experiments that Require Institutional Biosafety Committee Notice Simultaneous With Initiation




Experiments not included in Sections III-A, III-B, III-C, III-E, and their subsections are considered in Section
III-D. All such experiments may be conducted at BL1 containment. For experiments in this category, a registration
document (see Section III-C) shall be dated and signed by the investigator and filed with the local Institutional
Biosafety Committee at the time the experiment is initiated. The Institutional Biosafety Committee reviews and
approves all such proposals, but Institutional Biosafety Committee review and approval prior to initiation of the
experiment is not required (see Section IV-A). For example, experiments in which all components derived from non-pathogenic
prokaryotes and non-pathogenic lower eukaryotes fall under Section III-D and may be conducted at BL1 containment.





Section III-D-1. Experiments Involving the Formation of Recombinant DNA Molecules Containing No More than
Two-Thirds of the Genome of Any Eukaryotic Virus 



Recombinant DNA molecules containing no more than two-thirds of the genome of any eukaryotic virus (all viruses from
a single Family (see Section V-Q) being considered identical (see Section V-S)) may be propagated and maintained
in cells in tissue culture using BL1 containment. For such experiments, it must be demonstrated that the cells lack
helper virus for the specific Families of defective viruses being used. If helper virus is present, procedures specified
under Section III-C-3 should be used. The DNA may contain fragments of the genome of viruses from more than one
Family but each fragment shall be less than two-thirds of a genome. 



Section III-D-2. Experiments Involving Whole Plants 



This section covers experiments involving recombinant DNA-modified whole plants, and/or experiments involving
recombinant DNA-modified organisms associated with whole plants, except those that fall under Section III-A, III-B,
III-C, or III-E. It should be emphasized that knowledge of the organisms and judgment based on accepted scientific
practices should be used in all cases in selecting the appropriate level of containment. For example, if the genetic
modification has the objective of increasing pathogenicity or converting a non-pathogenic organism into a pathogen,
then a higher level of containment may be appropriate depending on the organism, its mode of dissemination, and its
target organisms. By contrast, a lower level of containment may be appropriate for small animals associated with
many types of recombinant DNA-modified plants. 

Section III-D-2-a. BL1-P is recommended for all experiments with recombinant DNA-containing plants
and plant-associated microorganisms not covered in Section III-D-2-b or other sections of the NIH Guidelines.
Examples of such experiments are those involving recombinant DNA-modified plants that are not noxious weeds or that
cannot interbreed with noxious weeds in the immediate geographic area, and experiments involving whole plants and
recombinant DNA-modified non-exotic (see Section V-W) microorganisms that have no recognized potential for rapid
and widespread dissemination or for serious detrimental impact on managed or natural ecosystems (e.g., 

Rhizobium 

spp. and 

Agrobacterium 

spp.). 

Section III-D-2-b. BL2-P or BL1-P + biological containment is recommended for the following experiments:


Section III-D-2-b-(1). Plants modified by recombinant DNA that are noxious weeds or can interbreed with noxious
weeds in the immediate geographic area. 

Section III-D-2-b-(2). Plants in which the introduced DNA represents the complete genome of a non-exotic infectious
agent (see Section V-W). 

Section III-D-2-b-(3). Plants associated with recombinant DNA-modified non-exotic microorganisms that
have a recognized potential for serious detrimental impact on managed or natural ecosystems (see Section V-W). 

Section III-D-2-b-(4). Plants associated with recombinant DNA-modified exotic microorganisms that have
no recognized potential for serious natural ecosystems (see Section V-W).

Section III-D-2-b-(5). Experiments with recombinant DNA-modified arthropods or 
small animals associated with plants, or with arthropods or small animals with 
recombinant DNA-modified microorganisms associated with them if the 
recombinant DNA-modified microorganisms have no recognized potential for 
serious detrimental impact on managed or natural ecosystems (see Section V-W). 



Section III-E. Exempt Experiments 



The following recombinant DNA molecules are exempt from the NIH Guidelines 
and registration with the Institutional Biosafety Committee is not required: 

Section III-E-1. Those that are not in organisms or viruses. 

Section III-E-2. Those that consist entirely of DNA segments from a single 
nonchromosomal or viral DNA source, though one or more of the segments may be 
a synthetic equivalent. 

Section III-E-3. Those that consist entirely of DNA from a prokaryotic host 
including its indigenous plasmids or viruses when propagated only in that host (or a 
closely related strain of the same species), or when transferred to another host by 
well established physiological means. 

Section III-E-4. Those that consist entirely of DNA from an eukaryotic host 
including its chloroplasts, mitochondria, or plasmids (but excluding viruses) when 
propagated only in that host (or a closely related strain of the same species). 

Section III-E-5. Those that consist entirely of DNA segments from different species 
that exchange DNA by known physiological processes, though one or more of the 
segments may be a synthetic equivalent. A list of such exchangers will be prepared 
and periodically revised by the NIH Director with advice of the RAC after 
appropriate notice and opportunity for public comment (see Section 
IV-C-1-b-(1)-(c)). See Appendices A-I through A-VI for a list of natural
exchangers 
that are exempt from the NIH Guidelines. 

Section III-E-6. Those that do not present a significant risk to health or the 
environment (see Section IV-C-1-b-(1)-(c)), as determined by the NIH Director, 
with the advice of the RAC, and following appropriate notice and opportunity for 
public comment. See Appendix C for other classes of experiments which are 
exempt from the NIH Guidelines. 



Section IV, Roles and Responsibilities 



Section IV-A. Policy 



The safe conduct of experiments involving recombinant DNA depends on the 
individual conducting such activities. The NIH Guidelines cannot anticipate every 
possible situation. Motivation and good judgment are the key essentials to 
protection of health and the environment. The NIH Guidelines are intended to 
assist the institution, Institutional Biosafety Committee, Biological Safety Officer, 
and Principal Investigator in determining safeguards that should be implemented. 
The NIH Guidelines will never be complete or final since all conceivable 
experiments involving recombinant DNA cannot be foreseen. Therefore, it is the 
responsibility of the institution and those associated with it to adhere to the intent of the 
NIH Guidelines as well as to their specifics. Each institution (and the Institutional 
Biosafety Committee acting on its behalf) is responsible for ensuring that 
recombinant DNA activities comply with the NIH Guidelines. General recognition 
of institutional authority and responsibility properly establishes accountability for 
safe conduct of the research at the local level. The following roles and 
responsibilities constitute an administrative framework in which safety is an essential 
and integral part of research involving recombinant DNA molecules. Further 
clarifications and interpretations of roles and responsibilities will be issued by the 
NIH as necessary.

Section IV-B-1. General Information 



Each institution conducting or sponsoring recombinant DNA research which is 
covered by the NIH Guidelines is responsible for ensuring that the research is 
conducted in full conformity with the provisions of the NIH Guidelines. In order to 
fulfill this responsibility, the institution shall: 

Section IV-B-1-a. Establish and implement policies that provide for the safe 
conduct of recombinant DNA research and that ensure compliance with the NIH 
Guidelines. As part of its general responsibilities for implementing the NIH 
Guidelines, the institution may establish additional procedures, as deemed necessary, 
to govern the institution and its components in the discharge of its responsibilities 
under the NIH Guidelines. Such procedures may include: (i) Statements formulated 
by the institution for the general implementation of the NIH Guidelines, and (ii) any 
additional precautionary steps the institution deems appropriate. 
Section IV-B-1-b. Establish an Institutional Biosafety Committee that meets the 
requirements set forth in Section IV-B-2-a and carries out the functions detailed in 

Section IV-B-2-b. 

Section IV-B-1-c. Appoint a Biological Safety Officer (who is also a member of the 
Institutional Biosafety Committee) if the institution: (i) Conducts recombinant DNA 
research at Biosafety Level (BL) 3 or BL4, or (ii) engages in large scale (greater 
than 10 liters) research. The Biological Safety Officer carries out the duties 
specified in Section IV-B-3. 

Section IV-B-1-d. Assist and ensure compliance with the NIH Guidelines by 
Principal Investigators conducting research at the institution as specified in 

Section IV-B-4. 

Section IV-B-1-e. Ensure appropriate training for the Institutional Biosafety 
Committee Chair and members, Biological Safety Officer (when applicable), 
Principal Investigators, and laboratory staff regarding laboratory safety and 
implementation of the NIH Guidelines. The Institutional Biosafety Committee 
Chair is responsible for ensuring that Institutional Biosafety Committee members 
are appropriately trained. The Principal Investigator is responsible for ensuring that 
laboratory staff are appropriately trained. The institution is responsible for ensuring 
that the Principal Investigator has sufficient training; however, this responsibility 
may be delegated to the Institutional Biosafety Committee. 

Section IV-B-1-f. Determine the necessity for health surveillance of personnel 
involved in connection with individual recombinant DNA projects; and if 
appropriate, conduct a health surveillance program for such projects. The 
institution shall establish and maintain a health surveillance program for personnel 
engaged in large scale research or production activities involving viable organisms 
containing recombinant DNA molecules which require BL3 containment at the 
laboratory scale. The institution shall establish and maintain a health surveillance 
program for personnel engaged in animal research involving viable recombinant 
DNA-containing microorganisms that require BL3 or greater containment in the 
laboratory. The Laboratory Safety Monograph discusses various components of such 
a program (e.g., records of agents handled, active investigation of relevant illnesses, 
and the maintenance of serial serum samples for monitoring serologic changes that 
may result from the employees' work experience). Certain medical conditions may 
place a laboratory worker at increased risk in any endeavor where infectious agents 
are handled. Examples cited in the Laboratory Safety Monograph include 
gastrointestinal disorders and treatment with steroids, immunosuppressive drugs, or 
antibiotics. Workers with such disorders or treatment should be evaluated to 
determine whether they should be engaged in research with potentially hazardous 
organisms during their treatment or illness. Copies of the Laboratory Safety 
Monograph are available from the Office of Recombinant DNA Activities, National 
Institutes of Health, Building 31, Room 4B11, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, (301) 496-
9838.

Section IV-D. Compliance with the NIH Guidelines 


As a condition for NIH funding of recombinant DNA research, institutions shall 
ensure that such research conducted at or sponsored by the institution, irrespective 
of the source of funding, shall comply with the NIH Guidelines. The policies on 
noncompliance are as follows: 
All NIH-funded projects involving recombinant DNA techniques must comply with 
the NIH Guidelines. Non-compliance may result in: (i) suspension, limitation, or 
termination of financial assistance for such projects and of NIH funds for other 
recombinant DNA research at the institution, or (ii) a requirement for prior NIH 
approval of any or all recombinant DNA projects at the institution. 
All non-NIH funded projects involving recombinant DNA techniques conducted at 
or sponsored by an institution that receives NIH funds for projects involving such 
techniques must comply with the NIH Guidelines. Noncompliance may result in: (i) 
suspension, limitation, or termination of NIH funds for recombinant DNA research 
at the institution, or (ii) a requirement for prior NIH approval of any or all 
recombinant DNA projects at the institution. 
Information concerning noncompliance with the NIH Guidelines may be brought 
forward by any person. It should be delivered to both NIH/ORDA and the relevant 
institution. The institution, generally through the Institutional Biosafety Committee, 
shall take appropriate action. The institution shall forward a complete report of the 
incident recommending any further action to the Office of Recombinant DNA 
Activities, National Institutes of Health, Building 31, Room 4B11, Bethesda, 
Maryland 20892, (301) 496-9838. 
In cases where NIH proposes to suspend, limit, or terminate financial assistance 
because of noncompliance with the NIH Guidelines, applicable DHHS and Public 
Health Service procedures shall govern. 


Section IV-E. Voluntary Compliance 
Section IV-E-1. Basic Policy 


Individuals, corporations, and institutions not otherwise covered by the NIH 
Guidelines are encouraged to do so by following the standards and procedures set 
forth in Sections I through IV. In order to simplify discussion, references hereafter 
to ``institutions'' are intended to encompass corporations and individuals who have 
no organizational affiliation. For purposes of complying with the NIH Guidelines, an 
individual intending to carry out research involving recombinant DNA is encouraged 
to affiliate with an institution that has an Institutional Biosafety Committee 
approved under the NIH Guidelines. 
Since commercial organizations have special concerns, such as protection of 
proprietary data, some modifications and explanations of the procedures are 
provided in Sections IV-E-2 through IV-E-5-b in order to address these concerns. 


Section IV-E-2. Institutional Biosafety Committee Approval 


It should be emphasized that employment of an Institutional Biosafety Committee 
member solely for purposes of membership on the Institutional Biosafety Committee 
does not itself make the member an institutionally affiliated member. Except for 
the unaffiliated members, a member of an Institutional Biosafety Committee for an 
institution not otherwise covered by the NIH Guidelines may participate in the 
review and approval of a project in which the member has a direct financial interest 
so long as the member has not been, and does not expect to be, engaged in the 
project. Section IV-B-2-a-(4) is modified to that extent for purposes of these 
institutions.

Section IV-E-3. Certification of Host-Vector Systems 


A host-vector system may be proposed for certification by the NIH Director in accordance with the procedures set forth
in Appendix I-II. In order to ensure protection for proprietary data, any public notice regarding a host-vector system
which is designated by the institution as proprietary under Section IV-E-5-a will be issued only after
consultation with the institution as to the content of the notice. 


Section IV-E-4. Requests for Exemptions and Approvals 


Requests for exemptions or other approvals as required by the NIH Guidelines should be submitted based on the procedures
set forth in Sections I through IV. In order to ensure protection for proprietary data, any public notice regarding
a request for an exemption or other approval which is designated by the institution as proprietary under Section IV-E-5-a
will be issued only after consultation with the institution as to the content of the notice. 


Section IV-E-5. Protection of Proprietary Data 
Section IV-E-5-a. General 


In general, the Freedom of Information Act requires Federal agencies to make their records available to the public
upon request. However, this requirement does not apply to, among other things, ``trade secrets and commercial or
financial information that is obtained from a person and that is privileged or confidential.'' Under 18 U.S.C. 1905,
it is a criminal offense for an officer or employee of the U.S. or any Federal department or agency to publish, divulge,
disclose, or make known ``in any manner or to any extent not authorized by law any information coming to him in the course
of his employment or official duties or by reason of any examination or investigation made by, or return, report or
record made to or filed with, such department or agency or officer or employee thereof, which information concerns
or relates to the trade secrets, (or) processes_of any person, firm, partnership, corporation, or association.''
This provision applies to all employees of the Federal Government, including special Government employees. Members
of the RAC are ``special Government employees.'' 
In submitting to NIH for purposes of voluntary compliance with the NIH Guidelines, an institution may designate those
items of information which the institution believes constitute trade secrets, privileged, confidential, commercial,
or financial information. If NIH receives a request under the Freedom of Information Act for information so designated,
NIH will promptly contact the institution to secure its views as to whether the information (or some portion) should
be released. If the NIH decides to release this information (or some portion) in response to a Freedom of Information
request or otherwise, the institution will be advised; and the actual release will not be made until the expiration
of 15 days after the institution is so advised except to the extent that earlier release in the judgment of the NIH 
Director is necessary to protect against an imminent hazard to the public or the environment. 


Section IV-E-5-b. Presubmission Review 


Any institution not otherwise covered by the NIH Guidelines, which is considering submission of data or information
voluntarily to NIH, may request presubmission review of the records involved to determine if NIH will make all or part
of the records available upon request under the Freedom of Information Act. 
A request for presubmission review should be submitted to NIH/ORDA along with the records involved to the Office of
Recombinant DNA Activities, National Institutes of Health, Building 31, Room 4B11, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, (301)
496-9838. These records shall be clearly marked as being the property of the institution on loan to NIH solely
for the purpose of making a determination under the Freedom of Information Act. NIH/ORDA will seek a determination
from the responsible official under DHHS regulations (45 Code of Federal Regulations, Part 5) as to whether the records
involved, (or some portion) will be made available to members of the public under the Freedom of Information Act. Pending
such a determination, the records will be kept separate from NIH/ORDA files, will be considered records of the institution
and not NIH/ORDA, and will not be received as part of NIH/ORDA files. No copies will be made of such records.

NIH/ORDA will inform the institution of the DHHS Freedom of Information 
Officer's determination and follow the institution's instructions as to whether some or all of the records involved
are to be returned to the institution or to become a part of NIH/ORDA files. If the institution instructs NIH/ORDA to
return the records, no copies or summaries of the records will be made or retained by DHHS, NIH, or ORDA. The DHHS Freedom
of Information Officer's determination will represent that official's judgment at the time of the determination
as to whether the records involved (or some portion) would be exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information
Act if at the time of the determination the records were in NIH/ORDA files and a request was received for such files under
the Freedom of Information Act. 


Section V. Footnotes and References of Sections I Through IV


Section V-A. The original reference to organisms as Class 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 refers to the classification in the publication
Classification of Etiologic Agents on the Basis of Hazard, 4th Edition, July 1974, U.S. Department of Health, Education,
and Welfare, Public Health Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Office of Biosafety, Atlanta,
Georgia 30333. The NIH Director, with advice of the RAC, may revise the classification for the purposes of the NIH Guidelines
(see Section IV-C-1-b-(2)-(e)). The revised list of organisms in each class is reprinted in Appendix
B. 
Section V-B. Section III describes a number of places where judgments are to be made. In all these cases, the Principal
Investigator shall make the judgment on these matters as part of his/her responsibility to ``make the initial determination
of the required levels of physical and biological containment in accordance with the NIH Guidelines'' (see Section
IV-B-4-c-(1)). For cases falling under Sections III-A through III-D, this judgment is to
be reviewed and approved by the Institutional Biosafety Committee as part of its responsibility to make an ``independent
assessment of the containment levels required by the NIH Guidelines for the 
proposed research'' (see Section IV-B-2-b-(1)). The Institutional Biosafety 
Committee may refer specific cases to NIH/ORDA as part of NIH/ORDA's functions to ``provide advice to all within and
outside NIH'' (see Section IV-C-3). NIH/ORDA may request advice from the RAC as part of the RAC's responsibility

for ``interpreting the NIH Guidelines for experiments to which the NIH Guidelines do not specifically assign containment
levels'' (see Section IV-C-1-b-(2)-(f)).

importation, interstate movement, and release into the environment of certain 
organisms that are plant or animal pathogens, whether genetically engineered or 
not. Permits are required for veterinary biologics and for certain plants or 
microorganisms derived through genetic engineering using genetic sequences from 
plant pests (pathogens). Specific information about regulated organisms and 
procedures for obtaining a permit for regulated organisms may be obtained from the 
Director, Biotechnology, Biologics, and Environmental Protection, Animal and Plant

response to a vector-encoded microbial immunogen is the major goal, such an 
immune response has been demonstrated in model systems, and the persistence of 
the vector-encoded immunogen is not expected, are not covered under Sections 
III-A-2, III-B-2, or III-B-3. Such studies may be initiated without RAC review
and 
NIH approval if approved by another Federal agency. 
Section V-V. For recombinant DNA experiments in which the intent is to modify 
stably the genome of cells of one or more human subjects (see Sections III-A-2, III-B-2, and
III-B-3). 
Section V-W. In accordance with accepted scientific and regulatory practices of the 
discipline of plant pathology, an exotic plant pathogen (e.g., virus, bacteria, or 
fungus) is one that is unknown to occur within the U.S. (see Section V-R). 
Determination of whether a pathogen has a potential for serious detrimental impact 
on managed (agricultural, forest, grassland) or natural ecosystems should be made 
by the Principal Investigator and the Institutional Biosafety Committee, in 
consultation with scientists knowledgeable of plant diseases, crops, and ecosystems 
in the geographic area of the research.

Certain specified recombinant DNA molecules that ``consist entirely of DNA 
segments from different species that exchange DNA by known physiological 
processes, though one or more of the segments may be a synthetic equivalent are exempt from these NIH Guidelines (see
Section III-E-5). Institutional Biosafety Committee registration is not required for these exempt
experiments. A list of such exchangers will be prepared and periodically revised by the NIH Director with advice from
the RAC after appropriate notice and opportunity for public comment (see Section IV-C-1-b-(1)-(c)).
See Appendices A-I through A-VI for a list of natural exchangers that are exempt from the NIH Guidelines.''
Section III-E-5 describes recombinant DNA molecules that are: (1) composed entirely of DNA segments
from one or more of the organisms within a sublist, and (2) to be propagated in any of the organisms within a sublist (see
Classification of Bergey's Manual of Determinative Bacteriology; 8th edition, R. E. Buchanan and N. E. Gibbons,
editors, Williams and Wilkins Company; Baltimore, Maryland 1984). Although these experiments are exempt, it is
recommended that they be performed at the appropriate biosafety level for the host or recombinant organism (see Biosafety
in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories, 3rd edition, May 1993, U.S. DHHS, Public Health Service, Centers
for Disease Control, Atlanta, Georgia, and NIH Office of Biosafety, Bethesda, Maryland).

Appendix C. Exemptions Under Section III-E-6 



Section III-E-6 states that exempt from these NIH Guidelines are ``those that do not present a significant
risk to health or the environment (see Section IV-C-1-b-(1)-(c)), as determined by
the NIH Director, with the advice of the RAC, and following appropriate notice and opportunity for public comment.
See Appendix C for other classes of experiments which are exempt from the NIH Guidelines.'' The following classes
of experiments are exempt under Section III-E-6: 



Appendix C-I. Recombinant DNA in Tissue Culture 



Recombinant DNA molecules containing less than one-half of any eukaryotic viral genome (all viruses from a single
family (see Appendix C-VI-D) being considered identical (see Appendix C-VI-E), that are
propagated and maintained in cells in tissue culture are exempt from these NIH Guidelines with the exceptions listed
in Appendix C-I-A. 



Appendix C-I-A. Exceptions 



The following categories are not exempt from the NIH Guidelines: (i) experiments described in Section III-A
which require specific RAC review and NIH and Institutional Biosafety Committee approval before initiation, (ii)
experiments described in Section III-B which require NIH/ORDA and Institutional Biosafety Committee approval
before initiation, (iii) experiments involving DNA from Class 3, 4, or 5 organisms (see Appendix C-VI-A)
or cells known to be infected with these agents, (iv) experiments involving the deliberate introduction of genes
coding for the biosynthesis of molecules that are toxic for vertebrates (see Appendix F), and (v) whole plants regenerated
from plant cells and tissue cultures are covered by the 
exemption provided they remain axenic cultures even though they differentiate into embryonic tissue and regenerate
into plantlets. 



Appendix C-II. 

Escherichia coli 

K-12 Host-Vector Systems 



Experiments which use 

Escherichia coli 

K-12 host-vector systems, with the exception of those experiments listed in Appendix C-II-A, are
exempt from the NIH Guidelines provided that: (i) the 

Escherichia coli 

host does not contain conjugation proficient plasmids or generalized transducing phages; or (ii) lambda or lambdoid
or Ff bacteriophages or non-conjugative plasmids (see Appendix C-VI-B) shall be used as vectors. However,
experiments involving the insertion into 

Escherichia coli 

K-12 of DNA from prokaryotes that exchange genetic information (see Appendix C-VI-C) 
with Escherichia coli may be performed with any Escherichia coli K-12 vector (e.g., conjugative plasmid).
When a non-conjugative vector is used, the 

Escherichia coli 

K-12 host may contain conjugation-proficient plasmids either autonomous or integrated, or generalized transducing
phages. For these exempt laboratory experiments, Biosafety Level (BL) 1 physical containment conditions are recommended.
For large scale fermentation experiments, the appropriate physical containment conditions need be no greater than
those for the host organism unmodified by recombinant DNA techniques; the Institutional Biosafety Committee can
specify higher containment if deemed necessary. 



Appendix C-II-A. Exceptions 



The following categories of experiments are not exempt from the NIH Guidelines: (i) experiments described in Section
III-A which require Institutional Biosafety Committee approval, RAC review, and NIH approval before initiation,
(ii) experiments described in Section III-B which require Institutional Biosafety Committee and NIH/ORDA
approval before initiation, (iii) experiments involving DNA from Class 3, 4, or 5 organisms (see Appendix C-VI-A)
or cells known to be infected with these agents may be conducted under containment conditions specified in Section
III-C-2 with prior Institutional Biosafety Committee review and approval, (iv) large scale experiments
(e.g., more than 10 liters of culture), and (v) experiments involving the cloning of toxin molecule genes coding for
the biosynthesis of molecules toxic for vertebrates (see Appendix F).

Appendix C-III. Saccharomyces Host-Vector Systems 



Experiments involving 

Saccharomyces cerevisiae 

and 

Saccharomyces uvarum 

host-vector systems, with the exception of experiments listed in Appendix C-III-A, are exempt from the NIH Guidelines.
For these exempt experiments, BL1 physical containment is recommended. For large scale fermentation experiments,
the appropriate physical containment conditions need be no greater than those for the host organism unmodified by
recombinant DNA techniques; the Institutional Biosafety Committee can specify higher containment if deemed necessary.




Appendix C-III-A. Exceptions 



The following categories are not exempt from the NIH Guidelines: (i) Experiments described in Section III-A which
require Institutional Biosafety Committee approval, RAC review, and NIH approval before initiation, (ii) experiments
described in Section III-B which require Institutional Biosafety Committee and NIH/ORDA approval before initiation,

Appendix F. Containment Conditions for Cloning of Genes Coding for the Biosynthesis of Molecules Toxic for Vertebrates




Appendix F-I. General Information 



Appendix F specifies the containment to be used for the deliberate cloning of genes coding for the biosynthesis of
molecules toxic for vertebrates. The cloning of genes coding for molecules toxic for vertebrates that have an LD

50

 of <100 nanograms per kilograms body weight (e.g., microbial toxins such as the botulinum toxins, tetanus toxin,
diphtheria toxin, 

Shigella dysenteriae

 neurotoxin) are covered under Section III-B-1 and require Institutional Biosafety Committee and NIH/ORDA
approval before initiation. No specific restrictions shall apply to the cloning of genes if the protein specified
by the gene has an LD

50

 "100 micrograms per kilograms of body weight. Experiments involving genes coding for toxin molecules with an LD

50

 of <100 micrograms per kilograms and >100 nanograms per kilograms body weight require Institutional Biosafety
Committee approval and registration with NIH/ORDA prior to initiating the experiments. A list of toxin molecules
classified as to LD

50

 is available from NIH/ORDA. Testing procedures for determining toxicity of toxin molecules not on the list are available
from the Office of Recombinant DNA Activities, National Institutes of Health, Building 31, Room 4B11, Bethesda,
Maryland 20892, (301) 496-9838. The results of such tests shall be forwarded to NIH/ORDA, which will consult
with 

ad hoc

 experts, prior to inclusion of the molecules on the list (see Section IV-C-1-b-(2)-(e)).




Appendix F-II. Cloning of Toxin Molecule Genes in Escherichia coli K-12 



Appendix F-II-A. Cloning of genes coding for molecules toxic for vertebrates that have an LD

50

 of >100 nanograms per kilograms and <1000 nanograms per kilograms body weight (e.g., abrin, 

Clostridium perfringens 

epsilon toxin) may proceed under Biosafety Level (BL) 2 + EK2 or BL3 + EK1 containment conditions. 

Appendix F-II-B. Cloning of genes for the biosynthesis of molecules toxic for vertebrates that have an

Appendix G. Physical Containment 



Appendix G specifies physical containment for standard laboratory experiments and defines Biosafety Level 1 through
Biosafety Level 4. For large scale (over 10 liters) research or production, Appendix K supersedes Appendix G. Appendix
K defines Good Large Scale Practice through Biosafety Level 3_Large Scale. For certain work with plants, Appendix
P supersedes Appendix G. Appendix P defines Biosafety Levels 1 through 4_Plants. For certain work with animals, Appendix
Q supersedes Appendix G. Appendix Q defines Biosafety Levels 1 through 4_Animals. 



Appendix G-I. Standard Practices and Training 



The first principle of containment is strict adherence to good microbiological practices (see Appendices G-III-A
through G-III-J). Consequently, all personnel directly or indirectly involved in experiments using
recombinant DNA shall receive adequate instruction (see Sections IV-B-1-e and IV-B-4-d).
At a minimum, these instructions include training in aseptic techniques and in the biology of the organisms used in
the experiments so that the potential biohazards can be understood and appreciated. 

Any research group working with agents that are known or potential biohazards shall have an emergency plan that describes
the procedures to be followed if an accident contaminates personnel or the environment. The Principal Investigator
shall ensure that everyone in the laboratory is familiar with both the potential hazards of the work and the emergency
plan (see Sections IV-B-4-d and IV-B-4-e). If a research group is working with
a known pathogen for which there is an effective vaccine, the vaccine should be made available to all workers. Serological
monitoring, when clearly appropriate, will be provided (see Section IV-B-1-f).

The Laboratory Safety Monograph (see Appendix G-III-O) and Biosafety in 
Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories (see Appendix G-III-B) describe 
practices, equipment, and facilities in detail. 




Appendix G-II. Physical Containment Levels 





The objective of physical containment is to confine organisms containing 
recombinant DNA molecules and to reduce the potential for exposure of the 
laboratory worker, persons outside of the laboratory, and the environment to 
organisms containing recombinant DNA molecules. Physical containment is 
achieved through the use of laboratory practices, containment equipment, and 
special laboratory design. Emphasis is placed on primary means of physical 
containment which are provided by laboratory practices and containment equipment. 
Special laboratory design provides a secondary means of protection against the 
accidental release of organisms outside the laboratory or to the environment. 
Special laboratory design is used primarily in facilities in which experiments of 
moderate to high potential hazard are performed. 



Combinations of laboratory practices, containment equipment, and special 
laboratory design can be made to achieve different levels of physical containment. 
Four levels of physical containment, which are designated as BL1, BL2, BL3, and 
BL4 are described. It should be emphasized that the descriptions and assignments 
of physical containment detailed below are based on existing approaches to 
containment of pathogenic organisms (see Appendix G-III-B). The National Cancer 
Institute describes three levels for research on oncogenic viruses which roughly 
correspond to our BL2, BL3, and BL4 levels (see Appendix G-III-C). 



It is recognized that several different combinations of laboratory practices, 
containment equipment, and special laboratory design may be appropriate for 
containment of specific research activities. The NIH Guidelines, therefore, allow 
alternative selections of primary containment equipment within facilities that have 
been designed to provide BL3 and BL4 levels of physical containment. The 
selection of alternative methods of primary containment is dependent, however, on 
the level of biological containment provided by the host-vector system used in the 
experiment. Consideration will be given by the NIH Director, with the advice of the 
RAC to other combinations which achieve an equivalent level of containment (see 
Section IV-C-1-b-(2)-(c)).

Only needle-locking syringes or disposable syringe-needle units (i.e., needle is 
integral to the syringe) are used for the injection or aspiration of fluids containing 
organisms that contain recombinant DNA molecules. Extreme caution should be 
used when handling needles and syringes to avoid autoinoculation and the 
generation of aerosols during use and disposal. Needles should not be bent, 
sheared, replaced in the needle sheath or guard, or removed from the syringe 
following use. The needle and syringe should be promptly placed in a 
puncture-resistant container and decontaminated, preferably autoclaved, before 
discard or reuse.

Special Practices (BL3) Appendix G-II-C-2-a. Laboratory doors are kept closed when experiments are in progress.


Appendix G-II-C-2-b. Contaminated materials that are to be decontaminated at a site away from the laboratory
are placed in a durable leak-proof container which is closed before being removed from the laboratory. 

Appendix G-II-C-2-c. The Principal Investigator controls access to the laboratory and restricts access to
persons whose presence is required for program or support purposes. The Principal Investigator has the final responsibility
for assessing each circumstance and determining who may enter or work in the laboratory. 

Appendix G-II-C-2-d. The Principal Investigator establishes policies and procedures whereby only persons
who have been advised of the potential biohazard, who meet any specific entry requirements (e.g., immunization),
and who comply with all entry and exit procedures entering the laboratory or animal rooms. 

Appendix G-II-C-2-e. When organisms containing recombinant DNA molecules or experimental animals are present
in the laboratory or containment module, a hazard warning sign incorporating the universal biosafety symbol is posted
on all laboratory and animal room access doors. The hazard warning sign identifies the agent, lists the name and telephone
number of the Principal Investigator or other responsible person(s), and indicates any special requirements for
entering the laboratory such as the need for immunizations, respirators, or other personal protective measures.


Appendix G-II-C-2-f. All activities involving organisms containing recombinant DNA molecules are conducted
in biological safety cabinets or other physical containment devices within the containment module. No work in open
vessels is conducted on the open bench. 

Appendix G-II-C-2-g. The work surfaces of biological safety cabinets and other containment equipment are
decontaminated when work with organisms containing recombinant DNA molecules is finished. Plastic-backed paper
toweling used on non-perforated work surfaces within biological safety cabinets facilitates clean-up. 

Appendix G-II-C-2-h. An insect and rodent program is in effect. 

Appendix G-II-C-2-i. Laboratory clothing that protects street clothing (e.g., solid front or wrap-around
gowns, scrub suits, coveralls) is worn in the laboratory. Laboratory clothing is not worn outside the laboratory,
and it is decontaminated prior to laundering or disposal.

should be worn when handling infected animals and when skin contact with infectious materials is unavoidable. 

Appendix G-II-C-2-k. Molded surgical masks or respirators are worn in rooms containing experimental animals.


Appendix G-II-C-2-l. Animals and plants not related to the work being conducted are not permitted in the laboratory.


Appendix G-II-C-2-m. Laboratory animals held in a BL3 area shall be housed in partial-containment caging systems,
such as Horsfall units (see Appendix G-III-K), open cages placed in ventilated enclosures, solid-wall and -bottom
cages covered by filter bonnets or solid-wall and -bottom cages placed on holding racks equipped with ultraviolet
in radiation lamps and reflectors.

 




Note: 

Conventional caging systems may be used provided that all personnel wear appropriate personal protective devices.
These protective devices shall include at a minimum wrap-around gowns, head covers, gloves, shoe covers, and respirators.
All personnel shall shower on exit from areas where these devices are required.

Appendix G-II-C-2-p. Hypodermic needles and syringes are used only for parenteral injection
and aspiration of fluids from laboratory animals and diaphragm bottles. Only needle locking syringes or disposable
syringe-needle units (i.e., needle is integral to the syringe) are used for the injection or aspiration of fluids
containing organisms that contain recombinant DNA molecules. Extreme caution should be used when handling needles
and syringes to avoid autoinoculation and the generation of aerosols during use and disposal. Needles should not
be bent, sheared, replaced in the needle sheath or guard, or removed from the syringe following use. The needle and
syringe should be promptly placed in a puncture-resistant container and decontaminated, preferably by autoclaving,
before discard or reuse. 

Appendix G-II-C-2-q. Spills and accidents which result in overt or potential exposures to
organisms containing recombinant DNA molecules are immediately reported to the Biological Safety Officer, Institutional
Biosafety Committee, and NIH/ORDA. Reports to NIH/ORDA shall be sent to the Office of Recombinant DNA Activities,
National Institutes of Health, Building 31, Room 4B11, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, (301) 496-9838. Appropriate
medical evaluation, surveillance, and treatment are provided and written records are maintained. 

Appendix G-II-C-2-r. Baseline serum samples for all laboratory and other at-risk personnel
should be collected and stored. Additional serum specimens may be collected periodically depending on the agents
handled or the function of the laboratory. 

Appendix G-II-C-2-s. A biosafety manual is prepared or adopted. Personnel are advised of
special hazards and are required to read and follow the instructions on practices and procedures. 



Appendix G-II-C-2-t. Alternative Selection of Containment Equipment (BL3) 

 Experimental procedures involving a host-vector system that provides a one-step higher level of biological containment
than that specified may be conducted in the BL3 laboratory using containment equipment specified for the BL2 level
of physical containment. Experimental procedures involving a host-vector system that provides a one-step lower
level of biological containment than that specified may be conducted in the BL3 laboratory using containment equipment
specified for the BL4 level of physical containment. Alternative combination of containment safeguards are shown
in Appendix G-Table 1. 



Appendix G-II-C-3. Containment Equipment (BL3).

 Appendix G-II-C-3-a. Biological safety cabinets (Class I, II, or III) (see Appendix G-III-L)
or other appropriate combinations of personal protective or physical containment devices (e.g., special protective
clothing, masks, gloves, respirators, centrifuge safety cups, sealed centrifuge rotors, and containment caging
for animals) are used for all activities with organisms containing recombinant DNA molecules which pose a threat
of aerosol exposure. These include: manipulation of cultures and of those clinical or environmental materials which
may be a source of aerosols; the aerosol challenge of experimental animals; the harvesting of infected tissues or
fluids from experimental animals and embryonate eggs; and the necropsy of experimental animals. 



Appendix G-II-C-4. Laboratory Facilities (BL3)

 Appendix G-II-C-4-a. The laboratory is separated from areas which are open to unrestricted
traffic flow within the building. Passage through two sets of doors is the basic requirement for entry into the laboratory
from access corridors or other contiguous areas. Physical separation of the high containment laboratory from access
corridors or other laboratories or activities may be provided by a double-doored clothes change room (showers may
be included), airlock, or other access facility which requires passage through two sets of doors before entering
the laboratory. 

Appendix G-II-C-4-b. The interior surfaces of walls, floors, and ceilings are water resistant
so that they can be easily cleaned. Penetrations in these surfaces are sealed or capable of being sealed to facilitate
decontaminating the area. 

Appendix G-II-C-4-c. Bench tops are impervious to water and resistant to acids, alkalis,
organic solvents, and moderate heat. 

Appendix G-II-C-4-d. Laboratory furniture is sturdy and spaces between benches, cabinets,
and equipment are accessible for cleaning.

or automatically operated and is located near the laboratory exit door. 

Appendix G-II-C-4-f. Windows in the laboratory are closed and sealed. 

Appendix G-II-C-4-g. Access doors to the laboratory or containment module are self-closing.


Appendix G-II-C-4-h. An autoclave for decontaminating laboratory wastes is available preferably
within the laboratory. 

Appendix G-II-C-4-i. A ducted exhaust air ventilation system is provided. This system creates
directional airflow that draws air into the laboratory through the entry area. The exhaust air is not recirculated
to any other area of the building, is discharged to the outside, and is dispersed away from the occupied areas and air
intakes. Personnel shall verify that the direction of the airflow (into the laboratory) is proper. The exhaust air
from the laboratory room may be discharged to the outside without being filtered or otherwise treated. 

Appendix G-II-C-4-j. The high efficiency particulate air/HEPA filtered exhaust air from
Class I or Class II biological safety cabinets is discharged directly to the outside or through the building exhaust
system. Exhaust air from Class I or II biological safety cabinets may be recirculated within the laboratory if the
cabinet is tested and certified at least every twelve months. If the HEPA-filtered exhaust air from Class I or II biological
safety cabinets is to be discharged to the outside through the building exhaust air system, it is connected to this
system in a manner (e.g., thimble unit connection (see Appendix G-III-L)) that avoids any interference
with the air balance of the cabinets or building exhaust system. 

Appendix G-II-D. Biosafety Level 4 (BL4) 

Appendix G-II-D-1. Standard Microbiological Practices (BL4) 

Appendix G-II-D-1-a. Work surfaces are decontaminated at least once a day and immediately

materials to be removed from the Class III cabinets or from the maximum containment laboratory in a viable or intact
state are transferred to a non-breakable, sealed primary container and then enclosed in a non-breakable, sealed
secondary container which is removed from the facility through a disinfectant dunk tank, fumigation chamber, or
an airlock designed for this purpose. 

Appendix G-II-D-2-b. No materials, except for biological materials that are to remain in
a viable or intact state, are removed from the maximum containment laboratory unless they have been autoclaved or
decontaminated before exiting the facility. Equipment or material which might be damaged by high temperatures or
steam is decontaminated by gaseous or vapor methods in an airlock or chamber designed for this purpose. 

Appendix G-II-D-2-c. Only persons whose presence in the facility or individual laboratory
rooms is required for program or support purposes are authorized to enter. The supervisor has the final responsibility
for assessing each circumstance and determining who may enter or work in the laboratory. Access to the facility is
limited by means of secure, locked doors; accessibility is managed by the Principal Investigator, Biological Safety
Officer, or other persons responsible for the physical security of the facility. Before entering, persons are advised
of the potential biohazards and instructed as to appropriate safeguards for ensuring their safety. Authorized persons
comply with the instructions and all other applicable entry and exit procedures. A logbook signed by all personnel
indicates the date and time of each entry and exit. Practical and effective protocols for emergency situations are
established. 

Appendix G-II-D-2-d. Personnel enter and exit the facility only through the clothing change
and shower rooms. Personnel shower each time they exit the facility. Personnel use the air locks to enter or exit the
laboratory only in an emergency. 

Appendix G-II-D-2-e. Street clothing is removed in the outer clothing change room and kept
there. Complete laboratory clothing (may be disposable), including undergarments, pants and shirts or jump suits,
shoes, and gloves, is provided and used by all personnel entering the facility. Head covers are provided for personnel
who do not wash their hair during the exit shower. When exiting the laboratory and before proceeding into the shower
area, personnel remove their laboratory clothing and store it in a locker or hamper in the inner change room. Protective
clothing shall be decontaminated prior to laundering or disposal. 

Appendix G-II-D-2-f. When materials that contain organisms containing recombinant DNA
molecules or experimental animals are present in the laboratory or animal rooms, a hazard warning sign incorporating
the universal biosafety symbol is posted on all access doors. The sign identifies the agent, lists the name of the Principal
Investigator or other responsible person(s), and indicates any special requirements for entering the area (e.g.,
the need for immunizations or respirators). 

Appendix G-II-D-2-g. Supplies and materials needed in the facility are brought in by way of
the double-doored autoclave, fumigation chamber, or airlock which is appropriately decontaminated between each
use. After securing the outer doors, personnel within the facility retrieve the materials by opening the interior

Appendix G-II-D-2-i. Materials (e.g., plants, animals, and clothing) not related to the
experiment being conducted are not permitted in the facility. 
Appendix G-II-D-2-j. Hypodermic needles and syringes are used only for parenteral injection
and aspiration of fluids from laboratory animals and diaphragm bottles. Only needle-locking syringes or disposable
syringe-needle units (i.e., needle is integral part of unit) are used for the injection or aspiration of fluids containing
organisms that contain recombinant DNA molecules. Needles should not be bent, sheared, replaced in the needle sheath
or guard, or removed from the syringe following use. The needle and syringe should be placed in a puncture-resistant
container and decontaminated, preferably by autoclaving before discard or reuse. Whenever possible, cannulas
are used instead of sharp needles (e.g., gavage). 
Appendix G-II-D-2-k. A system is set up for reporting laboratory accidents, exposures, employee
absenteeism, and for the medical surveillance of potential laboratory-associated illnesses. Spills and accidents
which result in overt exposures to organisms containing recombinant DNA molecules are immediately reported to the
Biological Safety Officer, Institutional Biosafety Committee, and NIH/ORDA. Reports to the NIH/ORDA shall be sent
to the Office of Recombinant DNA Activities, National Institutes of Health, Building 31, Room 4B11, Bethesda, Maryland
20892, (301) 496-9838. Written records are prepared and maintained. An essential adjunct to such a reporting-surveillance
system is the availability of a facility for quarantine, isolation, and medical care of personnel with potential
or known laboratory associated illnesses. 
Appendix G-II-D-2-l. Laboratory animals involved in experiments requiring BL4 level physical
containment shall be housed either in cages contained in Class III cabinets or in partial containment caging systems,
such as Horsfall units (see Appendix G-III-K), open cages placed in ventilated enclosures, or solid-wall
and- bottom cages placed on holding racks equipped with ultraviolet irradiation lamps and reflectors that are located
in a specially designed area in which all personnel are required to wear one-piece positive pressure suits. 


Appendix G-II-D-2-m. Alternative Selection of Containment Equipment (BL4) 


Experimental procedures involving a host-vector system that provides a one-step higher level of biological containment
than that specified may be conducted in the BL4 facility using containment equipment requirements specified for
the BL3 level of physical containment. Alternative combinations of containment safeguards are shown in Appendix
G_Table 1. 


Appendix G-II-D-3. Containment Equipment (BL4). 

Appendix G-II-D-3-a. All procedures within the facility with agents assigned to Biosafety
Level 4 are conducted in the Class III biological safety cabinet or in Class I or II biological safety cabinets used
in conjunction with one-piece positive pressure personnel suits ventilated by a life-support system. 


Appendix G-II-D-4. Laboratory Facilities (BL4). 

Appendix G-II-D-4-a. The maximum containment facility consists of either a separate building
or a clearly demarcated and isolated zone within a building. Outer and inner change rooms separated by a shower are
provided for personnel entering and exiting the facility. A double-doored autoclave, fumigation chamber, or ventilated
airlock is provided for passage of those materials, supplies, or equipment which are not brought into the facility
through the change room. 
Appendix G-II-D-4-b. Walls, floors, and ceilings of the facility are constructed to form
a sealed internal shell which facilitates fumigation and is animal and insect proof. The internal surfaces of this
shell are resistant to liquids and chemicals, thus facilitating cleaning and decontamination of the area. All penetrations
in these structures and surfaces are sealed. Any drains in the floors contain traps filled with a chemical disinfectant
of demonstrated efficacy against the target agent, and they are connected directly to the liquid waste decontamination
system. Sewer and other ventilation lines contain high efficiency particulate air/HEPA filters.

Appendix G-II-D-4-c. Internal facility appurtenances, such as light fixtures, air ducts,
and utility pipes, are arranged to minimize the horizontal surface area on which dust can settle. 
Appendix G-II-D-4-d. Bench tops have seamless surfaces which are impervious to water and
resistant to acids, alkalis, organic solvents, and moderate heat. 
Appendix G-II-D-4-e. Laboratory furniture is simple and of sturdy construction; and spaces
between benches, cabinets, and equipment are accessible for cleaning. 
Appendix G-II-D-4-f. A foot, elbow, or automatically operated hand washing sink is provided
near the door of each laboratory room in the facility. 
Appendix G-II-D-4-g. If there is a central vacuum system, it does not serve areas outside the
facility. In-line high efficiency particulate air/HEPA filters are placed as near as practicable to each use point
or service cock. Filters are installed to permit in-place decontamination and replacement. Other liquid and gas
services to the facility are protected by devices that prevent back-flow. 
Appendix G-II-D-4-h. If water fountains are provided, they are foot operated and are located
in the facility corridors outside the laboratory. The water service to the fountain is not connected to the back-flow
protected distribution system supplying water to the laboratory areas. 
Appendix G-II-D-4-i. Access doors to the laboratory are self-closing and locking. 
Appendix G-II-D-4-j. Any windows are breakage resistant. 
Appendix G-II-D-4-k. A double-doored autoclave is provided for decontaminating materials
passing out of the facility. The autoclave door which opens to the area external to the facility is sealed to the outer
wall and automatically controlled so that the outside door can only be opened after the autoclave ``sterilization''
cycle has been completed. 
Appendix G-II-D-4-l. A pass-through dunk tank, fumigation chamber, or an equivalent decontamination
method is provided so that materials and equipment that cannot be decontaminated in the autoclave can be safely removed
from the facility. 
Appendix G-II-D-4-m. Liquid effluent from laboratory sinks, biological safety cabinets,
floors, and autoclave chambers are decontaminated by heat treatment before being released from the maximum containment
facility. Liquid wastes from shower rooms and toilets may be decontaminated with chemical disinfectants or by heat
in the liquid waste decontamination system. The procedure used for heat decontamination of liquid wastes is evaluated
mechanically and biologically by using a recording thermometer and an indicator microorganism with a defined heat
susceptibility pattern. If liquid wastes from the shower room are decontaminated with chemical disinfectants,
the chemical used is of demonstrated efficacy against the target or indicator microorganisms. 
Appendix G-II-D-4-n. An individual supply and exhaust air ventilation system is provided.
The system maintains pressure differentials and directional airflow as required to assure flows inward from areas
outside of the facility toward areas of highest potential risk within the facility. Manometers are used to sense pressure
differentials between adjacent areas maintained at different pressure levels. If a system malfunctions, the manometers
sound an alarm. The supply and exhaust airflow is interlocked to assure inward (or zero) airflow at all times. 
Appendix G-II-D-4-o. The exhaust air from the facility is filtered through high efficiency
particulate air/HEPA filters and discharged to the outside so that it is dispersed away from occupied buildings and
air intakes. Within the facility, the filters are located as near the laboratories as practicable in order to reduce
the length of potentially contaminated air ducts. The filter chambers are designed to allow in situ decontamination
before filters are removed and to facilitate certification testing after they are replaced. Coarse filters and HEPA
filters are provided to treat air supplied to the facility in order to increase the lifetime of the exhaust HEPA filters
and to protect the supply air system should air pressures become unbalanced in the laboratory. 
Appendix G-II-D-4-p. The treated exhaust air from Class I and II biological safety cabinets
may be discharged into the laboratory room environment or the outside through the facility air exhaust system. If
exhaust air from Class I or II biological safety cabinets is discharged into the laboratory the cabinets are tested
and certified at six-month intervals. The exhaust air from Class III biological safety cabinets is discharged, without
recirculation through two sets of high efficiency particulate air/HEPA filters in series, via the facility exhaust
air system. If the treated exhaust air from any of these cabinets is discharged to the outside through the facility
exhaust air system, it is connected to this system in a manner (e.g., thimble unit connection (see Appendix G-III-L))
that avoids any interference with the air balance of the cabinets or the facility exhaust air system. 
Appendix G-II-D-4-q. A specially designed suit area may be provided in the facility. Personnel
who enter this area shall wear a one-piece positive pressure suit that is ventilated by a life-support system. The
life-support system includes alarms and emergency backup breathing air tanks. Entry to this area is through an airlock
fitted with airtight doors. A chemical shower is provided to decontaminate the surface of the suit before the worker
exits the area. The exhaust air from the suit area is filtered by two sets of high efficiency particulate air/HEPA filters
installed in series. A duplicate filtration unit, exhaust fan, and an automatically starting emergency power source
are provided. The air pressure within the suit area is greater than that of any adjacent area. Emergency lighting and
communication systems are provided. All penetrations into the internal shell of the suit are sealed. A double-doored
autoclave is provided for decontaminating waste materials to be removed from the suit areas.

Appendix G-III-L. Biological safety cabinets referred to in this section are classified 
as Class I, Class II, or Class III cabinets. A Class I is a ventilated cabinet for 
personnel protection having an inward flow of air away from the operator. The 
exhaust air from this cabinet is filtered through a high efficiency particulate 
air/HEPA filter. This cabinet is used in three operational modes: (i) with a 
full-width open front, (ii) with an installed front closure panel (having four 6-inch 
diameter openings) without gloves, and (iii) with an installed front closure panel 
equipped with arm-length rubber gloves. The face velocity of the inward flow of air 
through the full-width open front is 75 feet per minute or greater. A Class II 
cabinet is a ventilated cabinet for personnel and product protection having an open 
front with inward air flow for personnel protection, and HEPA filtered mass 
recirculated air flow for product protection. The cabinet exhaust air is filtered 
through a HEPA filter. The face velocity of the inward flow of air through the 
full-width open front is 75 feet per minute or greater. Design and performance 
specifications for Class II cabinets have been adopted by the National Sanitation 
Foundation, Ann Arbor, Michigan. A Class III cabinet is a closed-front ventilated 
cabinet of gas tight construction which provides the highest level of personnel 
protection of all biosafety safety cabinets. The interior of the cabinet is protected 
from contaminants exterior to the cabinet. The cabinet is fitted with arm-length 
rubber gloves and is operated under a negative pressure of at least 0.5 inches water 
gauge. All supply air is filtered through HEPA filters. Exhaust air is filtered 
through two HEPA filters or one HEPA filter and incinerator before being 
discharged to the outside environment. National Sanitation Foundation Standard 
49. 1976. Class II (Laminar Flow) Biohazard Cabinetry, Ann Arbor, Michigan. 

Appendix G-III-M. Biosafety Level 1 is suitable for work involving agents of 
unknown or minimal potential hazard to laboratory personnel and the environment. 
The laboratory is not separated from the general traffic patterns in the building. 
Work is generally conducted on open bench tops. Special containment equipment is 
not required or generally used. Laboratory personnel have specific training in the 
procedures conducted in the laboratory and are supervised by a scientist with 
general training in microbiology or a related science (see Appendix G-III-B). 

Appendix G-III-N. Biosafety Level 2 is similar to Level 1 and is suitable for work 
involving agents of moderate potential hazard to personnel and the environment. It 
differs in that: (1) laboratory personnel have specific training in handling 
pathogenic agents and are directed by competent scientists; (2) access to the 
laboratory is limited when work is being conducted; and (3) certain procedures in 
which infectious aerosols are created are conducted in biological safety cabinets or 
other physical containment equipment (see Appendix G-III-B). 

Appendix G-III-O. Office of Research Safety, National Cancer Institute, and the 
Special Committee of Safety and Health Experts, Laboratory Safety Monograph: A 
Supplement to the NIH Guidelines for Recombinant DNA Research, NIH, Bethesda, 
Maryland 1978. 

Appendix G-III-P. Biosafety Level 3 is applicable to clinical, diagnostic, teaching, 
research, or production facilities in which work is conducted with indigenous or 
exotic agents which may cause serious or potentially lethal disease as a result of 
exposure by the inhalation route. Laboratory personnel have specific training in 
handling pathogenic and potentially lethal agents and are supervised by competent 
scientists who are experienced in working with these agents. All procedures 
involving the manipulation of infectious material are conducted within biological 
safety cabinets or other physical containment devices or by personnel wearing 
appropriate personal protective clothing and devices. The laboratory has special 
engineering and design features. It is recognized, however, that many existing 
facilities may not have all the facility safeguards recommended for BL3 (e.g., access 
zone, sealed penetrations, and directional airflow, etc.). In these circumstances, 
acceptable safety may be achieved for routine or repetitive operations (e.g., 
diagnostic procedures involving the propagation of an agent for identification, 
typing, and susceptibility testing) in laboratories where facility features satisfy BL2 
recommendations provided the recommended ``Standard Microbiological Practices,'' 
``Special Practices,'' and ``Containment Equipment'' for BL3 are rigorously followed. 
The decision to implement this modification of BL3 recommendations should be 
made only by the Principal Investigator.

Appendix I. Biological Containment (See Appendix E) 



Appendix I-I. Levels of Biological Containment 



In consideration of biological containment, the vector (plasmid, organelle, or virus) 
for the recombinant DNA and the host (bacterial, plant, or animal cell) in which the 
vector is propagated in the laboratory will be considered together. Any combination 
of vector and host which is to provide biological containment shall be chosen or 
constructed so that the following types of ``escape'' are minimized: (i) survival of the 
vector in its host outside the laboratory, and (ii) transmission of the vector from the 
propagation host to other non-laboratory hosts. The following levels of biological 
containment (host-vector systems) for prokaryotes are established. Appendices I-I-A 
through I-II-B describe levels of biological containment (host-vector systems) for 
prokaryotes. Specific criteria will depend on the organisms to be used. 



Appendix I-I-A. Host-Vector 1 Systems 



Host-Vector 1 systems provide a moderate level of containment. Specific Host-Vector 1 systems are: 



Appendix I-I-A-1. Escherichia coli K-12 Host-Vector 1 Systems (EK1). 

The host is always 

Escherichia coli

 K-12 or a derivative thereof, and the vectors 
include non-conjugative plasmids (e.g., pSC101, Co1E1, or derivatives thereof (see 
Appendices I-III-A through G) and variants of bacteriophage, such as lambda (see 
Appendices I-III-H through O). The 

Escherichia coli

 K-12 hosts shall not contain 
conjugation-proficient plasmids, whether autonomous or integrated, or generalized 
transducing phages. 



Appendix I-I-A-2. Other Host-Vector 1 Systems. 

At a minimum, hosts and vectors shall be comparable in containment to 

Escherichia 
coli

 K-12 with a non-conjugative plasmid or bacteriophage vector. Appendix I-II 
describes the data to be considered and mechanism for approval of Host-Vector 1 
systems. 



Appendix I-I-B. Host-Vector 2 Systems 



Host-Vector 2 Systems provide a high level of biological containment as 
demonstrated by data from suitable tests performed in the laboratory. Escape of 
the recombinant DNA either via survival of the organisms or via transmission of 
recombinant DNA to other organisms should be <1/10

8

 under specified conditions. 
Specific Host-Vector 2 systems are: 

Appendix I-I-B-1. For 

Escherichia coli

 K-12 Host-Vector 2 systems (EK2) in which 
the vector is a plasmid, no more than 1/10

8

 host cells shall perpetuate a cloned 
DNA fragment under the specified non-permissive laboratory conditions designed to 
represent the natural environment, either by survival of the original host or as a 
consequence of transmission of the cloned DNA fragment.

Appendix I-I-B-2. For Escherichia coli K-12 Host-Vector 2 systems (EK2) in which the vector
is a phage, no more than 1/108 phage particles shall perpetuate a cloned DNA fragment under the specified non-permissive
laboratory conditions designed to represent the natural environment, either as a prophage (in the inserted or plasmid
form) in the laboratory host used for phage propagation, or survival in natural environments and transferring a cloned
DNA fragment to other hosts (or their resident prophages). 



Appendix I-II. Certification of Host-Vector Systems 





Appendix I-II-A. Responsibility. 

Host-Vector 1 systems (other than Escherichia coli K-12) and Host-Vector 2 systems may not be designated as
such until they have been certified by the NIH Director. Requests for certification of host-vector systems may be
submitted to the Office of Recombinant DNA Activities, National Institutes of Health, Building 31, room 4B11, Bethesda,
Maryland 20892, (301) 496-9838. Proposed host-vector systems will be reviewed by the RAC (see section IV-C-1-b-(1)-(e)).
Initial review will based on the construction, properties, and testing of the proposed host-vector system by a subcommittee
composed of one or more RAC members and/or 

ad hoc

 experts. The RAC will evaluate the subcommittee's report and any other available information at the next scheduled
RAC meeting. The NIH Director is responsible for certification of host-vector systems, following advice of the RAC.
Minor modifications to existing host-vector systems (i.e., those that are of minimal or no consequence to the properties
relevant to containment), may be certified by the NIH Director without prior RAC review (see section IV-C-1-b-(2)-(h)).
Once a host-vector system has been certified by the NIH Director, a notice of certification will be sent by NIH/ORDA
to the applicant and to the Institutional Biosafety Committee Chairs. A list of all currently certified host-vector
systems is available from the Office of Recombinant DNA Activities, National Institutes of Health, Building 31,
room 4B11, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, (301) 496-9838. The NIH Director may rescind the certification of a host-vector
system (see section IV-C-1-b-(2)-(i)). If certification is rescinded, NIH will instruct investigators to transfer
cloned DNA into a different system or use the clones at a higher level of physical containment level, unless NIH determines
that the already constructed clones incorporate adequate biological containment. Certification of an host-vector
system does not extend to modifications of either the host or vector component of that system. Such modified systems
shall be independently certified by the NIH Director. If modifications are minor, it may only be necessary for the
investigator to submit data showing that the modifications have either improved or not impaired the major phenotypic
traits on which the containment of the system depends. Substantial modifications to a certified host-vector system
requires submission of complete testing data.

Appendix I-II-B. Data To Be Submitted for Certification 





Appendix I-II-B-1. Host-Vector 1 Systems Other than Escherichia coli K-12. 

The following types of data shall be submitted, modified as appropriate for the particular system under consideration:
(i) a description of the organism and vector; the strain's natural habitat and growth requirements; its physiological
properties, particularly those related to its reproduction, survival, and the mechanisms by which it exchanges
genetic information; the range of organisms with which this organism normally exchanges genetic information and
the type of information is exchanged; and any relevant information about its pathogenicity or toxicity; (ii) a description
of the history of the particular strains and vectors to be used, including data on any mutations which render this organism
less able to survive or transmit genetic information; and (iii) a general description of the range of experiments
contemplated with emphasis on the need for developing such an Host-Vector 1 system. 



Appendix I-II-B-2. Host-Vector 2 Systems. 

Investigators planning to request Host-Vector 2 systems certification may obtain instructions from NIH/ORDA concerning
data to be submitted (see Appendices I-III-N and O). In general, the following types of data are required:
(i) description of construction steps with indication of source, properties, and manner of introduction of genetic
traits; (ii) quantitative data on the stability of genetic traits that contribute to the containment of the system;
(iii) data on the survival of the host-vector system under non-permissive laboratory conditions designed to represent
the relevant natural environment; (iv) data on transmissibility of the vector and/or a cloned DNA fragment under
both permissive and non-permissive conditions; (v) data on all other properties of the system which affect containment
and utility, including information on yields of phage or plasmid molecules, ease of DNA isolation, and ease of transfection
or transformation; and (vi) in some cases, the investigator may be asked to submit data on survival and vector transmissibility
from experiments in which the host-vector is fed to laboratory animals or one or more human subjects. Such in vivo data
may be required to confirm the validity of predicting in vivo survival on the basis of in vitro experiments. Data shall
be submitted 12 weeks prior to the RAC meeting at which such data will be considered by the Office of Recombinant DNA
Activities, National Institutes of Health, Building 31, room 4B11, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, (301) 496-9838.
Investigators are encouraged to publish their data on the construction, properties, and testing of proposed Host
Vector 2 systems prior to consideration of the system by the RAC and its subcommittee. Specific instructions concerning
the submission of data for proposed 

Escherichia coli

 K-12 Host-Vector 2 system (EK2) involving either plasmids or bacteriophage in 

Escherichia coli

 K-12, are available from the Office of Recombinant DNA Activities, National Institutes of Health, Building

Appendix J. Biotechnology Research Subcommittee 


The National Science and Technology Council's Committee on Fundamental 
Science determined that a subcommittee should be continued to identify and 
coordinate Federal research efforts, identify research needs, stimulating 
international cooperation, and assess national and international policy issues 
concerning biotechnology sciences. The primary emphasis will be on scientific issues 
to increase the overall effectiveness and productivity of the Federal investment in 
biotechnology sciences, especially regarding issues which cut across agency 
boundaries. This subcommittee is called the Biotechnology Research Subcommittee. 
Membership of the Biotechnology Research Subcommittee will include Federal 
agencies that support biotechnology research. Agencies represented are: U.S. 
Department of Agriculture, Department of Commerce, Department of Defense, 
Department of Energy, Department of Health and Human Services, Department of 
Interior, Department of Justice, Department of State, Department of Veterans 
Affairs, Agency for International Development, Environmental Protection Agency, 
National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and National Science Foundation. 
The Biotechnology Research Subcommittee will function in an advisory capacity to 
the Committee on Fundamental Science, the Director of the Office of Science and 
Technology Policy, and the Executive Office of the President. The Biotechnology 
Research Subcommittee will review the scientific aspects of proposed regulations 
and guidelines as they are developed.

The primary responsibilities of the Biotechnology Research Subcommittee are to: 
(i) Describe and review current Federal efforts in biotechnology research; (ii) 
identify and define the priority areas for future Federal biotechnology research, 
including areas needing greater emphasis, describing the role of each agency in 
those areas, and delineate where interagency cooperation would enhance progress in 
the biotechnology sciences, with an emphasis on integrated research efforts, where 
appropriate; (iii) assess major international efforts in the biotechnology sciences and 
develop mechanisms for international collaboration. For example, activities of the 
U.S.-European Community Task Force on Biotechnology have been coordinated 
through the Biotechnology Research Subcommittee; (iv) identify and review national 
and international policy issues (such as public education) associated with 
biotechnology; and (v) provide reviews, analyses, and recommendations to the 
Chairs of the Committee on Fundamental Science on scientific issues related to 
regulations and the applications of biotechnology research and biotechnology 
policies and issues. 
In 1990, the Biotechnology Research Subcommittee replaced the Biotechnology 
Sciences Coordinating Committee. Both the Biotechnology Research Subcommittee 
and the Biotechnology Sciences Coordinating Committee previously functioned 
under the Federal Coordinating Council on Science, Engineering, and Technology 
(FCCSET). While regulatory issues became the primary focus of the Biotechnology 
Sciences Coordinating Committee, the Biotechnology Research Subcommittee 
focuses on scientific issues, although it will still provide scientific support for 
regulatory responsibilities. 


Appendix K. Physical Containment for Large Scale Uses of 
Organisms Containing Recombinant DNA Molecules 


Appendix K specifies physical containment guidelines for large scale (greater than 
10 liters of culture) research or production involving viable organisms containing 
recombinant DNA molecules. It shall apply to large scale research or production 
activities as specified in Section III-C-6. It is important to note that this appendix 
addresses only the biological hazard associated with organisms containing 
recombinant DNA. Other hazards accompanying the large scale cultivation of such 
organisms (e.g., toxic properties of products; physical, mechanical, and chemical 
aspects of downstream processing) are not addressed and shall be considered 
separately, albeit in conjunction with this appendix. 
All provisions shall apply to large scale research or production activities with the 
following modifications: (i) Appendix K shall supersede Appendix G when 
quantities in excess of 10 liters of culture are involved in research or production. 
Appendix K-II applies to Good Large Scale Practice; (ii) the institution shall 
appoint a Biological Safety Officer if it engages in large scale research or production 
activities involving viable organisms containing recombinant DNA molecules. The 
duties of the Biological Safety Officer shall include those specified in Section 
IV-B-3; (iii) the institution shall establish and maintain a health surveillance 
program for personnel engaged in large scale research or production activities 
involving viable organisms containing recombinant DNA molecules which require 
Biosafety Level (BL) 3 containment at the laboratory scale. The program shall 
include: preassignment and periodic physical and medical examinations; collection, 
maintenance, and analysis of serum specimens for monitoring serologic changes that 
may result from the employee's work experience; and provisions for the investigation 
of any serious, unusual, or extended illnesses of employees to determine possible 
occupational origin. 


Appendix K-I. Selection of Physical Containment Levels 


The selection of the physical containment level required for recombinant DNA 
research or production involving more than 10 liters of culture is based on the 
containment guidelines established in Section III. For purposes of large scale 
research or production, four physical containment levels are established. The four 
levels set containment conditions at those appropriate for the degree of hazard to 
health or the environment posed by the organism, judged by experience with similar 
organisms unmodified by recombinant DNA techniques and consistent with Good 
Large Scale Practice. The four biosafety levels of large scale physical containment 
are referred to as Good Large Scale Practice, BL1-Large Scale, BL2-Large Scale, 
and BL3-Large Scale. Good Large Scale Practice is recommended for large scale 
research or production involving viable, non-pathogenic, and non-toxigenic 
recombinant strains derived from host organisms that have an extended history of 
safe large scale use. Good Large Scale Practice is recommended for organisms such 
as those included in Appendix C which have built-in environmental limitations that 
permit optimum growth in the large scale setting but limited survival without 
adverse consequences in the environment. BL1-Large Scale is recommended for 
large scale research or production of viable organisms containing recombinant DNA 
molecules that require BL1 containment at the laboratory scale and that do not 
qualify for Good Large Scale Practice. BL2-Large Scale is recommended for large 
scale research or production of viable organisms containing recombinant DNA 
molecules that require BL2 containment at the laboratory scale. BL3-Large Scale is 
recommended for large scale research or production of viable organisms containing 
recombinant DNA molecules that require BL3 containment at the laboratory scale. 
No provisions are made for large scale research or production of viable organisms 
containing recombinant DNA molecules that require BL4 containment at the 
laboratory scale. If necessary, these requirements will be established by NIH on an 
individual basis. 


Appendix K-II. Good Large Scale Practice (GLSP) 


Appendix K-II-A. Institutional codes of practice shall be formulated and 
implemented to assure adequate control of health and safety matters.

Office of Recombinant DNA Activities, National Institutes of Health, Building 31, 
Room 4B11, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, (301) 496-9838. Medical evaluation, 
surveillance, and treatment are provided as appropriate and written records are 
maintained. 

Appendix K-V-B. Cultures of viable organisms containing recombinant DNA 
molecules shall be handled in a closed system (e.g., closed vessels used for the 
propagation and growth of cultures) or other primary containment equipment (e.g., 
Class III biological safety cabinet containing a centrifuge used to process culture 
fluids) which is designed to prevent the escape of viable organisms. Volumes less 
than 10 liters may be handled outside of a closed system provided all physical 
containment requirements specified in Appendix G-II-C are met. 

Appendix K-V-C. Culture fluids (except as allowed in Appendix K-V-D) shall not 
be removed from a closed system or other primary containment equipment unless 
the viable organisms containing recombinant DNA molecules have been inactivated 
by a validated inactivation procedure. A validated inactivation procedure is one 
which has been demonstrated to be effective using the organisms that will serve as 
the host for propagating the recombinant DNA molecules. 

Appendix K-V-D. Sample collection from a closed system, the addition of materials 
to a closed system, and the transfer of culture fluids from one closed system to 
another shall be conducted in a manner which prevents the release of aerosols or 
contamination of exposed surfaces. 

Appendix K-V-E. Exhaust gases removed from a closed system or other primary 
containment equipment shall be treated by filters which have efficiencies equivalent 
to high efficiency particulate air/HEPA filters or by other equivalent procedures 
(e.g., incineration) to prevent the release of viable organisms containing 
recombinant DNA molecules to the environment. 

Appendix K-V-F. A closed system or other primary containment equipment that has 
contained viable organisms containing recombinant DNA molecules shall not be 
opened for maintenance or other purposes unless it has been sterilized by a 
validated sterilization procedure. A validated sterilization procedure is one which 
has been demonstrated to be effective using the organisms that will serve as the host 
for propagating the recombinant DNA molecules. 

Appendix K-V-G. A closed system used for the propagation and growth of viable 
organisms containing recombinant DNA molecules shall be operated so that the 
space above the culture level will be maintained at a pressure as low as possible, 
consistent with equipment design, in order to maintain the integrity of containment 
features. 

Appendix K-V-H. Rotating seals and other mechanical devices directly associated 
with a closed system used to contain viable organisms containing recombinant DNA 
molecules shall be designed to prevent leakage or shall be fully enclosed in 
ventilated housings that are exhausted through filters which have efficiencies 
equivalent to high efficiency particulate air/HEPA filters or through other 
equivalent treatment devices.

Appendix K-VI. Footnotes of Appendix K


Appendix K-VI-A. This table is derived from the text in Appendices G and K and is not to be used in lieu of Appendices
G and K.
Appendix K-VI-B. The criteria in this grid address only the biological hazards associated with organisms
containing recombinant DNA. Other hazards accompanying the large scale cultivation of such organisms (e.g., toxic
properties of products; physical, mechanical, and chemical aspects of downstream processing) are not addressed
and shall be considered separately, albeit in conjunction with this grid.


Appendix K-VII. Definitions to Accompany Containment Grid and Appendix K


Appendix K-VII-A. Accidental Release. An accidental release is the unintentional discharge of a microbiological
agent (i.e., microorganism or virus) or eukaryotic cell due to a failure in the containment system.
Appendix K-VII-B. Biological Barrier. A biological barrier is an impediment (naturally occurring or
introduced) to the infectivity and/or survival of a microbiological agent or eukaryotic cell once it has been released
into the environment.
Appendix K-VII-C. Closed System. A closed system is one in which by its design and proper operation, prevents
release of a microbiological agent or eukaryotic cell contained therein.
Appendix K-VII-D. Containment. Containment is the confinement of a microbiological agent or eukaryotic
cell that is being cultured, stored, manipulated, transported, or destroyed in order to prevent or limit its contact
with people and/or the environment. Methods used to achieve this include: physical and biological barriers and inactivation
using physical or chemical means.
Appendix K-VII-E. De minimis Release. 

De minimis

 release is the release of: (i) viable microbiological agents or eukaryotic cells that does not result in the establishment
of disease in healthy people, plants, or animals; or (ii) in uncontrolled proliferation of any microbiological agents
or eukaryotic cells.
Appendix K-VII-F. Disinfection. Disinfection is a process by which viable microbiological agents or
eukaryotic cells are reduced to a level unlikely to produce disease in healthy people, plants, or animals.
Appendix K-VII-G. Good Large Scale Practice Organism. For an organism to qualify for Good Large Scale
Practice consideration, it must meet the following criteria [Reference: Organization for Economic Cooperation
and Development, Recombinant DNA Safety Considerations, 1987, p. 34-35]: (i) the host organism should be non-pathogenic,
should not contain adventitious agents and should have an extended history of safe large scale use or have built-in
environmental limitations that permit optimum growth in the large scale setting but limited survival without adverse
consequences in the environment; (ii) the recombinant DNA-engineered organism should be non-pathogenic, should
be as safe in the large scale setting as the host organism, and without adverse consequences in the environment; and
(iii) the vector/insert should be well characterized and free from known harmful sequences; should be limited in
size as much as possible to the DNA required to perform the intended function; should not increase the stability of
the construct in the environment unless that is a requirement of the intended function; should be poorly mobilizable;
and should not transfer any resistance markers to microorganisms unknown to acquire them naturally if such acquisition
could compromise the use of a drug to control disease agents in human or veterinary medicine or agriculture.
Appendix K-VII-H. Inactivation. Inactivation is any process that destroys the ability of a specific
microbiological agent or eukaryotic cell to self-replicate.
Appendix K-VII-I. Incidental Release. An incidental release is the discharge of a microbiological agent
or eukaryotic cell from a containment system that is expected when the system is appropriately designed and properly
operated and maintained.

<TEXT>
 

Appendix K-VII-J. Minimization. Minimization is the design and operation of 
containment systems in order that any incidental release is a de minimis release. 
Appendix K-VII-K. Pathogen. A pathogen is any microbiological agent or 
eukaryotic cell containing sufficient genetic information, which upon expression of 
such information, is capable of producing disease in healthy people, plants, or 
animals. 
Appendix K-VII-L. Physical Barrier. A physical barrier is considered any 
equipment, facilities, or devices (e.g., fermentors, factories, filters, thermal 
oxidizers) which are designed to achieve containment. 
Appendix K-VII-M. Release. Release is the discharge of a microbiological agent 
or eukaryotic cell from a containment system. Discharges can be incidental or 
accidental. Incidental releases are de minimis in nature; accidental releases may be 
de minimis in nature. 


Appendix L. Release into the Environment of Certain Plants 


Appendix L-I. General Information 


Appendix L specifies conditions under which certain plants as specified below, may 
be approved for release into the environment. Experiments in this category cannot 
be initiated without submission of relevant information on the proposed 
experiment to NIH, review by the RAC Plant Subcommittee, and specific approval 
by the NIH Director. Such experiments also require the approval of the 
Institutional Biosafety Committee before initiation. 


Appendix L-II. Criteria Allowing Review by the RAC Plant Subcommittee Without 
the Requirement for Full RAC Review



In consultation with the RAC Plant Subcommittee and without the requirement for 
full RAC review (Institutional Biosafety Committee review and approval is 
necessary), NIH/ORDA may approve the growing of plants containing 
recombinant DNA in the field under the following conditions: (i) The plant species 
is a cultivated crop of a genus that has no species known to be a noxious weed; (ii) 
the introduced DNA consists of well-characterized genes containing no sequences 
harmful to humans, animals, or plants; (iii) the vector consists of DNA from 
exempt host-vector systems (see Appendix C), from plants of the same or closely 
related species, from nonpathogenic prokaryotes or nonpathogenic lower eukaryotic 
plants, from plants pathogens only if sequences resulting in production of disease 
symptoms have been deleted, or chimeric vectors constructed from sequences of 
exempt host-vector systems (see Appendix C) or from sequences from plant 
pathogens in which the disease symptoms have been deleted. The DNA may be 
introduced by any suitable method. If sequences resulting in production of disease 
symptoms are retained for purposes of introducing the DNA into the plant, 
greenhouse-grown plants must be shown to be free of such sequences before such 
plants, their derivatives, or seed can be used in field tests; (iv) plants are grown in 
controlled access fields under specified conditions appropriate for the plant under 
study and the geographical location. Such conditions should include provisions for 
using good cultural and pest control practices, for physical isolation from plants of 
the same species outside of the experimental plot in accordance with pollination 
characteristics of the species, and the prevention of plants containing recombinant 
DNA from becoming established in the environment. Review by the Institutional 
Biosafety Committee should include an appraisal by scientists knowledgeable of the 
crop, its production practices, and the local geographical conditions. Procedures 
for assessing alterations in and the spread of organisms containing recombinant 
DNA must be developed. The results of the outlined tests must be submitted for 
review and approval by the Institutional Biosafety Committee. Copies of such 
results must be submitted to the Office of Recombinant DNA Activities, National 
Institutes of Health, Building 31, Room 4B11, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, (301) 
496-9838. 


Appendix M. Points to Consider in the Design and Submission 
of Protocols for the Transfer of Recombinant DNA 
Molecules Into the Genome of One or More Human Subjects 



Appendix M applies to research conducted at or sponsored by an institution that 
receives any support for recombinant DNA research from the NIH. Researchers 
not covered by the NIH Guidelines are encouraged to use Appendix M. 
Experiments in which recombinant DNA or DNA or RNA derived from 
recombinant DNA is introduced into one or more human subjects with the intent 
of stably modifying his/her genome are covered by Sections III-A-2, III-B-2, and 
III-B-3 (see Section V-U). Experiments in which recombinant DNA or DNA or 
RNA derived from recombinant DNA and that are not covered by Sections III-A-2, 
III-B-2, or III-B-3 and that are not considered exempt under Section V-U, are 
covered under Section III-C-7. 
This document is intended to provide guidance in preparing proposals for NIH 
consideration under Sections III-A-2 and III-B-2. Section III-A-2 addresses
Major 
Actions involving the transfer of recombinant DNA or DNA or RNA derived from 
recombinant DNA into one or more human subjects that have been determined by 
NIH/ORDA, in consultation with the RAC Chair and one or more RAC members, 
as necessary, to: (i) Represent novel characteristics (e.g., target disease or vector), 
(ii) represent an uncertain degree of risk to human health or the environment, or 
(iii) contain information determined to require further public review. Proposals 
considered under Section III-A-2 will be reviewed by the RAC and approved by 
the NIH Director. RAC review of experiments considered under Section III-A-2 
will follow publication of a precis of the proposal in the 

Federal Register

 and an 
opportunity for public comment. Section III-B-2 addresses Minor Actions involving 
the transfer of recombinant DNA or DNA or RNA derived from recombinant 
DNA into one or more human subjects that have been determined by 
NIH/ORDA, in consultation with the RAC Chair and one or more RAC members, 
as necessary, to qualify for the Accelerated Review process. Proposals considered 
under Sections III-A-2 and III-B-2 will be on a case-by-case basis. A list of actions 
approved under Sections III-A-2 and III-B-2 involving the transfer of recombinant 
DNA or DNA or RNA derived from recombinant DNA into one or more human 
subjects is available from the Office of Recombinant DNA Activities, National 
Institutes of Health, Building 31, Room 4B11, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, (301) 
496-9838. The list of actions to the NIH Guidelines involving the transfer of 
recombinant DNA or DNA or RNA derived from recombinant DNA into one or 
more human subjects does not include experiments considered to be exempt from 
RAC and NIH/ORDA review under Section III-C-7. 
Since the recombinant DNA or DNA or RNA derived from recombinant DNA is 
expected to be confined following transfer to one or more human subjects, no risk 
to public health or to the environment is expected. Nevertheless, Appendix M-I-B-4-b specifically
asks the researchers to address this point.

This appendix will be considered for revision as experience in evaluating proposals accumulates and as new scientific
developments occur. This review will be carried out periodically as needed. 
A proposal involving the transfer of recombinant DNA or DNA or RNA derived from recombinant DNA into one or more human
subjects will be considered by the RAC and/or NIH/ORDA only after the protocol has been approved by the local Institutional
Biosafety Committee and Institutional Review Board in accordance with DHHS Regulations for the Federal Regulations
for the Protection of Human Subjects (45 Code of Federal Regulations, Part 46). If a proposal involves children, special
attention should be paid to subpart D of these DHHS regulations. The Institutional Review Board and Institutional
Biosafety Committee may, at their discretion, condition their approval on further specific deliberation by the
RAC and/or NIH/ORDA. Consideration of human gene transfer proposals by the RAC and/or NIH/ORDA may proceed simultaneously
with review by other involved Federal agencies (see Appendix M-VII-A) provided that NIH/ORDA is notified
of the simultaneous review. Meetings of the full RAC and its subcommittee will be open to the public except where trade
secrets or proprietary information would be disclosed. The committee prefers that proposals submitted for RAC review
contain no proprietary information or trade secrets, enabling all aspects of the review to be open to the public. Public
review of these protocols will serve to inform the public about the technical aspects of the proposals as well as the
meaning and significance of the research. 
The clinical application of recombinant DNA techniques raises two general kinds of questions: (i) the questions
usually discussed by Institutional Review Boards in their review of any proposed research involving one or more human
subjects; and (ii) broader issues. The first type of question is addressed principally in Appendix M-I of this document.
Several broader issues are discussed throughout Appendix M. 
Appendix M-I requests a description of the protocol with special attention to the short-term risks and benefits of
the proposed research to the patient and to other people, the selection of patients, informed consent, privacy, and
confidentiality. Appendix M-II addresses special issues pertaining to the free flow of information about the clinical
trials. These issues lie outside the usual purview of Institutional Review Boards and reflect general public concerns
about biomedical research. Appendix M-III summarizes guidelines for submission of human gene transfer protocols
for RAC review. Appendix M-IV specifies reporting requirements. Appendix M-V describes the procedures for Accelerated
Review of human gene transfer experiments. Appendix M-VI describes the procedures to be followed for Expedited Review
of single patient human gene transfer experiments. Appendix M-VII contains the footnotes to Appendix M.

The RAC will not at present entertain proposals for germ-line alterations but will consider for approval protocols
involving somatic cell gene transfer. The purpose of somatic cell gene therapy is to treat an individual patient,
e.g., by inserting a properly functioning gene into a patient's somatic cells. In germ-line alterations, a specific
attempt is made to introduce genetic changes into the germ (reproductive) cells of an individual, with the aim of changing
the set of genes passed on to the individual's offspring. 
The acceptability of human somatic cell gene therapy has been addressed in several public documents as well as in numerous
academic studies. In November 1982, the President's Commission for the Study of Ethical Problems in Medicine and
Biomedical and Behavioral Research published a report, Splicing Life, which resulted from a two-year process of
public deliberations and hearing. Upon release of that report, a U.S. House of Representatives subcommittee held
three days of public hearings with witnesses from a wide range of fields from the biomedical and social sciences to
theology, philosophy, and law. In December 1984, the Office of Technology Assessment released a background paper,
Human Gene Therapy, which concluded: civic, religious, scientific, and medical groups have all accepted, in principle,
the appropriateness of gene therapy of somatic cells in humans for specific genetic diseases. Somatic cell gene therapy
is seen as an extension of present methods of therapy that might be preferable to other technologies. In light of this
public support, the RAC is prepared to consider proposals for somatic cell gene therapy. 
In its evaluation of proposals involving the transfer of recombinant DNA or DNA or RNA derived from recombinant DNA
into one or more human subjects, the RAC will consider whether the design of such experiments offers adequate assurance
that their consequences will not go beyond their purpose, which is the same as the traditional purpose of clinical
investigations, namely, to protect the health and well-being of one or more human subjects being treated while at
the same time gathering generalizable knowledge. Two possible undesirable consequences of the transfer of recombinant
DNA would be unintentional: (i) vertical transmission of genetic changes from an individual to his/her offspring,
or (ii) horizontal transmission of viral infection to other persons with whom the individual comes in contact. Accordingly,
this document requests information that will enable the RAC and/or NIH/ORDA to assess the possibility that the proposed
experiments will inadvertently affect reproductive cells or lead to infection of other people (e.g., medical personnel
or relatives). 
In recognition of the social concern that surrounds the subject of gene transfer, the RAC and NIH/ORDA will cooperate
with other groups in assessing the possible long-term consequences of the transfer of recombinant DNA or DNA or RNA
derived from recombinant DNA into one or more human subjects and related laboratory and animal experiments in order
to define appropriate human applications of this emerging technology. 
Responses to Appendix M should be provided in the form of either written answers or references to specific sections
of the protocol or its appendices. Principal Investigators should indicate points which are not applicable with
a brief explanation. Principal Investigators submitting proposals that employ essentially the same vector systems
(or with minor variations), and/or that are based on the same preclinical testing as proposals previously reviewed
by the RAC, may refer to preceding documents without having to rewrite such material.

Appendix P. Physical and Biological Containment for 
Recombinant DNA Research Involving Plants 


Appendix P specifies physical and biological containment conditions and practices 
suitable to the greenhouse conduct of experiments involving recombinant DNA-containing plants, plant-associated
microorganisms, and small animals. All 
provisions of the NIH Guidelines apply to plant research activities with the 
following modifications: 
Appendix P shall supersede Appendix G when the research plants are of a size, 
number, or have growth requirements that preclude the use of containment 
conditions described in Appendix G. The plants covered in Appendix P include 
but are not limited to mosses, liverworts, macroscopic algae, and vascular plants 
including terrestrial crops, forest, and ornamental species. 
Plant-associated microorganisms include viroids, virusoids, viruses, bacteria, fungi, 
protozoans, certain small algae, and microorganisms that have a benign or 
beneficial association with plants, such as certain Rhizobium species and 
microorganisms known to cause plant diseases. The appendix applies to 
microorganisms which are being modified with the objective of fostering an 
association with plants. 
Plant-associated small animals include those arthropods that: (i) Are in obligate 
association with plants, (ii) are plant pests, (iii) are plant pollinators, or (iv) 
transmit plant disease agents, as well as other small animals such as nematodes for 
which tests of biological properties necessitate the use of plants. Microorganisms 
associated with such small animals (e.g., pathogens or symbionts) are included. 
The Institutional Biosafety Committee shall include at least one individual with 
expertise in plant, plant pathogen, or plant pest containment principles when 
experiments utilizing Appendix P require prior approval by the Institutional 
Biosafety Committee. 


Appendix P-I. General Plant Biosafety Levels 


Appendix P-I-A. The principal purpose of plant containment is to avoid the 
unintentional transmission of a recombinant DNA-containing plant genome, 
including nuclear or organelle hereditary material or release of recombinant DNA-
derived organisms associated with plants. 
Appendix P-I-B. The containment principles are based on the recognition that the 
organisms that are used pose no health threat to humans or higher animals (unless 
deliberately modified for that purpose), and that the containment conditions 
minimize the possibility of an unanticipated deleterious effect on organisms and 
ecosystems outside of the experimental facility, e.g., the inadvertent spread of a 
serious pathogen from a greenhouse to a local agricultural crop or the 
unintentional introduction and establishment of an organism in a new ecosystem. 
Appendix P-I-C. Four biosafety levels, referred to as Biosafety Level (BL) 1_Plants (P), BL2-P,
BL3-P, and BL4-P, are established in Section II. The selection 
of containment levels required for research involving recombinant DNA molecules 
in plants or associated with plants is specified in Section III. These biosafety levels 
are described in Appendix P-II. This appendix describes greenhouse practices and 
special greenhouse facilities for physical containment. 
Appendix P-I-D. BL1-P through BL4-P are designed to provide differential levels 
of biosafety for plants in the absence or presence of other experimental organisms 
that contain recombinant DNA. These biosafety levels, in conjunction with 
biological containment conditions described in Appendix P-III, provide flexible 
approaches to ensure the safe conduct of research. 
Appendix P-I-E. For experiments in which plants are grown at the BL1 through 
BL4 laboratory settings, containment practices shall be followed as described in 
Appendix G. These containment practices include the use of plant tissue culture 
rooms, growth chambers within laboratory facilities, or experiments performed on 
open benches. Additional biological containment practices should be added by the 
Greenhouse Director or Institutional Biosafety Committee as necessary (see 
Appendix P-III), if botanical reproductive structures are produced that have the 
potential of being released. 


Appendix P-II. Physical Containment Levels 


Appendix P-II-A. Biosafety Level 1_Plants (BL1-P) 
Appendix P-II-A-1. Standard Practices (BL1-P) 
Appendix P-II-A-1-a. Greenhouse Access (BL1-P) 


Appendix P-II-A-1-a-(1). Access to the greenhouse shall be limited or restricted,
at 
the discretion of the Greenhouse Director, when experiments are in progress. 
Appendix P-II-A-1-a-(2). Prior to entering the greenhouse, personnel shall be 
required to read and follow instructions on BL1-P greenhouse practices and 
procedures. All procedures shall be performed in accordance with accepted 
greenhouse practices that are appropriate to the experimental organism.

Appendix P-II-A-1-b. Records (BL1-P)


Appendix P-II-A-1-b-(1). A record shall be kept of experiments currently in progress
in the greenhouse facility.


Appendix P-II-A-1-c. Decontamination and Inactivation (BL1-P)


Appendix P-II-A-1-c-(1). Experimental organisms shall be rendered biologically
inactive by appropriate methods before disposal outside of the greenhouse facility.


Appendix P-II-A-1-d. Control of Undesired Species and Motile Macroorganisms (BL1-P)


Appendix P-II-A-1-d-(1). A program shall be implemented to control undesired species
(e.g., weed, rodent, or arthropod pests and pathogens), by methods appropriate to the organisms and in accordance
with applicable state and Federal laws.
Appendix P-II-A-1-d-(2). Arthropods and other motile macroorganisms shall be housed
in appropriate cages. If macroorganisms (e.g., flying arthropods or nematodes) are released within the greenhouse,
precautions shall be taken to minimize escape from the greenhouse facility.


Appendix P-II-A-1-e. Concurrent Experiments Conducted in the Greenhouse (BL1-P)


Appendix P-II-A-1-e-(1). Experiments involving other organisms that require a containment
level lower than BL1-P may be conducted in the greenhouse concurrently with experiments that require BL1-P
containment, provided that all work is conducted in accordance with BL1-P greenhouse practices.


Appendix P-II-A-2. Facilities (BL1-P)
Appendix P-II-A-2-a. Definitions (BL1-P)


Appendix P-II-A-2-a-(1). The term ``greenhouse'' refers to a structure with walls,
a roof, and a floor designed and used principally for growing plants in a controlled and protected environment. The

Appendix P-III. Biological Containment Practices 



Appropriate selection of the following biological containment practices may be 
used to meet the containment requirements for a given organism. The present list 
is not exhaustive; there may be other ways of preventing effective dissemination 
that could possibly lead to the establishment of the organism or its genetic material 
in the environment resulting in deleterious consequences to managed or natural 
ecosystems. 



Appendix P-III-A. Biological Containment Practices (Plants) 



Appendix P-III-A-1. Effective dissemination of plants by pollen or seed can be 
prevented by one or more of the following procedures: (i) Cover the reproductive 
structures to prevent pollen dissemination at flowering and seed dissemination at 
maturity; (ii) remove reproductive structures by employing male sterile strains, or 
harvest the plant material prior to the reproductive stage; (iii) ensure that 
experimental plants flower at a time of year when cross-fertile plants are not 
flowering within the normal pollen dispersal range of the experimental plant; or 
(iv) ensure that cross-fertile plants are not growing within the known pollen 
dispersal range of the experimental plant. 



Appendix P-III-B. Biological Containment Practices (Microorganisms) 



Appendix P-III-B-1. Effective dissemination of microorganisms beyond the 
confines of the greenhouse can be prevented by one or more of the following 
procedures: (i) Confine all operations to injections of microorganisms or other 
biological procedures (including genetic manipulation) that limit replication or 
reproduction of viruses and microorganisms or sequences derived from 
microorganisms, and confine these injections to internal plant parts or adherent 
plant surfaces; (ii) ensure that organisms, which can serve as hosts or promote the 
transmission of the virus or microorganism, are not present within the farthest 
distance that the airborne virus or microorganism may be expected to be effectively 
disseminated; (iii) conduct experiments at a time of year when plants that can 
serve as hosts are either not growing or are not susceptible to productive infection; 
(iv) use viruses and other microorganisms or their genomes that have known 
arthropod or animal vectors, in the absence of such vectors; (v) use microorganisms 
that have an obligate association with the plant; or (vi) use microorganisms that 
are genetically disabled to minimize survival outside of the research facility and 
whose natural mode of transmission requires injury of the target organism, or 
assures that inadvertent release is unlikely to initiate productive infection of 
organisms outside of the experimental facility. 



Appendix P-III-C. Biological Containment Practices (Macroorganisms) 



Appendix P-III-C-1. Effective dissemination of arthropods and other small animals 
can be prevented by using one or more of the following procedures: (i) Use non-
flying, flight-impaired, or sterile arthropods; (ii) use non-motile or sterile strains of 
small animals; (iii) conduct experiments at a time of year that precludes the 
survival of escaping organisms; (iv) use animals that have an obligate association 
with a plant that is not present within the dispersal range of the organism; or (v) 
prevent the escape of organisms present in run-off water by chemical treatment or 
evaporation of run-off water. 


Appendix Q. Physical and Biological Containment for 
Recombinant DNA Research Involving Animals 



Appendix Q specifies containment and confinement practices for research involving 
whole animals, both those in which the animal's genome has been altered by stable 
introduction of recombinant DNA, or DNA derived therefrom, into the germ-line 
(transgenic animals) and experiments involving viable recombinant DNA-modified
