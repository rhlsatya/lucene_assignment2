ACTION: 

Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM).






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This document proposes the supersedure of an existing airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to The Endstrom
Helicopter Corporation Model F-28A, F-28C, 280, and 280C series helicopters, that currently requires
an initial and repetitive visual inspections of the upper swashplate bearings for corrosion, and replacement of
defective upper swashplate bearings with airworthy bearings. This action would require that the visual inspections
apply to both the upper and lower swashplate bearings (bearings); expand the applicability to those affected helicopters
manufactured prior to January 1, 1981; establish a retirement life of 1,200 hours' time-in-service for certain bearings;
and provide a corrected upper swashplate bearing part number. This proposal is prompted by the necessity to require
visual inspection so the lower swashplate bearings; expand the applicability to include the Model F-28C-2
helicopter; establish a retirement life for certain bearings; and correct the upper swashplate bearing part number
from the existing AD. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent failure of the bearings and subsequent
loss of control of the helicopter.

Availability of NPRMs




Any person may obtain a copy of this NPRM by submitting a request to the FAA, Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel, Attention:
Rules Docket No. 93-SW-26-Ad, 2601 Meacham Blvd., Room 663, Fort Worth, Texas 76137.



Discussion




On March 19, 1976, the FAA issued AD 76-01-11, Amendment 39-2560, (41 FR 13906, April 1, 1976), to
require an initial and repetitive visual inspection of the upper swashplate bearing, part number (P/N) Z993L13XR3B,
for corrosion, and replacement of corroded upper swashplate bearings. That action was prompted by three reports
of upper swashplate bearing failures that were attributed to corrosion. These failures occurred between 205 and
586 hours' time-in-service (TIS). In two of these incidents, the probable cause of the upper swashplate bearing failures
was corrosion of the balls and race due to water impregnating the housing after the loss of lubricant. This led to a spalling
interaction between the balls and race, resulting in upper swashplate bearing failure. After reviewing the data,
the FAA has determined that corrosion of either upper or lower bearings (bearings) could create an unsafe condition.
These conditions, if not corrected, could result in failure of the bearings and subsequent loss of control of the helicopter.

Since the issuance of that AD, improved and modified bearings have been approved by the FAA for these model helicopters.
Additionally, the manufacturer has issued The Enstrom Helicopter Corporation Service Information Letter (SIL)
No. 0110, Revision B, dated March 18, 1993, that extends the previous visual inspections to include the Model F-28C-2
helicopters. The SIL describes an approved swashplate modification and indicates that the SIL should only apply
to those affected helicopters manufactured prior to January 1, 1981. In addition, a swashplate modification that
would constitute terminating action for the requirements of this AD has been approved.

Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other products of this same type
design, the proposed AD would supersede AD 76-06-11 to require visual inspections of the lower swashplate
bearings; expand the applicability to the Model F-28C-2 helicopter; establish a retirement life of 1,200
hours' time-in-service for certain upper and lower swashplate bearings; and correct the upper swashplate bearing
part number in the existing AD. This proposed AD would also provide an optional terminating action from the requirements
of this AD and limit the applicability of the AD requirements to those affected model helicopters manufactured prior
to January 1, 1981.

The FAA estimates that 660 helicopters of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD, that it would take approximately
5 work hours per helicopter to accomplish the proposed actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour.
Required parts would cost approximately $1,400 per helicopter. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the
proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $1,105,500.

The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.

For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action''
under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44
FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative,
on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft
regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting
the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption ADDRESSES

(a) Within the next 10 hours' time-in-service (TIS) after the effective date of this AD, and thereafter at intervals
not to exceed 100 hours' TIS since the last inspection, perform a visual inspection of the upper swashplate bearing,
P/N Z993L13X3B, bearing number SKF 6013-RS, or ECD013-13, and lower swashplate bearing, P/N 5201SBKZZ-ABEC,
or ECD009-11, for corrosion as follows:

(1) Lower the swashplate to lowest position with the collective control.

(2) Remove the plastic bearing seal using a blunt scribe.

(3) Using an inspection mirror, visually inspect the bearings for grease lubricant and any evidence of corrosion.
Rotate the bearings and housing to reposition balls and race for complete inspection. For bearings found free of corrosion
or defects, repack them with Exxon ANDOK-B grease or any MIL-G-18709A grease, and reinstall them
in accordance with the applicable maintenance manual.

(b) Replace any unairworthy bearing with an airworthy bearing in accordance with the applicable maintenance manual.

(c) Before further flight, after the effective date of this AD, remove all upper and lower swashplate bearings having
1,200 hours' or more TIS, and replace them with airworthy bearings. For bearings with less than 1,200 hours' TIS on
the effective date of this AD, replace the bearings on or before attaining 1,200 hours' TIS.

(d) The owner may elect to install revised upper swashplate bearing housing, P/N 28-16108-2, and lower
swashplate bearing housing, P/N 28-16361-1, that are equipped with grease fittings and integral bearing
shields as described in The Enstrom Helicopter Corporation Service Information Letter No. 0110, Revision B, dated
March 18, 1993. This would constitute terminating action for the requirements of this AD.

(e) An alternative method of compliance or adjustment of the compliance time that provides an acceptable level of
safety may be used when approved by the Manager, Chicago Aircraft Certification Office, FAA. Operators shall submit
their requests through an FAA Principal Maintenance Inspector, who may concur or comment and then send it to the Manager,
Chicago Aircraft Certification Office.






Note: 

Information concerning the existence of approved alternative methods of compliance with this AD, if any, may be obtained
from the Chicago Aircraft Certification Office.




(f) Special flight permits may be issued in accordance with   21.197 and 21.199 of the Federal Aviation
Regulations (14 CFR 21.197 and 21.199) to operate the helicopter to a location where the requirements of this AD can
be accomplished.

<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of proposed rulemaking.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This notice proposes to establish Class E airspace at Springdale, AR. Currently, Springdale, AR has Class D airspace
during the hours of operation of the Springdale Air Traffic Control Tower. This action is proposing to provide controlled
airspace, Class E, upward from the surface to contain instrument flight rule (IFR) operations during the hours that
the control tower is closed. The intended effect of this proposal is to provide adequate Class E airspace to contain
IFR operations during the hours that the control tower is closed at Springdale, AR.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
Comments Invited


Interested parties are invited to participate in this proposed rulemaking by submitting such written data, views,
or arguments as they may desire. Comments that provide the factual basis supporting the views and suggestions presented
are particularly helpful in developing reasoned regulatory decisions on the proposal. Comments are specifically
invited on the overall regulatory, aeronautical, economic, environmental, and energy-related aspects of the proposal.
Communications should identify the airspace docket and be submitted in triplicate to the address listed above. Commenters
wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments on this notice must submit, with those comments, a self-addressed,
stamped, postcard containing the following statement: ``Comments to Airspace Docket No. 93-ASW-42.''

closing date for comments will be considered before taking action on the proposed rule. The proposal contained in
this notice may be changed in the light of comments received. All comments submitted will be available for examination
in the System Management Branch, Air Traffic Division, at 2601 Meacham Blvd., Fort Worth, TX, both before and after
the closing date for comments. A report summarizing each substantive public contact with FAA personnel concerned
with this rulemaking will be filed in the docket.


Availability of NPRM's


Any person may obtain a copy of this notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) by submitting a request to the Manager, System
Management Branch, Department of Transportation, Federal Aviation Administration, Fort Worth, TX 76193-0530.
Communications must identify the notice number of this NPRM. Persons interested in being placed on a mailing list
for future NPRM's should also request a copy of Advisory Circular No. 11-2A that describes the application procedure.


The Proposal


The FAA is considering an amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to establish Class
E airspace at Springdale, AR. Controlled airspace to the surface is needed during the hours that the control tower
is closed to contain IFR operations at the airport. The intended effect of this proposal is to provide adequate Class
E airspace, during the hours that the control tower is closed, for IFR operations at Springdale Regional Airport,
Springdale, Arkansas.
The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Class E airspace areas designated as
surface areas for airports are published in Paragraph 6002 of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective
September 16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 958 FR 36298; July 6, 1993). The Class E airspace
designation listed in this document would be published subsequently in the Order.
The FAA has determined that this proposed regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations
that need frequent and routine amendments to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) Is not a ``significant
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies
and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as
the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and
air navigation, it is certified that this rule, when promulgated, will not have a significant impact on a substantial
number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Proposed rule; limited reopening of the rulemaking record.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) is reopening the rulemaking record for the proposed revision
of the regulation of personal protective equipment for shipyard employment (53 FR 48150, November 29, 1988) to incorporate
the rulemaking record developed for the recently revised regulation of personal protective equipment for general
industry (Docket S-060, final rule published in 59 FR 16334, April 6, 1994) and the record for the proposed regulation
of personal protective equipment (fall protection equipment for general industry) (Docket S-057, 55 FR 13423,
April 10, 1990). While the shipyard rulemaking on personal protective equipment (PPE) generated 10 comments, the
general industry rulemakings generated hundreds of comments and several thousand pages of hearing testimony regarding
PPE issues. The Agency believes the regulation of PPE in shipyard and general industry employment should be consistent,
in order to facilitate compliance and effective employee protection. OSHA has determined that the information in
Dockets S-060 and S-057 is relevant to full consideration of the issues raised by the shipyard PPE proposal,
and that it is appropriate to reopen the record to incorporate those materials and to allow the public an opportunity
to comment. This notice also raises specific PPE issues arising out of the general industry rulemakings for public
comment.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 



I. Background



On November 29, 1988, OSHA proposed to revise the personal protective equipment (PPE) requirements in the shipyard
employment standards (part 1915, subpart I) (53 FR 48150). The proposal updated references to national consensus
standards and added requirements for hazard assessment, proper selection and care of PPE, training, lifesaving
equipment and personal fall protection equipment. The written comment period ended on February 27, 1989. The Agency
received 10 comments on the proposed rule. There were no hearing requests.

On August 16, 1989, OSHA proposed to update the existing general industry standards (part 1910, subpart I, Docket
S-060) for eye and face ( 1910.133), head ( 1910.135) and foot (1910.136) PPE and to add generic
requirements for hazard assessment, proper selection of PPE, prohibition on use of damaged or defective PPE and training
in the proper use of PPE (  1910.132 (d) through (f)) (54 FR 33832). The proposed general industry revisions
were consistent with the corresponding provisions of the proposed rule for shipyard employment.
On April 10, 1990, the Agency proposed to add criteria for personal fall arrest equipment (  1910.128,
1910.129 and 1910.131) and positioning device equipment (  1910.128 and 1910.130) to the general industry
PPE standards (part 1910, subpart I, Docket S-057) (55 FR 13423). Again, the criteria proposed for general industry
PPE were consistent with those proposed for shipyards.
The two general industry rulemakings generated extensive records, including hundreds of comments and several thousand
pages of hearing testimony. On April 6, 1994, OSHA issued a final rule (59 FR 16334) which completed Agency action in
the Docket S-060 proceeding. Based on the rulemaking record, OSHA made some changes to the proposed rule in drafting
the final rule. In particular, OSHA revised the proposed training requirement so that it provides clear direction
regarding what constitutes adequate training and what circumstances trigger a requirement for retraining. In addition,
the final rule added requirements for the certification of the hazard assessment ( 1910.132(d)(2)) and certification
that the required training has been provided and understood ( 1910.132(f)(4)).
Also, based on the rulemaking record for general industry fall protection PPE (Docket S-057), the Agency is
considering further limiting or prohibiting the use of body belts and non-locking snaphooks in personal fall arrest
systems. In particular, the evidence in the record supports the conclusion that an employee who falls while wearing
a body belt as part of a personal fall arrest system is substantially more likely to suffer death or serious injury than
would be the case if the employee were wearing a full body harness. Furthermore, the rulemaking record indicates that
locking snaphooks designed to prevent ``roll out'' (where snaphooks become accidentally disengaged during use)
provide a higher level of employee protection than single-action (non-locking) snaphooks.
While it is appropriate to facilitate employer access to safety and health standards by maintaining separate standards
for general industry (part 1910) and for the shipyard industry (part 1915), the Agency believes that the substance
of those standards should be consistent. OSHA believes, based on its review of the pertinent rulemaking records,
that PPE used in shipyards does not differ markedly from PPE used in general industry. Therefore, the Agency has determined
that the information generated in the general industry rulemakings should be taken into account as the Agency drafts
the final rule for shipyard PPE, as well. To this end, OSHA is incorporating the general industry PPE rulemaking records
(Dockets S-057 and S-060) into the record for the shipyards PPE rulemaking. In addition, OSHA is reopening
the written comment period for the shipyard PPE proposal so the public has an opportunity to comment on the newly incorporated
materials.


II. Issues


OSHA is requesting comments on these five specific issues:
1. 

Certification of hazard assessment

. OSHA believes that a hazard assessment is an important element of a PPE program because it produces the information
needed to select the appropriate PPE for the hazards present or likely to be present at particular workplaces. The
Agency believes that employers are able to determine and evaluate the hazards of their particular workplaces and
to use this information for proper PPE selection.
Proposed  1915.152(b) required employers to select the types of PPE to be used by employees based on
