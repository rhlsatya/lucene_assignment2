CFR part 3015, subpart V, and final rule related notice published at 48 FR 29114, June 24, 1983.)

This notice imposes no new reporting or recordkeeping provisions that are subject to Office of Management and Budget
review in accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3587). 

This action is not a rule as defined by the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601-612) and thus is exempt from
the provisions of that Act. This notice has been determined to be exempt under Executive Order 12866. 



Definitions



The terms used in this notice shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the regulations governing the CACFP (7 CFR
part 226). 



Background 



Pursuant to sections 4, 11 and 17 of the National School Lunch Act (NSLA) (42 U.S.C. 1753, 1759a and 1766), section 4
of the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 (42 U.S.C. 1773) and   226.4, 226.12 and 226.13 of the regulations governing
the CACFP (7 CFR part 226), notice is hereby given of the new payment rates for participating institutions. These rates
shall be in effect during the period July 1, 1994-June 30, 1995. 

As provided for under the NSLA and the Child Nutrition Act of 1966, all rates in the CACFP must be prescribed annually
on July 1 to reflect changes in the Consumer Price Index for the most recent 12-month period. In accordance with this
mandate, the Department last published the adjusted national average payment rates for centers, the food service
payment rates for day care homes and the administrative reimbursement rates for sponsors of day care homes on July
8, 1993 at 58 FR 36636 (for the period July 1, 1993-June 30, 1994). The payment rates for the period July 1, 1994-June
30, 1995 are:

Pursuant to section 12(f) of the NSLA (42 U.S.C. 1760(f), the Department adjusts the payment rates for participating
institutions in the States of Alaska and Hawaii. The new payment rates for Alaska are as follows:






The new payment rates for Hawaii are as follows:





The changes in the national average payment rates and the food service payment rates for day care homes reflect a 1.7
percent increase during the 12-month period May 1993 to May 1994 (from 142.9 in May 1993 to 145.3 in May 1994) in the food
away from home series of the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers, published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics
of the Department of Labor. The changes in the administrative reimbursement rates for sponsoring organizations
of day care homes reflect a 2.3 percent increase during the 12-month period May 1993 to May 1994 (from 144.2 in May 1993
to 147.5 in May 1994) in the series for all items of the Consumers Price Index for All Urban Consumers, published by the
Bureau of Labor Statistics of the Department of Labor.

The total amount of payments available to each State agency for distribution to institutions participating in the
program is based on the rates contained in this notice.

ACTION:

 Notice. 





</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This notice announces the value of donated foods or, where 
applicable, cash in lieu thereof to be provided in the 1995 school year for 
each lunch served by schools participating in the National School Lunch 
Program (NSLP) or by commodity schools and for each lunch and supper served by 
institutions participating in the Child and Adult Care Food Program. 




This notice also announces that the value of agricultural commodities and 
other foods provided to States during the past school year met the level of 
assistance authorized under the National School Lunch Act. Thus, there will 
be no shortfall cash payments to States for the NSLP for the 1994 school year. 
The annually programmed level of assistance was met in food donations by June 
30, 1994.




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

These programs are listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance under Nos. 10.550, 10.555, and 10.558 and
are subject to the provisions of Executive Order 12372, which requires intergovernmental consultation with State
and local officials. (See 7 CFR part 3015, subpart V, and final rule related notice published at 48 FR 29114, June 24,
1983.) 



This notice imposes no new reporting or recordkeeping provisions that are 
subject to Office of Management and Budget review in accordance with the 
Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3507). This action is not a rule 
as defined by the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601-612) and thus is 
exempt from the provisions of that Act. This notice has been determined to be 
exempt under Executive Order 12866. 




National Average Minimum Value of Donated Foods for the Period July 1, 1994 Through June 30, 1995 



This notice implements mandatory provisions of sections 6(e), 14(f) and 
17(h)(1) of the National School Lunch Act (the Act) (42 U.S.C. 1755(e), 
1762a(f), and 1766(h)(1)). Section 6(e)(1)(A) of the Act establishes the 
national average value of donated food assistance to be given to States for 
each lunch served in NSLP at 11.00 cents per meal. Pursuant to section 
6(e)(1)(B), this amount is subject to annual adjustments as of July 1 of each 
year to reflect changes in the Price Index for Food Used in Schools and 
Institutions. Section 17(h)(1) of the Act provides that the same value of 
assistance in donated foods for school lunches shall also be established for 
lunches and suppers served in the Child and Adult Care Food Program. Notice 
is hereby given that the national average minimum value of donated foods, or 
cash in lieu thereof, per lunch under NSLP (7 CFR part 210) and per lunch and 
supper under the Child and Adult Care Food Program (7 CFR part 226) shall be 
14.50 cents for the period July 1, 1994 through June 30, 1995. 

The Price Index for Food Used in Schools and Institutions is computed on the basis of five major food components in the
Bureau of Labor Statistics' 
Producer Price Index (cereal and bakery products; meats, poultry and fish; 
dairy products; processed fruits and vegetables; and fats and oils). Each 
component is assigned a proportional value using the appropriate relative 
weight as determined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The value of food 
assistance is adjusted each July 1 by the annual percentage change in a three- 
month simple average value of this Price Index for March, April and May. The 
three-month average of the Price Index increased by 2.92 percent from 123.23 
for March, April and May of 1993 to 126.83 for the same three months in 1994. 
When computed on the basis of unrounded data and rounded to the nearest one-quarter cent, the resulting national average
for the period July 1, 1994 
through June 30, 1995 will be 14.50 cents per meal. This is an increase of 
0.50 cents from the school year 1994 rate. 

Section 14(f) of the Act provides that commodity schools shall be eligible to receive donated foods equal in value
to the sum of the national average value 
of donated foods established under section 6(e) of the Act and the national 
average payment established under section 4 of the Act (42 U.S.C. 1753). Such 
schools are eligible to receive up to 5 cents of this value in cash for 
processing and handling expenses related to the use of such foods. 

Commodity schools are defined in section 12(d)(7) of the Act (42 U.S.C. 
1760(d)(7)) as ``schools that do not participate in the school lunch program 
under this Act, but which receive commodities made available by the Secretary 
for use by such schools in nonprofit lunch programs.'' 

For the 1995 school year, commodity schools shall be eligible to receive 
donated food assistance valued at 31.50 cents for each lunch served. This 
amount is based on the sum of the section 6(e) level of assistance announced 
in this notice and the adjusted section 4 minimum national average payment 
factor for school year 1995. The section 4 factor for commodity schools does 
not include the two cents per lunch increase for schools where 60 percent of 
the lunches were served in the second preceding year free or at reduced 
prices, since that increase is applicable only to schools participating in the 
National School Lunch Program. 



Cash in Lieu Payments_Value of Donated Commodities for School Year 1994 



Section 6(b) of the Act (42 U.S.C. 1755(b)) and the regulations governing cash 
in lieu of donated foods (7 CFR part 240) require the Secretary of Agriculture 
by June 1 of each school year to estimate the value of agricultural 
commodities and other foods that will be delivered to States during that 
school year. Under the food distribution regulations (7 CFR part 250), these 
foods are used by schools participating in NSLP. If the estimated value is 
less than the total level of commodity assistance authorized under section 
6(e) of the Act, the Secretary is required by July 1 of that school year to 
pay to each State educational agency funds equal to the difference between the 
value of programmed deliveries and the total level of authorized assistance 
for each State. 

During the past school year the adjusted minimum national average value of 
donated foods or payments of cash in lieu thereof per lunch was 14.00 cents. 
In accordance with section 6(e) of the Act, the mandated level of commodity 
assistance was $566,188,578 for school year 1994. The Secretary has 
determined that at least that amount was available for delivery nationally by 
June 30, 1994 to meet the mandated level of assistance. 

Notice is hereby given, therefore, that no shortfall cash payments will be 
made for the school year ending June 30, 1994. 







Authority: 

Sections 6(e)(1) (A) and (B), 14(f) and 17(h)(1) of the National School Lunch Act, as amended (42 U.S.C. 1755(e)(1)(A)
and (B), 1762a(f), and 1766(h)(1)).

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This Notice announces the annual adjustments to: (1) The ``national average payments,'' the amount of money the Federal
Government provides States for lunches and breakfasts served to children participating in the National School Lunch
and School Breakfast Programs; (2) the ``maximum reimbursement rates,'' the maximum per lunch rate from Federal
funds that a State can provide a school food authority for lunches served to children participating in the National
School Lunch Program; and (3) the rate of reimbursement for a half-pint of milk served to nonneedy children in a school
or institution which participates in the Special Milk Program for Children. The payments and rates are prescribed
on an annual basis each July. The annual payments and rates adjustments for the school lunch and school breakfast programs
reflect changes in the Food Away From Home series of the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers. The annual rate
adjustment for milk reflects changes in the Producer Price Index for Fluid Milk Products. These payments and rates
are in effect from July 1, 1994 through June 30, 1995.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

These programs are listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance under No. 10.553, No. 10.555 and No. 10.556
and are subject to the provisions of Executive Order 12372, which requires intergovernmental consultation with
State and local officials. (See 7 CFR part 3015, subpart V, and final rule related notice published at 48 FR 29114, June
24, 1983.).




This Notice imposes no new reporting or recordkeeping provisions that are subject to OMB review in accordance with
the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3507).

This action is not a rule as defined by the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601-612) and thus is exempt from
the provisions of that Act.

This Notice has been determined to be exempt under Executive Order 12866.



Background





Special Milk Program for Children

_Pursuant to section 3 of the Child Nutrition Act of 1966, as amended (42 U.S.C. 1772), the Department announces the
rate of reimbursement for a half-pint of milk served to nonneedy children in a school or institution which participates
in the Special Milk Program for Children. This rate is adjusted annually to reflect changes in the Producer Price Index
for Fluid Milk Products (Code 0231), published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the Department of Labor.

For the period July 1, 1994 to June 30, 1995, the rate of reimbursement for a half-pint of milk served to a nonneedy child
in a school or institution which participates in the Special Milk Program is 11.00 cents. This reflects no change over
the current reimbursement rate because the Producer Price Index for Fluid Milk Products (Code 0231) from May 1993
to May 1994 (from a level of 120.6 in May 1993 to 121.1 in May 1994) did not change significantly enough to trigger a change
in the reimbursement rate.

As a reminder, schools or institutions with pricing programs which elect to serve milk free to eligible children continue
to receive the average cost of a half-pint of milk (the total cost of all milk purchased during the claim period divided
by the total number of purchased half-pints) for each half-pint served to an eligible child.



National School Lunch and School Breakfast Programs

_Pursuant to section 11 of the National School Lunch Act, as amended (42 U.S.C. 1759a), and section 4 of the Child Nutrition
Act of 1966, as amended (42 U.S.C. 1773), the Department annually announces the adjustments to the National Average
Payment Factors and to the maximum Federal reimbursement rates for meals served to children participating in the
National School Lunch Program. Adjustments are prescribed each July 1, based on changes in the Food Away From Home
series of the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers, published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the Department
of Labor. The changes in the national average payment rates for schools and residential child care institutions for
the period July 1, 1994 through June 30, 1995 reflect a 1.7 percent increase in the Price Index during the 12-month period
May 1993 to May 1994 (from a level of 142.9 in May 1993 to 145.3 in May 1994).



Lunch Payment Factors

_Section 4 of the National School Lunch Act (42 U.S.C. 1753) provides general cash for food assistance payments to
States to assist schools in purchasing food. There are two section 4 National Average Payment Factors for lunches
served under the National School Lunch Program. The lower payment factor applies to lunches served by school food
authorities in which less than 60 percent of the lunches served in the school lunch program during the second preceding
school year were served free or at a reduced price. The higher payment factor applies to lunches served by school food
authorities in which 60 percent or more of the lunches served during the second preceding school year were served free
or at a reduced price. To supplement these section 4 payments, section 11 of the National School Lunch Act provides
special cash assistance payments to aid schools in providing free and reduced-price lunches. The section 11 National
Average Payment Factor for each reduced-price lunch served is set at 40 cents less than the factor for each free lunch.

As authorized under sections 8 and 11 of the National School Lunch Act, maximum reimbursement rates for each type of
lunch are prescribed by the Department in this Notice. These maximum rates ensure equitable disbursement of Federal
funds to school food authorities.



Breakfast Payment Factors

_Section 4 of the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 establishes National Average Payment Factors for free, reduced-price
and paid breakfasts served under the School Breakfast Program and additional payments for schools determined to
be in ``severe need'' because they serve a high percentage of needy children.

<USDEPT>DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION</USDEPT>






Centers for Independent Living; Inviting Applications for New Awards for Fiscal Year (FY) 
1994 



Purpose of Program



This program provides support for planning, conducting, administering, and evaluating centers for independent
living (centers) that comply with the standards and assurances in section 725 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (Act),
as amended, consistent with the State plan for establishing a statewide network of centers. Centers are consumer-controlled,
community-based, cross-disability, nonresidential private nonprofit agencies that are designed and operated
within local communities by individuals with disabilities and provide an array of independent living (IL) services.




Eligible Applicants 



An applicant is eligible to apply as a new center if the applicant meets the requirements of   366.2(a)
and 366.24 and either_ (1) Is not currently receiving funds under Part C of Chapter 1 of Title VII of the Act; or (2) proposes
the expansion of an existing center through the establishment of a separate and complete center (except that the governing
board of the existing center may serve as the governing board of the new center) in a different geographical location.
Eligibility under this competition is limited to those entities proposing to serve areas that are unserved or underserved
in the States and territories listed under AVAILABLE FUNDS. 



Deadline for Transmittal of Applications:

 August 5, 1994. 



Deadline for Intergovernmental Review:

 September 6, 1994. 



Applications Available:

 July 6, 1994. 



Available Funds:

 $2,776,432 as distributed in the following_



 




Estimated Range of Awards:

 $32,000 to $200,000. 



Estimated Number of Awards:

 1 to 5 per eligible State or territory. 






Note: 

The Department is not bound by any estimates in this notice. 






Project Period:

 Up to 60 months. 



Applicable Regulations:

 (a) The Education Department General Administrative Regulations (EDGAR) in 34 CFR Parts 74, 75, 77, 79, 80, 81, 82,
85, and 86; and (b) The program regulations in 34 CFR Parts 364 and 366. 

It is the policy of the Department of Education not to solicit applications before the publication of final regulations.
However, in this case, it is essential to solicit applications on the basis of the notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM)
published in the 

Federal Register

 on May 12, 1994 (59 FR 24814), because the Department's authority to obligate these funds will expire on September
30, 1994. 

The comment period for the NPRM ended on June 13, 1994. A total of 40 comments were received from centers (21), State
agencies (11), Statewide Independent Living Councils and other statewide organizations (4), national constituent
organizations (3), and an individual (1). The comments were generally favorable and constructive. The following
is a summary of the substantive comments received on the NPRM and of the changes that are expected to be made, based on
public comments, in the final regulations that are currently undergoing review and that may affect applicants under
this competition. Technical and other minor changes_and suggested changes the Secretary is not legally authorized
to make under the applicable statutory authority_are not addressed. 

Only one commenter objected to the 30-day comment period. The Secretary considered a 30-day comment period necessary
because a longer comment period would not have left enough time to publish this notice inviting applications for competitive
awards for new centers under this program for fiscal year (FY) 1995. The Secretary also considered a 30-day comment
period adequate because of the extensive opportunity for input and comment that was afforded to the public prior to
publishing the NPRM. The Secretary does not believe it is necessary to extend the comment period.

Part 364 



Two commenters objected to the change in terminology from an individual with ``severe'' disabilities to an individual
with ``significant'' disabilities. Although only one comment specifically complimenting the Department on the
use of ``significant'' rather than ``severe'' was received in response to the NPRM, the IL community previously expressed
overwhelming support for the change in comments to the notice of proposed rulemaking on the proposed nomenclature
change published on October 27, 1993 (58 FR 57938). Therefore, the Secretary does not expect any change in the final
regulations. 

A number of commenters suggested changes to the definitions in proposed  364.4. 

Two commenters were concerned that the proposed definition of ``advocacy'' may be interpreted to require an advocate
to be an attorney. One of these commenters suggested a broader definition of ``advocacy.'' 

The proposed definition of ``advocacy'' specifically states that, to the extent permitted by State law or the rules
of any agency before which an individual is appearing, a non-lawyer may engage in advocacy on behalf of another individual.
The Secretary does not interpret this definition as requiring an advocate to be an attorney in all cases, but only in
those situations where State law or the rules of an agency require that an advocate representing another individual
be an attorney. 

Therefore, the Secretary does not expect any change to this definition in the final regulations. 

Commenters suggested that the proposed definition of ``attendant care'' be revised to make it clear that this service
may be provided on the job and in the community, as well as at home. 

The Secretary believes the proposed definition provides adequate flexibility to allow attendant care in a variety
of situations. Therefore, the Secretary does not expect any change to this definition in the final regulations. 

Commenters questioned why the words ``cognitive'' and ``sensory'' do not appear in the proposed definition of ``individual
with significant disabilities.'' These commenters noted that the proposed definition conflicts with the proposed
definition of an ``individual with a disability.'' 

The concepts of ``physical'' and ``mental'' impairments in the statutory definitions of ``individual with a severe
disability'' and ``individual with a disability'' include the concepts of ``sensory'' and ``cognitive'' impairments,
respectively. However, the Secretary agrees that the definitions of ``individual with a significant disability''
and ``individual with a disability'' should be consistent. Therefore, the Secretary anticipates adding the words
``sensory'' and ``cognitive'' to the definition of ``individual with a significant disability'' in the final regulations.


In proposed  364.5, commenters objected to the limitation on reallocating expenditures after the initiation
of an audit or compliance review and considered it punitive and contrary to ordinary accounting procedures. 

The Secretary agrees that a change is necessary to make this requirement consistent with acceptable accounting practices.
Therefore, the Secretary anticipates changing  364.5 in the final regulations to allow costs that a grantee
intends to use as an offset against disallowed costs, if those costs are reported on the final financial status reports
within 90 days after the completion of an audit or compliance review. 

Commenters objected to the language in proposed   364.6 and 364.7 regarding program income. Commenters
asserted that the resource development requirement in evaluation standard 7 in section 725(b)(7) of the Act should
be interpreted to permit centers to accumulate funds over several years to create, among other financial instruments,
endowments and reserves. 

The Secretary agrees that imposing time limits on the use of program income may be inconsistent with long-term ``resource
development,'' which may include endowment drives and the solicitation of gifts and bequests that may produce long-term
income. Therefore, the Secretary anticipates changing the language in proposed   364.6 and 364.7 in
the final regulations to allow centers to use program income to establish endowments and other similar financial
instruments, but only if the corpus and income generated from the endowment and other similar financial instruments
are used solely to carry out the purposes of the Center for Independent Living (CIL) program authorized under Part
C of Chapter 1 of Title VII of the Act. 

One commenter objected to the use of the term ``special'' when referring to reasonable accommodation and ``alternative''
modes of communication in proposed   364.20, 364.23, and 364.56. 

The Secretary agrees with the commenter and anticipates substituting the word ``alternative'' for the word ``special''
in these sections of the final regulations. 

Commenters expressed concern regarding access to records in proposed  364.37(c) on the grounds that access
to individual records may be unnecessarily intrusive and inconsistent with commitments that providers make to their
consumers. 

The Secretary believes that access to individual case records or files or consumer service records is necessary for
the proper and efficient administration and monitoring of the CIL program. Proposed  364.37(c) limits this
access to the Secretary and the Comptroller General of the United States, or any of their duly authorized representatives.
The Secretary does not believe that this access is unreasonable or that it will be abused. Therefore, the Secretary
does not expect any change in the final regulations. 

Commenters were concerned that the references to ``legally authorized representative'' in proposed  364.51
may be interpreted to require an attorney or legal guardian. 

The Secretary does not intend to require that only an attorney or legal guardian may represent an individual for purposes
of proposed  364.51(b)(2)(requirements pertaining to ineligibility determinations). Therefore, the Secretary
anticipates adding a definition of ``legally authorized representative'' to the final regulations to clarify that
an individual's authority to represent or advocate on behalf of an individual with significant disabilities is determined
pursuant to State law. 

Two commenters objected to the absence of requirements in proposed  364.52 regarding the content of a waiver
and the appropriate solicitation of a waiver. One of the commenters also was concerned that the absence of conditions
on the use of waivers could allow service providers to circumvent the requirements of proposed   364.43
(provision of IL services by the State) and 364.53 (documentation of IL services provided to individuals). One of
the commenters also suggested that the regulations should require that consumers be advised of the need for an IL plan
and how the IL plan helps protect the consumer's rights. 

The Secretary agrees in part with the commenters and anticipates adding the words ``knowingly and voluntarily''
before the word ``signs'' in  364.52(a)(2) of the final regulations. The Secretary believes this is adequate
protection to prevent the possibility of service providers forcing consumers to sign ``waivers.'' The Secretary
does not believe that it is necessary to add further requirements regarding the waiver of an IL plan.

<PARENT> FR940706-2-00013 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Commenters suggested that proposed  364.53 be modified to recognize the fact that records may be electronic
as well as written.

The Secretary agrees with the commenters. With the exception of an IL plan or a waiver of an IL plan, both of which require
a consumer's signature, the Secretary anticipates revising  364.53 in the final regulations to allow records
to be maintained electronically.

Commenters suggested that the State standards in proposed  364.55 should not be permitted to exceed the standards
in section 725 of the Act.

The standards referred to in proposed  364.55 are actually the standards that the designated State unit (DSU)
is required to develop pursuant to proposed  365.31 for those service providers that are not centers or for centers
that are providing specialized IL services under a contract with the DSU. The Secretary anticipates adding language
to the final regulations to make this clear.

One commenter objected to the words ``other information'' in proposed  364.56(c)(2) because of the possibility
that service providers may use this language to withhold information from a consumer.

Proposed  364.56(c)(2) does not permit a service provider to withhold information from a consumer. Proposed
 364.56(c)(2) merely requires that, if a service provider determines that releasing medical, psychological,
or other information may be harmful if released directly to the consumer, the service provider shall release this
information to the consumer through a qualified medical or psychological professional or the individual's legally
authorized representative. The Secretary does not expect any change to  364.56(c)(2) in the final regulations.



Part 366



One commenter suggested adding a requirement to the selection criteria in proposed  366.27 that the governing
board be reflective of the localities to be served by the proposed center.

The Secretary believes that, rather than adding the suggested language to the selection criteria in proposed  366.27,
replacing the words ``another'' and ``other'' in proposed  366.28(a) with ``bordering'' and adding similar
language in   366.2(a)(1)(i), 366.28(a), and 366.29(a) of the final regulations is more appropriate.
In this manner, centers will be limited to operating within a ``local community,'' as required by section 702(1)(A)
of the Act.

One commenter considered the selection criterion in proposed  366.27(a)(2) too vague and suggested that it
be expanded to ``not appear to be the traditional `needs assessment' that creates more service providers.''

The Secretary believes that the criterion adequately explains how an applicant can be expected to identify the need
for a new center in a community and how the applicant plans to address this identified need. The Secretary does not expect
any change in the final regulations.

Commenters suggested reducing the points allotted to ``plan of operation'' and increasing points for ``involvement
of individuals with significant disabilities'' in the selection criteria in proposed  366.27(g) and (h),
respectively. Commenters also felt that the proposed selection criteria should include the involvement of individuals
with significant disabilities in the preparation of a center's application.

The Secretary believes that the points assigned to the ``plan of operation'' selection criterion appropriately
reflect its value. The Secretary agrees that participation of individuals with significant disabilities in the
preparation of applications is important and anticipates substituting the phrase ``developing the center's application''
for the phrase ``conducting center activities'' in  366.27(h)(1) of the final regulations.



Selection Criteria



In evaluating applications for grants under this competition, the Secretary uses the selection criteria in  366.27
of the notice of proposed rulemaking published in the 

Federal Register

 on May 12, 1994 (59 FR 24814, 24838-24839), with the anticipated changes discussed in this notice.

Applicants should prepare their applications based on the proposed regulations, as modified by the expected changes
contained in this notice. If additional changes are made in the final regulations that are currently undergoing review,
applicants will be given the opportunity to revise or resubmit their applications.




FOR APPLICATIONS:

 Telephone (202) 205-9315. Individuals who use a telecommunications device for the deaf (TDD) may call the Federal
Information Relay Service (FIRS) at 1-800-877-8339 between 8 a.m. and 8 p.m., Eastern time, Monday

 (a) The Education Department General Administrative Regulations (EDGAR) in 34 CFR Parts 75, 77, 79, 80, 81, 82, 85,
and 86; and (b) The regulations for this program in 34 CFR Part 367.

It is the policy of the Department of Education not to solicit applications before the publication of final regulations.
However, in this case, it is essential to solicit applications on the basis of the notice of proposed rulemaking, published
in the 

Federal Register

 on May 12, 1994 (59 FR 24814), because the Department's authority to obligate these funds will expire on September
30, 1994.

The comment period for the notice of proposed rulemaking ended on June 13, 1994. Six parties submitted comments on
proposed 34 CFR Part 367. The following is a summary of the comments received and of the changes that are expected to
be made, based on public comments, in the final regulations that are currently undergoing review.

Three commenters supported the proposed regulations as worded.

One commenter recommended adding the word ``may'' to proposed  367.3(b). (Although the commenter identified
the provision as  367.1(b), the comment makes sense only if applied to proposed  367.3(b).) The commenter
stated that the addition of the word ``may'' would give States flexibility in the event they have funds to cover other
services.

Proposed  367.3(a) states that a DSA ``may'' use funds awarded under proposed Part 367 for the activities described
in proposed   367.1 and in 367.3(b). The Secretary believes that this language already provides a DSA
with adequate flexibility in choosing which services will be provided to individuals in the State. Therefore, no
change to proposed  367.3(b) is expected in the final regulations.

One commenter suggested changing the definition of ``older individual who is blind'' in proposed  367.5 to
make it less restrictive. Because this term is specifically defined in section 751 of the Act, no change to this definition
in proposed  367.5 is expected in the final regulations.

One commenter recommended adding a definition of ``capacity building'' to proposed  367.5. The Secretary
does not believe a definition is necessary because a variety of possible opportunities already exists for local,
regional, and State ``capacity building.''

One commenter suggested that the list of services in proposed  367.22(g) should be the same as that provided
in proposed  367.3(b) and also suggested adding the word ``may'' to  367.22(g)(2). The commenter also
stated that the wording in proposed  367.22(g) could be construed to mean that grant funds have to be used for
all the listed services and that States should not have to duplicate services already provided by the State through
other sources.

The Secretary agrees that the list of services in these proposed provisions should be the same. The Secretary expects
that this change will be made to proposed   367.3(b) and 367.22(g)(2) in the final regulations. The Secretary
also agrees that Chapter 2 funds should be used in a way that will supplement services that may already be available
through other sources. The Secretary expects that proposed  367.22(g)(2) of the final regulations will be
changed to make clear that an application will be evaluated on the extent to which the DSA will use Chapter 2 funds to
meet the unmet independent living (IL) needs of individuals in the State.

One commenter recommended including older individuals who are blind in the selection of new methods and approaches
for the provision of IL services pursuant to proposed  364.28.

The Secretary believes that the views of older individuals who are blind will be adequately represented and addressed
by the Statewide Independent Living Council (SILC). The SILC and DSU have joint responsibility for development of
the State plan and for ensuring that consumers have the opportunity to comment on the development and revision of the
State plan during public hearings. The selection and incorporation into the State plan of any new approaches for the
provision of IL services to older individuals who are blind would require a revision to the State plan. Therefore,
the Secretary does not expect any changes in the final regulations.

Two commenters recommended deleting proposed  367.41(b), which restricts a DSA's flexibility to enter into
procurement contracts with public and private nonprofit agencies.

Although section 752(i)(2)(A) of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (Act), as amended, 29 U.S.C. 701-796i, is a
general provision that allows the DSA to operate or administer this program either directly or through grants or contracts,
section 752(g) of the Act requires that a State's awards to public and private nonprofit agencies and organizations
under this program be made only through grants. Therefore, no change to proposed  367.41(b) is expected in the
final regulations.

Applicants should prepare their applications based on the proposed regulations, as modified by the expected changes
contained in this notice. If additional changes are made in the final regulations that are currently undergoing review,
applicants will be given the opportunity to revise or resubmit their applications.

<DOCTITLE>State Vocational Rehabilitation Unit In-Service Training; </DOCTITLE>
Notice Inviting Applications for New Awards for Fiscal Year (FY) 
1994 


Purpose of Program


This program is designed to support projects for training State vocational rehabilitation unit personnel in program

Training program responds to needs identified in the comprehensive system of personnel development in section 101(a)(7)
of the Act. The program may include training designed (a) to address recruitment and retention of qualified rehabilitation
professionals; (b) to provide for succession planning; (c) to provide for leadership development and capacity building;
and (d) for fiscal year 1994, to provide training on the amendments to the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 made by the Rehabilitation
Act Amendments of 1992. 
Eligible Applicants: Only State agencies designated under a State plan for vocational rehabilitation services
under section 101(a) of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended, are eligible to receive an award under this program.

 August 8, 1994 


Deadline for Intergovernmental Review:

 September 7, 1994 


Applications Available:

 July 7, 1994 


Available Funds:

 $5,944,350, of which $4,755,480 is available for allocation to designated agencies for basic awards and $1,188,870
is available for allocation to high quality applications. (Specific information regarding funds available to be
allocated to designated State agencies for basic awards appears in the chart in this notice.) 


Estimated Range of Awards:

 $19,795_$300,680. 


Estimated Average Size of Awards:

 $73,387. 


Estimated Number of Awards:

 81.

 



Note:

 The Department is not bound by any estimate in this notice.

 



Project Period:

 Up to 36 months. 


Applicable Regulations:

 (a) The Education Department General Administrative Regulations (EDGAR) in 34 CFR Parts 75, 77, 79, 80, 81, 82, and
85; and (b) The regulations for this program in 34 CFR Part 388; and (c)   385.4 and 385.40 through 385.46
of 34 CFR Part 385. 


Priorities 


Under 34 CFR 75.105(c)(3) and proposed  385.22(a) the Secretary reserves funds to support some or all of the
proposals that have been awarded a rating of 80 points or more under the criteria described in proposed  388.20.
In making a final selection of proposals to support under this program, the Secretary considers the extent to which
proposals have exceeded a rating of 80 points and address one or more of the following absolute priorities: 


(1) Development and Dissemination of Model In-Service Training Materials and Practices 


The proposed project demonstrates an effective plan to develop and disseminate information on its State Vocational
Rehabilitation In-Service Training program, including the identification of training approaches and successful
practices, in order to permit the replication of these programs by other State vocational rehabilitation units.



(2) Distance Education 


The proposed project demonstrates innovative strategies for training State vocational rehabilitation unit personnel
through distance education methods, such as interactive audio, video, computer technologies, or existing telecommunications
networks. 


(3) Enhanced Employment Outcomes for Specific Populations 


The proposed project supports specialized training in the provision of vocational rehabilitation or related services
to individuals with disabilities to increase the rehabilitation rate into competitive employment for all individuals
or specified target groups. 
It is the policy of the Department of Education not to solicit applications before the publication of final regulations.
However, in this case, it is essential to solicit applications on the basis of the notice of proposed rulemaking, published
in the 

Federal Register

 on May 9, 1994 (59 FR 24000), because the Department's authority to obligate these funds will expire on September 30,
1994. 
The comment period for the notice of proposed rulemaking 
ended June 8, 1994. Sixteen parties submitted comments on the proposed regulations. The following is a summary of
the changes that are expected to be made in the final regulations that are currently undergoing review, based on the
public comment. 
Five commenters suggested deleting  388.21(a)(4), which 
provides a minimum share of not less than one-eighth of one percent of the amounts made available to Guam, American
Samoa, the Virgin Islands, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and the Republic of Palau. The commenters
believe agencies in the territories, some of which have as many employees as small designated State agencies, should
receive the same minimum share of not less than one-third of one percent of the amounts made available for the fiscal
year as provided in  388.21(a)(3) to small agencies. The Secretary agrees that the same minimum share provided
to small designated State agencies is appropriate for the specified territories. The Secretary also notes that the
territories are eligible to compete for the remaining funds to be allocated based on the quality of the application
as determined by competitive reviews conducted by the Department using the selection criteria in  388.20 and
the priorities in  388.22. The Secretary expects to revise  388.21(a) by deleting paragraph (4) so that
all grant recipients receive the same minimum share of the sums made available for the fiscal year. A revision of  388.30,
deleting paragraph (c), which provides special matching considerations for the territories, is also expected to
be made in the final regulations. 
Two commenters requested definitions for the terms ``succession planning'' and ``capacity building'' used in  388.1.
The Secretary notes that these terms are found in the statute, but are optional for State agencies to address in their
in-service training. There are alternative ways to address these terms, and the Secretary prefers not to define them,
thus leaving the widest possible discretion to State agencies. No change is expected to be made in the final regulations.


Three commenters addressed the requirement in  388.20(a)(2)(iii) for an annual needs assessment of in-service
training needs. The commenters believe an annual assessment is not necessary and recommend a comprehensive needs
assessment every three years and a less comprehensive review annually. The Secretary agrees that a comprehensive
assessment is not needed annually. A revision of  388.20(a)(2)(iii), deleting the word ``annual,'' is expected
to be made in the final regulations.

Three commenters noted that the regulations do not specify the length of projects. Recommendations of project periods
of 36 and 60 months were made. The Secretary notes that regulations usually do not specify project duration and instead
leave flexibility for the Secretary to determine an appropriate project period each time a competition is announced.
This notice solicits applications for a 36-month period. No change is expected to be made in the final regulations.

A commenter asked that the phrase ``in connection with a distance learning training course'' be dropped from the description
of allowable telecommunications and technology fees in  388.31(d). The Secretary agrees that distance learning
may include valuable in-service training activities, such as a lecture or technology demonstration, that are not
part of a training course. The Secretary expects to revise  388.31(d) by deleting the words ``in connection
with a distance learning training course.'' 
A commenter noted that it was an unnecessary limitation to require that distance education for rehabilitation workers
be at their job sites as stated in  388.22(b)(2). The commenter noted that it may be necessary or efficient for
an agency to gather a group of employees at a central location removed from individual offices for distance education.
The Secretary agrees that there is no compelling reason to require in this priority that training occur at an individual
job site. The Secretary expects to revise  388.22(b)(2) by deleting the words ``at their job sites.'' 
A commenter requested clarification of the heading for  388.22(b)(3), which refers to ``specific populations''
although the text that follows refers to ``all individuals or specified groups.'' The Secretary believes that it
is up to the State agency to determine whether in-service training to improve employment outcomes will be targeted
narrowly or broadly. Activities directed to improving employment outcomes for all population groups or for a specific
target group are permitted under this priority. No change is expected to be made in the final regulations. 
A commenter observed that the NPRM retains most of the language in the current regulations and does not accurately
reflect the Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1992 (the 1992 Amendments), particularly provisions related to State
and strategic plans. The Secretary believes that extensive changes have been proposed in the current regulations
and is confident that all requirements in the 1992 Amendments have been implemented. No change is expected to be made
in the final regulations. 
Two commenters supported reserving a portion of funds for priorities, but believe this reserve should be divided
between priorities based on need and priorities based on responsiveness or quality of the application and innovative
approaches. The Secretary believes that the three priorities listed in the proposed regulations address significant
needs of State agencies and that no further division of the priorities into categories is needed. No change is expected
to be made in the final regulations. 
Four commenters objected to the proposed formula in  388.21 whereby 80 percent of the funds available would
be distributed based on the number of staff and 20 percent of the funds available would be distributed based on quality.
They believe that the split penalizes States with small populations with limited capacity to write grants. In the
commenters' view, the distribution does not take into account extra travel costs in a State with a large geographic
area, and a commenter suggested increasing the small State agency minimum share. The Secretary believes that the
proposed formula maximizes the amount of funds available for basic awards while ensuring that a reasonable amount
is available for small agencies and for the Secretary's priorities. No change is expected to be made in the final regulations.

A commenter recommended dropping the priority in  388.22(b)(2) for distance education on the grounds that
there is no evidence that distance education produces better results at less cost. The Secretary believes that distance
education is needed in some States and wants to ensure that a mechanism exists to demonstrate innovative approaches
to learning. No change is expected to be made in the final regulations. 
Two commenters recommended deleting  388.20(f)(1)(ii) of the evaluation selection criteria that would judge
in-service training outcomes by the extent to which training results in improved individual competency through
licensure, certification, or award of academic degrees or certificates. The commenters believe in-service training
to be short-term and job-based; therefore, reference to improved individual competency through degree-based programs
should be dropped. The Secretary believes that, in response to the need to increase the number of qualified rehabilitation
personnel, academic outcomes must be included among the measures of in-service training programs. No change is expected
to be made in the final regulations. 
Three commenters observed that reviewers for in-service proposals should be well qualified, represent diverse
populations, and be identified by name and program affiliation after the review is completed. They commented that
all applicants should receive reviewer comments. The Secretary agrees that reviewers must be qualified and representative
of the diverse populations and agencies assisted through in-service training. The Secretary does make summary information
available on characteristics of reviewers but believes the specific reviewers of proposals should remain anonymous.
All applicants are provided with the reviewer comments on their applications when the review is completed. No change
is expected to be made in the final regulations. 
A commenter noted that  388.21 does not state what the minimum score is that an applicant must receive in order
for its application to be approved by the Secretary or how it is to be computed. In order to make funding decisions, the
Secretary will set a minimum score for each competition after all applications have been reviewed. The minimum score
will be computed through an analysis of all reviewed applications to determine those that are in the fundable range.
No change is expected to be made in the final regulations.

A commenter observed that  388.1 should be revised, and the regulations changed throughout, to emphasize human
resource development in place of training. Peer reviewers should be oriented to human resource development prior
to their service as reviewers. The Secretary agrees that the term human resource development is descriptive of many
appropriate activities under this program. However, the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended, uses the term ``in-service
training,'' so that term is used in the regulations. No change is expected to be made in the final regulations. 
Regarding  388.22, which sets the Secretary's priorities, a commenter asked if an application that addresses
issues or activities other than the three priorities listed can be eligible for quality funds. The Secretary responds
that only applications that respond to the priorities already identified by the Secretary in the regulations for
this program or priorities established through future rulemaking will be considered when allocating the quality
funds. No change is expected to be made in the final regulations. 
Applicants should prepare their applications based on the proposed regulations, as modified by the expected changes
contained in this notice. If additional changes are made in the final regulations that are currently undergoing review,
applicants will be given the opportunity to revise or resubmit their applications.

City of Hamilton; Notice of Availability of Environmental Assessment



June 29, 1994.



In accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's
(Commission's) regulations, 18 CFR part 380 (Order 486, 52 FR 47897), the Commission's Office of Hydropower Licensing
has reviewed a non-capacity related amendment of license for the City of Hamilton Hydroelectric Project, No. 2724-008.
The City of Hamilton Hydroelectric Project is located on the Miami River in Butler County, Ohio. The application is
for approval to remove and replace the existing powerhouse superstructure and lowering the elevation of the powerhouse
and generating unit. An Environmental Assessment (EA) was prepared for the application. The EA finds that approving
the application would not constitute a major federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment.

Copies of the EA are available for review in the Public Reference Branch, Room 3104, of the Commission's offices at
941 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426.

<DOCTITLE>National Defense Authorization Act Proposed Procedures_Central Valley Project, California </DOCTITLE>


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Western Area Power Administration, DOE. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of Proposed Procedures to Implement Section 2929 of the 1994 National Defense Authorization Act (National
Defense Authorization Act, Pub. L. No. 103-160, 107 Stat. 1547, 1935 (1993)).

 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Western Area Power Administration (Western), a Federal power marketing agency of the Department of Energy (DOE),
has developed proposed procedures to fulfill the requirements of section 2929 of the National Defense Authorization
Act for fiscal year 1994 (National Defense Authorization Act, Pub. L. No. 103-160, 107 Stat. 1547, 1935 (1993))
(NDA Act). Under the proposed procedures to implement the requirements of the NDA Act, Western would allocate up to
119.223 megawatts (MW) of Power from the Central Valley Project (CVP), which represents the amount of CVP Power provided
as of November 30, 1993, to military installations. The NDA Act was signed into public law on November 30, 1993. Section
2929 of the NDA Act provides that, for a 10-year period beginning on November 30, 1993, the electric power allocations
provided as of November 30, 1993, by Western from the CVP to military installations in the State of California which
have been closed or approved for closure pursuant to the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act of 1990 (part A, Title
XXIX, Pub. L. 101-510; 10 U.S.C. 2687 note) (1990 Act) shall be reserved for sale through Long-Term Contracts
to Preference Entities which agree to use such Power to promote economic development at a military installation that
is closed or approved for closure pursuant to the 1990 Act. To the extent Power reserved by the NDA Act is not disposed
of through Long-Term Contracts, it shall be made available on a temporary basis during such 10-year period to military
installations in the State of California through Short-Term Contracts. By implementing these Procedures, Western
will establish the criteria to allocate the Power made available as a result of the NDA Act. 



The procedures set forth in this 

Federal Register

 will explain in detail how Western intends to implement the NDA Act. Under the proposed NDA Act Procedures, Western
has identified the Power that will be classified as NDA Act Power and the types of services and contracts that will be
offered. Also set forth under the proposed NDA Act Procedures are the general eligibility criteria that Western will
apply to all applicants requesting an Allocation of NDA Act Power, and the procedures to be used by applicants when
applying for NDA Act Power, which include demonstration that certain economic development criteria are being met.
Lastly, Western has set forth the procedures that will be used in allocating NDA Act Power to eligible applicants,
including a priority list developed by Western for allocating NDA Act Power. In general, the proposed Procedures
provide that the allocation of CVP Power as of November 30, 1993, at a military installation that is closed or approved
for closure under the 1990 Act will be classified as NDA Act Power and will be reserved through November 30, 2003, for
use at that military installation. Until the NDA Act Power is fully utilized at that military installation, the NDA
Act Power will be made available on a temporary basis as described in Section G.1. of the NDA Act Procedures.

NDA Act Power will be available to the following types of entities, in the following priority: 
1. First for a military load at a Closed Military Installation that received CVP Power as of November 30, 1993, or to
qualified preference entities promoting economic development at such closed military installation. 
2. Second, on a recallable basis with 3 years' notice, to a qualified preference entity promoting economic development
at a Closed Military Installation that did not have CVP Power as of November 30, 1993. 
3. Third, on a recallable basis with 6 months' notice, to a military branch which had CVP Power at a Closed Military Installation
as of November 30, 1993, for use within that military branch at a military installation within the CVP marketing area.

4. Fourth, on a recallable basis with 6 months' notice, to any military branch for use at a military installation within
the CVP marketing area, or to a negatively affected customer. 





<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On October 5, 1992, Western's Sacramento Area Office published notice of the Final 1994 Power Marketing Plan, Central
Valley Project, California (57 FR 45782), governing allocations of 529.946 MW of Power from the CVP. That notice provided
the final allocation of a total of 119.223 MW of Power to certain Department of Defense (DOD) military installations,
as specified in Appendix A herein. Contracts for such Power were entered into for a term ending December 31, 2004. The
power contracts with the DOD agencies allow for certain shifts of Power among military installations with approval
by Western. Effective November 30, 1993, such shifts became subject to the NDA Act. 



As of the date of publication of this 

Federal Register

, the following military installations are scheduled to close pursuant to the 1990 Act: 








Western is providing notice by this 

Federal Register

 that 34.209 MW of the total possible 119.223 MW (as shown in Appendix A) will be allocated pursuant to the final NDA Act
Procedures on a first-come, first-served basis beginning 30 days after publication of the final procedures. As any
of the remaining amount of 85.014 MW becomes available for allocation, pursuant to the NDA Act, Western will provide
notification of the availability of that Power. 


Proposed Procedures for the NDA Act 


These proposed procedures address how Western plans to allocate up to 119.223 MW of CVP contract rate of delivery (CROD)
provided as of November 30, 1993, to military installations closed or approved for closure pursuant to the 1990 Act.
When determining who will receive Allocations of Power, Western will exercise its discretion as provided by law.

increase at a Priority-One Base, the Allottee may request and Western may allocate any amount of NDA Act Power up to
the Priority-One Base's NDA Act Power Entitlement to meet such increase in loads. If necessary, Western may recall
NDA Act Power under the general allocation and contract principles to allocate to the Priority-One Base. 


G. General Allocation and Contract Principles


The general allocation criteria and contract principles established in the Marketing Plan shall apply to Allocations
of NDA Act Power. To meet the specific requirements of the NDA Act, Western shall also apply the following allocation
criteria to all applicants seeking an Allocation of NDA Act Power. All Allocations of NDA Act Power shall be at the sole
discretion of Western and shall be determined on a case-by-case basis. 
Allocations of NDA Act Power will be made in amounts solely determined by Western, subject to the final NDA Act Procedures.

1. Allocation Rights: 
 Western will allocate NDA Act Power to qualified applicants based on the following hierarchy:

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940706-2-00036 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940706-2-00022 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(ii) Second, to a Preference Entity at a Priority-One Base for amounts in excess of the NDA Act Power Entitlement for
such base, to serve a military load or to promote an economic development project; or to a Preference Entity promoting
an economic development project at a Priority-Two Base. 
 NDA Act Power allocated under this paragraph will be subject to recall upon a 3-year written notice in order to fulfill
an Allocation to a Priority-One Base which has not fully utilized its NDA Act Power Entitlement under G.1.(i) above.

 (iii) Third, to a military branch which had a CVP CROD at a Closed Military Installation as of November 30, 1993, for
use at a Priority-Three Base within that military branch within the CVP Marketing Area. 
 NDA Act Power allocated under this paragraph will be subject to recall upon a 6-month written notice in order to serve
a Priority-One or Priority-Two Base. 
 (iv) Fourth, to any military branch for use at a Priority-Three Base within the CVP Marketing Area, or to a Negatively
Affected Customer. 
 NDA Act Power allocated under this subparagraph will be subject to recall upon a 6-month written notice to serve a Priority-One
or Priority-Two Base, or a Priority-Three Base pursuant to G.1.(iii) above. 


2. Allocation of NDA Act Power
 

Western will use the following procedures to allocate NDA Act Power to a qualified applicant: 
 (i) Western will determine whether sufficient Unutilized NDA Act Power is available to fulfill the applicant's request.

 (ii) If sufficient Unutilized NDA Act Power is available to fulfill the applicant's request, Western shall allocate
the amount needed. 
 (iii) If sufficient Unutilized NDA Act Power is not available to fulfill the applicant's request, Western shall allocate
all Unutilized NDA Act Power and recall and reallocate NDA Act Power CROD to fulfill the request by following the reallocation
procedures stated in G.3. below. 
 (iv) To ensure the most equitable distribution of long-term firm NDA Act and Type III Withdrawable NDA Act Power, Western
proposes that each Allocation of NDA Act Power shall be determined as follows: 








D is defined as Long-Term Firm NDA Act Power available at the time of the Allocation. 
E is defined as Type III Withdrawable NDA Act Power available at the time of the Allocation. 
 

If using the above procedure would result in an Allocation of Long-Term Firm NDA Act Power which is less than 500 kW,
Western will modify the procedure to ensure that the Allottee receives a minimum of 500 kW of Long-Term Firm NDA Act
Power. 
 (v) Allocations will be made only to those applicants who qualify pursuant to the final NDA Act Procedures. The NDA
Act Power must be used at a Closed Military Installation or a Priority-Three Base, or the NDA Act Power must be used by
a Negatively Affected Customer. 
 (vi) The Allottee has the right to purchase NDA Act Power only when a new electric service contract between Western
and the Allottee has been executed and when all conditions precedent in that contract have been satisfied. 
 (vii) To consummate any Allocation of NDA Act Power, an electric service contract shall be executed within 6 months
of a contract offer by Western, unless otherwise agreed in writing by Western. 
 (viii) Western reserves the right to recall any amount of NDA Act Power CROD from an Allottee if the NDA Act Power CROD
allocated is in excess of the loads being served by the Allottee. 
 (ix) Subject to the final NDA Act Procedures, Western's Administrator has the sole discretion to reallocate any NDA
Act Power CROD that becomes available for marketing if an Allottee has failed to accept a contract within the period
allowed, or if a contract has terminated, subject to the final NDA Act Procedures. 


3. Reallocation Procedures 
 

When Western must recall NDA Act Power CROD in order to meet a request for NDA Act Power, Western will use the following
procedures and hierarchy: 
 (i) Allottees receiving Power pursuant to section G.1.(iv) above. This Power is subject to recall by Western upon
a 6-month written notice. 
 (ii) Allottees receiving Power pursuant to section G.1.(iii) above. This Power is subject to recall by Western upon
a 6-month written notice.

<TEXT>
 

(iii) Allottees receiving Power pursuant to section G.1.(ii) above. This Power is subject to recall by Western upon
a 3-year written notice. 
 (iv) If Western determines that a partial recall of NDA Act Power from any of the priority groups identified above is
necessary to fulfill the request, Western shall apply the following formula to determine the amount of NDA Act Power
to be recalled from each Allottee. 









A is defined as each Allottee's contribution to the sum of the NDA Act Power CROD for all Allottees in the priority group.

 B is the sum of all Allottees' NDA Act Power CROD in the priority group. 
 C is the requested amount to be recalled from the priority group. 


4. Withdrawal Procedures

 

When Western is required to initiate withdrawals of Type III Withdrawable NDA Act Power pursuant to the Final Withdrawal
Procedures, Western shall determine the amount to be withdrawn from each Allottee by using the Final Withdrawal Procedures.
Western will then total the amounts to be withdrawn from each Allottee and will use the following hierarchy to initiate
withdrawals of the Type III Withdrawable NDA Act Power: 
 (i) Allottees receiving Power pursuant to section G.1.(iv). 
 (ii) Allottees receiving Power pursuant to section G.1.(iii). 
 (iii) Allottees receiving Power pursuant to section G.1.(ii). 
 (iv) Allottees receiving Power pursuant to section G.1.(i). 
 (v) If Western determines that a partial withdrawal of Type III Withdrawable NDA Act Power from any of the above-mentioned
groups is necessary, Western shall apply the following formula to determine the amount of Type III Withdrawable NDA
Act Power to be withdrawn.

5. Contract Terms for the Purpose of NDA Act Power


(i) Long-Term Contracts:
Western proposes that Long-Term Contracts entered into under the final NDA Act Procedures shall provide for electric
service for a period ending by December 31, 2004, and be subject to the reallocation procedures set forth in the final
NDA Act Procedures. The effective date of the Long-Term Contract shall be determined by Western at the time of the contract
offer. To abide by the requirements of the NDA Act, Western shall have the right to recall all or any part of the NDA Act
Power CROD.

(ii) Short-Term Contracts:

Western proposes that Short-Term Contracts entered into under the final NDA Act Procedures shall provide for electric
service during a temporary period ending by December 31, 2004, subject to the reallocation procedures set forth in
the final NDA Act Procedures. The effective date of the Short-Term Contract shall be determined by Western at the time
of the contract offer. To abide by the requirements of the NDA Act, Western shall have the right to recall all or any part
of the NDA Act Power CROD.

(iii) For any applicant requesting NDA Act Power to be used for an economic development project, the point of delivery
for the NDA Act Power must be at the Closed Military Installation where the NDA Act Power will be used, unless otherwise
agreed to by Western.

(iv) The minimum Long-Term Firm NDA Act Power CROD shall be 500 kW.

(v) Transmission Service:

All transmission arrangements beyond Western's CVP system are the full responsibility of the Allottee. Western
will assist the Allottee in obtaining third-party transmission arrangements with PG&E for delivery of Power
allocated under the final NDA Act Procedures. Nonetheless, each Allottee is ultimately responsible for obtaining
its own delivery arrangements. Western reserves the right to terminate a contract if the Allottee is unable to arrange
for the transmission necessary to receive the CROD within 6 months of the execution of the contract.

(vi) For those Allottees that receive NDA Act Power to be used at a Closed Military Installation, the following provisions
must be complied with:

(A) Western reserves the right to terminate a contract if the Allottee cannot demonstrate that it is using the NDA Act
Power for an economic development project within 1 year of the execution of the contract, unless otherwise agreed.

(B) The Allottee must provide a report to Western each January 15, which describes the benefits of the NDA Act Power
CROD being passed on to the organization operating the economic development project. This report must be provided
to Western in such a way that Western can separately identify the composite energy and capacity costs stated in mills
per kWh of NDA Act Power and non-NDA Act Power. The report must also show that the economic development project is still
in operation.

(C) Western, at its sole discretion, shall have the right to either withdraw NDA Act Power or terminate its contract
with the Allottee upon 30 days' written notice if the Allottee does not comply with G.5.(vi)(B) above for each year
of the contract.

(vii) Standard Provisions:

The contracts entered into as a result of the final NDA Act Procedures will incorporate Western's standard provisions
for power sales contracts, resale of electric energy, and conservation and renewable energy in addition to the General
Power Contract Provisions. Western is in the process of developing procedures to require that all long-term firm
customers develop an integrated resource plan consistent with the Energy Policy Act of 1992. It is anticipated that
these procedures will be effective in late 1994.

 Regulatory Procedure Requirements


Regulatory Flexibility Analysis



Pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, 5 U.S.C. 601 et seq., each agency, when required to publish a proposed
rule, is further required to prepare and make available for public comment an initial regulatory flexibility analysis
to describe the impact of the rule on small entities. Western has determined that (1) this rulemaking relates to services
offered by Western and, therefore, is not a rule within the purview of the Act, and (2) the impacts of an Allocation from
Western would not cause an adverse economic impact to such entities. The requirements of this Act can be waived if the
head of the agency certifies that the rule will not, if promulgated, have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities. By his execution of this Federal Register

 notice, Western's Administrator certifies that no significant economic impact on a substantial number of small
entities will occur.



Environmental Compliance



The National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, 42 U.S.C.  4321 

et seq.

, and implementing regulations issued by the Council on Environmental Quality, 40 CFR  1500 

et seq.

, and the Department of Energy, 10 CFR  1021, require that the environmental effects of agency decisions be studied
and considered by decision makers. Studies were made to determine whether there were significant impacts to the environment
as a result of the original allocation of this Power to the military installations. These studies and analysis are
published in the Revised Environmental Assessment and Finding of No Significant Impact which were prepared by Western
for its Sacramento Area Office 1994 Power Marketing Plan. Western is examining the applicability of the 1994 Revised
Environmental Assessment to these Power allocations.



Paperwork Reduction Act Of 1980



The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, 44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq.

, requires that certain information collection requirements be approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)
before information is requested of the public. OMB has issued a final rule on the Paperwork Burdens on the Public, 48
FR 13666, March 31, 1983.



Determination Under Executive Order 12866



DOE has determined that this is not a significant regulatory action because it does not meet the criteria of Executive
Order 12866, 58 FR 51735. Western has an exemption from centralized regulatory review under Executive Order 12866;
accordingly, no clearance of this notice by OMB is required.

Title: 

Spill Prevention, Control, and Countermeasures (SPCC) Plans (EPA No. 0328.04; OMB No. 2050-0021).



Abstract: 

This ICR is an extension of an existing collection for Spill Prevention, Control, and Countermeasures (SPCC) planning
requirements in support of the Clean Water Act at paragraph (1) Section 311 (j), and described at 40 CFR 112. The information
will be used by the EPA to ensure that oil spill prevention planning occurs, thereby ensuring compliance with the requirements
of 40 CFR 112.

Under this ICR, owners or operators of affected facilities must: (1) Prepare the SPCC plan (40 CFR 112.3 and 112.7),
(2) maintain the plan and appropriate records (40 CFR 112.3 and 112.7(e)) if they begin operations or significantly
modify their facilities during the approval period, (3) submit the plan in the event of certain discharges of oil (40
CFR 112.4), (4) revise the plan following modification of the facility (40 CFR 112.5(a)), and (5) conduct a triennial
review of the SPCC plan (40 CFR 112(b)).

The SPCC plan should describe: (1) possible equipment failures that could lead to a discharge of oil from the facility
(40 CFR 112.7(b)); (2) the use of required preventive measures such as appropriate containment and/or diversion
structures or equipment (40 CFR 112.7(c)), or if containment is not available, an oil spill contingency plan and a
written commitment of manpower, equipment and materials required to expeditiously control and remove any harmful
quantity of oil discharged (40 CFR 112.7(d)); and (3) a discussion of the more detailed planning requirements (40
CFR 112.7(c)).

In addition to these general requirements, onshore facilities must maintain records of maintenance and usage of
bypass valves and comparison records on past inspections of aboveground storage tanks. Offshore facilities must
maintain written procedures for inspecting and testing pollution prevention equipment, keep records of well shut-in
valves, prepare written instructions for contractors and subcontractors, and maintain records of inspection of
submarine pipelines.

Currently there are 450,360 facilities subject to this regulation, with an estimated increase in the regulated universe
of 4,549 facilities per year over the next three years. Facility records related to compliance must be maintained
for three years.



Burden Statement: 

Public reporting burden for new facilities subject to this collection of information is estimated to range between
39.6 and 100.6 hours per response, with an average of 40.5 hours including time for reviewing the Oil Pollution Prevention
regulations, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining data, and preparing and reviewing the
SPCC plan. The annual recordkeeping burden for existing facilities is estimated to range from 5.0 to 13.9 hours per
respondent, with an average recordkeeping burden of 5.5 hours including time for maintaining. reviewing and updating
the SPCC plan.



Respondents: 

Owners or operators of subject facilities as defined at 40 CFR 112.



Estimated Number of Respondents: 

4,549 new facilities will be required to prepare a plan; an annual average of 454,878 existing facilities over the
next three years will be required to maintain records and submit amendments as needed.



Estimated Number of Responses Per Respondent:

Title: 

Needs Survey of Publicly-Owned Wastewater Treatment Works (POTWs) in the United States (EPA ICR No. 0318.06; OMB
Control No. 2040-0050).



Abstract: 

This is an extension of an existing information collection sponsored by the Office of Water in support of the requirements
set forth by Sections 205(a) and 516(b) of the Clean Water Act (CWA). The CWA requires EPA to conduct a ``needs survey''
every two years as a joint effort of the respondents (States, territories, and the District of Columbia), and EPA's
Office of Water and Regional Offices to gather construction cost estimates and technical data on all existing and
proposed POTWs. The survey results enable EPA, States and Congress to accurately assess construction requirements
and develop allotment formulas for wastewater treatment resource allocations.

Respondents will provide information that includes: 1) updated technical and construction cost information on
municipal wastewater treatment facilities, 2) planning documentation relevant to construction or project costs
of POTWs (capital improvement plans, diagnostics results of needs for construction, etc.), 3) justification of
certain specified categories of need based on construction costs curves, and 4) population anomalies relevant to
POTWs. Respondents will also be asked to provide information related to combined sewer overflows (CSOs), non-point
source and stormwater discharges. The majority of respondents will enter the information using EPA's on-line computerized
system.

EPA will manage the conduct of the survey, perform quality control and assurance on the needs survey database, and
prepare the final report to Congress using the information provided by the respondents.



Burden Statement: 

Public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated to average 248 hours per response including
time for reviewing instructions, gathering and compiling the data needed, and completing and reviewing the survey
information.



Respondents: 

State, territorial and District of Columbia government agencies responsible for oversight of POTWs.



Estimated Number of Respondents:

<DOCTITLE>Publication of Addenda for Data Reporting; Requirements for Pesticide Assessment Guidelines (N, E, and K)</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).




</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of availability; request for comment. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This notice announces the availability of and requests comments regarding the proposed addenda which includes a
draft Data Reporting Guidelines (DRG) for those environmental chemistry methods associated with Subdivision N,
E, and K. This draft DRG is not intended to introduce any new data requirements or revisions into the existing guidelines.
Its purpose is to further clarify technical aspects of the existing Pesticide Assessment Guidelines and to provide
a format for organizing and submitting soil and water methods and their supporting data in order to facilitate their
review. EPA recognizes there are sections of the draft DRG that do not apply to specific soil and water methods; therefore,
registrants should exercise scientific judgement in deciding which sections apply to their methods. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The draft DRG provides the registrant with a detailed format for submitting soil and water methods to the Agency. Each
method should be complete and meet the technical requirements identified in the DRG. Those methods should be sent
to the Agency to support specific exposure, environmental fate, and ecological effects studies during the normal
registration and reregistration cycle. Each study for which environmental chemistry methods are needed has been
clearly identified below. Soil and water methods should be clearly written and capable of being repeated by chemists
in Federal and state laboratories.


The draft DRG is not intended to introduce any requirements. Its purpose is to further clarify technical aspects of
the existing Pesticide Assessment Guidelines and to provide a format for organizing and submitting soil and water
methods used to generate study data and to facilitate their review. The studies involved are: 





Subdivision N

 -  Environmental Fate





Series 164-1 -  Terrestrial Field Dissipation Studies 

1


Series 164-2 -  Aquatic Field Dissipation Studies
Series 164-3 -  Forest Field Dissipation Studies
Series 164-5 -  Long Term Soil Dissipation Studies 

1






Series 165-3 -  Accumulation Studies in Irrigation Crops
Series 166-1 -  Groundwater Study







Subdivision E

 -  Hazard Evaluation

Series 71-5 -  Simulated and Actual Field Testing for Mammals and Birds
Series 72-7 -  Simulated and Actual Field Testing and Aquatic Organisms








Subdivision K

 -  Reentry Protection





Series 132-1 -  Soil Dislodgeable Residue Dissipation Studies





These addenda supercede the paragraphs in the respective guidelines and the other addenda issued by the Pesticide
Program regarding soil and water methods sent to the Agency for the studies identified above.
While these addenda to the Guidelines are not mandatory, data submitters are strongly encouraged to follow the format
to assure that reports will be consistent, thereby increasing the efficiency of pesticide registration, reregistration,
and other regulatory activities.
This is the ninth addendum to Subdivision N-Environmental Fate (Chemistry) published by the Agency. This new addenda
with the draft DRG has been sent to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the Food and Drug Administration, and other
organizations within EPA for comment. With this notice EPA plans to make the DRG available to the public for comment
in the 

Federal Register

. 
The Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) requires the registration of all pesticides that
are manufactured for use in the United States. In order to obtain a registration from EPA, manufacturers must demonstrate
that their pesticides do not cause any unreasonable adverse effects to human health and the environment. It is now
considered appropriate to provide available soil and water residue methods to EPA because of the increased public
concern regarding the contamination of the environment with pesticides. EPA will validate some of those methods
and may assemble them into a new manual in order to make them available to address potential environmental problems.
This DRG provides more detailed technical guidance regarding those analytical methods and amends Pesticide Assessment
Guideline N, E, and K referred to earlier. 
These methods may be validated in an EPA laboratory to determine if they identify and quantify the pesticide parent
compound, toxicologically significant metabolites, and degradates at the level indicated. The results from the
soil and water method validation program may be used to support regulatory decisions regarding the reliability and
validity of the chemistry data sent to the Agency with exposure, environmental fate, and ecological effects studies.

 Notice of Intent to Cancel (NOIC).






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 Pursuant to section 6(b) of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA), this Notice announces
EPA's intent to cancel the following pesticide registrations for simazine products used in swimming pools, hot tubs,
and whirlpool baths: Nuclo Dry Granular Algaecide (EPA Reg. No. 7124-32) and Nuclo Dry Algaecide 90 (EPA Reg.
No. 7124-93), produced by Alden Leeds, Inc.; and Winterizing Algaecide (EPA Reg. No. 3432-33) and Algicil
Plus (EPA Reg. No. 3432-54), produced by N. Jonas Company. EPA is taking this action because it believes that
the use of the products, in accordance with widespread and commonly recognized practice, generally causes unreasonable
adverse effects on the environment. Specifically, EPA is concerned with potential cancer and non-cancer effects
resulting from exposure to simazine in swimming pools. EPA believes that the risks from this particular simazine
use exceed the benefits derived from this use. Effective the date of final cancellation, EPA will not allow further
sale, distribution, or use of existing stocks of these products, as described in this Notice. Holders of existing
stocks are subject to FIFRA section 6(g) reporting requirements.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 



I. Introduction 



This Notice announces EPA's intent to cancel the following pesticide registrations for simazine products used in
swimming pools, hot tubs, and whirlpool baths: Nuclo Dry Granular Algaecide (EPA Reg. No. 7124-32), Nuclo Dry
Algaecide 90 (EPA Reg. No. 7124-93), Winterizing Algaecide (EPA Reg. No. 3432-33), and Algicil Plus (EPA
Reg. No. 3432-54). For the reasons set forth below, the Administrator has made the determination that these
products, when used in accordance with widespread and commonly recognized practice, generally cause unreasonable
adverse effects on the environment. 



A. Organization of this Notice 



This Notice is divided into 13 units. This unit provides introductory information and describes the legal authority
for this action. Unit II gives the background information on how EPA arrived at its decision to cancel these products.
Unit III summarizes EPA's toxicology concerns. Unit IV outlines the exposure assessment. Unit V discusses EPA's
risk concerns. Unit VI examines the benefits of these products and the impact of this proposed cancellation action.
Unit VII provides the risk/benefit analysis. Unit VIII describes the role of the Scientific Advisory Panel and the
Secretary of Agriculture. Unit IX discusses disposition of existing product stocks. Unit X provides the required
notification for possession of canceled products. Unit XI outlines the procedures for implementing the actions
required by this Notice, as well as the procedures for requesting a hearing. Unit XII lists the references to the supporting
documentation. Unit XIII gives information on the public docket. 



B. Legal Authority 



Before a pesticide product may be lawfully sold or distributed in either intrastate or interstate commerce, the product
must be registered by EPA pursuant to FIFRA section 3(a) (7 U.S.C. 136a(a)). A registration is a license allowing a
pesticide product to be sold and distributed for specified uses in accordance with use instructions, precautions,
and other terms and conditions of the registration. 

In order to obtain a registration for a pesticide under FIFRA, an applicant must demonstrate that the pesticide satisfies
the statutory standard for registration, section 3(c)(5) of FIFRA (7 U.S.C. 136a(c)(5)). That standard requires,
among other things, that the pesticide performs its intended function without causing ``unreasonable adverse effects
on the environment.'' The term ``unreasonable adverse effects on the environment'' is defined under FIFRA section
2(bb) as ``any unreasonable risk to man or the environment, taking into account the economic, social, and environmental
costs and benefits of the use of any pesticide'' (7 U.S.C. 136(bb)). This standard requires a finding that the benefits
of the use of the pesticide exceed the risks of use, when the pesticide is used in compliance with the terms and conditions
of registration or in accordance with commonly recognized practices. The burden of demonstrating that a pesticide
product satisfies the statutory criteria for registration is at all times on the proponents of registration, and
continues as long as the registration is in effect 
(

Industrial Union Dept. v. American Petroleum Institute

, 448 U.S. 607, 653 n.61 (1980);

 Environmental Defense Fund V. EPA

, 510 F. 2d 1292, 1297 (D.C. Cir. 1975)). 

Under FIFRA section 6(b), EPA may issue a notice of intent to cancel the registration of a pesticide product whenever
it appears to the Administrator that the product, when used in accordance with widespread and generally recognized
practice, generally causes unreasonable effects (7 U.S.C. 136d(b)). 

Registrants and other adversely affected persons may request a hearing on the cancellation of a specified registration
and use. If they do so in a legally effective manner, the registration and use will be continued pending a decision at
the conclusion of an administrative hearing. 



II. Background 



In 1989, EPA classified simazine as a possible human carcinogen (Ref. 1). Simazine is used primarily as an agricultural
herbicide; swimming pool use accounts for less than 2 percent of total simazine usage. In August 1993, EPA conducted
a risk assessment for the swimming pool use (Ref. 2). The risk assessment revealed high potential cancer and non-cancer
health risks to children and adults exposed to water treated with simazine algaecides. 

Because of its risk concerns, EPA requested that the 13 registrants of the simazine swimming pool algaecides cease
product formulation and voluntarily cancel their product registrations (Refs. 3 and 4). In response to EPA's request,
nine of the registrants--A & V, Great Lakes Biochemical, Applied Biochemists, Aqua Clear Industries, Western
Purity Biochemical, Poolmaster, Leslie's Pool Supplies, York Chemical, and Quantum Biochemical--requested a
FIFRA section 6(f) voluntary product cancellation. Also, pursuant to FIFRA section 4(i)(5)(D), EPA canceled two
registrations held by EZ-Clor Systems and one held by N. Jonas Company, for failure to pay the annual registration
maintenance fees for those registrations. The cancellation order for the registrations held by these 11 registrants
was published on April 15, 1994 (59 FR 18120). A separate order, cancelling the registration of Aladdin Winter Care
(EPA Reg. No. 11329-17) for failure to pay the annual registration maintenance fee for that product registration,
was signed on May 16, 1994. The order was published in the 

Federal Register

 and became effective on May 25, 1994 (59 FR 27016). 

Alden Leeds and N. Jonas Co. still hold the following registrations for the following simazine products: Nuclo Dry
Granular Algaecide (EPA Reg. No. 7124-32), Nuclo Dry Algaecide 90 (EPA Reg. No. 7124-93), Winterizing
Algaecide (EPA Reg. No. 3432-33), and Algicil Plus (EPA Reg. No. 3432-54). 

The three registrants of technical simazine--Ciba-Geigy, Drexel Chemical, and Oxon-Italia--are not supporting
the swimming pool simazine use. That is, these manufacturers of the simazine active ingredient do not have their simazine
products registered for swimming pool-related uses. None of Drexel Chemical's products were registered for aquatic
use, and Ciba-Geigy and Oxon-Italia had ceased supporting all aquatic uses before EPA conducted its risk assessment.
The aquatic-use cancellation for Ciba-Geigy, the supplier of technical simazine for the swimming pool products,
was published in the 

Federal Register

 on July 1, 1992 (57 FR 29309) and became effective on October 9, 1992. The notice of Oxon-Italia's request for aquatic
use cancellations was published in the 

Federal Register

 on February 9, 1994 (59 FR 6021), and became effective 90 days from that publication date. At EPA's request, Ciba-Geigy
and Oxon-Italia have amended their product labels to explicitly prohibit reformulation of their products into swimming
pool products; Drexel has amended its technical simazine label to prohibit formulation into aquatic-use products.
Because manufacturers of simazine swimming pool products must formulate their products from technical simazine,
the effect of these actions is that there is no legal source of simazine active ingredient from which the swimming pool
product manufacturers may formulate any simazine products. 



III. Summary of Toxicological Concerns 



Based on toxicological studies in laboratory animals, EPA has determined that simazine may pose cancer and non-cancer
risks to individuals exposed to this pesticide. The results of these studies, as well as the EPA classification of
the carcinogenic potential of simazine, are described below. 



A. Carcinogenicity 



EPA reviewed the simazine toxicological data base, including rat and mouse chronic feeding/carcinogenicity studies,
in its evaluation of the carcinogenic potential of simazine. 

1.

 Rat study.

 In a 2-year chronic feeding carcinogenicity study, simazine technical was administered in the diet of 340 male
and 340 female Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats (MRID No. 40614405). The study had two phases: a carcinogenicity phase and
a chronic phase. An equal number of male and female rats were randomly divided into four major groups; 50 animals/sex/group
were used in the carcinogenicity phase, and 30 to 40 animals/sex/group were used in the chronic phase. Animals were
dosed at 0 (control), 10, 100, or 1,000 ppm of simazine for 2 years (corresponding to 0.41, 4.17, or 45.77 mg/kg/day
in males; and 0.52, 5.34, or 63.10 mg/kg/day in females). 

For the carcinogenicity phase, results in the female SD rats indicated that there was a statistically significant
dose-related trend in mammary gland carcinomas, as well as in combined adenomas and carcinomas. The incidence of
mammary gland carcinomas was statistically significantly increased at both the 100 and 1,000 ppm groups, as compared
to the controls. Also, the incidence of combined adenomas and carcinomas was statistically significantly higher
in the highest dose tested (HDT) group, as compared to the controls. Mammary gland carcinomas in the main study contributed
to increased mortality in the HDT animals. A higher incidence of mammary gland carcinomas was also seen in the recovery
study (52 weeks of treatment at 1,000 ppm, followed by 52 weeks of recovery) for the control (1/10) and the HDT (4/10)
animals. 

The incidence of hyperplastic changes (cystic glandular hyperplasia) in the mammary glands of female rats was statistically
significantly higher in the HDT animals than in the controls. This finding correlates with the observed high incidence
of tumors in the HDT group. It is generally understood that the higher tumor incidence correlates directly with a higher
incidence of hyperplastic changes. 

In the female rats, the incidence of pituitary carcinomas was found to be statistically significantly higher in the
HDT animals than in the controls. The incidence of pituitary adenomas was found to be extremely high in all groups.
Further statistical analysis of these tumors (total tumor analysis) indicated that the incidence of combined adenomas/carcinomas
in the mid- and high-dose groups was statistically significantly higher than in the controls, and also exhibited
a significant increasing dose-related trend. 

There was a statistically significant dose-related trend for the incidence of kidney tubular adenomas in female
rats. However, the tumors occurred only at the HDT, and the incidence was not statistically significant as compared
to the control animals. 

In the male SD rats, the incidence of hepatocellular adenomas or carcinomas was very low in all treated and control
groups. The incidence of combined hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas was statistically significantly higher
in the HDT group, as compared to the control group. These incidences fell within the historical control range for this
testing facility. 

A very low incidence of kidney tubular adenomas and carcinomas was seen in male rats. A statistically significant
dose-related trend was observed for the incidence of carcinomas, as well as for the incidence of combined adenomas
and carcinomas. However, tumors occurred only at the HDT, and tumor incidences were not statistically significantly
elevated as compared to concurrent controls. 

For this study, the Health Effects Division (HED) of the Office of Pesticide Programs Cancer Peer Review Committee
concluded that the highest dose exceeded the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) for female rats, based on excess deaths
and body-weight-gain reductions. The Committee also agreed that the highest dose in male rats appeared to have exceeded
the MTD, based on a significant decrease in body-weight gain. However, the mid-level dose was well below the MTD, and
mammary gland tumors in the female rat were statistically significantly increased at both the mid- and high-dose
levels. In addition, the Committee concluded that there was too great an interval between the mid (100 ppm) and high
(1,000 ppm) doses. These factors were taken into account in the weight-of-evidence considerations that led the Committee
to classify simazine as a possible human carcinogen (Ref. 2). 

2.

 Mouse study.

 There is no evidence of a relationship between simazine exposure and carcinogenicity in the mouse. In a 1988 chronic
feeding/carcinogenicity study in mice, simazine technical was administered in the diet to a group of 60 male and 60
female CD1 (ICR) BR mice at 0 (control), 40, 1,000, or 4,000 ppm for 95 weeks (MRID No. 40614404). There were no increases
in neoplasms reported for any dosed group and no evidence of compound-related effect on survival or target organ toxicity.


3.

 Classification of carcinogenic potential.

 Based on the weight-of-evidence, the HED Cancer Peer Review Committee concluded that simazine should be classified
as a Group C possible human carcinogen (Ref. 2). This determination was primarily based on results from the 2-year
chronic feeding/carcinogenicity study in rats. Based on EPA's evaluation of the data presented in this study, EPA
concluded that technical-grade simazine is carcinogenic in female SD rats, inducing the formation of mammary gland
carcinomas. There is evidence in the published literature that simazine has genotoxic activity, and this was considered
in the weight-of-evidence evaluation of simazine's carcinogenicity classification. 



B. Systemic Effects 



1.

 Rat study.

 EPA determined that the 2-year rat chronic feeding study, described in unit III. A.1. of this notice, was appropriate
for assessing non-cancer risks for ``competitive'' exposure to simazine. A No Observed Effect Level (NOEL) of 0.52
mg/kg/day was established based on decreased body weight gain and depression of hematological parameters that occurred
at 5.34 mg/kg/day. These effects, which include depressed red-blood-cell count, hemoglobin, and hematocrit, are
considered to be reversible when exposure is terminated. 

2.

 Rabbit study.

 For evaluation of non-cancer risks from ``recreational'' exposure to simazine, EPA based its risk assessment on
the results of a rabbit developmental toxicity study (MRID No. 001611407). 

In this study, 19 female New Zealand White rabbits per dose level were artificially inseminated and administered
technical grade simazine once daily by gastric intubation at doses of 5 mg/kg, 75 mg/kg, and 200 mg/kg of body weight.
A significant reduction in mean fetal weight and a significant increase in the incidence of fetuses with skeletal
variations were observed at the 200 mg/kg dose level. Therefore, the developmental NOEL for this study is 75 mg/kg
of body weight. In the mothers, significant decreases in body weight gain, tremors, and abortions were observed in
the mid- and high-dose groups (75 and 200 mg/kg dose levels). The maternal NOEL was therefore established at 5 mg/kg
of body weight. 



IV. Exposure Assessment 



EPA developed four exposure scenarios based on the frequency and duration of exposure (competitive versus recreational
swimming), and on the age and weight of the swimmer (6-year-old child versus 35-year-old male).
The assessment assumed exposure to the entire body through dermal, oral, buccal and sublingual, orbital and nasal,
aural, and inhalation routes. High-exposure frequency, or ``competitive,'' 6-year-old and 35-year-old
swimmers are assumed to have daily exposures of 3 and 5 hours, respectively, for 150 days per year (Ref. 5). Based on
these assumptions, EPA estimates that ``competitive'' swimmers are exposed to an Actual Daily Exposure (ADE) of
0.12 mg/kg/day for children, and 0.07 mg/kg/day for adults. Low-exposure frequency, or ``recreational,'' swimmers
of both age groups are assumed to be exposed for 30 minutes per day, 5 days a year. This low exposure results in an ADE of
0.02 mg/kg/day for children and 0.0073 mg/kg/day for adults. EPA assumed that lifetime exposure constitutes 30 years
of exposure over a 75-year lifetime. 

Simazine concentrations in swimming pool water were calculated based on label application rates. Although simazine
is soluble to only 3.5 parts per million (ppm) in water at 68 
 F, EPA assumed that swimmers could be exposed to average simazine concentrations of 5 ppm, because solubility
could increase at temperatures above 68 
 F. 

EPA has concluded that it is not necessary to conduct a separate exposure assessment for the simazine product that
is used to control algae in swimming pools during the off-season or winter months. A separate assessment is unnecessary
because the exposure levels for the winter-use (winterizer) product are comparable to the exposure levels for the
non-winterizer simazine swimming pool products. Label application rates for winterizer and 
non-winterizer products are similar. In addition, label directions do not require swimming pools that have been
treated with winterizer products to be drained before they are used by swimmers. Because EPA has no data concerning
simazine dissipation, EPA must assume that following initial or subsequent winterizer treatment, simazine does
not dissipate from swimming pool water. Consequently, swimmers could be exposed to unacceptable levels of simazine
when winterized swimming pools are opened for use. Therefore, EPA believes that the individual risk posed to swimmers
from exposure to simazine used as a winterizer is not significantly different from other exposure scenarios. 



V. Risk 



A. Cancer 



1.

 Potency factor (Q

1

*). EPA calculated the cancer potency, or Q

1

*, for simazine as 1.20 

 x 

 10

-1

 (mg/kg/day)

-1

, based on mammary gland cancer in laboratory animals. The Scientific Advisory Panel (SAP) reviewed the carcinogenicity
of simazine in September 1989 and, while agreeing with the Group C classification, did not recommend the use of a quantitative
risk assessment (Ref. 6). The SAP noted that certain pesticides, such as simazine, may alter endocrine physiology
in the rat and influence the incidence of mammary gland tumors; the SAP therefore recommended that EPA formulate a
position on the regulation of chemicals with this mechanism.

At a subsequent OPP Cancer Peer Review Committee meeting, the Peer Review Committee evaluated the SAP's recommendation
and concluded that it is appropriate to use the Q

1*

 to quantify the carcinogenic risks from exposure to simazine until data are provided showing a hormonally mediated
mechanism (Ref. 7). EPA has not received data adequate to support this hypothesis. 

2. 

Cancer risk.

 The excess individual lifetime cancer risk is calculated by multiplying the Q

1

* by the Lifetime Average Daily Exposure (LADE), expressed in mg/kg/day. EPA estimates that the excess risk to an individual
exposed to simazine over a 75-year lifetime (i.e., 30 years of exposure) ranges from 4.8 

 x 

 10

-6

 to 1.4 

 x 

 10

-3

. Risk to most competitive and recreational swimmers is estimated to fall within this range, although in some instances
the risks could be higher or lower. EPA generally considers any risk to the general public greater than 1 

 x 

 10

-6

 to be unacceptable. 



B. Non-Cancer 



EPA measures non-cancer risks by calculating a margin of exposure (MOE), which is a comparison of the NOEL to actual
daily exposure, both of which are expressed in milligrams of chemical dose per kilogram of body weight per day. An MOE
less than 100 generally represents an unacceptable risk. 

1. 

Non-cancer risk to swimmers from high exposure frequency.

 The high exposure frequency assumed for the competitive swimmer categories necessitated the use of a long-term toxicity
study to calculate non-cancer risk. The 2-year chronic rat feeding study was therefore used to calculate the
MOEs for competitive swimmers. The risks to swimmers for the non-cancer effects seen in the chronic study--reduction
in body weight gain and depression of hematological parameters (anemia)--are reflected in MOEs of 4.3 for children
and 7.4 for adults. The MOEs for swimmers in the competitive category, based on effects seen in the chronic feeding
study, are well below 100 and therefore indicate an unacceptable risk. 

2.

 Non-cancer risk to swimmers from low exposure frequency.

 EPA does not consider swimmers exposed at a low exposure frequency (i.e., a few short exposures per year) to be at risk
of exhibiting non-cancer effects (Ref. 8). Because of the low exposure frequency assumed for the recreational swimmer
categories, the rabbit developmental toxicity study was used to calculate MOEs. The effects of reduction in maternal
body weight gain, abortions, and tremors were manifested at very high dose levels and are considered signs of general
systemic toxicity in the test animals. EPA calculated MOEs of 250 for children and 685 for adults exposed to simazine
in swimming pools. This indicates that recreational swimmers are not at risk from the effects seen in the developmental
toxicity study. 

The following table summarizes the risk numbers derived from the assessment: 





VI. Benefits and Impact of Cancellation 



Under FIFRA, a pesticide registration may only be maintained if the benefits of the use of the pesticide exceed the
risks of use. EPA has found that at least some of the registered alternative algaecides provide comparative control
at comparative prices, during summer season use. EPA has concluded that the benefits associated with Nuclo Dry Granular
Algaecide, Nuclo Dry Algaecide 90, and Algicil Plus are negligible when compared to the total operating costs on a
per-pool basis. The cancellation of these products for summer use will have a negligible impact on the pool industry
and the public. 

EPA has also found that the benefits associated with Winterizing Algaecide are relatively small. This information
is based on the fact that there are a number of alternatives to simazine winterizing products on the market, and the
labels of many of these alternative products indicate that they are used at a similar frequency as simazine. Although
EPA has anecdotal information that suggests simazine may have a longer duration of activity, which could, if true,
result in a cost savings, there are no data to support this. Therefore, EPA concludes that the loss of simazine winterizing
products would have only a small impact on the swimming pool industry and the public. 

The cancellation of the four products subject to this Notice will not have a significant economic impact in part because
they account for only a small share of the algaecide market for swimming pool use. EPA estimates that all 22 simazine
products account for less than 10 percent of the market for algaecides for swimming pool use. Registrants of 18 of these
products have already requested voluntary cancellation of their registrations, or have had their registrations
canceled for maintenance fee non-payment. The remaining four products subject to this Notice account for less than
1 percent of the total swimming pool algaecide market. 

The economic impact of cancelling these four products is minimized by the availability of registered alternative
algaecides for swimming pool use. Because these alternatives have a substantially greater market share than simazine,
the cancellation of the four products subject to this Notice should not result in significant price increases in the
non-simazine products. For the same reasons, EPA does not expect market dislocations due to the inability to produce
the alternative algaecides to meet demand. 

Alden Leeds and N. Jonas Co. indicated to EPA that they have accounted for approximately 25,000 gallons of liquid product
in their possession or in the channels of trade, and 14,000 pounds of unformulated Ciba-Geigy simazine product that
Ciba-Geigy has agreed to buy back. Given the small amount of these products and the over 3 million swimming pools in
the United States that could use simazine pool products, cancellation of these products would have little impact
on the swimming pool industry. Section 6(b) of FIFRA requires EPA to consider the impact of cancellation upon the agricultural
economy (7 U.S.C. 136d(b)). EPA has determined that the cancellation of these products will have no impact upon the
agricultural economy because these products are registered for swimming pool use, and not for agricultural uses.




VII. Risk/Benefit Assessment 



Under section 6(b) of FIFRA, the Administrator may cancel a pesticide due to unreasonable adverse effects, if the
pesticide generally causes an ``unreasonable risk to man or the environment, taking into account the economic, social,
and environmental costs and benefits'' of the pesticide's use (7 U.S.C. 136d(b)). 

As discussed in the preceding sections of this Notice, the cancer and non- cancer risks to human health from continued
registration of Nuclo Dry Granular Algaecide, Nuclo Dry Algaecide 90, Winterizing Algaecide, and Algicil Plus are
significant, while the benefits of continued registration are negligible for summer use, and are relatively small
for the winterizing use. EPA believes that the risks posed by continued registration are unreasonable when compared
to the benefits, and that simazine use in swimming pools should be canceled.

In making its determination to propose cancellation, EPA has also examined whether any measures short of cancellation
exist to reduce exposure to acceptable levels, and has concluded that there are none. For the summer use, no measures
could be identified to reduce risk to an acceptable range. For the winterizer use, EPA considered allowing registrants
to retain that use, if data were submitted that showed that superchlorination of pools following simazine use eliminated
the product from treated water. No such data were submitted to EPA. Therefore, EPA has determined that for both the
summer and winter use, there are no acceptable measures short of cancellation. 



VIII. Role of the Scientific Advisory Panel and the Secretary of Agriculture 



Sections 6(b) and 25(d) of FIFRA provide certain opportunities for the FIFRA Scientific Advisory Panel (SAP) and
the Secretary of the Department of Agriculture (USDA) to review and comment upon a draft NOIC, and in the case of USDA,
an analysis of the impact of the proposed action on the agricultural economy. These reviews may be waived, and when
they are, the Notice may be published without delay. 

On April 5, 1994, EPA asked the SAP and Secretary of USDA to waive their rights to review and comment on this Notice (Refs.
9 and 10). On April 12, 1994, Nancy Ragsdale, Director, National Agricultural Pesticide Impact Assessment Program,
USDA, notified EPA that the Secretary would waive review of this action (Ref. 11). On May 25, 1994, the SAP notified
EPA that it waived its review of this action (Ref. 12). Because the SAP and USDA have waived their review of this action,
EPA is issuing this Notice without delay. 



IX. Disposition of Existing Stocks 



For purposes of this Notice, existing stocks are defined as those stocks of simazine products for use in swimming pools
that were in the United States and were packaged, labeled, and released for shipment prior to July 6, 1994. 

EPA has an established policy for determinations concerning the sale, distribution, and use of existing stocks of
canceled pesticides (56 FR 29362, June 26, 1991). That policy states that in cases where EPA has identified a significant
risk concern and the registration is canceled, EPA will make existing stocks determinations on a case-by-case basis.
In most cases EPA will not permit the continued sale, distribution, or use of existing stocks of a canceled product
raising risk concerns unless it can be demonstrated that the benefits exceed the risks. EPA reserves the right to amend
this existing stocks provision, should conditions warrant such amendment. 

The swimming pool use of simazine poses unreasonable cancer and non- cancer risk. As discussed in units VI and VII of
this Notice, the benefits of continued sale, distribution, and use of existing stocks are negligible and do not outweigh
the risks. Finally, EPA has taken steps to minimize the amount of stocks that are currently in the hands of registrants,
retailers, and distributors. In December 1993, EPA notified registrants of the risks associated with the products
and asked them to stop formulating, selling, and distributing their products (Ref. 4). 

EPA has determined that no person may sell, distribute, or use the existing stocks of any product subject to this Notice
except for: (1) Sale or distribution up through the chain of distribution to the former registrant of that product,
or (2) for lawful disposal. It is the responsibility of the basic registrants to notify any and all supplementally
registered distributors of their product(s) that this Notice also applies to their supplementally registered products.
Registrants may be held liable for violations committed by their distributors. Any sale, distribution, or use of
existing stocks of canceled products other than as provided in this Notice will be considered a violation of FIFRA
12(a)(2)(J). 

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Notice, the distribution or sale of canceled products will be allowed
if such distribution or sale is for the purpose of collecting products for relabeling, reformulation, disposal,
or export to a country where the use of simazine is not prohibited, or any other lawful purpose not inconsistent with
the provisions of this Notice. In order for exported existing stocks of canceled simazine to qualify for this exception,
such stocks must comply with all the labeling requirements identified in FIFRA section 17(1)(a) and the foreign purchaser
acknowledgement requirements identified in FIFRA section 17(a)(2). In order to be considered to be in compliance
with these provisions, the exporter must follow the procedures specified in the EPA's Export Policy and Procedures
for Exporting Unregistered Pesticides at 40 CFR part 168, subpart D. 



X. Required Notification of Possession of Canceled Products 



Pursuant to FIFRA section 6(g), any producer or exporter, registrant, applicant for a registration, applicant or
holder of an experimental use permit, commercial applicator, or any person who distributes or sells any pesticide,
who possesses any stocks of pesticide products containing simazine subject to this Notice that are canceled by a final
order issued either in the absence of or following a hearing on cancellation (hereafter, referred to as ``affected
persons,'' which includes affected individuals, partnerships, associations, corporations, or any organized
group of persons whether incorporated or not) must notify the EPA and appropriate State and local officials of: (1)
Such possession; (2) the quantity of canceled simazine pesticide product possessed; and, (3) the place at which the
canceled simazine pesticide product is stored. Notification by affected persons to EPA and designated State and
local officials pursuant to FIFRA section 6(g) shall be in accordance with the procedures, time frames, and requirements
set out in this Unit. End users, except commercial applicators, are not required to report their stocks of canceled
simazine products. 



A. Pesticides Required to be Reported 



Affected persons must report, pursuant to FIFRA section 6(g), the information described below for canceled simazine
pesticide products that are in their possession, regardless of the ownership of that canceled simazine pesticide
product. Canceled simazine product that is owned by one affected person, but is in the physical possession of another
affected person who is subject to section 6(g) reporting, is to be reported by the person in physical possession of
the pesticide. 

The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has given approval for the collection of information under FIFRA section
6(g), and has assigned the OMB control number 2070-0109. 



B. Information that Must be Included in the Submission



 To be in compliance with FIFRA section 6(g), affected persons must submit to the designated EPA and State and local
officials the following information certified by a responsible company official as true and correct: 

1. The identity and address of the affected person (company). 

2. Name and phone number of a contact person (in the company). 

3. Indication that the FIFRA section 6(g) information is being submitted for canceled pesticide products containing
simazine. 

4. The relationship of the affected person (company) to the canceled simazine pesticide products being reported
under FIFRA section 6(g) (i.e., exporter, producer, registrant, applicant for registration, applicant for or holder
of an experimental use permit, commercial applicator, distributor, retailer, etc.). 

5. The street address of each location owned, leased, or operated in the United States by the submitter where the canceled
simazine pesticide product is held. 

6. For each location listed, the quantity (pounds, gallons, or other appropriate measure) of canceled simazine pesticide
product listed by the number of units of each size container (pound, gallons, or other appropriate measure) and by
EPA registration number (e.g., x units of 5 gallon containers of EPA registration number xxx-xxx). 



C. When to Report



Affected persons are advised not to report until the effective date of the final order issued either in the absence
of or following a hearing on cancellation. Reports of existing stocks submitted before the effective date of the cancellation
are not considered to meet the reporting requirements of FIFRA section 6(g). Upon the effective date of cancellation,
affected persons must submit FIFRA section 6(g) information according to the following time frames: 

1. Registrants of canceled simazine must report within 30 days of the effective date of the final order. 

2. Producers, exporters, applicants for a registration, applicants or holders of an experimental use permit, dealers,
distributors, retailers, and commercial applicators must report within 45 days of the effective date of the final
order. 

3. End users are not required to report their possession of canceled products containing simazine.

XI. Procedural Matters 
 


This Notice announces EPA's intent to cancel the registrations of Nuclo Dry Granular Algaecide (EPA Reg. No. 7124-32),
Nuclo Dry Algaecide 90 (EPA Reg. No. 7124-93), Winterizing Algaecide (EPA Reg. No. 3432-33), Algicil
Plus (EPA Reg. No. 3432-54), and any products with these registration numbers that are supplementally distributed.
This action is taken pursuant to authority in section 6(b) of FIFRA. Under FIFRA section 6(b)(1), registrants and
other adversely affected parties may request a hearing on the cancellation actions that this Notice initiates. Any
hearing concerning cancellation of the registration for any affected pesticide product will be held in accordance
with FIFRA section 6(d). Unless a hearing is properly requested in accordance with the provisions of this Notice,
the registrations will be canceled. This unit of the Notice explains how such persons may request a hearing in accordance
with the procedures specified in this Notice, and the consequences of requesting or failing to request a hearing.

Requests for a hearing by other adversely affected parties must be received by the Office of the Hearing Clerk on or
before August 5, 1994. All registrants and other adversely affected persons who request a hearing must file the request
in accordance with the procedures established by FIFRA and EPA's Rules of Practice Governing Hearings (40 CFR part
164). These procedures require that all requests identify the specific registration by Registration Number and
state the basis for objecting to the cancellation of the product for which a hearing is requested. Requests must be
received by the Hearing Clerk within the applicable 30-day period. Failure to comply with these requirements
will result in denial of the request for a hearing. Requests for a hearing must be submitted to: Hearing Clerk (1900),
Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M Street, SW, Washington, DC 20460. 
 
1. 

Consequences of filing a timely and effective hearing request.

 If a hearing on any action initiated by this Notice is requested in a timely and effective manner, the hearing will be
governed by EPA's Rules of Practice Governing Hearings under FIFRA section 6 (40 CFR part 164). All hearings will be
held in Washington, DC. In the event of a timely and effective request for a hearing, each cancellation action concerning
the specific use of the specific registered product that is the subject of the hearing request will not become effective
except pursuant to an order of the Administrator at the conclusion of the hearing. 
 
2.

 Consequences of failure to file in a timely and effective manner.

 If a hearing concerning the cancellation of a specific product subject to this Notice is not requested in a timely and
effective manner by the end of the applicable 30-day period, registration of that product will be canceled automatically.

 


B. Separation of Functions

<DOCTITLE>Triclopyr; Renewal of Temporary Tolerances </DOCTITLE>


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 


 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice. 


 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 EPA has renewed temporary tolerances for the combined residues of the herbicide triclopyr and its metabolites in
or on certain raw agricultural commodities. 


 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 EPA issued a notice, published in the 

Federal Register

 of August 15, 1991 (56 FR 40614), stating that temporary tolerances had been renewed for the combined residues of the
herbicide triclopyr (3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinyloxyacetic acid) and its metabolites 3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinol
and 2-methoxy-3,5,6-trichloropyridine in or on the raw agricultural commodities rice grain at 0.5 part per million
(ppm) and rice straw at 8.0 ppm, and for triclopyr in poultry meat, poultry fat, and meat byproducts (except kidney)
at 0.2 ppm, poultry kidney at 1.0 ppm and eggs at 0.3 ppm. These tolerances are renewed in response to pesticide petition
(PP) 8G3571, submitted by DowElanco, 9002 Purdue Rd., P.O. Box 681428, Indianapolis, IN 46268. 


The company has requested a 1-year renewal of the temporary tolerances to permit the continued marketing of
the above raw agricultural commodities when treated in accordance with the provisions of the experimental use permit
62719-EUP-8, which is being renewed under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) as amended
(Pub. L. 95-396, 92 Stat. 819; 7 U.S.C. 136). The scientific data reported and other relevant material were evaluated,
and it was determined that renewal of the temporary tolerances will protect the public health. Therefore, the temporary
tolerances have been renewed on the condition that the pesticide be used in accordance with the experimental use permit
and with the following provisions: 

1. The total amount of the active ingredient to be used must not exceed the quantity authorized by the experimental
use permit. 
2. DowElanco must immediately notify the EPA of any findings from the experimental use that have a bearing on safety.
The company must also keep records of production, distribution, and performance and on request make the records available
to any authorized officer or employee of the EPA or the Food and Drug Administration. 
These tolerances expire June 23, 1995. Residues not in excess of these amounts remaining in or on the above raw agricultural
commodities after this expiration date will not be considered actionable if the pesticide is legally applied during
the term of, and in accordance with, the provisions of the experimental use permit and temporary tolerances. These
tolerances may be revoked if the experimental use permit is revoked or if any experience with or scientific data on
this pesticide indicate that such revocation is necessary to protect the public health. 
The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this notice from the requirements of section 3 of Executive Order
12866. 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601-612),
the Administrator has determined that regulations establishing new tolerances or raising tolerance levels or establishing
exemptions from tolerance requirements do not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small
entities. A certification statement to this effect was published in the 

Federal Register

 of May 4, 1981 (46 FR 24950).

<DOCTITLE>Statement of Policy for Water Soluble Packaging; Notice of Availability and Request for Comments </DOCTITLE>





<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 EPA is soliciting comments on a proposed policy for water soluble packaging. That policy has been developed in a draft
Pesticide Regulation (PR) Notice entitled, ``Water Soluble Packaging (WSP)'' which is available upon request.
Interested parties may request a copy of the Agency's proposed policy as set forth in the ADDRESSES unit of this notice.




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Water soluble packaging (WSP), which usually consists of polyvinyl alcohol, is used to package certain powdered
formulations of pesticides to minimize exposure to pesticide handlers via inhalation. EPA is proposing to streamline
the registration requirements for WSP to encourage use of such ``reduced risk'' packaging. Under the proposed policy,
EPA will register WSP along with other forms of packaging under one registration number under the following conditions:



1. The confidential statement of formula (CSF) must list the chemical name(s), trade name(s), supplier(s), CAS Registry
number(s), and amount(s) of components of the polyvinyl alcohol film and printing ink(s). All WSP components must
have been previously cleared and not listed as ingredients to the product. 
2. The ``Directions For Use'' on the label must provide mixing directions in terms of WSP packages to be added per unit
volume of water. 
To add WSP to an existing registration, a registrant would notify EPA by submitting a letter certifying compliance
with the PR Notice, and enclosing two copies of the CSF and one copy of the revised label. 
This 

Federal Register

 notice announces the availability of the draft PR Notice and solicits comment on the proposed policy. If, after reviewing
any comments, EPA determines that changes to the Policy are warranted, the Agency will revise the draft PR Notice prior
to release.

<DOCTITLE>Toxic Substances Control Act Confidential Business Information Claims Policies and Regulations; Notice of Availability
</DOCTITLE>





<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of availability.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 Notice is hereby given that EPA is making available a final paper entitled 

Final Action Plan: TSCA Confidential Business Information Reform

 discussing issues regarding Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) Confidential Business Information (CBI) policies
and certain future actions by EPA which may change CBI requirements or TSCA implementation. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 In September 1992, EPA released a commissioned study entitled 

Influence of CBI Requirements on TSCA CBI

 (the ``study''). The study was commissioned as part of an EPA initiative to improve TSCA's utilization as a toxics
information dissemination statute. The study provided an in depth analysis of CBI claims, submitter procedures
for making such claims, EPA review and challenges of claims, and effects of CBI claims on information which is not eligible
for confidential treatment by the standards established in TSCA and its implementing regulations, including 40
CFR part 2, on EPA's toxics information mission. 


After releasing the study, EPA has met with a variety of state, environmental, labor, and industry groups. In addition,
EPA conducted a public meeting regarding the study. EPA carefully considered the recommendations provided in the
study and the comments it has received from the public. Based in part on the recommendations and comments received,
EPA formulated a working paper entitled 

Proposed Actions to Reform TSCA Confidential Business Information

 (the ``proposal'') discussing the issues raised by EPA, the study, and the various comments. 
The Agency conducted a second public meeting after the release of the proposal. Again EPA has received many comments.
Based on the recommendations and comments received, EPA developed the final paper entitled 

Final Action Plan: TSCA Confidential Business Information Reform

. The paper is available from the TSCA Hot Line at the location listed under the ADDRESSES unit. 
The following are components of the Final Action Plan: 
1. Educational efforts. 
2. Toxics information dissemination. 
3. State programs. 
4. Regulatory policy clarifications. 
5. CBI review. 
6. Industry voluntary information dissemination. 
7. Regulatory changes: sunset provisions. 
8. Regulatory changes: senior management official signing CBI claims. 
9. Regulatory changes: upfront substantiation. 
All the comments received in the various stages of the policy development process, various other relevant documents
and the transcripts of the public meetings have been incorporated into a public case file. This case file, No. 00125A,
is available for inspection in the TSCA Nonconfidential Information Center located at EPA headquarters, Rm. NE-B607,
401 M St., SW., Washington, DC, from 12 noon to 4 p.m., Monday through Friday, excluding holidays.

<DOCTITLE>Deutsche Bank AG, Frankfurt, Germany; Application to engage in Nonbanking Activities</DOCTITLE>


Deutsche Bank AG, Frankfurt, Germany (Deutsche Bank), has applied pursuant to  4(c)(8) of the Bank Holding Company
Act (12 U.S.C. 1843(c)(8)) (BHC Act) and  225.23(a)(3) of the Board's Regulation Y (12 CFR 225.23(a)(3)) to engage
in various activities through Deutsche Bank Sharps Pixley, Inc. (DBSPI) and Sharps Pixley Brokers, Inc. (``Brokers''),
both of New York, New York, which were acquired indirectly by Deutsche Bank from Kleinwort Benson Group plc, London,
England on December 31, 1993. Deutsche Bank proposes to engage in the following activities through DBSPI: (1) trading
for its own account for nonhedging purposes in gold, silver and platinum bullion in the spot, forward and over-the-counter
(OTC) option markets; and (2) providing various financing services. Deutsche Bank proposes to provide futures commission
merchant (FCM) execution and investment advisory services through Brokers, an FCM registered under the Commodity
Exchange Act (7 U.S.C.  1 

et seq

.), on the following contracts: Copper Futures, Options on Copper Futures, Gold Futures, Options on Gold Futures,
Silver Futures, and Options on Silver Futures on the Commodity Exchange, Inc.; Copper Futures, Options on Copper
Futures, Lead Futures, Options on Lead Futures, Zinc Futures, Options on Zinc Futures, Aluminum Futures, Options
on Aluminum Futures, Tin Futures, Options on Tin Futures, Nickel Futures, Options on Nickel Futures, Aluminum Alloy
Futures, and Options on Aluminum Alloy Futures on The London Metal Exchange, Limited. The activities will be conducted
on a world wide basis.
Section 4(c)(8) of the BHC Act provides that a bank holding company may, with Board approval, engage in any activity
which the Board, after due notice and opportunity for hearing, has determined (by order or regulation) to be so closely
related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto. This statutory test requires
that two separate tests be met for an activity to be permissible for a bank holding company. First, the Board must determine
that the activity is, as a general matter, closely related to banking. Second, the Board must find in a particular case
that the performance of the activity by the applicant bank holding company may reasonably be expected to produce public
benefits that outweigh possible adverse effects.
A particular activity may be found to meet the ``closely related to banking'' test if it is demonstrated that banks
generally have provided the proposed activity, that banks generally provide services that are operationally or
functionally similar to the proposed activity so as to equip them particularly well to provide the proposed activity,
or that banks generally provide services that are so integrally related to the proposed activity as to require their
provision in a specialized form. 

National Courier Ass'n v. Board of Governors

, 516 F.2d 1229, 1237 (D.C. Cir. 1975). In addition, the Board may consider any other basis that may demonstrate that
the activity has a reasonable or close relationship to banking or managing or controlling banks. Board Statement
Regarding Regulation Y, 49 FR 806 (1984).
Deutsche Bank states that the Board previously has determined by Regulation that certain of the proposed activities,
when conducted within limitations established by the Board in its regulations and in related interpretations and
orders, are closely related to banking for purposes of  4(c)(8) of the BHC Act. See 12 C.F.R. 225.25(b)(1) and Westpac
Banking Corporation, 73 Federal Reserve Bulletin 61 (1987) (making, acquiring or servicing loans or other extensions
of credit); 12 C.F.R. 225.25(b)(18) and (19) (providing FCM transactional and advisory services with respect to
bullion contracts). 
Deutsche Bank also maintains that the Board has determined by order that several of the other proposed activities,
when conducted within the limitations established by the Board in previous orders, are closely related to banking.


See Midland Bank, PLC

, 76 Federal Reserve Bulletin 860 (1990) (trading gold and silver bullion in the spot market for a bank holding company's
own account); 

J.P. Morgan & Co. Incorporated

, 80 Federal Reserve Bulletin 151 (1994) (providing FCM transactional and advisory services with respect to nonfinancial
commodity contracts). Deutsche Bank maintains that DBSPI and Brokers would conduct these previously approved activities
in conformity with the conditions and limitations established by the Board in prior cases.
Deutsche Bank further states that the Board previously has not approved trading platinum bullion in the spot market
for a bank holding company's own account, or trading gold, silver or platinum bullion in the forward or OTC option market
for a bank holding company's own account for nonhedging purposes. With respect to trading gold and silver in the forward
and OTC option markets, Deutsche Bank maintains that the Board previously has determined that trading for nonhedging
purposes in the proposed derivative contracts with respect to other bank-eligible investments is closely related
to banking, and, therefore, that trading these contracts with respect to silver and gold bullion also is closely related
to banking. 

See Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation

, 75 Federal Reserve Bulletin 217 (1989) (trading foreign exchange for a bank holding company's own account for nonhedging
purposes in the spot, forward, options, futures and options on futures markets).
With respect to its proposal that Company trade for its own account in platinum bullion, Deutsche Bank states that
the OCC and the New York State Banking Department have approved this activity for banks under their respective jurisdictions.
Deutsche Bank also states that the Board has approved under  4(c)(8) of the BHC Act the purchase and sale of platinum
coins, under limited circumstances. 

See Standard Chartered PLC

, 76 Federal Reserve Bulletin 681 (1990). Deutsche Bank also states that the Board has approved, under Regulation
K (12 C.F.R. part 211), trading in platinum by bank holding company subsidiaries located outside the United States.


See J.P. Morgan & Co. Incorporated

, 76 Federal Reserve Bulletin 552 (1990). Deutsche Bank maintains that for these reasons, the proposed trading in
platinum bullion is closely related to banking.
In order to approve the proposal, the Board must determine that the proposed activities to be conducted by DBSPI and
Brokers ``can reasonably be expected to produce benefits to the public, such as greater convenience, increased competition,
or gains in efficiency, that outweigh possible adverse effects, such as undue concentration of resources, decreased
or unfair competition, conflicts of interests, or unsound banking practices.'' 12 U.S.C.  1843(c)(8).
Deutsche Bank believes that the proposal will produce public benefits that outweigh any potential adverse effects.
In particular, Deutsche Bank maintains that the proposal will enhance competition and enable Deutsche Bank to offer
its customers a broader range of products. In addition, Deutsche Bank states that the proposed activities will not
result in the adverse effects such as an undue concentration of resources, decreased or unfair competition, conflicts
of interest, or unsound banking practices.
In publishing the proposal for comment, the Board does not take a position on issues raised by the proposal. Notice
of the proposal is published solely to seek the views of interested persons on the issues presented by the application
and does not represent a determination by the Board that the proposal meets, or is likely to meet, the standards of the
BHC Act.
Any comments or requests for hearing should be submitted in writing and received by William W. Wiles, Secretary, Board
of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Washington, D.C. 20551, not later than July 31, 1994. Any request for a
hearing on this application must, as required by  262.3(e) of the Board's Rules of Procedure (12 CFR 262.3(e)), be accompanied
by a statement of the reasons why a written presentation would not suffice in lieu of a hearing, identifying specifically
any questions of fact that are in dispute, summarizing the evidence that would be presented at a hearing, and indicating
how the party commenting would be aggrieved by approval of the proposal.
This application may be inspected at the offices of the Board of Governors or the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago.

Proposed Respondents are willing to enter into an Agreement Containing Consent Order (``Agreement'') to license
certain assets, contract manufacture dicyclomine tablets and capsules, cease and desist from certain acts, and
provide for certain other relief:
It is hereby agreed by and between Proposed Respondents, by their duly authorized officers and their attorneys, and

manner of service. The complaint may be used in construing the terms of the Order, and no agreement, understanding,
representation, or interpretation not contained in the Order or the agreement may be used to vary or contradict the
terms of the Order.

It is further ordered 

that:
A. MMD shall consent to the appointment of a trustee by the Commission to terminate MMD's prior Agreement, if any, and
to enter into a new Agreement on behalf of MMD with a Potential New Entrant selected by the trustee if:

to section 5(

l

) of the Federal Trade Commission Act, 15 U.S.C. section 45(

l

), or any other statute enforced by the Commission, MMD shall consent to the appointment of a trustee in such action.

Commission or the Attorney General from seeking civil penalties or any other relief available to it for any failure
by Respondents to comply with this Order.
B. If a trustee is appointed by the Commission or a court pursuant to Paragraph III.A of this Order, MMD shall consent
to the following terms and conditions regarding the trustee's powers, duties, authorities, and responsibilities:

4. The trustee shall have twelve (12) months from the date the Commission approves the trust agreement described in
Paragraph III.B.3 to terminate any prior Agreement and to enter into the Agreement specified in Paragraph II of this
Order, which Agreement shall be subject to the prior approval of the Commission. If, however, at the end of the twelve
(12) month period the trustee has submitted a plan or believes that the Agreement required by Paragraph II of this Order
can be entered into within a reasonable time, the twelve (12) month period may be extended by the Commission or, in the
case of a court-appointed trustee, by the court;

Analysis of Proposed Consent Order to Aid Public Comment



The Federal Trade Commission (``Commission'') has accepted provisionally an agreement containing a proposed Consent
Order from The Dow Chemical Company (``Dow'') and Marion Merrell Dow Inc. (``MMD''), a subsidiary of Dow, under which
MMD would be required to manufacture and supply the drug dicyclomine for a potential new entrant and to provide the
dicyclomine formulation and other intangible assets to expedite that potential new entrant's entry as a manufacturer
into the dicyclomine market. In addition, under the proposed Consent Order the potential new entrant would be required
to certify its good faith intention to manufacture dicyclomine.

The proposed Consent Order has been placed on the public record for sixty (60) days for reception of comments by interested
persons. Comments received during this period will become part of the public record. After sixty (60) days, the Commission
will again review the agreement and the comments received and will decide whether it should withdraw from the agreement
or make final the agreement's proposed Order.

On October 4, 1993, MMD and Rugby-Darby Group Companies, Inc. (``Rugby'') signed an agreement whereby MMD acquired
all of the stock of Rugby's generic pharmaceutical business. The proposed compliant alleges that the acquisition
violates Section 7 of the Clayton Act, as amended, 15 U.S.C. 18, and Section 5 of the FTC Act, as amended, 15 U.S.C. 45,
in the market for dicyclomine hydrochloride capsules and tablets in the United States.

The proposed Consent Order would remedy the alleged violation by establishing a new entrant into the U.S. market for
dicyclomine capsules and tablets to replace the competition lost as a result of the acquisition. The proposed Consent
Order would require MMD to enter into an agreement with a potential new entrant within twelve (12) months from the date
the proposed Consent Order becomes final.

The agreement would require MMD to manufacture and supply dicyclomine, as well as to license the relevant dicyclomine
technology, to a Commission approved potential new entrant. MMD must continue to supply the potential new entrant
with dicyclomine until the potential new entrant has begun manufacturing dicyclomine with FDA approval, or for seven
(7) years, whichever is shorter. The price at which MMD may contract to supply dicyclomine to the potential new entrant
may not exceed 48 percent of the Average Wholesale Price charged by Rugby as of July 2, 1993. The potential new entrant
must certify its good faith intention and actual plan to obtain FDA approval to manufacture dicyclomine capsules
and tablets for sale in the U.S. In the event that MMD fails to enter into such an agreement with a potential new entrant,
or that the potential new entrant discontinues or fails in its efforts to obtain FDA approval to manufacture dicyclomine
within seven (7) years, the proposed Consent Order provides that MMD shall consent to the appointment of a trustee
by the Commission. The trustee will be responsible for locating a potential new entrant that will obtain the necessary
approvals and sell dicyclomine into the U.S. market.

The proposed Order will also prohibit for a period of ten (10) years, Dow and MMD from acquiring any interest in assets
used for the development, manufacture or sale of dicyclomine without prior approval from the Commission. The proposed
Order will also require MMD to provide to the Commission a report of its compliance with the provisions of the Order
within sixty (60) days following the date this Order becomes final, and every sixty (60) days thereafter until the
Commission has approved a potential new entrant.

One year from the date the Order becomes final and annually thereafter for nine (9) years, Dow and MMD will be required
to provide to the Commission a report of their compliance with the Consent Order. The Consent Order also requires Dow
or MMD to notify the Commission at least thirty (30) days prior to any change in the structure of Dow or MMD resulting
in the emergence of a successor.

The purpose of this analysis is to facilitate public comment on the proposed Order, and it is not intended to constitute
an official interpretation of the agreement and proposed Order or to modify in any way their terms.

Dissenting Statement of Commissioner Mary L. Azcuenaga


In 

The Dow Chemical Company

, File No. 941-0019



Today, the Commission accepts for comment a consent agreement settling charges that Marion Merrell Dow's consummated
acquisition of certain stock in the Rugby-Darby Group Companies, Inc. would substantially lessen competition in
the United States market for dicyclomine hydrochloride capsules and tablets. I support the allegations in the complaint
that the acquisition created a monopoly in the manufacture and sale of dicyclomine hydrochloride capsules and tablets,
and I have reason to believe the acquisition violated the law. I dissent because I find the remedy insufficient. Ideally,
the Commission would have sought to enjoin the transaction. Although it did not seek a preliminary injunction, the
Commission still should seek through administrative litigation divestiture of assets sufficient to create a viable,
independent dicyclomine business. Administrative litigation takes time but affords a much higher likelihood of
obtaining effective relief by divestiture of an ongoing enterprise than does a technology license designed to induce
new entry.

The order requires Marion Merrell Dow to grant a nonexclusive license to certain intangible dicyclomine assets,
including patents and technology, and for up to seven years to sell to the person acquiring the license dicyclomine
tablets and capsules at a price not exceeding 48 percent of the average wholesale price on July 2, 1993. Technology
licenses tend to be highly regulatory and less effective than divestitures in restoring competition. Further, because
of the great difficulty government agencies have in specifying competitive market prices, it is highly questionable
whether requiring sales of dicyclomine at a Commission-specified maximum price will provide consumers with interim
relief from the monopoly. Indeed, since the Commission granted early termination of the Hart-Scott-Rodino waiting
period on July 12, 1993, it seems entirely possible that the price on July 2 reflected the impending merger to monopoly
and was already supra-competitive.



Concurring Statement of Commissioner Deborah K. Owen on Proposed Consent Agreement With Marion Merrell Dow Inc.,
File No. 941-0019



The Commission is accepting for public comment a proposed consent agreement with Marion Merrell Dow Inc. (``MMD''),
the manufacturer of Bentyl, a drug commonly prescribed for the treatment of certain gastrointestinal disorders.
In October 1993, MMD acquired Rugby-Darby Group Companies, Inc. (``Rugby''), a manufacturer of numerous pharmaceutical
products, including a generic version of Bentyl: dicyclomine hydrochloride. The proposed complaint alleges, 

inter alia

, that this acquisition ``created a monopoly in the manufacture of dicyclomine hydrochloride capsules and tablets.''
Complaint   VIII(c). I am writing separately in order to explain one aspect of my analysis of this case,
and to raise some questions concerning the proposed remedy.

A threshold issue in analyzing this merger is whether MMD's Bentyl and Rugby's generic dicyclomine are in the same
product market. On the one hand, it may seem obvious that two drugs deemed to be bio-equivalent by the Food and Drug Administration,
must be in the same relevant product market. On the other hand, branded drugs and their generic counterparts typically
vary dramatically in price, suggesting that consumers may not view the products as equivalent or interchangeable.

As indicated in the Merger Guidelines, the Commission approaches the issue of market definition by asking what products,
if any, constrained the price of MMD's Bentyl (and Rugby's generic dicyclomine) at the time of the merger. If, in response
to a small but significant increase in the price of Bentyl, enough customers would switch to generic dicyclomine (or,
if in response to a small but significant increase in the price of generic dicyclomine, enough customers would switch
to Bentyl) to make the price increase unprofitable, then the two products are deemed to be in the same market. Whether
a particular branded drug and any generic versions are in the same market may vary over time, and depends in part upon
their relative prices at the time of the merger. In general, where the price differential between the branded product
and the generic product is great, the products are more likely to be in separate markets.
 Conversely, where the price gap between the branded product and the generic product is relatively small (for example,
where there is only one generic version available to consumers), the products are more likely to be in the same market.

The proposed consent agreement aims to establish a new competitor in the U.S. dicyclomine market to replace the competition
lost as a result of MMD's allegedly illegal acquisition. Specifically, MMD is required to license certain dicyclomine
production technology to a Commission-approved licensee that avows a good faith intention to obtain FDA approval
to independently manufacture dicyclomine for sale in the United States. Further, MMD must supply dicyclomine to
the potential new entrant for up to seven years, until such time as the licensee has begun manufacturing dicyclomine
on its own.

I am concerned about the terms of this Commission-mandated supply agreement. The proposed consent order provides
that the price at which MMD may contract to supply dicyclomine to the potential entrant may not exceed 48 percent of
the average wholesale price charged by Rugby as of July 2, 1993.
 This is in effect a form of government price regulation, and is apt to result in a significant misallocation of resources.
It is particularly troubling that the maximum transfer price is fixed by the Commission's order for up to seven years,
and (unlike market-based prices) does not vary with either changes in demand or changes in the costs of production.
If the costs of production come to exceed the transfer price, then the licensee may have an incentive to delay the opening
of its own production facility, and hence delay the return of true, market-based competition. 





Furthermore, the fixed transfer price may actually be in effect for longer than seven years. For example, if the original
licensee fails after seven years to obtain FDA approval, then a replacement licensee may be selected by a trustee.
This second licensee is entitled to purchase dicyclomine from MMD at the same fixed price. Given the Commission's
recent experience in the 

Institut Merieux

 (File No. C-3301) and 

Promodes

 (Docket No. 9228) matters, the prospect of another seemingly interminable and complicated compliance proceeding
disturbs me. 

I hope that during the public comment period the Commission will receive advice on the wisdom and workability of the
proposed supply agreement. In particular, I am interested in considering alternate ways of structuring the price
term. Is there a practical way, under a revised order, to permit the price term to vary should the costs of production
or demand vary?
 Or would the uncertainties of future cost and demand changes be better accomodated if MMD and the licensee were free
to negotiate a price term (perhaps subject to Commission approval)? Finally, what is the optimal duration for the
supply agreement? Specifically, how long should it take a licensee, acting diligently, to obtain required FDA approvals
and commence manufacturing dicyclomine? At this time, I am not confident that the appropriate maximum duration for
the MMD supply agreement should be as long as seven years. Public comment on these issues may be of significant value
to the Commission not only in this matter, but more generally as the agency seeks to devise effective antitrust remedies
for the pharmaceutical, and other industries.

Statement of Commissioner Dennis A. Yao



In 

The Dow Chemical Company,

 File No. 941 0019



I voted to accept for public comment the proposed consent agreement in this matter because I believe it represents
a viable solution to the potential anticompetitive effects that resulted from Marion Merrell Dow's (``MMD'') acquisition
of Rugby Holding, Inc. (``Rugby''). The acquisition created a monopoly in the market for dicyclomine tablets and
capsules by combining the only two manufacturers of the branded and generic product. The proposed consent has the
potential of establishing a second competitor through the grant of a nonexclusive license by MMD of certain intangible
dicyclomine assets. The order also sets a maximum price at which MMD is allowed to sell dicyclomine tablets and capsules
to the licensee for up to seven years. The goal is to replace the competition lost from the dicyclomine market as quickly
as possible by establishing a new entrant in the market. The order is the best mechanism to provide quick relief.

The order sets a ceiling of 48% of the average wholesale price on July 2, 1993, as the maximum price at which MMD is allowed
to sell dicyclomine tablet and capsules to the licensee. The July 2, 1993, wholesale price offers the best available
approximation of the price that would exist in a market consisting of only one manufacturer of the branded and one manufacturer
of the generic product. The 48% is based on our best approximation of the margin that a generic distributor of another
manufacturer's product needs to make a profit. Furthermore, the July 2 price is the firs price increase that reflected
the exit of two generic competitors. The timing of the merger announcement and the price increase could suggest that
the price on July 2nd were also influenced by the impending merger; however there is no evidence of this. If the ceiling
is higher than one would prefer, the licensee and licensor could conceivably arrive at a transfer price that somewhat
reduces their incentives to fully compete. Unfortunately, there is no other non-arbitrary method for setting the
maximum allowable price, nor would it be easy to determine such a price. The provision, however, does serve the basic
purpose of providing the licensee a chance to succeed without injecting a regulator's version of competition into
the market.







I have a mild concern that the licensee will not have sufficient incentives to begin manufacturing dicyclomine on
its own under the order. A potential licensee could enter the licensing agreement for a short period of time with the
intention of taking advantage of the profit available for selling the licensed product but without the intention
of manufacturing dicyclomine on its own. Alternatively, a licensee might initially intend to elf-manufacture,
but change its strategy at some later date and sell only the licensed product.
 In this particular instance, no reasonable fixes to the licensee incentive problem seem available. Therefore, on
balance, I support the order because, at a minimum, it should achieve the necessary intermediate relief. Permanent
relief, such as divestiture, may not be as needed in this instance because there is a good possibility of future entry,
albeit untimely.

Analysis of Proposed Consent Order to Aid Public Comment



The Federal Trade Commission has accepted an agreement to a proposed consent order from Macy's Northeast, Inc., Macy's
South, Inc., Macy's California, Inc., and Bullock's, Inc. (``proposed respondents''), wholly-owned subsidiaries
of R.H. Macy & Co., Inc. Proposed respondents operate department stores in New York, California, and a number
of other states.

The proposed consent order has been placed on the public record for sixty (60) days for reception of comments by interested
persons. Comments received during this period will become part of the public record. After sixty (60) days, the Commission
will again review the agreement and the comments received and will decide whether it should withdraw from the agreement
and take other appropriate action, or make final the proposed order contained in the agreement.

The complaint alleges that the proposed respondents have violated a Rule promulgated by the Federal Trade Commission
(16 CFR 702.3(a)) pursuant to the Magnuson-Moss Consumer Warranty Act (15 U.S.C. 2301). This Rule requires the proposed
respondents to make manufacturers' warranty information available to consumers. The purposes of this Act, and the
Rule, are to improve the information available to consumers, to prevent deception, and to promote competition, in
the marketing of consumer product warranties offered by manufacturers.

The Rule, called the ``Pre-Sale Availability Rule,'' gives retailers the option of either (1) displaying the text
of manufacturers' warranties in close proximity to the product display; or (2) furnishing the text of manufacturers'
warranties to customers upon request, and prominently displaying signs advising of the availability of such warranties.
The complaint alleges that the proposed respondents have not complied with either of these options.

The proposed order requires proposed respondents to comply with this Rule, to inform their retail store executives
of their compliance responsibilities, and to develop a program for instructing their sales personnel about the availability
and location of manufacturers' warranty information. Proposed respondents will be subject to civil penalties if
they do not comply with the order.

The purpose of this analysis is to facilitate public comment on the proposed order. It is not intended to constitute
an official interpretation of the agreement and proposed order or to modify in any way their terms.

Analysis of Proposed Consent Order to Aid Public Comment


The Federal Trade Commission has accepted an agreement to a proposed consent order from Montgomery Ward & Co.,
Incorporated, Chicago, Illinois (``Wards''). Wards is a national chain of retail department stores, and of specialty
stores selling appliances and consumer electronics.
The proposed consent order has been placed on the public record for sixty (60) days for reception of comments by interested
persons. Comments received during this period will become part of the public record. After sixty (60) days, the Commission
will again review the agreement and the comments received and will decide whether it should withdraw from the agreement
and take other appropriate action, or make final the proposed order contained in the agreement.
The complaint alleges that Wards has violated a Rule promulgated by the Federal Trade Commission (16 CFR 702.3(a))
pursuant to the Magnuson-Moss Consumer Warranty Act (15 U.S.C.  2301). This Rule requires Wards to maker manufacturers'
warranty information available to consumers. The purposes of this Act, and the Rule, are to improve the information
available to consumers, to prevent deception, and to promote competition, in the marketing of consumer product warranties
offered by manufacturers.
The Rule, called the ``Pre-Sale Availability Rule,'' gives retailers the option of either 1) displaying the text
of manufacturers' warranties in close proximity to the product display; or 2) furnishing the text of manufacturers'
warranties to customers upon request, and prominently displaying signs advising of the availability of such warranties.
The complaint alleges that Wards has not complied with either of these options.
The proposed order requires Wards to comply with this Rule, to inform its retail store executives of their compliance
responsibilities, and to develop a program for instructing its sales personnel about the availability and location
of manufacturers' warranty information. Wards will be subject to civil penalties if it does not comply with the order.
The purpose of this analysis is to facilitate public comment on the proposed order. It is not intended to constitute
an official interpretation of the agreement and proposed order or to modify in any way their terms.

Analysis of Proposed Consent Order to Aid Public Comment 



The Federal Trade Commission has accepted an agreement to a proposed consent order from Sears, Roebuck & Co.,
Hoffman Estates, Illinois (``Sears''). Sears is a national chain of retail department stores. 

The proposed consent order has been placed on the public record for sixty (60) days for reception of comments by interested
persons. Comments received during this period will become part of the public record. After sixty (60) days, the Commission
will again review the agreement and the comments received and will decide whether it should withdraw from the agreement
and take other appropriate action, or make final the proposed order contained in the agreement. 

The complaint alleges that Sears has violated a Rule promulgated by the Federal Trade Commission (16 CFR 702.3(a))
pursuant to the Magnuson-Moss Consumer Warranty Act (15 U.S.C.  2301). This Rule requires Sears to make manufacturers'
warranty information available to consumers. The purposes of this Act, and the Rule, are to improve the information
available to consumers, to prevent deception, and to promote competition, in the marketing of consumer product warranties
offered by manufacturers. 

The Rule, called the ``Pre-Sale Availability Rule,'' gives retailers the option of either (1) displaying the text
of manufacturers' warranties in close proximity to the product display; or (2) furnishing the text of manufacturers'
warranties to customers upon request, and prominently displaying signs advising of the availability of such warranties.
The complaint alleges that Sears has not complied with either of these options. 

The proposed order requires Sears to comply with this Rule, to inform its retail store executives of their compliance
responsibilities, and to develop a program for instructing its sales personnel about the availability and location
of manufacturers' warranty information. Sears will be subject to civil penalties if it does not comply with the order.


The purpose of this analysis is to facilitate public comment on the proposed order. It is not intended to constitute
an official interpretation of the agreement and proposed order or to modify in any way their terms.

ACTION: 

Notice of Intent to Prepare an Environmental Impact Statement.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The General Services Administration (GSA) is issuing this notice to advise the public that an Environmental Impact
Statement (EIS) will be prepared and considered for the construction of a new U.S. Courthouse in Cleveland, Ohio.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The General Services Administration proposes to acquire a site and develop a new U.S. Courthouse consisting of approximately
800,000 gross square feet. The new facility will consolidate the district court and court-related agencies which
are currently housed in six different Government-owned and leased locations. Although the proposed building will
initially accommodate the projected 10-year space requirements of the courts, the site to be acquired will be of sufficient
size to allow for its expansion beyond that timeframe.




The existing U.S. Courthouse in Cleveland was constructed in 1910 and is listed on the National Register of Historic
Places. It contains a gross area of approximately 250,000 square feet and currently houses the district court, the
bankruptcy court and the U.S. court of appeals. Due to the significant expansion of the recent years, several court-related
tenants have been relocated into approximately 127,000 square feet of leased space. The proposed new courthouse
will, with the exception of two senior district judges, consolidate the entire direct court family and related agencies
in one building. The existing U.S. Courthouse will be retained, and will house two senior district judges and the bankruptcy
court. The EIS will evaluate alternative sites for the proposed facility, as well as the no-build alternative. The
EIS will also evaluate impacts on the affected environment for resource areas including geology and soils, air and
noise quality, cultural resources, land us, community services, traffic and transportation, hazardous materials,
economics and aesthetics



Public Scoping Meeting 




To ensure that the full range of issues relating to the proposed project are addressed and all potential significant
issues are identified, comments and suggestions are being solicited. To facilitate the receipt of comments, a public
scoping meeting will be held at 5:30 PM, Wednesday, July 13, 1994, at the A.J. Celebrezze Federal Building, 1240 E.
Ninth Street, Room B-1 (basement level), Cleveland, Ohio. Both written and oral comments will be accepted at
that time. 


Written comments may be mailed to the GSA contact person through July 29, 1994.

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Center for Infectious Diseases, announces the opportunity
for potential collaborators to enter into a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) for the further
development, refinement, and validation of three interrelated technologies: (1) The Exchangeable Template Reaction
(ETR), a method to assemble synthetic genes, (2) the construction of hepatitis C virus (HCV) specific ``mosaic''
proteins composed of immunodominant antigenic epitopes, and (3) differential HCV diagnostic tests. It is anticipated
that these and any new technologies or inventions which may arise from this CRADA will be licensed to the collaborator
with whom the CRADA is made. 



Because CRADAs are designed to facilitate the development of scientific and technological knowledge into useful,
marketable products, a great deal of freedom is given to Federal agencies in implementing collaborative research.
The CDC may accept staff, facilities, equipment, supplies, and money from the other participants in a CRADA; CDC may
provide staff, facilities, equipment, and supplies to the project. There is a single restriction in this exchange:
CDC MAY NOT PROVIDE FUNDS to the other participants in a CRADA. This opportunity is available until 30 days after publication
of this notice. Respondents may be provided a longer period of time to furnish additional information if CDC finds
this necessary. 




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The goal of this CRADA is to bring to market HCV-specific technologies that will improve public health. CDC will provide
intellectual insight and experimental design protocols to: (1) Improve the efficiency of ETR, (2) construct ``mosaic''
proteins for HCV that have immunodiagnostic and potential vaccine relevance, and (3) evaluate synthetic peptides
containing antigenic epitopes as reagents to discriminate recent from late infections or that may predict outcome
of HCV infection. CDC will design and conduct feasibility experiments for each of the project areas and will contribute
in the preparation of serologic panels to validate various test formats. The CRADA partner will prepare all synthetic
peptides and oligonucleotides as necessary for each project area, prepare monospecific and monoclonal antibodies
whenever appropriate, and purify antigens from recombinant lysates as needed. The collaborator will utilize its
expertise in market research to evaluate the commercialization of the technologies. 




Respondents should provide evidence of expertise in the development and evaluation of diagnostic assays, evidence
of experience in commercialization of diagnostics products, and supporting data (e.g., publications, proficiency
testing, certifications, resumes, etc.) of qualifications for the principle investigator who would be involved
in the CRADA. The 
respondent will develop the final research plan in collaboration with CDC. 

Applicant submissions will be judged according to the following criteria: 

1. Expertise in diagnostic virolgoy; 
2. Evidence of scientific credibility; 
3. Evidence of commitment and ability to develop innovative designs for diagnostic assays and/or vaccines; 
4. Evidence of preparing synthetic peptides and oligonucleotides; 
5. Evidence of a strong engineering department to design automated equipment; and, 
6. Evidence of an existing infrastructure to commercialize on successful technologies. 

This CRADA is proposed and implemented under the 1986 Federal Technology Transfer Act, Public Law 99-502 (15
U.S.C. 3710). 

The responses must be made to: Lisa Blake-Despigna, Technology Transfer Coordinator, National Center for Infectious
Diseases, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 1600 Clifton Road, NE., Mailstop C-19, Atlanta,
GA 30333.

<DOCTITLE>Cooperative Agreement for </DOCTITLE>
Laboratory Medicine Sentinel Monitoring Network 



Introduction 


The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announces the availability of fiscal year (FY) 1994 funds for
up to three cooperative agreements to become part of the Laboratory Medicine Sentinel Monitoring Network. The Public
Health Service (PHS) is committed to achieving the health promotion and disease prevention objectives of ``Healthy
People 2000,'' a PHS-led national activity to reduce morbidity and mortality and improve the quality of life. This
announcement is related to the priority area of Surveillance and Data Systems. (For ordering a copy of ``Healthy People
2000,'' see the section 

``WHERE TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.''

) 


Authority 


This program is authorized under section 317 (k)(3) [42 U.S.C. 247b(k)(3)] of the Public Health Service Act, as amended.




Smoke-Free Workplace 


The Public Health Service strongly encourages all grant recipients to provide a smoke-free workplace and promote
the non-use of all tobacco products. This is consistent with the PHS mission to protect and advance the physical and
mental health of the American people. 



Eligible Applicants 


Eligibility is limited to nonprofit organizations. Thus, universities, colleges, research institutions, hospitals,
other public and private organizations, and State and local health departments or their bona fide agents, are eligible
for these cooperative agreements. 

We are limiting eligibility to non-profit organizations to provide assistance to those organizations and to implement
long term laboratory medicine monitoring programs. 



Availability of Funds 



Approximately $250,000 will be available in FY 1994 to fund three cooperative agreements. It is expected that the
awards will begin on or about September 30, 1994, and will be made for a 12-month budget period within a project period
of up to five years. Funding estimates may vary and are subject to change. 

Continuation awards within the project period will be made on the basis of satisfactory progress and the availability
of funds. 



Purpose 


The purpose of these cooperative agreements is to develop data collection networks and to provide information about
the practice of laboratory medicine in hospital, physician office and independent laboratories. This cooperative
agreement will ultimately improve patient care by improving the quality of clinical laboratory medicine and increase
the availability of laboratory monitoring networks. 



Program Requirements 


In conducting the activities to achieve the purpose of the program, the recipients will be responsible for the activities
under A. (Recipient Activities), and CDC will be responsible for those activities under B. (CDC Activities). 



A. Recipient Activities



1. Solicit laboratories to voluntarily participate in the Monitoring Networks so that sufficient representatives
of each laboratory type (hospital, physician office, and independent) participate in the total network by the end
of the first year of operation. 

2. Provide leadership in the design and evaluation of questionnaires for periodic reporting of laboratory operational
characteristics and problems, especially those that impact patient care and on methods that are used by the network
participants during the period of the study. Topics investigated by the questionnaires and the time period of monitoring
may change during the cooperative agreement by mutual consent of both network participants and CDC. The actual monitoring
areas will be decided after the award of the cooperative agreement(s) and may differ for each of the laboratory groups.

The questionnaires should also capture information that determines the effectiveness of actions being taken by
participants to improve the practice of laboratory medicine. 
3. Provide leadership in collecting and sharing raw data both within the network and with CDC. Participant identification
information may be omitted from these data sets if the network manager(s) is able to respond to questions concerning
the validity of entered data without providing participant identification information.

<PARENT> FR940706-2-00044 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

4. Periodically send the developed questionnaires to network participants for them to gather and submit the response
data back. The network manager will then enter, analyze, and summarize the data for the participants in a statistically
valid manner. 
5. Prepare manuscripts for peer-review publications, as appropriate, that describe the results of one or more of
the activities listed above. Manuscripts should benefit the public good. All manuscripts would note the nature of
the funding for the project. 



B. CDC Activities 



1. Collaborate with the network in identifying those areas of Laboratory Medicine that have Public Health concerns.

2. Provide technical assistance with questionnaire development, data gathering devices, statistical analysis,
and writing summaries of the results. 
3. Collaborate in the development of a mutually defined data set standard for transmission of raw data. 
4. Assist with presentations (including visuals, materials, etc.,) of any delivered data at professional forums.
CDC staff may also assist in the presentation of material derived from these cooperative agreements. 
5. Provide technical assistance in the preparation of manuscripts related to the activities in this project.

during Construction.'' Peer reviewers will give their individual review comments and suggestions regarding the
scope of the study. Historically, many exposures related to construction have gone unquantified and uncontrolled.
The objective of this project is to provide the construction industry with information concerning practical, effective
engineering controls and work methods which minimize worker exposures to process-generated air contaminants.
The initial phases of this project will focus on drywall sanding and roofing kettles. Viewpoints and suggestions
from industry, labor, academia, other government agencies, and the public are invited.

3. Issues related to an increase in the retirement age. 
4. Issues, using the New Beneficiary Data System, on how aged individuals become poor and how the economic status of
individuals with disabilities and their families change. 
5. Issues related to differences in calculated poverty rates between the Survey of Income Program Participation
(SIPP) and the Current Population Survey (CPS). 



B. FY 1994 Grant Process 



The grant application process for FY 1994 will consist of a one-stage, full application. Applications are limited
to 20 single- or 40 double-spaced pages (excluding resumes, forms, etc.) and must relate to the selection criteria
established for review of applications. 

Priority areas in this announcement permit applicants to propose research efforts from 12 to 24 months in duration.
In item 11 of the Face Sheet (page 1 of form SSA-96-BK) indicate the priority area under which the application
is submitted, i.e., ORS-94-001, ORS-94-002, etc. 



Part II. Priority Research Areas 



In particular, the following projects will be considered for funding: 


A. Economic Circumstances of Aged Widows_ORS-94-001 



A high proportion of the elderly who are economically vulnerable are widowed women. Although as a group they experience
one of the highest rates of poverty, approximately three-quarters of widows aged 65 or older are not poor. Data from
the SIPP provide an opportunity to understand the economic circumstances of aged widows and to identify those factors
that are associated with their late-life poverty. 

Proposals are sought for SIPP-based research that conducts two types of analyses of the poverty of aged widows. The
first of these tasks is to provide a comprehensive description of the personal, financial, and environmental characteristics
of poor elderly widows. These characteristics will include details of income amounts and specific sources, assets,
personal and household characteristics (e.g., age, race, education, work history, fertility history, welfare
recipiency history, health status, urban vs rural location, age at which widowhood occurred). This descriptive
material should compare and contrast the incidence of poverty and its circumstances for aged widows with similar
measures for single elderly women who have never married, aged married women, and, where sample size permits, elderly
divorced women. 

The second task is to simulate the resulting economic scenario for married women aged 65 or older in the event of the
death of their husbands. This will involve projecting the time path of income and assets for the widow, given the couple's
economic circumstances at time of the SIPP interviews. The hypothetical widow's income should be based on Social
Security and Supplemental Security Income program rules, any pension income she has earned in her own right, whether
a husband with public or private pension rights has elected a survivor's option, asset income, the couple's life insurance
holdings, and so forth. It is expected that, where possible, the economic status of the couple prior to the husband's
death will be related to factors such as lifetime work experience of each spouse, current health status and health
insurance coverage, etc. In addition, various scenarios for asset decumulation associated with health expenditures
brought on by the husband's death might be introduced to account for reduced assets subsequently available to the
surviving spouse [See Linda Del Bene and Denton R. Vaughan, ``Income, Assets and Health Insurance: Economic Resources
for Meeting Acute Health Care Needs of the Aged,'' Social Security Bulletin, Spring 1992]. We are interested in learning
how the economic status of aged widows compares with their circumstances prior to the husband's death, whether particular
background factors can be used to predict which married women are particularly at risk of poverty in their old age,
and how the incomes and assets of widows change as the duration of widowhood increases. 

Grant proposals must be based on well-developed rigorous analysis. Applications may be submitted for multi-year
funding not to exceed 24 months in duration. 

The applications for multi-year funding should include a budget for the first budget period (not to exceed 12 months).
If the application is approved, a grant will be awarded for the initial 12-month budget period. Funding will subsequently
be provided for an additional 12-month budget period dependent on satisfactory performance of the initial budget
period, continued relevance of the project, and the availability of FY funds. 

It is anticipated that an amount up to $100,000 will be allocated to fund one project under this priority area for the
initial 12-month budget period. 



B. Selected Economic and Demographic Assumptions Used to Project the Financial Status of the OASDI Trust Funds_ORS-94-002




The annual reports of the Board of Trustees of the Federal OASDI Trust Funds contain long-range, 75-year projections
on the financial status of the trust funds. The assumptions and methodology underlying those projections were reviewed
by the Panel of Technical Experts (the Panel) convened by the quadrennial Advisory Council on Social Security and
recommendations for research were made. (The ``Social Security Technical Panel Report to the 1991 Advisory Council
on Social Security'' and its appendices were reprinted in the November and December 1990 issues of the Social Security
Bulletin.)

<PARENT> FR940706-2-00053 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

To address some of the Panel's recommendations for research, the principal topics of this priority are to better understand:
(i) the determinants of changes in productivity and earnings, and how to develop better methods of projecting future
productivity and earnings; (ii) the determinants of nominal and real interest rates and of how to project them; (iii)
the determinants of fertility and how to project future fertility rates; (iv) the determinants of mortality and how
to project future mortality rates; (v) the analysis of 

illegal

 immigration and how to project such immigration; and (vi) the conceptual framework for the current low-cost and high-cost
projections. 

Among the questions to be addressed on productivity and earnings are: What are the determinants of linkages between
productivity and earnings, particularly hours of work and fringe benefits? What are the effects of the changing quality
(including the question of measuring quality) and demographic mix of the labor force? What are the effects of research
and development by both the public and the private sectors? What are the effects of capital formation by the public
sector (e.g., public infrastructure) and by the private sector? What is the effect of the increasing integration
of U.S. and foreign markets? Are there analytical methods or strategies for selecting which averaging periods are
most appropriate in determining the various economic assumptions? What is the long-term relationship, if any, between
productivity and earnings and other economic and demographic factors? 

Among the questions to be addressed on nominal and real interest rates are: To what extent can the current structure
of interest rates be used to predict future interest rates? What are the determinants of inflation and are there analytical
methods for projecting future inflation rates? What strategies are optimal for incorporating both historical and
current interest rate information into the projections? What is the long-term relationship, if any, between nominal
and real interest rates and other economic and demographic variables? 

Among the questions to be addressed on fertility patterns in this priority area are: What are the determinants of fertility
and changes in fertility? What is the relationship between age at first birth and the total fertility rate? How do birth
rates of immigrants and of their children compare with those of non-immigrants and their children? Will future trends
in fertility rates by race and ethnic group mirror past trends? For assumptions used in projecting fertility, can
an analytical framework be developed to help decide how much weight to put on long-term trend information and how much
weight to put on the most recent trends? Is there empirical evidence supporting alternative weighting schemes? 

Among those questions to be addressed on mortality are: What are the determinants of mortality and rates of change
in mortality? What evidence is there for projecting changes in mortality for specific causes (e.g., cancer, heart,
etc.) based on changes in smoking, nutrition, and other lifestyle patterns? For assumptions used in projecting mortality,
can an analytical framework be developed to help decide how much weight to put on long-term trend information and how
much weight to put on the most recent trends? Is there empirical evidence supporting alternative weighting schemes?


Among the questions to be addressed on 

illegal 

immigrants are: Estimates of current numbers, labor-force participation rates, and rates of immigration of illegal
immigrants; analysis of factors likely to affect future immigration rates of illegal immigrants and projections
based on this analysis; the length of coverage and average earnings of illegal immigrants and the length of time they
remain in the country; and the extent to which illegal immigrants receive benefits based upon their coverage under
the system. 

Among the questions to be asked with respect to the conceptual framework for the current low-cost and high-cost projections
are: Although theoretically, the current low-cost and high-cost projections represent a collection of extreme
values for each of the variables, how should these bounds be interpreted_as absolute bounds on what could possibly
happen, as confidence levels, as illustrative alternative projections, or as sensitivity analyses? (Attention
should be given to the way in which rates of inflation are incorporated into the low-cost and high-cost projections.)
Should the projections incorporate interrelationships among the economic and demographic variables (for example,
among others, interactions among fertility, marital status, labor force participation, and birth expectations),
and if so, which interrelationships are critical, and how should they be incorporated? 

Grant proposals must be based on well-developed rigorous analysis. Applications may be submitted for multi-year
funding not to exceed 24 months in duration.

The applications for multi-year funding should include a budget for the first budget period (not to exceed 12 months).
If the application is approved, a grant will be awarded for the initial 12-month budget period. Funding will subsequently
be provided for an additional 12-month budget period dependent on satisfactory performance of the initial budget
period, continued relevance of the project, and the availability of FY funds. 
It is anticipated that up to $240,000 will be allocated to fund one or more projects under this priority area for the
initial 12-month budget period. 


C. Issues Related to the Scheduled Increase in the Retirement Age_ORS-94-003 


The Social Security Amendments of 1983 (Public Law 98-21) provide for a gradual increase in the age at which unreduced
retired-workers benefits are first payable (for brevity, the retirement age) from 65 to 67 between the years 2000
and 2027. Benefits for retired workers still will be available at age 62, but the amount payable will be gradually reduced
from the currently payable 80 percent of the unreduced benefit to 70 percent. It has further been proposed to speed
up the phase-in to a higher retirement age, and to increase the retirement age to 68 (70 in one proposal). At least one
proposal also increases the early retirement age to 65. (The executive summary of the report mandated by Congress
and consultant reports were reprinted in the October 1986 and February 1987 issues of the Social Security Bulletin.)

1. The increase in retirement age is based on the assumption that the increase in life expectancy has been accompanied
by a corresponding improvement in health and capacity to work. But past studies are inconclusive about the relationship
between longevity and work ability, especially among persons in their sixties. Proposals are sought to further investigate
these relationships, using either new approaches, more current data, and/or new databases. 
One possible approach would be to use microdata collected by the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) to examine
trends in health and ability to work. Data should be presented for subgroups of major interest for the retirement age
issue (both early and normal retirement), subject to sampling error problems. A wide 
range of variables that measure health and ability to work should be included. 
2. The retirement-age increase may also impact on the Social Security Disability Insurance (DI) program. Studies
are needed to address questions such as: (i) what is the expected impact on the number of DI beneficiaries and their
duration on the rolls and on the DI Trust Fund; (ii) how many workers would qualify for DI benefits at age 65 and 66 and
how many would elect to receive benefits; and (iii) among those aged 62-64 who do not now elect to apply for DI benefits,
how many might do so because of the additional reduction in benefits for early retirement that accompanies a retirement-age
increase (including the elimination in some proposals of 

early

 benefits for workers aged 62-64)? 
Grant proposals must be based on well-developed, rigorous analysis. Applicants may submit applications for funding
not to exceed 17 months in duration. 
The applications should include a budget for the total period of the grant (not to exceed 17 months). If the application
is approved, a grant will be awarded for the entire budget period of the grant. 
It is anticipated that up to $190,000 will be allocated to fund one or more projects for up to 17 months under this priority
area. 


D. Analyses of the New Beneficiary Data System_ORS-94-004 


This project is intended to encourage research with the New Beneficiary Data System (NBDS) developed by SSA over the
past decade to study the changing circumstances of aged and disabled beneficiaries. Based initially on a survey of
new beneficiaries at the beginning of the 1980's, the dataset has been expanded with information from administrative
records (on benefits, covered earnings, Supplemental Security Income, and Medicare) and followup interviews with
survivors from the original survey. With the exception of the Medicare records, all administrative data have been
obtained both for respondents and spouses.

The original sample contained representative samples of new Social Security beneficiaries who filed for benefits
as retired workers, disabled workers, wives, widows, divorced wives, and surviving divorced wives. There was also
a representative sample of persons aged 65 and over who were entitled to Medicare benefits but who had not yet received
Social Security cash benefits. The aged sample was, for the most part, in its mid- to late-60's in 1982 and in its mid-
to late-70's in 1991. Some of the sample members were 
affected by the ``notch'' that was created when legislation was enacted to correct for an overcompensation in the
benefit formula for inflation. 
The original interview covered a wide range of topics, including demographic characteristics, marital and childbearing
history, employment history, current income (in the format of the SIPP) and assets, and health. The followup interview,
in addition to asking many of the same questions as the original interview, collected a history of critical events
since 1982 (such as widowhood or divorce, work cessation, migration, and the sale of the home) and the financial impact
of these critical events. The original health items of work disability, functional capacity, and presence of major
diseases were expanded to assess specific Activities of Daily Living and Instrumental Activities of Daily Living,
private health insurance provisions, and the longest experience in a long-term care facility. Disabled workers
who returned to work were asked about their job search experience, employer accommodations to their disability,
and their use of vocational and rehabilitation services. 
Background material and a compilation of reports based on the 1982 New Beneficiary Survey are available. These reports
were also published in various editions of the Social Security Bulletin from 1983 to 1993. 
Using the NBDS, the following projects will be considered for funding: 


1. Understanding How Aged Beneficiaries Become Poor 


Although poverty rates among the aged have declined substantially over the last 30 years, there are still some troublesome
problems and poverty among aged women is a particular concern. Various legislative proposals have been made or discussed
to improve the treatment of women under the Social Security program, including care-giving credits, increasing
benefits at some age, eliminating the actuarial reduction for early benefit receipt at some age, modifying the Social
Security special minimum benefit, and redesigning couple benefits in order to enhance survivor benefits. However,
many of the proposals are not well targeted to the poor. Proposals for research are sought to increase our understanding
of why aged beneficiaries, and especially aged women, become poor, which will improve our ability to form policy in
this area. 
Some of the key research questions are: To what extent is aged poverty a continuation of a lifetime of low income? To
what extent is aged poverty a result of aged couples decumulating assets as they age? What are the economic effects
of widowhood, including the extent to which sources of income are lost or reduced, and the extent to which high health
care expenditures surrounding the death of a spouse are a major cause of high poverty rates among the aged who have become
widowed? Is the type of social security benefit received (retired worker benefits, wife or widow benefits, worker
benefits that are supplemented because of entitlement to a higher spouse or survivor benefit and those that are not,
retirement benefits that were converted from a disability benefit at age 65 and those that were not) related to differing
poverty rates in 1982, and are those patterns the same among beneficiaries 10 years later? How different is the role
of major sources of income (including social security, other pensions, asset income, earnings, and Supplemental
Security Income_an SSA-administered ``safety net'' program) in 1991 than it was in 1982? 


2. Changing Economic Status of Individuals With Disabilities and Their Families 


We know that newly disabled individuals in 1982 were less well-off than newly retired individuals in terms of both
income and assets. However, little or no research has been done to follow disabled individuals over time to determine
whether they have particular problems maintaining an adequate standard of living. The well-being of many individuals
with disabilities depends not only on their own income but also on the income and/or services provided by family members,
such as the earnings of spouses, or help with activities of daily living that may mean the difference between living
in the community and having to be institutionalized.

Among the questions to be addressed are: How adequate are the income and assets of individuals with disabilities just
after benefit receipt and 10 years later? To what extent do disabled individuals maintain their economic status over
this period of time? What factors are associated with changes in economic status over the period? How do family members
affect the economic status of disabled workers? 
Analyses should include background factors (such as demographic characteristics, previous occupational characteristics
and earnings, living arrangements, family characteristics, and health conditions), major changes in life circumstances
(such as widowhood or divorce, changes in living arrangements, or a spouse changing hours of work or retiring), sources
of income, changes in the health status, and health-care costs and how these factors relate to various economic outcomes.

Proposals should identify the expected methods of analysis, the possible variables to be considered, and the logic
for inclusion. Application may be submitted for multi-year funding not to exceed 24 months in duration. 
The applications for multi-year funding should include a budget for the first budget period (not to exceed 12 months).
If the application is approved, a grant will be awarded for the initial 12-month budget period. Funding will subsequently
be provided for an additional 12-month budget period dependent on satisfactory performance of the initial budget
period, continued relevance of the project, and the availability of FY funds. 
It is anticipated that up to $190,000 will be allocated to fund one or more projects for the initial 12-month budget
period under this priority area. 


E. Documenting and Explaining SIPP-CPS Differences in Aged Poverty Rates_ORS-94-005 


The official poverty measure and its three derivative statistics (poverty counts, poverty rates and poverty gaps)
are important and frequently used criteria employed in the formulation of policy and the evaluation of program outcomes
for the aged and disabled populations served by SSA. 
Twelve-month poverty rates based on the SIPP are somewhat lower for many population subgroups than the poverty rates
estimated from the CPS. Much of the comparison of poverty rates from the two surveys has been based on the first operational
SIPP panel (the 1984 panel) which pertained to the 1983-85 time period. In the 1984 panel context, SIPP-CPS poverty
rate differences for the aged, were, if anything, less marked than for younger age groups. Based on a review of published
poverty rate estimates based on SIPP panels for 1985-1990 and comparison to corresponding estimates based
on the CPS, it appears that a significant change in the pattern of SIPP-CPS differences in poverty rates appeared with
the introduction of the 1985 SIPP panel. Key features of the change in the pattern of SIPP-CPS differences in poverty
rates include: 1) a modest decline in the poverty rate for all ages in the SIPP relative to the CPS; 2) a much more marked
SIPP-CPS difference in poverty rates for the aged than the nonaged (with SIPP rates for the aged ranging between 28
and 34 percent below those based on the CPS); 3) a marked attenuation of the tendency for poverty rates to increase strongly
with age among those age 65 and older in the SIPP context as compared with the CPS. Furthermore, preliminary research
conducted at SSA indicates that SIPP_CPS poverty rate differences among the aged appear to vary significantly by
sex, age, marital status, race and ethnicity; differences appear to be particularly marked for persons who are married,
white, or age 85 or older.

Studies are needed (1) to describe more fully the pattern of SIPP_CPS differences in poverty estimates for the aged,
and (2) to establish, if possible, the factors giving rise to the observed differences. SIPP-CPS differences should
be delineated for population subgroups defined in terms of salient characteristics such as marital status, more
broadly defined aspects of family composition, including the presence of nonaged family members, age, race and ethnicity.
Differences should, at a minimum, be characterized in terms of poverty counts, rates, and the poverty gap. Particular
attention should be given to evaluating possible differences between the two surveys in the portrayal of poverty
as it relates to increasing age. Given that the pattern of poverty by population subgroup is of particular interest,
the relatively small sample size available in single SIPP panels as compared with the CPS is likely to be of some concern.
If, as is suggested by review of published estimates, it can be shown that the basic patterns of SIPP-CPS differences
are stable across the post-1984 SIPP panels, serious consideration should be given to pooling the post-1984 panels
in order to support as detailed a subgroup analysis as is possible, given the substantially larger sample sizes available
from pooled samples. If the combining of SIPP panels seems feasible, the combined panels should be employed to support
the explanatory phase of the overall study, as well. 
After developing a plan for documenting more fully SIPP-CPS differences in the portrayal of poverty among the aged,
the grantee might discuss how the observed differences might be explained. In this regard a critical review of the
literature that has considered the differences between poverty rate estimates from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics
(PSID) and the CPS might prove quite useful in generating hypotheses and in formulating empirical approaches to testing
the hypotheses. While several possible factors are likely to be suggested by this review (e.g., sample weighting,
particularly that component of the overall weighting scheme designed to deal with panel attrition; differing operationalizations
of the income unit; differing income concepts; and the quality of income data), emphasis in empirical work should
be given to the last factor, the relative quality of the income data from the two surveys. However, some attention could
also be given to the change in SIPP-CPS differences in poverty estimates that occurred with the introduction of the
1985 SIPP panel.

1

 The nature of each hypothesized factor to be considered and how it might cause the observed pattern of SIPP-CPS differences
might be described. A closely reasoned plan for empirically assessing the possible impact data quality on the differences
in SIPP-CPS poverty rates for the aged may be presented. Particular emphasis should be given to explaining the relevance
of each proposed test for clarifying the observed pattern of SIPP-CPS differences, notwithstanding the fact that
it may not be possible to devise fully unambiguous tests of the effects of income data quality on the observed SIPP-CPS
differences. 




Given the level of available funding, empirical work should be limited to describing the pattern of SIPP-CPS differences
in poverty estimates (rates, counts, and gaps). 
As much of the study will revolve around comparison of alternative estimates within or between survey contexts, issues
of statistical inference also need to be given careful consideration. In particular, given the results of SSA research
on the variance properties of SIPP-based estimates of the aged, standard errors for SIPP estimates should be based
on the generalized variance parameters as estimated by SSA (see the note by Bye and Gallicchio appearing in the winter
1993 Social Security Bulletin) or calculated directly from the survey file using the methods outlined in the Bye-Gallicchio
article. 
Grant proposals must be based on well-developed, rigorous analysis. Applicants may submit applications for funding
not to exceed 17 months in duration. 
The applications should include a budget for the total period of the grant (not to exceed 17 months). If the application
is approved, a grant will be awarded for the entire budget period of the grant.

It is anticipated that an amount up to $135,000 will be allocated to fund one or more projects for up to 17 months under
this priority area. 







Note

: To foster the sharing of research, principal investigators for each grant awarded will be required to (1) include
in the final report an executive summary which SSA could publish in the quarterly Social Security Bulletin and (2)
discuss the results of their research with SSA staff. Funds should be included in the grant budget for a meeting at the
SSA Office of Research and Statistics, Washington, DC. 



Part III. Application Process 



A. Eligible Applicants 



Any State or local government, public or private organization, nonprofit or for-profit organization, or agency,

<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Exxon Valdez Oil Spill Public Advisory Group Nomination Solicitation.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Exxon Valdez Oil Spill Trustee Council is soliciting nominations for the Public Advisory Group which advises
the Trustee Council on decisions related to the planning, evaluation, and conduct of injury assessment and restoration
activities using funds obtained for purposes of restoration as part of the civil settlement pursuant to the T/V Exxon
Valdez oil spill of 1989. Public Advisory Group members will be selected to serve a two-year term beginning in October
1994.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The Public Advisory Group was created by Paragraph V.A.4 of the Memorandum of Agreement and Consent Decree entered
into by the United States of America and the State of Alaska on August 27, 1991, and approved by the United States District
Court for the District of Alaska in settlement of 

United States of America v. State of Alaska, 

Civil Action No. A91-081 CV. The Public Advisory Group was created to advise the Trustee Council on matters relating
to decisions on injury assessment, restoration activities, or other use of natural resources damage recoveries
obtained by the governments.


The Trustee Council consists of representatives of the State of Alaska Attorney General; Commissioner of the Alaska
Department of Fish and Game; Commissioner of the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation; the Secretary
of the Interior; the Secretary of Agriculture; and the Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration,
U.S. Department of Commerce. Appointment to the Public Advisory Group will be made by the Secretary of the Interior
with unanimous approval of the Trustees.
The Public Advisory Group consists of 17 members representing the public at large (5 members) and the following special
interests: aquaculture, commercial fishing, commercial tourism, forest products, environmental, conservation,
local government, Native landowners, recreation users, sport hunting and fishing, subsistence, and science/academic.
Two additional ex officio non-voting members are from the Alaska State House of Representatives and the Alaska State
Senate.
Nominees need to submit the following information to the Trustee Council:
1. A biographical sketch (education, experience, address, telephone);
2. Information about the nominee's knowledge of the region, peoples, or principal economic and social activities
of the area affected by the T/V Exxon Valdez oil spill, or expertise in public lands and resource management;
3. Information about the nominee's relationship/involvement (if any) with the principal interest to be represented;
4. A statement explaining any unique contributions the nominee will make to the Public Advisory Group and why the nominee
should be appointed to serve as a member;
5. Any additional relevant information that would assist the Trustee Council in making a recommendation; and
6. A disclosure statement of any potential conflict of interest. Public Advisory Group members and their alternates
are chosen to represent a broad range of interests. It is possible that action could be taken by the Public Advisory
Group when one or more of the members have a direct personal conflict of interest which would prejudice and call into
question the entire public process. To avoid this eventuality and to enable the Trustee Council to choose appropriate
individuals as members and/or alternates to members, it is necessary that each nominee provide the following information
with their information packet. If the answer to any of these questions is yes, please provide a brief explanation of
your answer. A yes will not necessarily preclude any nominee from being appointed to serve on the Public Advisory Group.

<DOCTITLE>Notice of Record of Decision for Walnut Creek National Wildlife Refuge Master Plan, Jasper County, IA</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Fish and Wildlife Services, U.S. Department of the Interior.




</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This notice makes available to the public a summary of the Record of Decision (ROD) for the proposed Master Plan for
the Walnut Creek National Wildlife Refuge, located in Jasper County, Iowa. Establishment of the 8,654-acre Refuge
was approved on September 5, 1990. Federal funding for design, construction, and operation of the Refuge is provided
through appropriations by the U.S. Congress. Pursuant to Council on Environmental Quality regulations implementing
the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) (40 CFR 1505.2), the Service issues this ROD upon consideration of the
Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) prepared for the Proposed Action. The U.S. Department of Army, Corps
of Engineers (USCOE), acting as a cooperating agency in the preparation of the FEIS also adopts the FEIS and ROD as its
NEPA documentation.



A Notice of Availability of the FEIS was published by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in the 

Federal Register

 on July 23, 1993.

The FEIS evaluated alternatives for four elements of the Master Plan: habitat/wildlife emphasis, management, programs,
and facilities siting. Based upon an evaluation of the impacts of the various alternatives on the physical, biological,
social, and economic environments, the Preferred Alternative was identified. The Preferred Alternative is a balance
of several options and is comprised of the following elements:





Alternative I.D: Restoration and reconstruction of over 7000 acres of tallgrass prairie/savanna habitat with reintroduction
of bison and elk.

Alternative II.E: Active habitat reconstruction and management to maximize environmental education.

Alternative III.C: Intermediate refuge program including indoor and outdoor environmental education programs
and facilities, a visitor center with a tour route and trail system, small laboratory facilities and overnight accommodations
for researchers; and other opportunities for interpretation and recreational public use.



Alternative IV.B: Consolidated facilities siting the visitor center, research facilities and maintenance facility
in a central campus.





Other alternatives considered included: the no build alternative, creation of extensive wetland habitat for waterfowl
and fisheries, limited public use programs and facilities and active prairie reconstruction to maximize research.



Comments Received



Prior to preparation of the FEIS, the Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) on the Proposed Master Plan for
the Walnut Creek National Wildlife Refuge was circulated for public review and comment. Comments were received from
agencies and individuals expressing concerns about the findings of the DEIS. Issues raised in these comments included
but were not limited to the habitat reconstruction process including seed sources, the potential for habitat fragmentation,
and the reintroduction of bison and elk; the potential environmental effects of recreational facilities; the siting
of Refuge facilities to minimize environmental impacts; Section 404 permit requirements; Refuge access; and historic
resource issues. All substantive issues raised in the comments have been addressed to the satisfaction of the Service
and the USCOE either through revisions incorporated into the FEIS text or responses contained in Section 6.5 of the
FEIS. These responses are incorporated by reference into the ROD. No comments were received on the FEIS.



Findings and Decision



Based upon a careful review and consideration of the impacts identified in the FEIS, results of the various studies
and surveys conducted in conjunction with the DEIS and FEIS, public comments received on the DEIS, and other relevant
factors, including the purposes for which the Refuge was established by Congress and statutory and regulatory guidance
for funding such projects, the Service, with concurrence by the USCOE, finds as follows:

(1) The Preferred Alternative consists of the programs and facilities mentioned above.

(2) The Preferred Alternative represents the best balance between provision of environmental education, interpretive,
recreational, and research facilities and programs, minimization of environmental impacts, and public and agency
concerns identified during the public participation process.

<DOCNO> FR940706-2-00104 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940706-2-00058 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(3) Consistent with economic, social, and other essential considerations, to the maximum extent practicable, potential
adverse environmental effects identified in the FEIS will be minimized or avoided by incorporating mitigative measures
as conditions of Federal funding approval and permit issuance. These measures are described in Section 4.0 of the
FEIS.
(4) A wetland mitigation plan providing in-kind and on-site replacement for unavoidable adverse impacts to existing
wetlands has been developed and will be implemented, resulting in no net loss of wetland habitat values over time.
Specific details regarding the mitigation plan have been developed through the Section 404 permit process.
(5) No state or federally listed endangered or threatened species or their critical habitats are known to be adversely
affected by the project.
(6) No historic properties listed in or eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places are known
to be adversely affected by the project.
(7) Statutory authority for the Service to fund and implement, and for the USCOE to permit, the project exists.
(8) The requirements of NEPA and the implementing regulations (40 CFR Parts 1500-1508) have been satisfied.
The ROD serves as the written facts and conclusions relied upon in reaching this decision. A complete copy of the ROD
is filed at the Refuge together with the other NEPA documents. For further information contact: Mr. Richard M. Birger,
Refuge Manager, Walnut Creek National Wildlife Refuge, P.O. Box 399, Prairie City, Iowa 50228. Telephone: (515)

As a condition to use of this exemption, any employee affected by the abandonment shall be protected under

<DOCTITLE>Hughes Christiansen Co. a/k/a Baker Hughes Oilfield Operations, Inc. Headquartered in Houston, TX; Amended Certification
Regarding Eligibility To Apply for Worker Adjustment Assistance</DOCTITLE>



In accordance with Section 223 of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 USC 2273) the Department of Labor issued a Certification
of Eligibility to Apply for Worker Adjustment Assistance applicable to all workers of the subject firm. The certification
notice was issued on May 17, 1994 and published in the 

Federal Register

 on June 1, 1994 (59 FR 28429).

At the request of the State Agency, the Department reviewed the certification for workers of the subject firm. The
investigation findings show that the correct name of the subject firm through December 31, 1992 was Hughes Christiansen
Company, Inc. In 1993, Hughes Cristiansen Company became an operating division of Baker Hughes Oilfield Operations,
Inc., and the claimants' wages were reported under an unemployment insurance (UI) tax account for Baker Hughes Oilfield

<DOCTITLE>Sportette Industries, Inc., Nazareth, PA; NU-Place, Inc., Nazareth, PA; Amended Certification Regarding Eligibility
to Apply for Worker Adjustment Assistance</DOCTITLE>



In accordance with Section 223 of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2273) the Department of Labor issued a Certification
of Eligibility to Apply for Worker Adjustment Assistance on April 20, 1994, applicable to all workers of the subject
firm. The certification notice was published in the Federal Register on May 11, 1994 (59 FR 24483).

At the request of the State Agency, the Department reviewed the certification for workers of the subject firm. The
findings show that Nu-Place and Sportette were subsidiaries of Quartet Fashions in New York. The findings show that
production at Nu-Place was integrated with the production at Sportette and Nu-Place closed in January 1994.

The intent of the Department's certification is to include all workers who were adversely affected by increased imports
of ladies' pants, skirts, blouses and jackets. Accordingly, the Department is amending the certification by including
the workers at Nu-Place, Inc. in Nazareth, Pennsylvania.

The amended notice applicable to TA-W-29,618 is hereby issued as follows:

``All workers of Sportette Industries, Inc., Nazareth, Pennsylvania and Nu-Place, Inc., Nazareth, Pennsylvania
engaged in the production of ladies' pants, skirts, blouses and jackets who became totally or partially separated
from employment on or after March 1, 1993 are eligible to apply for adjustment assistance under Section 223 of the Trade
Act of 1974.''

Adjustment Assistance</DOCTITLE>


Pursuant to Title V of the North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act (P.L. 103-182) concerning
transitional adjustment assistance, hereinafter called (NAFTA-TAA), and in accordance with Section 250(a),
Subchapter D, Chapter 2, Title II, of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2273), the Department of Labor issued
a Certification of Eligibility to Apply for NAFTA-Transitional Adjustment assistance on April 22, 1994, applicable
to workers of Valeo Climate Control Corporation in Fort Worth, Texas. The certification did not apply to workers in
the Rapid Product Development Group at the Fort Worth, Texas location of Valeo Climate Control Corporation. The Notice
will be published in the Federal Register

.
At the request of the company, the Department reviewed the certification. New information from the company shows
that worker separations from the Rapid Product Development Group of the Fort Worth, Texas facility of Valeo Climate
Control Corporation were related to the shift in production from the subject plant to Mexico.
The Department's certification is amended to include workers in the Rapid Product Development Group.
The amended notice applicable to NAFTA-00051 is hereby issued as follows:
``All workers of Valeo Climate Control Corporation in Fort Worth, Texas, including workers in the Rapid Product Development
Group, who become totally or partially separated from employment on or after December 8, 1993 are eligible to apply
for NAFTA-TAA under Section 250 of the Trade Act of 1994.''

<USDEPT>UNITED STATES NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION</USDEPT>



<DOCTITLE>Biweekly Notice</DOCTITLE>



Applications and Amendments to Facility Operating Licenses
Involving No Significant Hazards Considerations

I. Background


Pursuant to Public Law 97-415, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission or NRC staff) is publishing
this regular biweekly notice. Public Law 97-415 revised section 189 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the
Act), to require the Commission to publish notice of any amendments issued, or proposed to be issued, under a new provision
of section 189 of the Act. This provision grants the Commission the authority to issue and make immediately effective
any amendment to an operating license upon a determination by the Commission that such amendment involves no significant
hazards consideration, notwithstanding the pendency before the Commission of a request for a hearing from any person.

This biweekly notice includes all notices of amendments issued, or proposed to be issued from June 13, 1994, through
June 23, 1994. The last biweekly notice was published on June 22, 1994 (59 FR 32226). 



Notice Of Consideration Of Issuance Of Amendments To Facility Operating Licenses, Proposed No Significant Hazards
Consideration Determination, And Opportunity For A Hearing



The Commission has made a proposed determination that the following amendment requests involve no significant hazards
consideration. Under the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facility in accordance
with the proposed amendment would not (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an
accident previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident
previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The basis for this proposed determination
for each amendment request is shown below. 
The Commission is seeking public comments on this proposed determination. Any comments received within 30 days after
the date of publication of this notice will be considered in making any final determination. 
Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendment until the expiration of the 30-day notice period. However,
should circumstances change during the notice period such that failure to act in a timely way would result, for example,
in derating or shutdown of the facility, the Commission may issue the license amendment before the expiration of the
30-day notice period, provided that its final determination is that the amendment involves no significant hazards
consideration. The final determination will consider all public and State comments received before action is taken.
Should the Commission take this action, it will publish in the 

Federal Register 

a notice of issuance and provide for opportunity for a hearing after issuance. The Commission expects that the need
to take this action will occur very infrequently. 
Written comments may be submitted by mail to the Rules Review and Directives Branch, Division of Freedom of Information
and Publications Services, Office of Administration, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555,
and should cite the publication date and page number of this 

Federal Register 

notice. Written comments may also be delivered to Room 6D22, Two White Flint North, 11555 Rockville Pike, Rockville,
Maryland from 7:30 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. Federal workdays. Copies of written comments received may be examined at the NRC
Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555. The filing of requests for a hearing
and petitions for leave to intervene is discussed below.
By August 5, 1994, the licensee may file a request for a hearing with respect to issuance of the amendment to the subject
facility operating license and any person whose interest may be affected by this proceeding and who wishes to participate
as a party in the proceeding must file a written request for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene. Requests
for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's ``Rules of Practice
for Domestic Licensing Proceedings'' in 10 CFR Part 2. Interested persons should consult a current copy of 10 CFR 2.714
which is available at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington,
DC 20555 and at the local public document room for the particular facility involved. If a request for a hearing or petition
for leave to intervene is filed by the above date, the Commission or an Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, designated
by the Commission or by the Chairman of the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board Panel, will rule on the request and/or
petition; and the Secretary or the designated Atomic Safety and Licensing Board will issue a notice of a hearing or
an appropriate order. 
As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall set forth with particularity the interest of the
petitioner in the proceeding, and how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding. The petition
should specifically explain the reasons why intervention should be permitted with particular reference to the following
factors: (1) the nature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made a party to the proceeding; (2) the nature and
extent of the petitioner's property, financial, or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect
of any order which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest. The petition should also identify
the specific aspect(s) of the subject matter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Any person
who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has been admitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting
leave of the Board up to 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended
petition must satisfy the specificity requirements described above.
Not later than 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file
a supplement to the petition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions which are sought to be litigated
in the matter. Each contention must consist of a specific statement of the issue of law or fact to be raised or controverted.
In addition, the petitioner shall provide a brief explanation of the bases of the contention and a concise statement
of the alleged facts or expert opinion which support the contention and on which the petitioner intends to rely in proving
the contention at the hearing. The petitioner must also provide references to those specific sources and documents
of which the petitioner is aware and on which the petitioner intends to rely to establish those facts or expert opinion.
Petitioner must provide sufficient information to show that a genuine dispute exists with the applicant on a material
issue of law or fact. Contentions shall be limited to matters within the scope of the amendment under consideration.
The contention must be one which, if proven, would entitle the petitioner to relief. A petitioner who fails to file

County, Ohio




Date of amendment request: 

June 2, 1994


Description of amendment request: 

The proposed amendment would merge Toledo Edison Company into Cleveland Electric Illuminating Company. As described
in the application, the company formed from the merger is intended to be renamed. Therefore, the licensee uses the
nomenclature ``NEWCO'' as a temporary name of the combined operating company, and will provide the permanent name
by supplemental letter. The amendment would (1) replace the Toledo Edison Company and Cleveland Electric Illuminating
Company with ``NEWCO'' as a licensee, (2) designate ``NEWCO'' as the owner of the Perry Nuclear Power Plant, Unit 1,
and (3) make other administrative changes to the license as indicated in the amendment application. Centerior Service
Company would be unaffected by the amendment and would remain a licensee.


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:



1. The proposed changes do not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated.

The proposed changes to the Operating License are administrative and have no effect on any plant systems. All Limiting
Conditions for Operation, Limiting Safety Systems Settings and Safety Limits specified in the Technical Specifications
remain unchanged. This change meets one of the examples of a change not likely to involve a significant hazards consideration
in that it is a purely administrative changes (48 FR 14864).

2. The proposed changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated.

The proposed changes to the Operating License are administrative and have no effect on any plant systems. All Limiting
Conditions for Operation, Limiting Safety Systems Settings and Safety Limits specified in the Technical Specifications
remain unchanged. This change meets one of the examples of a change not likely to involve a significant hazards consideration

Date of amendment request: 

May 20, 1994


Description of amendment request: 

The proposed amendment would permit the licensee to use an alternate repair criteria (ARC), designated as the F

*

 criteria. Use of the F

*

 criteria would allow tubes with otherwise pluggable indications, to remain in service as long as the indications
are below the designated minimum distance of the F

*

 criteria. The F

*

 criteria defines a length of 1.7 inches of undegraded expanded tube within the tubesheet as the minimum distance acceptable
for implementing this ARC. Below the F

*

 length, a circumferential tube defect can exist and the tube can remain in service. The proposed amendment will change
the plugging limit definition and would exclude plugging steam generator tubes with indications that satisfy the
F

*

 criteria. The F

*

 criteria maintains the structural integrity of the degraded tube as the primary pressure boundary and allows the
tube to remain in service for heat transfer and core cooling. 
This alternate repair criteria qualification is documented in Babcock & Wilcox Nuclear Technologies (BWNT)
Topical Report BAW-10196 P Revision 1, ``W-D4 F

*

 Qualification Report'', which is included as part of the licensee's submittal. 


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:


A. The proposed changes do not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated. 

The supporting qualification report for the subject criteria demonstrates that the presence of the tubesheet will
enhance the tube integrity in the region of the tube-to-tubesheet roll expansions by precluding tube deformation
beyond its initial expanded outside diameter. The resistance to a tube rupture is strengthened by the presence of
the tubesheet in that region. The results of hardrolling of the tube into the tubesheet provides a mechanical leak
limiting seal between the tube and the tubesheet. A tube rupture cannot occur because the contact between the tube
and the tubesheet does not permit sufficient movement of tube material. 

The type of degradation for which the F

*

 criteria has been developed (cracking with a circumferential orientation) can theoretically lead to a postulated
tube rupture event provided that the postulated through-wall circumferential crack exists near the top of the tubesheet.
An evaluation including analysis and testing has been done to determine the resistive strength of the expanded tubes
within the tubesheet. This evaluation provides the basis for the acceptance criteria for tube degradation subject
to the F

*

 criteria. 

The F

*

 length of roll expansion is sufficient to preclude tube pullout from tube degradation located below the F

*

 distance, regardless of the extent of the tube degradation. The Technical Specification leakage rate requirements
and accident analysis assumptions remain unchanged in the unlikely event that significant leakage from this region
does occur. The tube rupture and pullout is fully bounded by the existing steam generator tube rupture analysis included
in the UFSAR. The leakage testing of the roll expanded tubes indicates that for tube expansion lengths approximately
equal to the F

*

 distance, any postulated primary to secondary leakage from F

*

 tubes would be insignificant. The proposed alternate repair criteria does not adversely impact any other previously
evaluated design basis accident. 

The leakage from an F

*

 tube would be limited by the tube-to-tubesheet interface since this leak would occur below the secondary face of the
tubesheet. Qualification testing and previous experience indicate that normal and faulted leakage is well below
Technical Specification and administrative limits creating no increase in the consequences associated with tube
rupture type leakages. The UFSAR analyzed accident scenarios are still bounding since the normal and faulted leak
rates are well within the normal operating limit of 150 gallons per day. This conclusion is consistent with previous
F

*

 programs approved and used at other operating plants. 

All of the design and operating characteristics of the steam generator and connected systems are preserved since
the F

*

 criteria utilizes the ``as rolled'' tube configuration that exists as part of the original steam generator design.
The F

*

 joint has been analyzed and tested for design, operating, and faulted condition loadings in accordance with Regulatory
Guide 1.121 safety factors. The potential for tube rupture is not increased from the original submittal as demonstrated
in the qualification analyses and testing completed in the BWNT report. 

Therefore, this change does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated. 

B. The proposed changes do not create the possibility of a new or different type of accident from any accident previously
evaluated. 

Implementation of the proposed F

*

 criteria does not introduce any significant changes to the plant design basis. Use of the criteria does not provide
a mechanism to initiate an accident outside of the region of the expanded portion of the tube. In the unlikely event
the failed tube severed completely at a point below the F

*

 region, the remaining F

*

 joint would retain engagement in the tubesheet due to its length of expanded contact within the tubesheet bore. This
engagement length would prevent any interaction of the severed tube with neighboring tubes. Any hypothetical accident
as a result of any tube degradation in the expanded region of the tube would be bounded by the existing tube rupture accident
analysis. Tube bundle structural integrity will be maintained. Tube bundle leak tightness will be maintained such
that any postulated accident leakage from F

*

 tubes will be negligible with regard to offsite doses. 

Therefore, there is not a potential for creating the possibility of a new or different type of accident from any accident
previously evaluated. 
 
C. The proposed changes do not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. 

The use of the F

*

 criteria has been demonstrated to maintain the integrity of the tube bundle commensurate with the requirements of
Reg Guide 1.121 and the primary to secondary pressure boundary under normal and postulated accident conditions.
Acceptable tube degradation for the F

*

 criteria is any degradation indication in the tubesheet region, more than the F

*

 distance from the secondary face of the tubesheet or the top of the last hardroll contact point which ever is further
into the tubesheet. The safety factors used in the verification of the strength of the degraded tube are consistent
with the safety factors in the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code and Reg Guide 1.121 used in steam generator design.
The F

*

 distance has been verified by various testing to be greater than the length of the roll expanded tube-to-tubesheet
interface required to preclude both tube pullout and significant leakage during normal and postulated accident
conditions. The protective boundaries of the steam generator continue to be maintained with the use of the F

*

 criteria. A tube with the indication of degration previously requiring removal from service can be kept in service
through the F

*

 criteria. Since the joint is constrained within the tubesheet bore, there is no additional risk associated with the
previously analyzed tube rupture event. The leak testing acceptance criteria are based on the primary to secondary
leakage limit in the Technical Specifications and the leakage assumptions used in the UFSAR accident analyses. 

Implementation of the alternate repair criteria will decrease the number of tubes which must be taken out of service
with tube plugs or repaired by sleeves. Both plugs and sleeves reduce the RCS flow margin; thus, implementation of
the F

*

 criteria will maintain the margin of flow that would otherwise be reduced in the event of increased plugging or sleeving.


Based on the above, it is concluded that the proposed change does not result in a significant reduction in margin with
respect to plant safety as defined in the UFSAR or the Technical Specification Bases. 



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

Date of amendment request: 

October 22, 1993 


Description of amendment request: 

The proposed amendment would modify the Reactor Trip System (RTS) and Engineered Safety Feature (ESF) instrumentation
surveillance requirements to incorporate the applicable changes specified in NRC-approved WCAP-10271 and related
supplements. Four specific changes were approved by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for the RTS and Engineered
Safety Feature Actuation System analog channels. These changes are limited to the specific Reactor Protection System
(RPS) channels evaluated in the WCAP (including all supplements) and are subject to the conditions specified by the
NRC.

1. The surveillance or test frequency may be changed from monthly to quarterly.

2. The time allowed for a channel to be inoperable or out of service in an untripped condition may be changed from 1 hour
to 6 hours.

3. The time a channel in a functional group may be bypassed to perform testing may be increased from 2 to 4 hours. This
bypass time applies to either an inoperable channel when testing is done in the tripped mode or
 to the channel in test when testing is done in the bypass mode. The Allowed Outage Time for maintenance of a channel is
12 hours.

4. Routine channel testing may be performed in the bypassed condition instead of the tripped condition.

In addition, a number of editorial changes are made to improve clarity, and two-loop operating requirements are proposed
to be deleted. Also, the surveillance test interval for RTS interlocks is proposed to be changed from monthly to once-per-refueling
(about 18 months). Although not part of WCAP-10271, this was previously approved generically by NRC.


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:



1. Does the change involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated?

The determination that the results of the proposed changes are within all acceptable criteria was established in
the SER(s) [Safety Evaluation Report(s)] prepared for WCAP-10271, WCAP-10271 Supplement 1, WCAP-10271 Supplement
2 and WCAP-10271 Supplement 2, Revision 1 issued by letters dated February 21, 1985, February 22, 1989 and April 30,
1990. Implementation of the proposed changes is expected to result in an acceptable increase in total Reactor Protection
System yearly unavailability. This increase, which is primarily due to less frequent surveillance, results in an
increase of similar magnitude in the probability of an Anticipated Transient Without Scram (ATWS) and in the probability
of core melt resulting from an ATWS and also results in a small increase in Core Damage Frequency (CDF) due to Engineered
Safety Features Actuation System unavailability.

Implementation of the proposed changes is expected to result in a significant reduction in the probability of core
melt from inadvertent reactor trips. This is a result of a reduction in the number of inadvertent reactor trips (0.5
fewer inadvertent reactor trips per unit per year) occurring during testing of RPS instrumentation. This reduction
is primarily attributable to testing in bypass and less frequent surveillance.

The reduction in [***] core melt frequency is sufficiently large to counter the increase in ATWS core melt probability
resulting in an overall reduction in total core melt probability.

The values determined by the WOG [Westinghouse Owners Group] and presented in the WCAP for the increase in CDF were
verified by Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) as part of an audit and sensitivity analyses for the NRC Staff. Based
on the small value of the increase compared to the range of uncertainty in the CDF, the increase is considered acceptable.

Changes to Surveillance Test Frequencies for the Reactor Trip System Interlocks do not represent a significant reduction
in testing. The currently specified test interval for interlock channels allows the surveillance requirement to
be satisfied by verifying that the permissive logic is in its required state using the annunciator status light. The
surveillance, as currently required, only verifies the status of the permissive logic and does not address verification
of channel setpoint or operability. The setpoint verification and channel operability are verified after a refueling
shutdown. The definition of the channel check includes comparison of the channel status with other channels for the
same parameter. The requirement to routinely verify permissive status is a different consideration than the availability
of trip or actuation channels which are required to change state on the occurrence of an event and for which the function
availability is more dependent on the surveillance interval. The change in surveillance requirement to at least
once every 18 months does not therefore represent a significant change in channel surveillance and does not involve
a significant increase in unavailability of the Reactor Protection System.

The proposed changes do not result in an increase in the severity or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.

Implementation of the proposed changes affects the probability of failure of the RPS but does not alter the manner
in which protection is afforded nor the manner in which limiting criteria are established.

Therefore, the proposed changes do not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated.

2. Does the change create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated?

The proposed changes do not result in a change in the manner in which the Reactor Protection System provides plant protection.
No change is being made which alters the functioning of the Reactor Protection System (other than in a test mode). Rather
the likelihood or probability of the Reactor Protection System functioning properly is affected as described above.
Therefore,the proposed changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident nor involve a reduction
in a margin of safety as defined in the Safety Analysis Report.

The proposed changes do not involve hardware changes except those necessary to implement testing in bypass. Some
existing instrumentation is designed to be tested in bypass and current technical specifications allow testing
in bypass. Testing in bypass is also recognized by IEEE [Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers] Standards.
Therefore, testing in bypass has been previously approved and implementation of the proposed change for testing
in bypass does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated. Furthermore,
since the other proposed changes do not alter the functioning of the RPS, the possibility of a new or different kind
of accident from any previously evaluated has not been created.

3. Does the change involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety?

The proposed changes do not alter the manner in which safety limits, limiting safety system setpoints or limiting
conditions for operation are determined. The impact of reduced testing other than as addressed above is to allow a
longer time interval over which instrument uncertainties (e.g., drift) may act. Experience has shown that the initial
uncertainty assumptions are valid for reduced testing. 
Implementation of the proposed changes is expected to result in an overall improvement in safety by:

a. Less frequent testing will result in fewer inadvertent reactor trips and fewer actuations of Engineered Safety
Feature Actuation System components.

b. Improvements in the effectiveness of the operating staff in monitoring and controlling plant operation. This
is due to less frequent distraction of the operator and shift supervisor to attend to instrumentation testing.

Therefore, the proposed changes do not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

Date of amendment request: 

April 19, 1994 


Description of amendment request: 

The proposed amendment would modify Specifications 3.4.9.3 and 3.4.11 to incorporate power operated relief valve
(PORV) Technical Specification (TS) changes in accordance with the guidance in Generic Letter 90-06 as implemented
in NUREG-1431 Improved Standard Technical Specifications (ISTS), with some exceptions and modifications to reflect
plant specific design features. Certain other TS sections would also be modified to address related TSs.
The proposed changes involve the details of (a) limiting conditions of operation, and (b) surveillance testing for
equipment needed to protect the reactor vessel from overpressure conditions. This equipment includes PORVs and
their associated block valves, charging pumps, reactor coolant system (RCS) vent, accumulators, and the overpressure
protection system. Numerous administrative changes are also proposed, such as renumbering sections, spelling
out mathematical symbols, changes in nomenclature for consistency, and relocating sentences and paragraphs.


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:



1. Does the change involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated?

The proposed changes consolidate the power operated relief valve requirements into Specifications 3.4.9.3 and
3.4.11 which generally adopt the new Improved Standard Technical Specifications of NUREG-1431 to address the concerns
identified in Generic Letter 90-06 except for those changes required to reflect plant specific design features.
These changes are proposed to enhance safety and improve the reliability of the PORVs and block valves. Since the proposed
changes augment or preserve the requirements contained in the current technical specifications, we have concluded
that these changes do not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated in the UFSAR [Updated Final Safety Analysis Report].

2. Does the change create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated?

The proposed changes do not involve any physical changes to the PORVs or their setpoints. These changes do not delete
any function previously provided by the PORVs nor has the probability of inadvertent opening been increased. Accordingly,
no new failure modes have been defined for any plant system or component important to safety nor has any new limiting
single failure been identified as a result of these changes. Therefore, these changes will not create the possibility
of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated in the UFSAR.

3. Does the change involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety?

The proposed changes have been incorporated to enhance safety and improve the reliability of the PORVs and block valves
to ensure their availability when called upon to perform their function. These changes do not affect the manner by
which the facility is operated or involve a change to equipment or features which affect the operational characteristics
of the facility. Therefore, operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not involve
a significant reduction in a margin of safety.
 


The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis. The staff notes that a significant effort has been made by the NRC
and by industry over the last several years to improve and tighten the TS requirements for overpressure protection
systems. These efforts are documented in Generic Letter 90-06 and NUREG-1431. The changes proposed by the licensee
appear to result in TSs that are significantly more comprehensive and restrictive than those now existing for Beaver
Valley Units 1 and 2, and, therefore, should help to reduce the probability of an accident. The staff disagrees with
the licensee's claim that the changes do not affect the manner by which the facility is operated (consideration number
3 above). However, the staff believes that the proposed TS changes require more restrictive operation (such as more
careful control of the number of charging pumps which can inject into the RCS) and do not involve a significant reduction
in a margin of safety. Based on the NRC staff's review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied.
Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.

Date of amendment request: 

June 9, 1994 


Description of amendment request: 

The proposed amendment would revise Technical Specification section 4.8.1.1.2 to replace the current qualitative
examination of new diesel generator fuel oil for water/sediment and particulate contamination with a quantitative
examination for the same properties.


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:



1. Does the change involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated?

The proposed change does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated since the diesel generator availability and reliability is not being changed. The quantitative acceptance
criteria for new fuel oil is not being changed. Diesel generator performance will therefore not be changed due to the
proposed revision to SR [surveillance requirement] 4.8.1[.1].2.d.1.d. The diesel generator will continue to provide
sufficient electrical power to ESF [engineered safety feature] systems. The ESF systems will continue to function,
as assumed in the safety analyses, to ensure that the fuel, reactor coolant system, and containment 
design limits are not exceeded.

Therefore, this changes will not increase the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated due
to the continued availability and reliability of the emergency diesel power source.

2. Does the change create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated?

The proposed change does not alter the method of operating the plant. This change will continue to ensure that the addition
of new fuel oil complies with accepted standards regarding fuel oil quality. Since design requirements continue
to be met and the integrity of the reactor coolant system pressure boundary is not challenged, no new failure mode has
been created. As a result, an accident which is different than any already evaluated in the Updated Final Safety Analysis
Report will not be created due to this change.

Therefore, the proposed change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident
previously evaluated.

3. Does the change involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety?

The margin of safety is not reduced because the emergency diesel generators will continue to provide sufficient capacity,
capability, redundancy, and reliability to ensure availability of necessary power to ESF systems. The ESF systems
will continue to function, as assumed in the safety analyses, to ensure that the fuel, reactor coolant systems, and
containment design limits are not exceeded. The replacement of the clear and bright qualitative examination with
the proposed quantitative test to determine the actual water/sediment and particulates will ensure that new fuel
oil meets the required limits for these properties prior to addition to the storage tank, therefore assuring that
the quality of the stored fuel is unaffected by the addition of new fuel.
 
Therefore, this proposed change does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

Description of amendment request: 

The proposed amendment would delete the Appendix B Section 4.2.2 requirement to perform infrared aerial photography
every other year.


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:



1. Does the change involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated?

The proposed change will delete from Facility Operating License No. NPF-73 the Appendix B Section 4.2.2 requirement
to perform infrared aerial photography every other year. The acceptance limit which forms the licensing basis for
this technical specification is related to environmental impact and has no impact on the margin of safety, accident
analysis, or other design basis impacting the margin of safety. No increase in adverse environmental impact has been
identified over that previously identified in the Final Environmental Statement - Operating License Stage, environmental
impact appraisals, or in any decisions of the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board. The Final Environmental Statement
concluded, based on a model of combined drift from Units 1 and 2, that no adverse impacts to sensitive species of natural
vegetation or to sensitive species of crops were expected. The staff also examined infrared aerial photographs taken
from 1975 through 1983 and found no injury to vegetation from cooling tower drift in the vicinity of Unit 1.

Continued terrestrial monitoring was performed for Beaver Valley Unit 2 by infrared aerial photography in 1986,
1988, 1990, and 1992. The results as provided in the Annual Environmental Reports Non-Radiological concluded, ``Based
on interpretation of the infrared photographs and field verification, there is no evidence to suggest that the BVPS
[Beaver Valley Power Station] cooling towers are causing vegetation stress.''

Based on the compilation of the infrared aerial photography performed for both BV-1 and BV-2, deletion of this terrestrial
monitoring requirement will have no impact on the environment or the operation of the plant. Therefore, the proposed
change will not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.

2. Does the change create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated?

The Appendix B Section 4.2.2 requirement to perform infrared aerial photography reflects a commitment described
in Final Environmental Statement Section 5.14.1. Therein it is stated that the preoperational monitoring studies
for BV-2 are based primarily on the BV-1 operational monitoring programs. ``Results of these studies have shown that
there were no BV-1 operational impacts on flora, thus, the only terrestrial monitoring planned for BV-2 is continued
infrared aerial photography every other year. The photographs will be compared with preoperational photographs
of the BV-2 area, nd any signs of injury as a result of salt drift and other sources will be checked. The details of this
terrestrial monitoring program will be specified in the Environmental Protection Plan that will be included in Appendix
B of the operating license.'' The subject of this concern is the impact of salt and water drift on area vegetation including
sensitive agricultural crops. From the standpoint of soil salinization (the effects of the accumulation of salts
in the soil), described in the Environmental Report-Operating License Stage Section 5.3.3, no appreciable impact
resulting from operation of the natural draft cooling towers is anticipated. This is based on the average rate of precipitation
of 36.2 inches annually which greatly reduces the potential for accumulation of salt in the soil. The terrestrial
monitoring program has been performed in accordance with the Environmental Protection Plan and has provided additional
verification that operation of both cooling towers has not produced any evidence of vegetation stress. The proposed
change does not introduce any new mode of plant operation or require any physical modification to the plant, therefore,
this change will not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.

3. Does the change involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety?

Infrared aerial photography surveillance does not affect safety systems and/or systems important to safety. Terrestrial
monitoring is not used in any accident analysis and does not provide a basis for evaluating the radiological consequences
of an accident. Deleting the requirement to perform infrared aerial photography will not result in any environmental
impact from operation of the cooling tower and will not affect the operation of the cooling tower. The operating history
of both the BV-1 and the BV-2 cooling towers has demonstrated that there is no evidence of vegetation stress in accordance
with the results obtained from the infrared aerial photography and other associated methods of environmental monitoring.
Therefore, based on the above, the proposed change will not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

Date of amendment request: 

May 23, 1994


Description of amendment request: 

The amendment will revise Technical Specification (TS) 3.5.2 for Emergency Core Cooling Systems (ECCS) by removing
the option that allows High Pressure Safety Injection (HPSI) Pump 1C to be used as an alternative to the preferred pump
for subsystem operability. HPSI pump 1C is an installed spare which is not required to be maintained in an operable
status, and this change is being requested to upgrade the ECCS operability requirements consistent with actual plant
operating needs.


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:



(1) Operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not involve a significant increase
in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.

The proposed license amendment will remove the option of using High Pressure Safety Injection Pump 1C (HPSI-1C) to
satisfy, in part, the Emergency Core Cooling System (ECCS) operabilityrequirements specified in Limiting Condition
for Operation (LCO) 3.5.2. HPSI-1C is an installed spare pump that is not required to be operable unless it is being
used in place of the preferred B-train ECCS high pressure pump. The required functional response of the ECCS or the
required availability of the minimum equipment necessary to accomplish the ECCS safety function will not be changed
by removing the spare pump option from the Technical Specifications.

The calculated cooling performance of the St. Lucie Unit 1 ECCS during postulated accidents conforms to the criteria
set forth in 10 CFR 50.46 and the ability to achieve this required performance, including considerations of single-failure
criteria, is independent from optional use of HPSI-1C. Therefore, operation of the facility in accordance with the
proposed amendment will not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated.

(2) Operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not create the possibility of a new or
different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.

The proposed amendment will not change the physical plant or the modes of operation defined in the facility license.
Eliminating the option for the licensee to utilize HPSI-1C in place of the preferred B-train ECCS high pressure pump
does not involve the addition of new or different types of equipment to the previously analyzed ECCS. Equipment important
to safety will continue to perform their safety functions as previously analyzed and will not be affected by this proposed
amendment. Therefore, operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not create the possibility
of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.

(3) Operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not involve a significant reduction
in a margin of safety.

Removing the option to employ the installed spare HPSI pump 1C in lieu of the preferred B-train pump to determine ECCS
operability only removes an operational flexibility that has rarely been used by the licensee. St. Lucie Unit 1 accident
analyses do not take credit for an installed spare pump, the minimum complement of safety injection equipment required
for safe operation of the facility and that is required by LCO 3.5.2 is not changed, and the results of plant accident
and transient analyses are not influenced by this proposed amendment. The proposed change does not alter the bases
for any Technical Specification related to the establishment of, or maintenance of, a nuclear safety margin. Therefore,
operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not involve a significant reduction in
a margin of safety.

Based on the discussion presented above and on the supporting Evaluation of Proposed TS Changes, FPL has concluded
that this proposed license amendment involves no significant hazards consideration.



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant
hazards consideration.

Description of amendment request: 

The proposed amendments will relocate the seismic monitoring instrumentation Limiting Conditions for Operation,
Surveillance Requirements, and the associated tables contained in Technical Specifications 3.3.3.3, 4.3.3.3.1
and 4.3.3.3.2 to the Updated Final Safety Analysis Report. The basis for this request is consistent with NUREG-1432,
``Standard Technical Specifications, Combustion Engineering Plants'' and with the ``Final Policy Statement on
Technical Specifications Improvements for Nuclear Power Reactors, ``published in the Federal Register (58 FR 39132)
dated July 22, 1993.


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:



1. Operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not involve a significant increase in
the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.

The proposed changes are administrative in nature in that the specifications for operation and surveillance of the
Seismic Monitoring Instrumentation system will be relocated from Appendix A of the facility operating license to
the Updated Final Safety Analysis Report for St. Lucie Unit 1 and Unit 2. Changes to the system will be controlled by
10 CFR 50.59 and the safety analysis report is required to be updated pursuant to 10 CFR 50.71(e). Relocation of these
requirements to the UFSAR is consistent with the NRC ``Final Policy Statement on Technical Specifications Improvements
for Nuclear Power Reactors'' published in the Federal Register (58 FR 39132) dated July 22, 1993. 
Seismic monitoring instrumentation is not an accident initiator nor a part of the success path(s) which function
to mitigate accidents evaluated in the plant safety analyses. The proposed technical specification change does
not involve any change to the configuration or method of operation of any plant equipment that is used to mitigate the
consequences of an accident, nor do the changes alter any assumptions or conditions in any of the plant accident analyses.
Therefore, operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not involve a significant increase
in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.

(2) Operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not create the possibility of a new or
different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.

The proposed amendment to relocate the existing Technical Specification requirements for Seismic Monitoring Instrumentation
to the Updated Final Safety Analysis Report will not change the physical plant or the modes of plant operation defined
in the Facility License. The change does not involve the addition or modification of equipment nor does it alter the
design or operation of plant systems. Therefore, operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment
would not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.

(3) Operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not involve a significant reduction
in a margin of safety.

The proposed changes are administrative in nature in that operating and surveillance requirements for the Seismic
Monitoring Instrumentation system will be relocated from Appendix A of the facility license to the Updated Final
Safety Analysis Report for St. Lucie Unit 1 and Unit 2. Seismic monitoring instruments are not used to actuate safety-related
equipment, provide interlocks, or otherwise perform plant control functions. The instruments are used to record
the magnitude of a seismic event, should it occur. Conditions evaluated in plant accident and transient analyses
do not involve seismic instruments. The proposed changes do not alter the basis for any technical specification that
is related to the establishment of, or the maintenance of, a nuclear safety margin. Therefore, operation of the facility
in accordance with the proposed amendment would not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.

Based on the above discussion and the supporting Evaluation of Technical Specification changes, FPL has determined
that the proposed license amendment involves no significant hazards consideration.



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant
hazards consideration.

Date of amendment request: 

May 23, 1994


Description of amendment request: 

The proposed amendment revises Technical Specifications Section 3/4.7.1.1, Turbine Cycle, Safety Valves, to delete
a specific reference to the 1974 edition of the ASME Code and refer to testing in accordance with Technical Specification
4.0.5, the In-Service Inspection and In-Service Testing Specification.


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:



(1)Operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not involve a significant increase
in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.

The proposed amendment does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated because the main steam code safety valves will continue to be tested in accordance with current
NRC requirements as implemented through 10 CFR 50.55a. The NRC specifies the ASME code requirements for a facility
through revisions to 10 CFR 50.55a and through the review and approval of the plant specific in-service testing plan
for pumps and valves at the beginning of each in-service inspection interval.

The probability or consequences of an accident are not increased because testing of the main steam safety valves is
in accordance with the appropriate NRC requirements.

(2) Use of the modified specification would not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any
previously evaluated.

The use of this modified specification can not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any
previously evaluated since there is no physical change to the facility or the set points for the main steam safety valves.
The valves will be tested in accordance with current requirements. No new failure mode is introduced due to the change
because no plant change is being made and main steam safety valve test methods are consistent with the endorsed edition
of the ASME Code.

(3) Use of the modified specification would not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. 

The existing technical specification references an outdated version of the ASME Code. This change corrects the reference
to Specification 4.0.5 which ensures that in-service testing of ASME Code Class 1, 2, and 3 pumps and valves will be
performed in accordance with a periodically updated version of Section XI of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code
and Addenda as required by 10 CFR 50.55a. 
Safety valve setpoints or tolerances are not changed by this proposal. Therefore, the modified specification corrects
the ASME Code reference and does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.

Based on the above, we have determined that the proposed amendment does not (1) involve a significant increase in the
probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated, (2) create the probability of a new or different
kind of accident from any previously evaluated, or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety; and therefore
does not involve a significant hazards consideration.



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant
hazards consideration.

Date of amendment request: 

March 27, 1992, as supplemented on January 6, and May 27, 1994.


Description of amendment request: 

The proposed amendment would revise the limiting conditions for operation and surveillance requirements for primary
containment integrity, secondary containment integrity and other systems and equipment of Technical Specifications
Section 3.7.


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:



(1) The proposed amendment will not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated because the requested revisions do not affect the FSAR safety analyses involving these system.

Definitions

The revisions to Definition 15, ``Primary Containment Integrity'' and Definition 16, ``Secondary Containment
Integrity'' agree with the corresponding definitions of the STS. These changes are administrative in nature in that
they only clarify the requirements for containment integrity and the appropriate means of isolating penetrations.
These changes do not affect the operation or function of the containment isolation systems and, therefore, do not
result in a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.

Primary Containment Integrity
 
The revision to TS section 3.7.A, ``Primary Containment Integrity'', only adds a specific requirement to restore
primary containment integrity within 1 hour or commence a plant shutdown. These actions are consistent with the actions
specified in STS for primary containment integrity. No changes to the primary containment boundary or the requirements
for primary containment integrity have been proposed. Therefore, this change does not result in a significant increase
in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.

Primary Containment Power Operated Isolation Valves 
The revisions to TS section 3.7.B, ``Primary Containment Power Operated Isolation Valves'' are editorial in nature
in that the wording has only been changed to be consistent with the STS requirements for primary containment isolation
valves. These changes do not affect the function of the valves, the requirements to isolate a penetration with an inoperable
containment isolation valve or the actual methods of isolation. Penetrations are still required to be isolated within
4 hours in a manner that cannot be adversely affected by a single active failure. Therefore, these changes do not result
in a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.

Drywell Average Air Temperature

The addition of limits, actions, and surveillance requirements for drywell average air temperature are intended
to ensure that the initial assumptions in the DAEC Primary Containment Response Analysis to a DBA remain valid. The
temperature limit (135
 F) corresponds to the initial drywell average temperature assumed for this analysis in the UFSAR. The specified
limits, actions and surveillance requirements are consistent with STS. The addition of this limit to the TS will not
affect the actual operation or function of any equipment but will ensure that the containment analysis remains valid.
Therefore, the addition of this limit will not result in a significant increase in the probability or consequences
of an accident previously evaluated.

Pressure Suppression Chamber-Reactor Building Vacuum Breakers

The changes to TS section 3/4.7.D only provide additional detail and operability requirements for the pressure suppression
chamber-reactor building vacuum breakers. These additional details are consistent with the requirements of STS.
Specifying separate operability requirements for vacuum breakers inoperable for opening (but known to be closed),
or open better reflects the dual functions of these valves (vacuum relief and containment isolation). The additional
surveillance requirement will better ensure that the containment isolation function of these valves is maintained.
The rewording of existing surveillances only clarifies current requirements. These changes do not affect the actual
function, setpoints, or number of valves required to be operable and therefore do not result in a significant increase
in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.

Drywell-Pressure Suppression Chamber Vacuum Breakers 
The changes to TS section 3/4.7.E, only provide additional detail and operability requirements for the drywell-pressure
suppression chamber vacuum breakers. These additional details are consistent with the requirements of STS. Specifying
separate operability requirements for vacuum breakers inoperable for opening (but known to be closed) or open better
reflects the dual functions of these valves. The additional requirement to verify that each vacuum breaker is closed
at least once per week will better ensure that the isolation boundary between the drywell and torus is maintained.
The elimination of the requirement to exercise all operable drywell-pressure suppression chamber vacuum breakers
upon determination that a vacuum breaker is inoperable for opening will not affect the reliability of these vacuum
breakers. The only valid reason to exercise the operable vacuum breakers is if a common mode failure is suspected.
We have reviewed the maintenance history of these valves and have not identified any instance of common mode failures.
Conditional testing of these changes will not result in a significant increase in the probability or consequences
of an accident previously evaluated.

Main Steam Isolation Valve Leakage Control System (MSIV-LCS)

The change to TS Section 3/4.7.F, ``MSIV-LCS'', deletes the unnecessary and potentially non-conservative conditional
surveillance testing of the redundant MSIV-LCS subsystems. Although the proposed change will reduce the amount
of testing of the MSIV-LCS, reliability of these systems would not be decreased and the necessary assurance that the
alternate systems/subsystems/components will operate when needed is provided by the ASME Section XI IST Program.

The possibility of human error will decrease with reduced testing. Human error such as a misalignment of valves after
the system is returned to its normal configuration following testing and the misdirection of the operators attention
from monitoring and directing plant operations is less likely to occur if this testing is eliminated. Additionally,
reducing the scope and frequency of surveillance testing will decrease the probability of equipment failure (due
to testing) which could require plant shutdown. Therefore, this change will not increase the probability of occurrence
or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.

Suppression Pool Level and Temperature

The changes to TS section 3/4.7.F, ``Suppression Pool Level and Temperature'', are intended to clarify these requirements
and make them more consistent with STS. The revision to the applicability statement which deletes the requirement
for suppression pool level and temperature to be within the specified limits during work which has the potential to
drain the vessel is in accordance with STS. Suppression pool level and temperature limits ensure that the suppression
pool has the capability of acting as a heat sink for design basis events but are not appropriate or applicable during
the refueling or cold shutdown conditions. No changes have been made to the actual suppression pool temperature or
level limits and therefore, the assumptions made in the accident and transient analyses remain valid. These limits
are consistent with the STS. The revisions to the surveillance requirements are also intended to improve clarity
and consistency with STS. The deletion of the requirement to monitor suppression pool water temperature every 5 minutes
during relief valve operation is appropriate in that plant operating and emergency operating procedures already
specify what actions are to be taken when suppression pool average water temperature increases above 95
 F including initiation of suppression pool cooling. Monitoring pool temperature every 5 minutes during these
events is not necessary and is redundant to other actions. Therefore, these changes will not significantly increase
the probability of occurrence of the consequences of an accident previously evaluated.

Containment Atmosphere Dilution

The revisions to the applicability of TS section 3.7.H, ``Containment Atmosphere Dilution'', requiring the containment
atmosphere dilution system to be operable only when the reactor is in power operation and the primary containment
is required to be inerted will not significantly increase the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated because the CAD system can only function when the containment is inerted. The function of the CAD system
is to inject nitrogen into the containment after a LOCA and ensure the containment remains inerted. Drywell inspections
performed after plant startup and prior to plant shutdown require that the primary containment be de-inerted for
personnel access. Therefore, CAD system operability is not required during these inspections. No changes to the
actual function or purpose of the CAD system are proposed.

Oxygen Concentration

The changes to TS section 3/4.7.1, ``Oxygen Concentration'' are administrative in that they only clarify the requirement
that both the suppression chamber and the drywell must have oxygen concentrations less than 4 [percent] by volume.
The revisions to the surveillance requirements are consistent with STS. Decreasing the frequency of verification
of oxygen concentration from twice per week to once per week is in accordance with STS and reflects the fact that during
power operation, the containment is inerted and slightly pressurized such that air (oxygen) cannot leak into the
containment. Therefore, these changes will not significantly increase the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated.

Secondary Containment

The deletion of the requirement to operate the SGTS immediately after a secondary containment violation is identified
will not affect the reliability of the secondary containment in that containment integrity is normally fully restored
immediately after a violation is identified. The testing of the SGTS involves insertion of a Group III containment
isolation signal and is only appropriate if the restoration of secondary containment involves a temporary or new
secondary containment boundary. These modifications to a secondary containment boundary, however, would require
that the SGTS be operated as part of post modification testing. Deleting the requirement for the SGTS to be operated
after minor secondary containment violations will reduce the possibility of human error (such as misalignment of
valves after the system is returned to its normal configuration) due to reduced testing. Operation of the SGTS after
a secondary containment violation is not required by STS. 
Revision of the definition of calm wind conditions will not affect the reliability or availability of the secondary
containment or SGTS. An engineering evaluation on the effects of wind speed and direction on the ability of the SGTS
to maintain 1/4'' vacuum in secondary containment has been performed. The results indicate that while wind effects
can be seen on individual instruments, there is minimal effect on the average instrument readings with wind speeds
up to 15 mph. A discussion of this evaluation has been added to the Bases of TS section 3.7. Therefore, these changes
will not significantly increase the probability or the consequences of an accident previously evaluated.

Secondary Containment Automatic Isolation Dampers

The addition of operability requirements, actions and surveillance requirements for secondary containment isolation
dampers better ensures the integrity and isolation capability of the secondary containment. The new specifications
are consistent with the requirements of the STS. The actual function or operation of the secondary containment isolation
valves/dampers will not be affected. The appropriate valves/dampers will be incorporated in plant procedures that
are subject to the change control provisions of TS. Therefore, these changes will not increase the probability of
occurrence or consequences of an accident previously evaluated in the TS. 

Standby Gas Treatment System

The change to the output requirements of the inlet heaters for each train of the SGTS from 11 kw to 22 kw better ensures
that these heaters (and the SGTS) can perform their design function. The 22 kw output requirement ensures that the
inlet air humidity does not exceed the 70 [percent] humidity specified in the UFSAR. This change does not affect the
actual operation of the heaters or the SGTS.

The requirement to demonstrate the HEPA filter uniform air distribution after HEPA filter replacement or after structural
maintenance on the filter system housing (rather than annually) will not decrease the reliability of the SGTS. The
air flow test will be performed after work or modifications which have the ability to disrupt the system geometry or
result in potential flow blockage.

Revising the shutdown LCO requirement in the various specifications from requiring the plant to be in Cold Shutdown
in 24 hours to requiring Hot Shutdown in 12 hours and Cold Shutdown (or other condition not requiring equipment operability)
in the following 24 hours is consistent with STS and the shutdown requirements in TS section 3.5. This new requirement
will allow the reactor to be shutdown in a more controlled manner and will not result in a significant increase in the
probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.

The revisions to the Bases are administrative in that they only reflect the changes to the individual specifications
described previously in this section or correct minor discrepancies. All changes are consistent with the applicable
specifications. 
(2) The proposed amendment will not increase the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident
previously evaluated for the following reasons.

As described in the above response to question #1, none of the proposed changes alters the design of the plant or equipment
or the plant's transient response. The changes to the definitions and limiting conditions for operation applicable
to TS section 3.7 are consistent with STS and better ensure that equipment assumed to be operable in our accident analysis
will be operable upon demand. The addition of limiting conditions for operation for drywell average temperature
and secondary containment isolation valves will better ensure that the assumptions in our accident analysis remain
valid.

The changes to the surveillance requirements are consistent with the STS. Those systems required to mitigate accidents
evaluated in the UFSAR will still be operable and available.

The reduction in conditional surveillance testing of certain systems and equipment will reduce the probability
of equipment failure as a result of excessive testing or due to human error.

(3) The proposed amendment will not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety for the following reasons.

The revisions to the limiting conditions for operation in Chapter 3.7 of the TS will not invalidate the original licensing
basis assumptions and will not invalidate any assumptions or input parameters for any DAEC event analysis. These
changes provide more specific guidance only and are in accordance with the STS. Extending the time period within which
the DAEC must achieve Cold Shutdown conditions will permit increased operator attention and minimal distractions
for operators during shutdown, thus minimizing the risks of unexpected operational transients.

Additional surveillance testing for certain instrumentation and systems will provide additional assurance that
these systems will be available when needed.

Elimination of unnecessary or conditional surveillance testing will not reduce the minimum necessary equipment
operability requirements or equipment reliability. Elimination of the redundant testing will reduce equipment
failure due to excessive testing or human error.

In summary, the proposed administrative changes do not change the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated, do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident and do not involve a reduction in the
margin of safety.

Therefore, the proposed license amendment is judged to involve no significant hazards consideration.



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this
review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to
determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.

County, Connecticut




Date of amendment request: 

May 27, 1974


Description of amendment request: 

The amendment would temporarily allow the Operations Manager to not have a senior reactor operator (SRO) license
for Millstone 3, providing other conditions are met. 


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:
...The proposed change does not involve an SHC [significant hazards consideration] because the change would not:



1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.

The proposed change affects only an administrative control, which was based on the existing industry guidance in
ANSI N18.1-1971, that recommended the Operations Manager hold a SRO license. The current guidance in Section 4.2.2
of ANSI/ANS-3.1-1987 recommends, as one option, that the Operations Manager have held a license for a similar unit
and the Operations Middle Manager hold a SRO license. The Operations Middle Manager position does not exist at NNECO
[Northeast Nuclear Energy Company]. Therefore, the proposed change requests an exception to ANSI N18.1-1971 to
allow use of ANSI/ANS-3.101987 in a limited circumstance. Specifically, the proposed revision to Technical Specification
6.3.1 would temporarily allow the Operations Manager to have held a SRO at a PWR [pressurized water reactor] other
than Millstone Unit No. 3. The proposed revision would be in effect for the period ending three years after the Staff's
approval for this request.

The proposed exception to ANSI N18.1-1971 will allow at least one of the Operations Assistants (instead of a Operations
Middle Manager) to hold, and continue to hold, a SRO license, if the Operations Manager does not hold a license. The
proposed change includes the requirement if the Operations Manager does not hold a SRO license at Millstone Unit No.
3, he shall have held a license for a similar unit in accordance with Section 4.2.2 of ANSI/ANS-3.1-1987. For those
areas of knowledge that require a SRO license, at least one of the Operations Assistants hold a SRO license and provides
technical guidance normally required by the Operations Manager. 

The proposed change does not alter the design of any system, structure, or component. It does not change the way any
plant systems are operated. It does not reduce the knowledge, qualifications, or skills of any operator on watch,
and does not affect the way the Operations Department is managed by the Operations Manager in maintaining the effective
performance of his personnel and to ensure the plant is operated safely and in accordance with the requirements of
the Operating License. 

The proposed change does not detract from the Operations Manager's ability to perform his primary responsibilities.
In this case, by having previously held a SRO license for a similar unit, he will have gained the necessary training,
skills, and experience to fully understand the operation of plant equipment and the watch requirements for operators.

The proposed change does not weaken the supervisory chain that presently exists in the Operations Department. All
Control Room operators will continue to be supervised by the licensed Shift Supervisor. 

In summary, the proposed change does not affect the ability of the Operations Manager to provide the plant oversight
required of his position. In addition, it does not have any [e]ffect on the probability or consequences of any previously
evaluated accident.

2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated.

The proposed change to Technical Specification 6.3.1 does not affect the design or function of any plant system, structure,
or component. It does not affect, in any way, the performance of NRC licensed operators, nor does it change the way any
plant equipment is operated. Operation of the plant in conformance with technical specifications and other license
requirements will continue to be supervised by personnel who hold an NRC SRO license. The proposed change to Technical
Specification 6.3.1 ensures that the Operations Manager will be a knowledgeable and qualified individual. The proposed
change does not introduce any new failure modes. 
3. Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. 

The proposed change involves only an administrative control which is not related to the margin of safety as defined
in the technical specifications. The proposed change does not reduce the level of knowledge or experience required
of an individual who fills the Operations Manager position, nor does it affect the conservative manner in which the
plant is operated. All Control Room operators will continue to be supervised by personnel who hold a SRO license.



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

Pennsylvania Power and Light Company, Docket Nos. 50-387 and 50-388 Susquehanna Steam Electric Station, Units 1
and 2, Luzerne County, Pennsylvania




Date of amendment request: 

May 31, 1994


Description of amendment request: 

This amendment will change the frequency for monitoring the Spray Pond ground water level from once per month to once
every six months in Technnical Specification Requirement 4.7.1.3.c for each Susquehanna unit.


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:



I. This proposal does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated. 

The proposed Technical Specification change to extend the monthly surveillance interval for Spray Pond ground water
level measurement to biannual does not affect the the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
The safety analysis performed for this change concludes that the ground water level is stable, predictable, and significantly
below the acceptance criteria established in the Technical Specifications. Thus, less frequent monitoring of the
ground water level does not increase the probability that the Spray Pond will become inoperable due to rising ground
water levels or the probability of any accident scenarios associated with Spray Pond inoperability. The Technical
Specification change will not impact the function or the method of operation of plant systems, structures, or components.
Thus, the consequences of a malfunction of equipment important to safety previously evaluated in the FSAR are not
increased by the change. 

II. This proposal does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident or from any accident previously
evaluated.

The proposed Technical Specification change to extend the monthly surveillance interval for Spray Pond ground water
level measurement to biannual does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident or from any accident
previously evaluated. The proposed change dies not affect systems, structures, or components (SSCs) or the operation
of the SSCs; and therefore does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident.

III. This change does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.

The proposed Technical Specification change to extend the monthly surveillance frequency to biannual does not reduce
the margin of safety. The ground water level in the vicinity of the Spray Pond has been proven to be stable and predictable
through twelve years of monthly data collection. This data has shown the highest ground water levels (still considerably
lower than the Technical Specification limit) to occur in the months of April and October. Therefore, surveillance
of the ground water level at the observation sites during April and October will adequately monitor this aspect of
the Spray Pond operability. 



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

Public Service Electric & Gas Company, Docket Nos. 50-272 and 50-311, Salem Nuclear Generating Station, Unit
Nos. 1 and 2, Salem County, New Jersey 



Date of amendment request: 

May 25, 1994


Description of amendment request: 

Salem is in the process of upgrading the Radiation Monitoring System. This upgrade will involve a replacement on many
of the existing radiation monitors. The proposed change modifies Tables associated with Technical Specifications
3/4.3.3.1 Radiation Monitoring Instrumentation, 3/4.3.3.8 Radioactive Liquid Effluent Monitoring Instrumentation,
and 3/4.3.3.9 Radioactive Gaseous Effluent Monitoring Instrumentation. The proposed change relocates the Salem
specific radiation monitor numbers from the table to a cross reference in the Bases. No required radiation monitoring
functions are being changed. 

Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:



1. [This proposal does not involve] a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
analyzed.

The proposed change to relocate the Salem specific radiation monitor numbers to the Bases is administrative. There
are no modifications or changes in operating conditions associated with the proposed changes. Providing a more accurate
description of a referenced radiation monitor in the note is editorial. The proposed changes do not affect the probability
of occurrence or the consequences of accidents identified in the UFSAR. No accident precursors are being generated
by the proposed changes. Therefore, the proposed changes do not involve a significant increase in the probability
or consequences of a previously analyzed accident.

2. [This proposal does not create] the possibility of a new or different kind of accident.

The proposed changes to relocate the Salem specific radiation monitor numbers to the Bases are administrative. The
change to the note on Table 3.3-6 is editorial to provide a more accurate description of the required radiation monitor.
There are no modifications or changes in operating conditions associated with the proposed changes. Therefore,
the proposed changes will not increase the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
identified. 
3. [These changes do not involve] a significant reduction in a margin of safety.

The Technical Specification operability requirements for the radiation monitors are not being changed. Relocating
the Salem specific radiation monitor numbers to the Bases will not change any requirements for the radiation monitors.
The change to the note on Table 3.3-6 is editorial to provide a more accurate description of the required radiation
monitor. Therefore, the changes to the surveillance frequencies do not involve a significant reduction in any margin
of safety.



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

Rochester Gas and Electric Corporation, Docket No. 50-244, R. E. Ginna Nuclear Power Plant, Wayne County, New York




Date of amendment request: 

May 23, 1994, as supplemented June 15, 1994 


Description of amendment request: 

The proposed amendment would revise the Ginna Station Technical Specification (TS) 3.1.4 regarding allowable primary
coolant levels of specific activity. The limit for I-131 dose equivalent of iodine activity in the reactor coolant
would be increased from 0.2 to 1.0 micro Ci/gm. The limit for total specific activity of the reactor coolant would be
increased from 84 to 100/E micro Ci/gm, where E is the average beta and gamma energies per disintegration in Mev. Both
increased allowable levels are consistent with NUREG-1431 ``Standard Technical Specifications, Westinghouse
Plants, September 1992,'' and 
NUREG-0800 ``Standard Review Plan for the Review of Safety Analysis Reports for Nuclear Power Plants'' (Section
15.6.3).


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:



1. Operation of Ginna Station in accordance with the proposed changes does not involve a significant increase in the
probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.

The proposed changes do not affect any accident initiators and therefore the probability of any accident is not increased.
Consequences of the changes are analyzed and shown acceptable in the [Westinghouse LOFTTR2 Analysis of Potential
Radiological Consequences Following a Steam Generator Tube Rupture at the R.E. Ginna Nuclear Power Plant] analysis,
WCAP-11668, Section III.

2. Operation of Ginna Station in accordance with the proposed changes does not create the possibility of a new or different
kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.

The proposed changes involve no physical modifications to the plant; therefore, no new accident can be postulated.

3. Operation of Ginna Station in accordance with the proposed changes does not involve a significant reduction in
a margin of safety, as no margin of safety is reduced by the proposed changes, as shown in WCAP-11668.

Based upon the above information, it has been determined that the proposed changes to the Ginna Station Technical
Specifications do not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated, does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident previously evaluated, and does not
involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. Therefore, it is concluded that the proposed changes meet the
requirements of 10 CFR 50.92(c) and do not involve a significant hazards consideration.



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

50-346, Davis-Besse Nuclear Power Station, Unit No. 1, Ottawa County, Ohio




Date of amendment request: 

June 6, 1994


Description of amendment request: 

The proposed amendment would merge Toledo Edison Company into Cleveland Electric Illuminating Company. As described
in the application, the company formed from the merger is intended to be renamed. Therefore, the licensee uses the
nomenclature ``NEWCO'' as a temporary name of the combined operating company, and will provide the permanent name
by supplemental letter. The amendment would (1) replace the Toledo Edison Company and Cleveland Electric Illuminating
Company with ``NEWCO'' as a licensee, (2) designate ``NEWCO'' as the owner of the Davis-Besse Nuclear Power Station,
Unit 1, and (3) make other associated changes to the license as indicated in the amendment application. Centerior
Service Company would be unaffected by the amendment and would remain a licensee.


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below, indicating that the proposed changes would:



1a. Not involve a significant increase in the probability of an accident previously evaluated because no accident
initiators or assumptions are affected. The proposed changes are administrative and have no direct affect on any
plant systems. All Limiting Conditions for Operation, Limiting Safety System Settings and Safety Limits specified
in the Technical Specifications will remain unchanged.

1b. Not involve a significant increase in the consequences of an accident previously evaluated because no accident
conditions or assumptions are affected. The proposed changes do not alter the source term, containment isolation,
or allowable radiological consequences. The proposed changes are administrative and have no direct effect on any
plant systems.

2a. Not create the possibility of a new kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated because no new accident
initiators are created. The proposed changes are administrative and have no direct effect on any plant systems. The
changes do not affect the reactor coolant system pressure boundary and do not affect any system functional requirements,
plant maintenance, or operability requirements.

2b. Not create the possibility of a different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated because no different
accident initiators are created. The proposed changes are administrative and have no direct effect on any plant systems.
The changes do not affect the reactor coolant system pressure boundary and do not affect any system functional requirements,
plant maintenance, or operability requirements.

3. Not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety because the proposed changes do not involve new or significant
changes to the initial conditions contributing to accident severity or consequences. The proposed changes are administrative
and have no direct affect on any plant systems.



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corporation, Docket No. 50-271, Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Station, Vernon, Vermont




Date of amendment request: 

May 20, 1994 


Description of amendment request: 

The proposed amendment would remove Core Spray (CS) High Sparger Pressure Instrumentation from the Vermont Yankee
Technical Specifications for Emergency Core Cooling System (ECCS) Actuation Instrumentation. In addition, an
unrelated administrative change is also proposed. 


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:
 


1. The proposed change to remove the Core Spray High Sparger Pressure Instrumentation from the Technical Specifications
for ECCS Actuation Instrumentation is consistent with NRC requirements concerning this instrumentation. This
instrumentation is considered NNS [nonnuclear safety] and performs a local monitoring and alarm function only.
In addition, the NRC has recently approved the removal of Core Spray Sparger Break Detection Instrumentation from
the Technical Specifications of another BWR [boiling water reactor] with a similar situation.

The CS Sparger Piping is inspected every refueling outage to verify its integrity. No cracks in the CS Sparger piping
have been identified since the first inspection in 1980. CS Sparger Piping integrity is still assured. The instrumentation
systems to be removed from the ECCS Actuation Instrumentation Technical Specifications do not perform any automatic
control or trip function. In addition, this instrumentation does not provide information that is required to permit
the control room operator to take manual actions that are required for safety systems to accomplish their safety functions
for design basis accident events.

The proposed change does not result in any system hardware modification, function change or new plant configuration.
The requested change to ECCS Actuation Instrumentation does not impact any FSAR [Final Safety Analysis Report] safety
analysis involving the ECCS or Protection Systems. These monitoring functions are not contributors to the initiation
of accidents.

The administrative changes to correct typographical errors on Tables 3.2.1 and 4.2.1 will have no affect on plant
hardware, plant design, safety limit setting or plant system operation and therefore, do not modify or add any initiating
parameters that would significantly increase the probability or consequences of any previously analyzed accident.

Therefore, it is concluded that there is not a significant increase in the probability or consequence of an accident
previously evaluated.

2. The function of the Core Spray High Sparger Pressure Instrumentation to be removed from the Technical Specifications
is for local indication and alarm only. These functions are not necessary for operators to accomplish any safety functions.

The proposed change does not involve any change in hardware, function, Technical Specification trip setpoints,
plant operation, redundancy, protective function or design basis of the plant. There is no impact on any existing
safety analysis or safety design limits. Core Spray High Sparger Pressure Instrumentation functions do not initiate
nuclear system parameter variations which are considered potential initiating causes of threats to the fuel and
the nuclear system process barrier.

As discussed above, the proposed administrative change only corrects typographical errors concerning equipment
identification numbers. This change doe not affect any equipment and it does not involve any potential initiating
events that would create any new or different kind of accident.
 
Therefore, the proposed changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident
previously evaluated.

3. The proposed change to remove the Core Spray High Sparger Pressure Instrumentation from the Technical Specifications
for ECCS Actuation Instrumentation does not affect any existing safety margins. This equipment is NNS and performs
a local indication and alarming function only. The original intent of this detection system was because the first
BWR plants had only the CS System for long-term core cooling. Later, plants like VY [Vermont Yankee] were provided
with Low Pressure Coolant Injection (LPCI) Systems in addition to CS.

Existing Technical Specification requirements for automatic trip functions are unaffected. Failure of the Core
Spray High Sparger Pressure Instrumentation does not preclude the ability of the CS System to perform its safety function
to mitigate the consequences of accidents or of any other safety system to accomplish its safety functions. Proper
ECCS functioning post-accident is not relied upon by NNS alarming functions but by such systems as safety related
reactor level indication.

The CS Sparger Piping is inspected every refueling outage to verify its integrity. No cracks in the CS Sparger piping
have been identified since the first inspection in 1980. The removal from the Technical Specifications has no affect
on the bases of Protective Instrumentation which is to operate to initiate required system protective actions. The
Core Spray High Sparger Pressure Instrumentation does not perform any safety function.

As discussed above, the proposed administrative change which corrects typographical errors does not affect any
equipment involved in potential initiating events or safety limits. [***].

Based upon the above, it is concluded that the proposed changes do not involve a significant reduction in a margin of
safety.



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant
hazards consideration.

Washington Public Power Supply System, Docket No. 50-397, Nuclear Project No. 2, Benton County, Washington




Date of amendment request: 

March 18, 1992, modifications submitted June 25 and July 28, 1992, and December 6, 1993


Description of amendment request: 

On December 6, 1993, the licensee submitted a significant modification to its original request of March 18, 1992 (April
19, 1992 (57 FR 12349)). The modified request would amend the Technical Specifications (TS) to provide two surveillance
tests to determine the operability of the catalyst beds in the containment atmospheric control (CAC) system. One
test compares hydrogen content in the influent to the hydrogen content in effluent process streams to assure the catalyst
is operating. The second test measures the temperature profile in the catalyst bed to ensure that sufficient catalyst
remains available for the recombination process during postulated accident conditions. Since the original proposal
has been significantly changed, the staff is issuing a new notice and proposed no significant hazards consideration
determination.


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration.
The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis against the standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c). The staff's review is
presented below: 


1. Does the amendment involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated?
The proposed change does not involve any changes in the design or operation of the hydrogen recombiners, which are
accident mitigation systems. The proposed change revises surveillance requirements to ensure that existing equipment
will perform as designed in response to postulated events. The proposed change does not, therefore, involve an increase
in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
2. Does the amendment create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated?
The proposed change does not involve any changes in the design or operation of existing equipment, and does not, therefore,
create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.
3. Does the amendment involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety?
The proposed change increases surveillance requirements for existing equipment to ensure that the equipment will
perform as designed. With equipment performing as designed in response to postulated accidents, the proposed change
does not affect any existing margins of safety.
Based on the licensee's analysis and the staff's analysis, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are
satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards
consideration.

Wisconsin Public Service Corporation, Docket No. 50-305, Kewaunee Nuclear Power Plant, Kewaunee County, Wisconsin




Date of amendment request: 

March 31, 1994


Description of amendment request: 

The proposed amendment would revise the Kewaunee Nuclear Power Plant Technical Specifications (TS) by incorporating
operability and surveillance requirements for the recently installed Auxiliary Feedwater Pump Low Discharge Pressure
Trip instrumentation. Proposed surveillance requirements would be added to Table TS 4.1-1, ``Minimum Frequencies
for Checks, Calibrations and Test of Instrument Channels.'' TS 3.4, ``Steam and Power Conversions System,'' would
be revised to explicitly link operability of the associated Auxiliary Feedwater Pump Low Discharge Pressure Trip
channel to operability of the associated auxiliary feedwater pump. In addition, minor format inconsistencies in
TS 3.4.b.1.A and 3.4.b.1.B would be corrected. 


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:

(a) Table TS 4.1-1



The proposed changes were reviewed in accordance with the provisions of 10 CFR 50.92 to show no significant hazards
exist. The proposed changes will not:

1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.

The proposed change defines the necessary surveillance requirements for the recently installed Auxiliary Feedwater
Pump Low Discharge Pressure Trip channels. The intent of adding surveillance requirements to the TS's is to ensure
the availability and reliability of the components. The proposed change is an additional restriction not presently
included in the TS's. Therefore, it will not increase the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated
in the USAR.

2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.

The proposed change adds surveillance requirements to the TS for the Auxiliary Feedwater Low Discharge Pressure
Trip channels. It does not alter the plant configuration or overall plant performance. Therefore, it does not create
the possibility of a new or different kind of accident.

3. Involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety.

This proposed revision is an additional requirement in the TS's to ensure the availability and reliability of the
Auxiliary Feedwater Pump Low Discharge Pressure Trip channels. It does not alter the input or assumptions of the safety
analysis, and is an enhancement from an overall safety standpoint. Therefore, it will not involve a reduction in the
margin of safety.

(b) TS 3.4

The proposed changes were reviewed in accordance with the provision of 10 CFR 50.92 to show no significant hazards
exist. The proposed changes will not:

1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.

The proposed change defines the necessary operability requirements for the recently installed Auxiliary Feedwater
Pump Low Discharge Pressure Trip channels. Installation of this protection was recommended and approved by the NRC
prior to their installation. The proposed change requires that the reactor not be heated > 350
 F unless both motor driven Auxiliary Feedwater Pumps and their associated low discharge pressure trip channels
are operable. Also, the reactor shall not be heated > 350
 F unless the turbine driven auxiliary feedwater pump and its associated low discharge pressure trip channel
are operable, or if not demonstrated operable prior to > 350 
 F, they shall be declared inoperable when 350
 F is exceeded. Furthermore, when the reactor is > 350
 F, an auxiliary feedwater pump low discharge pressure trip channel may be inoperable for a period not to exceed
4 hours. If this time is exceeded, the associated auxiliary feedwater pump shall be declared inoperable and the appropriate
limiting condition for operation of TS 3.4.b.2 entered. The intent of adding these operability requirements to the
TS's is to ensure the availability of the components. The proposed change is an additional restriction not presently
included in the TS's. Therefore, it will not increase the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated
in the USAR. 

2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.

The proposed change adds operability requirements to the TS for the Auxiliary Feedwater Pump Low Discharge Pressure
Trip channels. It does not alter the plant configuration or overall plant performance. Therefore, it does not create
the possibility of a new or different kind of accident.

3. Involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety.

This proposed revision is an additional requirement in the TS's to ensure the operability of the Auxiliary Feedwater
Pump Low Discharge Pressure Trip channels. It does not alter the input or assumptions of the safety analysis, and is
an enhancement from an overall safety standpoint. Therefore it will not involve a reduction in the margin of safety

(c) Administrative changes to TS 3.4.b.1.A and TS 3.4.b.1.B

The proposed changes were reviewed in accordance with the provision of 10 CFR 50.92 to show no significant hazards
exist. The proposed changes will not:

1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated, or

2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from an accident previously evaluated, or

3. Involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety.

The proposed changes are administrative in nature and do not alter the intent of interpretation of the TS. Therefore,
no significant hazards exist.



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

Wolf Creek Nuclear Operating Corporation, Docket No. 50-482, Wolf Creek Generating Station, Coffey County, Kansas




Date of amendment request: 

May 24, 1994 


Description of amendment request: 

The amendment request proposes to revise the Technical Specifications (TS) to implement the NRC's Final Policy Statement
on Technical Specification Improvements for Nuclear Power Reactors (58 FR 39132). These improvements involve focusing
the Technical Specifications on those requirements that are of controlling importance to operational safety by
screening each TS in Section 3/4.1 through 3/4.11 using the criteria provided in the policy statement. The purpose
of the proposed amendment request is to relocate the specifications that do not meet any of the four policy statement
criteria. The relocated specifications will be moved to Updated Final Safety Analysis (USAR) Chapter 16. Based on
the screening, all or part of 38 technical specifications were identified as not meeting any of the criteria and, therefore,
as candidates for relocation. The licensee has categorized the TS changes as (1) specifications relocated intact
to USAR Chapter 16, (2) specifications relocated with portions retained in TS, (3) specifications relocated with
programmatic requirements referenced in Section 6 of TS, (4) modifications to retained specifications to accomodate
relocation of other specifications, and (5) new specification requirements incorporated into the TS. The last category
is used to effect the retention of portions of relocated specifications and accomodate the policy statement recommendation
to incorporate industry experience in the determination of TS content.


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:



1. The proposed changes do not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated.

The proposed Technical Specification changes involve relocating requirements that are not conditions or limitations
on reactor operation necessary to obviate the possibility of an abnormal situation or event giving rise to an immediate
threat to the public health and safety. The proposed changes were identified through the application of criteria
designed to cull those requirements that are not important to operational safety from the Technical Specifications.
In this process, selected provisions of the Technical Specifications identified for relocation were retained if
necessary to support a Technical Specification that was to be retained. Thus, only specification requirements that
have little or no operational safety significance are proposed for relocation. In addition, those requirements
that would be relocated will be included in the Updated Final Safety Analysis Report (USAR) and, therefore, will be
controlled and implemented as NRC commitments. In this manner, those requirements that have no operational safety
significance but involve maintaining the plant in its as-designed state (for example, through surveillance programs)
would be controlled.

In addition, the criteria for identifying requirements to be retained in the Technical Specifications specifically
call out, for retention, those structures, systems, or components that are required to mitigate accidents previously
evaluated.

Based on the above, the proposed changes do not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences
of an accident previously evaluated.



2. The proposed changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated.
 


The proposed changes involve relocating Technical Specification requirements to another licensee-controlled
document. No changes or physical alterations of the plant are involved. Also, no changes to the operation of the plant
or equipment are involved. Therefore, the proposed changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind
of accident from any previously evaluated.

3. Do the proposed changes involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety.

The proposed changes involve relocating Technical Specification requirements to the USAR. The requirements to
be relocated were identified by applying the criteria endorsed in the Commission's Policy Statement. Thus, those
specifications that would be relocated do not impose constraints on design and operation of the plant that are derived
form the plant safety analysis report or from probabilistic safety assessment (PSA) information and do not belong
in the Technical Specifications in accordance with 10 CFR 50.36 and the purpose of the Technical Specifications stated
in the Policy Statement. Therefore, relocation of these requirements does not involve a significant reduction in
the margin of safety.

In addition, revisions to the USAR will be evaluated in accordance with the 10 CFR 50.59 process which considers the
reduction in safety margin. Therefore, any future revisions to the provisions in the USAR will consider reductions
in the margin of safety using the criteria for identifying an unreviewed safety question.



The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

Wolf Creek Nuclear Operating Corporation, Docket No. 50-482, Wolf Creek Generating Station, Coffey County, Kansas




Date of amendment request: 

June 7, 1994


Description of amendment request: 

The proposed amendment revises Technical Specification Table 2.2-1, Reactor Trip System Instrumentation Setpoints,
to change the over-temperature-delta-temperature (OTDT) axial flux difference (AFD) limits to reflect results
of the Cycle 8 core maneuvering analysis.


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:



1. The proposed change does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated.

The probability of occurrence and the consequences of an accident evaluated previously in the Updated Safety Analysis
Report (USAR) are not increased due to the proposed technical specification change. Operation at 3565 MWt does not
affect any of the mechanisms postulated in the USAR to cause LOCA or non-LOCA design basis events. Analyses, evaluations
and minimum DNBR [departure from nucleate boiling ratio] calculations confirm that the USAR conclusions remain
valid for the proposed changes. On these bases it is concluded that the probability and consequences of the accidents
previously evaluated in the USAR are not increased.

2. The proposed change does not create the possiblity of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated.

There is no new type of accident or malfunction being created. The proposed change provides revised operating limits
necessary to support Cycle 8, and does not change the method and manner of plant operation. The safety design bases
in the USAR have not been altered. Thus, this change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident
from any previously evaluated.

3. The proposed change does not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety.

The proposed changes do not change the plant configuration in a way that introduces a new potential hazard to the plant
and do not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety. The analyses and evaluations discussed in the safety
evaluation demonstrate that all applicable safety analysis acceptance criteria continue to be met for the proposed
operating conditions. Items not specifically cited in this safety evaluation have been reviewed and have been found
to be bounded by the evaluations performed for Reference 1 [Wolf Creek Generating Station Technical Specifications].
Therefore, it is concluded that the margin of safety, as described in the bases to any technical specification, is
not reduced. 


The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

Order Prohibiting Involvement in 10 CFR Part 55 Licensed Activities (Effective immediately) 



In the Matter of: Stephen Mignotte, Senior Reactor Operator. 



I 



Stephen Mignotte (Mr. Mignotte) held Senior Reactor Operator License No. SOP-11160 (License) issued by the
Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC or Commission) pursuant to 10 CFR Part 55. The license authorized Mr. Mignotte
to manipulate, and to supervise the manipulation of, the controls of the nuclear power reactor at the New York Power
Authority's (Facility Licensee) Indian Point 3 Nuclear Power Plant in Buchanan, New York. On November 23, 1993, Mr.
Mignotte resigned his employment with the New York Power Authority, which caused the License to expire. Additionally,
the Facility Licensee, in a letter dated December 23, 1993, informed the NRC that the New York Power Authority no longer
had a need to maintain Mr. Mignotte's operating license for the Indian Point Unit 3 Nuclear Power Plant. 



II 



The responsibilities associated with a Senior Reactor Operator license issued pursuant to 10 CFR Part 55 require
that individuals be fit for duty while performing safety-related activities at the facility. The character of the
individual, which includes the individual's trustworthiness, is a consideration in issuing an operator license.


See 

Section 182a of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (42 U.S.C. 2232a). In determining whether or not an individual
seeking a license to be a reactor operator or senior reactor operator has the necessary character and trustworthiness,
the Commission takes into account any history of illegal drug use by the applicant. Prior to May 26, 1987, each applicant
for a reactor operator or senior reactor operator license was required to certify that the applicant had no drug or
narcotic habit on the Certificate of Medical Examination, NRC Form 396. Since that time, the NRC has required an evaluation
of the applicant prepared by a physician as part of a license application. 

See 

10 CFR 55.23(a). This evaluation is presented on a Certificate of Medical Examination, NRC Form 396. 

See 

10 CFR 55.23. Among the factors to be considered by the certifying physician are factors such as use of illegal drugs
or abuse of alcohol. 

See 

Form 396; 

see also 

ANSI/ANS 3.4-1983, Section 5.2.2. 

In accordance with 10 CFR Part 26, the Facility Licensee established a program to provide reasonable assurance that
nuclear power plant personnel are not under the influence of any substance, legal or illegal, which affects their
ability to safely and competently perform their duties, including measures for early detection of persons who are
not fit to perform licensed activities. In addition, licensed operators are required by 10 CFR 55.53(j) to refrain
from use of illegal drugs, including marijuana and cocaine. Licensed operators are also required by 10 CFR 55.53(k)
to participate in 10 CFR Part 26 fitness-for-duty programs established by the Facility Licensees. 



III 



On November 23, 1993, Mr. Mignotte, while on duty as a Senior Reactor Operator at the Indian Point 3 facility, was requested
by the Facility Licensee to provide a urine sample to the nurse at the plant after being randomly selected as part of
the routine fitness for duty chemical testing program required of the Facility Licensee by the NRC pursuant to 10 CFR
26.24. After receiving a sample from Mr. Mignotte, the nurse checked the temperature of the sample, noticed that it
felt ``cool to the touch'', and found that the temperature was below specifications in 10 CFR Part 26, Appendix A,  2.4(g)(14),
for acceptable urine samples. As a result, Mr. Mignotte was requested to provide a witnessed urine sample to the Facility
Licensee in accordance with the same section of the Appendix. Mr. Mignotte provided a second sample which was subsequently
determined, on November 30, 1993, to contain both marijuana and cocaine above cutoff levels specified by the Appendix.
After the witnessed urine sample had been collected on November 23, 1993, Mr. Mignotte was suspended from licensed
duties and he subsequently resigned that same day. These facts were provided to the NRC by the Facility Licensee, in
letters dated December 23, 1993 and January 3, 1994, and were discussed in the report of an NRC inspection conducted
January 12-13, 1994. 

The results of the second, witnessed urine sample indicate that Mr. Mignotte used illegal drugs, which is a violation
of the conditions of his license imposed by 10 CFR 55.53(j). Furthermore, his performance of licensed duties while
under the influence of illegal drugs is also a violation of the conditions of his license imposed by 10 CFR 55.53(j).
Based on the temperature of the first urine sample provided by Mr. Mignotte and the fact that the first sample yielded
negative results when tested for illegal substances while the subsequent, witnessed sample yielded positive results,
I conclude that the first sample was a surrogate false sample, submitted by Mr. Mignotte in an attempt to conceal illegal
drug use. 

10 CFR 50.5(a)(2) prohibits any employee of a licensee from deliberately submitting to the NRC, a licensee, or a licensee's
contractor or subcontractor, information that the person submitting the information knows to be incomplete or inaccurate
in some respect material to the NRC. The urine samples collected within the context of a licensee's chemical testing
program pursuant to the requirements of 10 CFR Part 26 represent information material to an access authorization
and fitness-for-duty decision. Therefore, Mr. Mignotte's deliberately submitting inaccurate information material
to the NRC in the form of a false sample is a violation of 10 CFR 50.5(a)(2). In addition, Mr. Mignotte violated 10 CFR
50.5(a)(1) by deliberately providing to the Facility Licensee a surrogate urine sample that he knew to be inaccurate
at the time he submitted it and which, but for detection, would have caused the Facility Licensee to be in violation
of 10 CFR 50.9(a). 

Mr. Nignotte's failure to comply with the prohibition against illegal drug use and his attempts to circumvent the
chemical testing program to avoid detection of illegal drug use while employed by the Facility Licensee are violations
of the conditions of Mr. Mignotte's license imposed by 10 CFR 55.53 (j) and (k), and demonstrate an intentional disregard
for the important obligations of a licensed operator.

IV


Based on the above, Mr. Mignotte, an employee of the New York Power Authority at the time of the incident, engaged in
deliberate misconduct in violation of 10 CFR 50.5(a)(1) and (2) by deliberately violating 10 CFR 55.53(k), in that
he submitted to the facility licensee information which he knew to be inaccurate in some respect material to the NRC.
Mr. Mignotte, a licensed Senior Reactor Operator at the time of the event, also used illegal substances and performed
licensed duties while under the influence of illegal substances in violation of 10 CFR 55.53(j), and deliberately
failed to participate in the fitness-for-duty program established by the facility licensee in violation of 10 CFR
55.53(k).
The NRC must be able to rely on its licensees and their employees, especially NRC-licensed operators, to comply with
NRC requirements, including the requirement to provide information and maintain records that are complete and accurate
in all material respects. Mr. Mignotte's actions in using illegal drugs and attempting to circumvent fitness-for-duty
requirements have raised serious doubt as to whether he can be relied upon to comply with NRC requirements applicable
to licensed individuals and to provide complete and accurate information to the NRC.
Consequently, I lack the requisite reasonable assurance that Mr. Mignotte will conduct any 10 CFR Part 55 licensed
activities in compliance with the Commission's requirements and that the health and safety of the public will be protected
with Mr. Mignotte engaged in such licensed activities at this time. Therefore, I find that the public health, safety,
and interest require that Mr. Mignotte be prohibited from involvement in 10 CFR Part 55 licensed activities for three
years from the date of this Order. Furthermore, pursuant to 10 CFR 2.202, I find that the significance of the misconduct
described above is such that the public health, safety and interest require that this Order be immediately effective.


V


Accordingly, pursuant to sections 103, 107, 161b, 161i, 161o, 182 and 186 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended,
and the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 2.202, 10 CFR 50.5, and 10 CFR 55.61, it is hereby ordered, effective immediately,
that:



A. Mr. Mignotte is prohibited for three years from the date of this Order from engaging in licensed operator activities
licensed by the NRC pursuant to 10 CFR Part 55.
B. For a period of three years from the date of this Order, Mr. Mignotte shall provide a copy of this Order to any prospective
employer engaged in activities licensed by the NRC pursuant to 10 CFR Part 50 prior to his acceptance of employment
with such prospective employer so that the employer will have notice of the prohibition against Mr. Mignotte's involvement
in licensed operator activities licensed pursuant to 10 CFR Part 55.
C. For three years from the date of this Order, Mr. Mignotte shall provide notice to the Director, Office of Enforcement,
U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, of the name, address, and telephone number of the employer,
within 72 hours of his acceptance of an employment offer, from an employer who is engaged in activities licensed by
the NRC pursuant to 10 CFR Part 50.



The Director, Office of Enforcement may, in writing, relax or rescind any of the above conditions upon demonstration
by Mr. Mignotte of good cause.


VI


In accordance with 10 CFR 2.202, Mr. Mignotte must, and any other person adversely affected by this Order may, submit
an answer to this Order, and may request a hearing within 20 days of the date of this Order. The answer may consent to this
Order. Unless the answer consents to this Order, the answer shall, in writing and under oath or affirmation, specifically
admit or deny each allegation or charge made in this Order and shall set forth the matters of fact and law on which Mr.
Mignotte or other person adversely affected relies and the reasons as to why the Order should not have been issued.
Any answer or request for a hearing shall be submitted to the Secretary, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, ATTN:
Chief, Docketing and Service Section, Washington, DC 20555. Copies also shall be sent to the Director, Office of Enforcement,
U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555; to the Assistant General Counsel for Hearings and Enforcement
at the same address; to the Regional Administrator, Region I, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, 475 Allendale
Road, King of Prussia, PA 19406; and to Mr. Mignotte, if the answer or hearing request is by a person other than Mr. Mignotte.
If a person other than Mr. Mignotte requests a hearing, that person shall set forth with particularity the manner in
which his interest is adversely affected by this Order and shall address the criteria set forth in 10 CFR 2.714(d).
If a hearing is requested by Mr. Mignotee or a person whose interest is adversely affected, the Commission will issue
an Order designating the time and place of any hearing. If a hearing is held, the issue to be considered at such hearing
shall be whether this Order should be sustained.
Pursuant to 10 CFR 2.202(c)(2)(i), Mr. Mignotee or any person adversely affected, by this Order, may, in addition
to demanding a hearing, at the time that answer is filed or sooner, move the presiding officer to set aside the immediate
effectiveness of the Order on the ground that the Order, including the need for immediate effectiveness, is not based
on adequate evidence but on mere suspicion, unfounded allegations, or error.
In the absence of any request for a hearing, the provisions specified in Section IV above shall be final 20 days from
the date of this Order without further order or proceedings. An answer or a request for a hearing shall not stay the immediate
effectiveness of this order.

<DOCTITLE>Florida Power and Light Co. (Turkey Point and St. Lucie Nuclear Plants) Receipt of Petition for Director's Decision
Under 10 CFR 2.206</DOCTITLE>



Notice is hereby given that on June 7, 1994, Thomas J. Saporito, Jr. filed a petition under 10 CFR 2.206 of the Commission's
regulations requesting that the NRC take action against Florida Power and Light Co. as operator of the Turkey Point
and St. Lucie nuclear power stations.

The Petitioner asks that the NRC institute a show cause proceeding to modify, suspend or revoke Florida Power and Light
Co.'s operating licenses and that the NRC take escalated enforcement action for retaliatory actions which were taken
against him, a former employee, for engaging in protected activities as defined in 10 CFR 50.7. Petitioner asks that
the NRC also take escalated enforcement action against every employee of the company who is found to have been involved
in the retaliatory actions.

In order to determine which Licensee employees were involved in the relatiatory actions and to assess the overall
work environment at the plants, Petitioner asks that the NRC conduct an investigation. In addition to the specific
acts of retaliation he claims were taken against him, the Petitioner alleges that other employees have also been retaliated
against, creating a chilling effect at the Turkey Point plant beginning in 1988. Petitioner asks that the NRC initiate
an investigation into his claims, which involve alleged violations of 10 CFR 50.7 and 19.15 and the Energy Reorganization
Act, notwithstanding the fact that they are being pursued within the Department of Labor, because of the asserted
public health and safety implications involved.

The Petitioner's request has been referred to the Director of the Office of Enforcement. As provided by 10 CFR 2.206,
appropriate action will be taken on this request within a reasonable time.

A copy of the Petition is available for inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington,
DC 20555.

<DOCTITLE>Virginia Electric and Power Co. Notice of Issuance of Amendment to Materials License SNM-2501</DOCTITLE>



The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) has issued Amendment No. 7 to Materials License No. SNM-2501
held by Virginia Electric and Power Company for the receipt and storage of spent fuel at the Surry ISFSI, located in
Surry County, Virginia. The amendment is effective as of the date of issuance.

The amendment revises the Technical Specifications making procedural changes to spent fuel characteristics for
the CASTOR V/21 cask and allows use of the CASTOR X/33 cask at the site. These changes do not affect fuel receipt, handling,
and storage safety. They are procedural in nature and result in a change in process operations and equipment that does
not alter the scope and type of operations presently authorized. The safety evaluation for this amendment demonstrates
that the accident consequences for the analyzed design basis accidents remain negligible. There is reasonable assurance
that the public health and safety will remain protected by activities authorized under this amendment and that the
environmental impact will remain insignificant.


The applications for the amendment complies with the standards and requirements of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954,
as amended (the Act), and the Commission's rules and regulations. The Commission has made appropriate findings as
required by the Act and the Commission's rules and regulations in 10 CFR Chapter I, which are set forth in the license
amendment. Prior public notice of the amendment was not required since the amendment does not involve a significant
hazards consideration.

The Commission has determined that the issuance of the amendment will not result in any significant environmental
impact and that, pursuant to 10 CFR 51.21, an environmental assessment need not be prepared in connection with issuance
of the amendment.

For further details with respect to this action, see (1) the applications for amendment dated December 23, 1988, May
3, 1991, and November 19, 1993, and (2) Amendment No. 7 to Materials License No. SNM-2501, and (3) the Commission's
letter to the licensee dated June 29, 1994. All of these items are available for public inspection at the Commission's
Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC., and at the Local Public Document Room
at the Swem Library, College of William and Mary, Williamsburg, Virginia, 23185.

Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Rewrite



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Office of Federal Procurement Policy, Office of Management and Budget.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of public meeting and request for public comments.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

In response to the report of the National Performance Review (NPR) recommendation to convert the FAR from rigid rules
to guiding principles, the Administrator for Federal Procurement Policy has established a Board of Directors (hereinafter
the Board), comprised of senior level individuals from the Executive Branch, to develop a plan for the FAR rewrite.
This notice solicits public comment on two approaches for the rewrite, including drafting principles, the Board
is considering.



Both approaches delineate mandatory and nonmandatory provisions. The first approach would provide for (1) a FAR
that is limited to mandatory governmentwide regulations, and (2) an acquisition manual that would reprint the FAR
and also include nonmandatory governmentwide policies, procedures, etc. In addition, agency supplements, including
both mandatory and nonmandatory provisions, would be authorized to implement agency-unique statutes, policies,
etc.


The second approach would consist of (1) the FAR which would include all mandatory Governmentwide provisions, and
(2) separate acquisition manuals developed by an agency or a group of agencies. The manuals would include mandatory
provisions necessary to implement statutes unique to the agency or group of agencies, a minimal number of mandatory
policies and procedures not required by statute, and nonmandatory guidance.

Both approaches would result in a FAR containing only mandatory provisions. However, the first approach would promulgate
governmentwide nonregulation guidance, while the second approach would permit an agency to promulgate in agency
manuals whatever nonregulation guidance the agency deems appropriate. Additionally, the first approach would
retain agency FAR supplements, while the second approach would replace agency supplements with agency acquisition
manuals.

The Board has prepared a model rewrite of FAR Part 9 to illustrate the first approach. It is drafted as a governmentwide
manual containing both the new FAR (which will also be codified in the Code of Federal Regulations); and policies,
procedures, provisions, forms, and clauses that do not constitute regulations. An actual FAR rewrite would likely
include a wider variety of options and illustrations than appear in the nonregulation component of the model. This
notice solicits comments only on the proposed approach for the FAR rewrite, and not on the content of the model rewrite
of Part 9.

The Board intends to provide for a mutual exchange of ideas and information with affected parties both in the government
and the private sector by publishing this notice, soliciting public comments, and holding a public meeting.

A public meeting will be held in Room 2010, New Executive Office building (NEOB), 725 17th Street, NW, Washington,
DC. Individuals wishing to attend the meeting, including individuals wishing to make presentations should contact
Ms. Rebecca Hardy at 202-395-3501 prior to 3:30 p.m. on August 16, 1994, for clearance to the NEOB.




<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

On September 7, 1993, the Vice President released the report of the NPR which required simplification of the procurement
process by rewriting the FAR, shifting from rigid rules to guiding principles. According to the report, the FAR, which
is the government's principal set of procurement regulations, is too process oriented, changes too often, minimizes
discretion of procurement officials, and stifles innovation. The Board intends to develop a plan to rewrite the FAR
to move from a system of rigid rules to guiding principles, promote decision making at the lowest possible level, eliminate
unnecessary regulatory requirements, facilitate innovative contracting and develop a more effective process
to listen to its customers.



This project will be accomplished under the direction of the Administrator for Federal Procurement Policy with the
assistance of a Board of Directors comprised of senior-level officials from the Executive Branch.

The Board has begun planning the FAR rewrite project by defining two approaches and by drafting a model FAR Part 9 that
adheres, for the most part, to the drafting principles outlined in this announcement as the first approach. However,
if the FAR is actually rewritten along the lines of the model, we expect that there would be additional material and
more than one optional approach or illustration to be included in many parts of the nonregulation part of the model.
The Board intends to recommend adoption of the NPR philosophy of giving greater flexibility in the formulation and
administration of contracts.



Questions for Commentors



To assist the Board in its deliberations, it is requested that all interested parties review the proposed approaches,
drafting principles, and illustration of the model rewrite of FAR Part 9. This notice solicits comments on the proposed
approaches for the FAR rewrite and not on the content of the model rewrite of FAR Part 9. In preparing comments the Board
requests that commentors consider the following questions with regard to each approach:

1. Does the proposed approach represent an improvement to the existing FAR system? If not, please suggest an alternative
approach.

2. Does the proposed approach remove from the regulations system unnecessary, burdensome direction while still
providing the procurement community with sufficient common policy and principles? If not, please suggest an alternative
approach.

3. Does the proposed approach increase discretion and encourage innovation while still fostering good contracting
practices? If not, please suggest an alternative approach.

4. Does the proposed approach simplify the procurement process? If not, please suggest an alternative approach.

5. Does the approach of publishing nonregulation information in an acquisition manual provide useful guidance for
contracting officers in decision making, formulating process or practical solutions, identifying alternatives?
If not, please suggest an alternative approach.

6. Does the proposed approach for the Code of Federal Regulations to contain only the regulation component of the model
raise any concerns for you? If so, please suggest an alternative approach.

7. The nonregulation component of the model would normally not be published for public comment in the 

Federal Register

. Does this approach create a problem? What problem? If so, please suggest an alternative approach.
8. Which types or categories of provisions and clauses would you recommend to be included in the regulation component
of the model? In the nonregulation manual component of the model?
9. Does the proposed approach to include only guidance needed by procurement personnel improve the contracting process?
If not, please suggest an alternative approach.
10. Is there a better approach for rewriting the FAR? What is it?
11. How do we carry forward to lower levels the concept of moving away from a centralized direction?
12. Please provide any other comments you consider appropriate.


First Proposed Approach


Discussion


The basic thrust of this approach under consideration by the Board is to divide the FAR into regulation and nonregulation
(a Governmentwide manual) components. The new FAR will essentially retain its current 53 Part structure and will
contain policies, provisions and clauses necessary to implement statutory requirements, primary regulation requirements,
basic policies/guiding principles and essential governmentwide procedures. Much of the material, provisions
and clauses that will be removed from the FAR will be made available in nonregulation remarks in a Federal acquisition
manual. In addition, agencies will continue to issue supplements to the FAR, including minimal mandatory as well
as nonmandatory provisions. The FAR will be mandatory for use by the agencies, and will be codified in the Code of Federal
Regulations.
The Government acquisition manual will include the FAR text, and in addition, will provide nonmandatory guidance,
alternative approaches, forms, clauses, and other examples that may be used, at their discretion, by contracting
officers in structuring a procurement. The nonregulation material in the manual will be published for public comment
only when required by Section 22 of the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act (41 U.S.C. 418b), which does not require
publication of the type of information normally provided nonregulation component of the acquisition manual.
The FAR system will promote decision making at the lowest practicable level by permitting contracting officers to
use, modify, tailor to best suit individual situations or disregard nonregulation policies, procedures, provisions,
forms and clauses. For example, in the illustration of a new FAR Part 9, the clauses covering First Article Approval,
Contractor Testing, (FAR 52.209-3) would be eliminated from the regulation component but would be included
in the nonregulation component.


Proposed Drafting Principles_Structure


1. Include in the FAR statements of general policy, standards, forms, provisions, and clauses that_
a. Are required by, or reasonably necessary to implement Statutes, Executive Orders, OMB Circulars, OFPP Policy
Letters, and, as appropriate, case law.
b. The FAR Council or joint FAR signatories decide must have governmentwide application because consistency is essential
to maintain an effective and efficient acquisition system.

<DOCNO> FR940706-2-00134 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940706-2-00078 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

2. Do not include in the FAR:

a. Procedures, policies, provisions or clauses which are not essential.

b. Guidance that is not needed by procurement personnel.

3. Include in the acquisition manual_

a. Examples of various optional methods for compliance with FAR policies, provisions, and clauses.

b. Procedures, practices, forms provisions, and clauses that may be used, modified, or not used, at the discretion
of the Contracting Officer.



Proposed Drafting Principles_General



1. Clearly identify the statutory requirements, basic policies, and principles.

2. Avoid proscription and rigid rules in favor of setting forth guiding principles.

3. Use goals and expected outcomes in place of processes or procedures.

4. Assume the reader is a procurement professional with appropriate knowledge, skills and abilities to do the job.

5. Assume contractors and contracting officials are going to do the ``right thing.''

6. Assign responsibility for decisions to the lowest practicable level, giving contracting officers authority,
responsibility, and maximum flexibility to find the most efficient, cost-effective way to meet customer mission
needs and time frames.

7. Minimize administrative and paperwork burdens on contracting officials and contractors.

8. Include in the FAR references to procurement related statutes and regulations, such as labor laws, and small business
size standards. Provide, as appropriate, in the acquisition manual, necessary additional information to assist
the contracting officers in complying with those requirements.

9. Provide guidance that encourages sound business practices, streamline the contracting process, contributes
to increased productivity, and cost effectiveness.

10. Provide guidance that implements policies based on statute without just restating the law.

11. Avoid guidance and other controls that impose unnecessary dollar thresholds, approval levels, contractor certifications,
coordination and documentation requirements, determinations.

12. Provide guidance that offers maximum opportunity for innovative contracting approaches.

13. Avoid the creation of regulations to address every contracting contingency.

14. Provide guidance to contracting officers that encourages risk management rather than risk avoidance.

15. Avoid regulations that impose government-unique, unnecessary requirements on federal contractors. Promote
the acquisition of commercial products and reliance on the commercial marketplace.

16. Apply a consistent set of drafting conventions so that the FAR will be succinct and understandable to the general
reader.



Second Proposed Approach



The second approach is essentially the same as the first approach with respect to which material would be regulations
and which material would be provided in a nonregulation acquisition manual. However, the nonregulation material
would not be published as a governmentwide manual. Rather, each agency, or group of agencies would be authorized to
publish its own manual containing its own guidance. These manuals would contain a minimal amount of mandatory material
applicable to the internal operations of the agency or necessary to implement the statutes that apply to that agency
or group of agencies. The remainder of the material in the manual would be that as noted in the first approach as nonregulation
in nature and not mandatory. Thus the FAR system would be comprised of the FAR (regulations) and agency acquisition
manuals (nonmandatory guidance and minimal mandatory requirements) that would take the place of current agency
supplements.



Illustration of the First Proposed Approach



Model of revised Part 9. The model FAR Part 9 is provided in the appendix to illustrate the first approach being considered
by the Board. Comment only on the approach illustrated by this model rewrite, and not on the content of the model rewrite
on Part 9. FAR Part 9 will be submitted to a committee for revisions in accordance with these Drafting Principles once
the Drafting Principles have been approved. The following model rewrite of FAR Part 9 shows the governmentwide acquisition
manual as it would appear under proposed number one.

<TEXT>
 

Proposed approach number two would follow the same criteria as is followed under proposed approach one to determine
which material is to be codified in the CFR and which material is to appear in nonregulation guidance. However, under
proposed approach number two, the nonregulation guidance would be published by individual agencies in manuals that
apply to contracts issued by that agency.

<USDEPT>SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION</USDEPT>





Self-Regulatory Organizations; American Stock Exchange, Inc.; Order Approving Proposed Rule Change Relating
to Amendments to Its Listing Fee Schedule for Listed Companies


June 28, 1994.


On May 3, 1994, the American Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Amex'' or ``Exchange'') submitted to the Securities and Exchange
Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission''), pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'')
 and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,
 a proposed rule change to amend its original listing fees for stock issues.





The proposed rule change was noticed in Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34133 (May 31, 1994), 59 FR 29308 (June
6, 1994). No comments were received on the proposal.
The Amex is amending Section 140 of its Listing Standards and Requirements relating to the fees charged to listed companies
for the original listing of common stock. Specifically, the Exchange is amending Section 140 to adopt a maximum fee
applicable to the original listing of stock issues on the Exchange.
Currently, the listing fee for stock issues ranges from $5,000 for new listings of less than one million shares to more
than $122,500 for listings of greater than 100 million shares. In addition, each issuer which does not already have
securities listed on the Exchange is assessed a one-time charge of $5,000. Listing fees for non-U.S. issuers listed
on foreign stock exchanges are currently 50 percent of the rates for U.S. companies, including the $5,000 one-time
charge, with a maximum of $30,000.
The Exchange is amending Section 140 to adopt a maximum fee of $45,000 ($50,000 inclusive of the one-time charge of
$5,000) for stock issues exceeding 15 million shares. In addition, the Exchange is reducing the maximum listing fee
for non-U.S. issuers already listed on a foreign exchange from $30,000 to $25,000, inclusive of the one-time charge.





The Exchange believes, based upon discussions with prospect companies, that each year several large companies elect
not to list on the Amex due to the expense of the Exchange's listing fee at the upper end of the fee schedule.
The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and in particular, with the requirements
of Section 6 of the Act.
 More specifically, the Commission believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6(b)(4) of the
Act which requires that the rules of an exchange assure the equitable allocation of reasonable dues, fees, and other
charges among members, issuers, and other persons using its facilities. The Commission believes that the reduced
original listing fees for stock issues exceeding 15 million shares are not unfairly discriminatory as proscribed
by Section 6(b)(5) of the Act.






The Commission believes that adopting a maximum original listing fee for stock issues exceeding 15 million shares
is consistent with Section 6(b)(4) of the Act in that it reasonably balances the Exchange's interest in attracting
large companies for listing with its regulatory interests in listing only bona fide companies on the Exchange. For
example, although decreasing listing fees for issues over 15 million shares should attract additional larger issuers
to its market, as well as provide an incentive for current Exchange issuers to list their new issues on the Amex, the
fee amendment will not affect the Amex's quantitative criteria for listing stock on the Exchange. Moreover, the adoption
of a maximum fee provides for a more equitable allocation of listing fees among issuers and should eliminate any disincentive
for large issuers to list on the Amex.
The Commission also believes that reducing the maximum fee applicable to original listings of stock for non-U.S.
companies listed on foreign stock exchanges from $30,000 to $25,000 (inclusive of the $5,000 one-time charge) is
consistent with Section 6(b)(5) of the Act in view of the reduction in fees for U.S. companies with issues exceeding
15 million shares.
Accordingly, the Commission believes that it is appropriate to approved the proposed rule change.
It is therefore ordered, pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act,
 that the proposed rule change (SR-Amex-94-12) is approved.






For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

<DOCTITLE>Issuer Delisting; Application To Withdraw From Listing and Registration; (Designatronics Incorporated, Common
Stock, $.04 Par Value) File No. 1-8543</DOCTITLE>



June 29, 1994.



Designatronics Incorporated (``Company'') has filed an application with the Securities and Exchange Commission
(``Commission''), pursuant to Section 12(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'') and Rule 12d2-2(d)
promulgated thereunder, to withdraw the above specified security from listing and registration on the American
Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Amex'').

The reasons alleged in the application for withdrawing this security from listing and registration include the following:

According to the Company, its Board of Directors (the ``Board'') unanimously approved resolutions on June 2, 1994,
to withdraw the Company's Common Stock from listing on the Amex and, instead, list such Common Stock on the National
Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations/National Market Systems (``NASDAQ/NMS''). According
to the Company, the decision of the Board followed a lengthy study of the matter, and was based upon the belief that listing
of the Common Stock on NASDAQ/NMS will be more beneficial to its stockholders than the present listing on the Amex because:

(1) The Company believes that the NASDAQ/NMS system of competing market-makers will result in increased visibility
and sponsorship for the Common Stock than is presently the case with the single specialist on the Amex; 

(2) The Company believes that the NASDAQ/NMS system will offer the Company's shareholders more liquidity than is
presently available on the Amex and less volatility in quoted prices per share when trading volume is slight;



(3) The Company believes that the NASD/NMS system will offer the opportunity for the Company to secure its own group
of market makers and expand the capital base available for trading in the Common Stock; and



(4) The Company believes that the firms making a market in the Company's Common Stock on the NASD/NMS system will also
be inclined to issue research reports concerning the Company, thereby increasing the number of firms providing institutional
research and advisory reports.






Any interested person may, on or before July 21, 1994, submit by letter to the Secretary of the Securities and Exchange
Commission, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549, facts bearing upon whether the application has been made
in accordance with the rules of the exchanges and what terms, if any, should be imposed by the Commission for the protection
of investors. The Commission, based on the information submitted to it, will issue an order granting the application
after the date mentioned above, unless the Commission determines to order a hearing on the matter.






For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

Determination That Nonconforming 1992 Porsche 911 Carrera 2 and Carrera 4 Passenger Cars Are Eligible for Importation




<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), DOT.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of determination by NHTSA that nonconforming 1992 Porsche 911 Carrera 2 and Carrera 4 passenger cars are eligible
for importation.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This notice announces the determination by NHTSA that 1992 Porsche 911 Carrera 2 and Carrera 4 passenger cars not originally
manufactured to comply with all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety standards are eligible for importation
into the United States because they are substantially similar to vehicles originally manufactured for importation
into and sale in the United States and certified by their manufacturer as complying with the safety standards (the
U.S.-certified versions of the 1992 Porsche 911 Carrera 2 and Carrera 4), and they are capable of being readily modified
to conform to the standards.




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Background



Under section 108(c)(3)(A)(i) of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act (the Act), 15 U.S.C.  1397(c)(3)(A)(i),
a motor vehicle that was not originally manufactured to conform to all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety standards
must be refused admission into the United States on and after January 31, 1990, unless NHTSA has determined that the
motor vehicle is substantially similar to a motor vehicle originally manufactured for importation into and sale
in the United States, certified under section 114 of the Act, and of the same model year as the model of the motor vehicle
to be compared, and is capable of being readily modified to conform to all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety
standards.

Petitions for eligiblity determinations may be submitted by either manufacturers or importers who have registered
with NHTSA pursuant to 49 CFR Part 592. As specified in 49 CFR 593.7, NHTSA publishes notice in the 

Federal Register

 of each petition that it receives, and affords interested persons an opportunity to comment on the petition. At the
close of the comment period, NHTSA determines, on the basis of the petition and any comments that it has received, whether
the vehicle is eligible for importation. The agency then publishes this determination in the 

Federal Register

.

Liphardt & Associates, Inc. of Ronkonkoma, New York (Registered Importer R-90-004) petitioned
NHTSA to determine whether 1992 Porsche 911 Carrera 2 and Carrera 4 passenger cars are eligible for importation into
the United States. NHTSA published notice of the petition on April 25, 1994 (59 FR 19748) to afford an opportunity for
public comment. The reader is referred to that notice for a thorough description of the petition. The petition covers
both the 2-wheel drive Carrera 2 and the 4-wheel drive Carrera 4. The notice referred collectively to these vehicles
as the ``1992 Porsche 911 Carrera 2/4.'' No comments were received in response to the notice. Based on its review of
the information submitted by the petitioner, NHTSA has determined to grant the petition.



Vehicle Eligibility Number for Subject Vehicles



The importer of a vehicle admissible under any final determination must indicate on the form HS-7 accompanying
entry the appropriate vehicle eligibility number indicating that the vehicle is eligible for entry. VSP 52 is the
vehicle eligibility number assigned to vehicles admissible under this determination.



Final Determination



Accordingly, on the basis of the foregoing, NHTSA hereby determines that 1992 Porsche 911 Carrera 2 and Carrera 4 passenger
cars not originally manufactured to comply with all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety standards are substantially
similar to 1992 Porsche 911 Carrera 2 and Carrera 4 passenger cars originally manufactured for importation into and
sale in the United States and certified under section 114 of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act, and
are capable of being readily modified to conform to all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety standards.






Authority: 

15 U.S.C. 1397(c)(3)(A)(i)(I) and (C)(ii); 49 CFR 593.8; delegations of authority at 49 CFR 1.50 and 501.8.

The HOPE for Elderly Independence Program is intended to demonstrate that effectively targeted and tailored supportive
services, coupled with tenant-based rental voucher assistance, can help frail elderly persons continue to live
independently in a cost efficient way and prevent premature or unnecessary institutionalization. Effective delivery
of supportive services is the critical element in a successful program. 

Supportive services for the frail elderly are coordinated by a PHA through a service coordinator and a professional
assessment committee (PAC). The PAC is competent to appraise the functional abilities of frail elderly persons with
respect to the performance of normal daily living activities. The service coordinator is skilled and trained in dealing
with the frail elderly, is a member of the PAC, and is responsible for assuring, through case management, that program
participants are linked to the supportive services they need to continue independent living. 

(i) A service coordinator's training, educational, and work experiences must meet the following minimum guidelines:


(A) A Bachelor of Social Work or degree in a related field such as gerontology, psychology or counseling is preferable;
a college degree is fully acceptable. However, individuals without a degree but with appropriate work experience
may be hired. A PHA may hire a person without a degree, with appropriate justification. 

(B) The service coordinator must be trained in the aging process, elder services, disability services, eligibility
for and procedures of federal and applicable State entitlement programs, legal liability issues relating to providing
service coordination, drug and alcohol use and abuse by the elderly, and mental health issues. This requirement is
not a prerequisite for hiring. However, training requirements, if not met at the point of hiring, must be satisfied
within one year. 

(C) Two years of experience in social services delivery with senior citizens or demonstrated working knowledge of
supportive services and other resources for senior citizens in the jurisdiction where the demonstration is located.


(D) Ability to advocate, problem-solve and provide results for the elderly served. 

(E) Demonstrated writing and organizational skills. 

(ii) A service coordinator performs the following functions: 

(A) Consults with frail elderly tenants, service providers, owners and other appropriate persons to identify the
particular needs and characteristics of frail elderly persons. 

(B) Builds professional relationships with agencies, service providers and volunteers in the community to secure
ongoing provision of supportive services and other necessary items for the program. Shops to determine the best value
in service pricing to assure individualized, flexible and creative services for the frail elderly. May set up a directory
of service providers. 

(C) Screens applicants for the HOPE for Elderly Independence Program, reviews any comments from applicants' physicians
and the adequacy of applicants' informal support network (i.e., family and friends available to the applicant to
assist in meeting daily living needs), conducts preliminary assessments of frailty, refers potentially eligible
applicants to the PAC. 

(D) Educates program participants on such issues as application procedures, service availability, and client rights
providing advocacy as appropriate. Assists participants in making their own choices, refers and links participants
to service providers. These are, for example, case management, personal assistance, homemaker assistance, meals-on-wheels,
transportation, counseling, occasional visiting nurses, preventive health screening and legal advocacy. 

(E) Helps build informal support networks with neighbors, friends and family, with the objective to provide only
those services necessary to maintain independence and to avoid dependence. If necessary, assists participants
with the decision to move to a higher level of care. 

(F) Ensures that the services included in participants' case plans are provided on a regular, ongoing and satisfactory
basis. Completes and maintains case files for the PAC including records of assessments, case plans, referrals, case
monitoring, and reassessments. Keeps the PAC and the service providers informed of the progress of participants.
Recommends reassessments as necessary. 

(G) Educates other PHA staff on issues related to aging 
in-place and services coordination to help them assist other frail elderly program participants.

of this NOFA. All technically adequate applications will be funded to the extent funds are available. If HUD receives
applications for funding greater than the amount made available under this NOFA, HUD will reduce the amount of funds
to be provided to each PHA in direct proportion to the funds available. 



II. Application Process 



Application Submission_Place and Time: Applications are due in the local HUD State or Area Office on August 5, 1994
by 3:00 p.m. local time. This application deadline is firm as to date and hour. HUD will not accept applications via
facsimile (fax) transmission. In the interest of fairness to all competing applicants, HUD will treat as ineligible
for consideration any application that is not received on or before the application deadline. Applicants should
take this practice into account and make early submission of their materials to avoid any risk of loss of eligibility
brought about by unanticipated delays or other delivery-related problems.

Each application for funding under this NOFA must contain the following items: 



(a) Request for Service Coordinator Funds




All applications must contain the following information stated in a letter from the Executive Director of the PHA
to the Director of the Public Housing Division in the local HUD State or Area Office (see sample letter format, Attachment
1): 

(1) The total number of HOPE for Elderly Independence Program participants. 

(2) The dollar amount of any PHA matching funds for supportive services costs under the HOPE for Elderly Independence
Program that is attributable to the costs of a service coordinator. If funds are received under this NOFA to pay service
coordinator costs that were formerly part of the PHA's required match, that dollar value match must be replaced with
payment for other additional supportive services costs. The PHA's application must identify any replacement supportive
services and their costs, and include firm written commitments from the service providers for at least the first year's
funding. 

(3) The annual salary proposed for the service coordinator, plus any fringe benefits and administrative costs (e.g.,
additional office equipment, supplies, car allowance, copying, training, etc.) for the first year, the amounts
needed for years two through five, and the total amount requested for the complete five year period. 

The service coordinator salary should be based on the following formula: 

(i) Determine the salary level, taking into consideration salaries for comparable jobs, modified by the hours worked.


(ii) Set the annual salary, including any fringe benefits that pertain to the job. 

(iii) List first year administrative costs. 

(iv) Set the total cost for year one: Annual salary, plus first year administrative costs, equals total cost for the
first year. 

(v) The estimates for years two through five (or less) may be based on an annual inflation factor of up to five percent.
Any one-time, first-year start-up costs should be subtracted from the year one administrative cost before calculating
the year two through five estimates. 



EXAMPLE
 






(4) Evidence that demonstrates salary comparability with similar positions in the local jurisdiction. 

(5) Whether the PHA will contract out for a service coordinator. 



(b) Required Certification Forms
 



The following certification forms are required to be submitted with the application and are attached to this NOFA:

(A) A pending civil rights suit against the PHA, referred by the Department's General Counsel and instituted by the
Department of Justice; 

(B) Outstanding HUD findings of PHA noncompliance with civil rights statutes, regulations and executive orders,
as a result of formal administrative proceedings, unless the PHA is implementing a HUD-approved tenant selection
and assignment plan and a voluntary compliance agreement designed to correct the areas of noncompliance; 

(C) A deferral of the processing of applications from the PHA imposed by HUD under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of
1964, the Attorney General's Guidelines (28 CFR 50.3) and the HUD Title VI regulations (24 CFR 1.8) and procedures
(HUD Handbook 8040.1), or under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and HUD implementing regulations (24
CFR 8.57); 

(D) A pending proceeding against the PHA based upon a Charge of Discrimination issued under the Fair Housing Act. A
Charge of discrimination is a Charge under Section 810(g)(2) of the Fair Housing Act, issued by the Department's General
Counsel or legally authorized designee. 

(E) There is an adjudication of a civil rights violation in a civil action brought against it by a private individual;
unless the PHA demonstrates that it is operating in compliance with a court order designed to correct the area(s) of
noncompliance. 

(ii) In the event that the validity of a civil rights certification is drawn into question the application is eligible
to be funded, but the PHA may not draw down funds until it has satisfied any outstanding civil rights issues. 



IV. Corrections to Deficient Applications



The HUD State or Area Office will screen all applications and notify applicants of technical deficiencies by letter.
Since the funds available under this NOFA are not being awarded on a competitive basis, a technical deficiency would
be a significant discrepancy in information supplied by the applicant and information available to HUD, or the omission
or the incomplete submission of any of the items required to be submitted in the application. These are listed in section
III. of this NOFA, Checklist of Application Submission Requirements, above. 

Applicants must submit corrections within 14 calendar days from the date of HUD's letter notifying the applicant
of any technical deficiency. Information received after 3:00 p.m., local time, on the fourteenth calendar day of
the correction period will not be accepted and the application will be rejected as being incomplete. 



V. Other Matters 



(a) Environmental Impact 



A Finding of No Significant Impact with respect to the environment has been made in accordance with the Department's
regulations at 24, CFR part 50, which implement section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969.
The Finding of No Significant Impact is available for public inspection between 7:30 a.m. and 5:30 p.m. weekdays in
the Office of the Rules Docket Clerk, Office of General Counsel, Department of Housing and Urban Development, room
10276, 451 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 20410. 



(b) Executive Order 12612, Federalism 



The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under section 6(a) of Executive Order 12612, Federalism, has determined
that the provisions of this NOFA do not have ``federalism implications'' within the meaning of the Order. The NOFA
makes funds available for PHAs to employ or otherwise retain the services of up to one service coordinator for a period
of up to five years in conjunction with the HOPE for Elderly Independence Program. As such, there are no direct implications
on the relationship between the national government and the states or on the distribution of power and responsibilities
among various levels of government. 



(c) Executive Order 12606, The Family 



The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under Executive Order 12606, 

The Family,

 has determined that the policies announced in this Notice would not have a significant impact on the formation, maintenance,
and general well-being of families except indirectly to the extent of the social and other benefits expected from
this program of assistance. 



(d) Documentation and Public Access Requirements: HUD Reform Act 





Public notice. 

HUD will include recipients that receive assistance pursuant to this NOFA in its quarterly 

Federal Register

 notice of recipients of all HUD assistance awarded on a competitive basis. (See 24 CFR 12.16(b), and the notice published
in the 

Federal Register

 on January 16, 1992 (57 FR 1942), for further information on these requirements.)

(e) Prohibition Against Lobbying Activities 


The use of funds awarded under this NOFA is subject to the disclosure requirements and prohibitions of section 319
of the Department of Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 1990 (31 U.S.C. 1352) (the ``Byrd
Amendment'') and the implementing regulations at 24 CFR part 87. These authorities prohibit recipients of Federal
contracts, grants, or loans from using appropriated funds for lobbying the Executive or Legislative Branches of
the Federal Government in connection with a specific contract, grant, or loan. The prohibition also covers the awarding
of contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, or loans unless the recipient has made an acceptable certification
regarding lobbying. Under 24 CFR part 87, applicants, recipients, and subrecipients of assistance exceeding $100,000
must certify that no Federal funds have been or will be spent on lobbying activities in connection with the assistance.
Indian Housing Authorities (IHAs) established by an Indian tribe as a result of the exercise of the tribe's sovereign
power are excluded from coverage of the Byrd Amendment, but IHAs established under State law are not excluded from
the statute's coverage. 



(f) Prohibition Against Lobbying of HUD Personnel



Section 13 of the Department of Housing and Urban Development Act contains two provisions dealing with efforts to
influence HUD's decisions with respect to financial assistance. The first imposes disclosure requirements on those
who are typically involved in these efforts_those who pay others to influence the award of assistance or the taking
of a management action by the Department 

and 

those who are paid to provide the influence. The second restricts the payment of fees to those who are paid to influence
the award of HUD assistance, if the fees are tied to the number of housing units received or are based on the amount of
assistance received, or if they are contingent upon the receipt of assistance. 



Section 13 was implemented by final rule published in the 

Federal Register

 on May 17, 1991 (56 FR 22912) as 24 CFR part 86. If readers are involved in any efforts to influence the Department in these
ways, they are urged to read the final rule, particularly the examples contained in Appendix A of the rule.
