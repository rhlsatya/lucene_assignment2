OFFICE OF GOVERNMENT ETHICS 











Addition of Paperwork Approval Numbers to and Updating and 
Correction of Citations in Certain Regulations of the Office of 
Government Ethics 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Office of Government Ethics (OGE). 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule; technical amendments. 






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Office of Government Ethics is adding the approval 
control numbers assigned by the Office of Management and Budget 
(OMB) under the Paperwork Reduction Act to various information 
collection requirements set forth in certain portions of its 
financial disclosure and outside employment regulations. In 
addition, OGE is updating a couple of authority citations and 
correcting a couple of citation errors in certain of its 
regulations. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Office of Government Ethics is 
amending two of its regulations, codified at 5 CFR parts 2634 and 
2636, to add reference to OMB paperwork approval control numbers 
for the various executive branch-wide information collections 
contained therein. The paperwork approval numbers for pertinent 
provisions of the financial disclosure regulation and related forms 
used to actually collect information are being added in 
parenthetical references to the appropriate sections of part 2634. 
These approval numbers cover reporting requirements for executive 
branch personnel (and certain members of the public) in part 2634 
and the Standard Form (SF) 278 Public Financial Disclosure Report, 
the OGE Form 201 used to seek access to SF 278s and certain other 
covered records under the Ethics in Government Act, the SF 450 
Confidential Financial Disclosure Report and the various model 
trust documents and certificates used in connection with qualified 
trusts. In addition, OGE is indicating the OMB paperwork approval 
number for the as-yet not effective confidential reporting 
provision for payments to charitable organizations in lieu of 
honoraria at  2636.205 of its outside employment regulation. 
Finally, OGE is updating the authority citations for 5 CFR parts 
2636 and 2641 and is correcting two errors in citations in 5 CFR 
2610.201(f) and 2641.101 of its regulations.

Administrative Procedure Act 



Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553 (b) and (d), as Director of the Office 
of Government Ethics, I find good cause exists for waiving the 
general notice of proposed rulemaking and 30-day delay in 
effectiveness as to these minor revisions. The notice and delayed 
effective date are being waived because these technical amendments 
and corrections to certain OGE regulations concern matters of 
agency organization, practice and procedure and because it is in 
the public interest that correct and up-to-date citations and 
information about paperwork approval numbers for the respective 
information collection requirements be contained in the regulations 
as soon as possible. 



Executive Order 12866 



In promulgating these technical amendments to its regulations, 
OGE has adhered to the regulatory philosophy and the applicable 
principles of regulation set forth in section 1 of Executive Order 
12866, Regulatory Planning and Review. These amendments and 
corrections have not been reviewed by the Office of Management and 
Budget under that Executive order, as they deal with agency 
organization, management and personnel matters and are not, in any 
event, deemed ``significant'' thereunder. 



Regulatory Flexibility Act 



As Director of the Office of Government Ethics, I certify 
under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 6) that this 
rulemaking will not have a significant economic impact on a 
substantial number of small entities. 



Paperwork Reduction Act 



The Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. chapter 35) does not 
apply because this technical amendments rulemaking does not itself 
contain any new information collection requirements that require 
the approval of the Office of Management and Budget (rather, as 
noted above, in pertinent part references to existing OMB paperwork 
control numbers are being added at appropriate places in OGE's 
regulations).

Commuted Traveltime Periods: Overtime Services Relating to Imports and Exports 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, USDA.

 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 We are amending the regulations concerning overtime services provided by employees of Veterinary Services by adding
a commmuted traveltime allowance for travel between two locations in Oregon. Commuted traveltime allowances are
the periods of time required for Veterinary Services employees to travel from their dispatch points and return there
from the places where they perform Sunday, holiday, or other overtime duty. The Government charges a fee for certain
overtime services provided by Veterinary Services employees and, under certain circumstances, the fee may include
the cost of commuted traveltime. This action is necessary to inform the public of commuted traveltime between these
locations.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Background 



The regulations in 9 CFR, chapter I, subchapter D, and 7 CFR, chapter III, require inspection, laboratory testing,
certification, or quarantine of certain animals, animal byproducts, plants, plant products, or other commodities
intended for importation into, or exportation from, the United States. When these services must be provided by an
employee of Veterinary Services (VS) on a Sunday or holiday, or at any other time outside the VS employee's regular
duty hours, the Government charges a fee for the services in accordance with 9 CFR part 97. Under circumstances described
in  97.1(a), this fee may include the cost of commuted traveltime. Section 97.2 contains administrative instructions
prescribing commuted traveltime allowances, which reflect, as nearly as practicable, the periods of time required
for VS employees to travel from their dispatch points and return there from the places where they perform Sunday, holiday,
or other overtime duty. 

We are amending  97.2 of the regulations by adding a commuted traveltime allowance for travel between two locations
in Oregon. The amendment is set forth in the rule portion of this document. This action is necessary to inform the public
of the commuted traveltime between the dispatch and service locations. 

We are also amending  97.2 to correct the spelling of Troutdale, OR. 


Effective Date 



The commuted traveltime allowances appropriate for employees performing services at ports of entry, and the features
of the reimbursement plan for recovering the cost of furnishing port of entry services, depend upon facts within the
knowledge of the Department of Agriculture. It does not appear that public participation in this rulemaking proceeding
would make additional relevant information available to the Department. 

Accordingly, pursuant to the administrative procedure provisions in 5 U.S.C. 553, we find upon good cause that prior
notice and other public procedure with respect to this rule are impracticable and unnecessary; we also find good cause
for making this rule effective less than 30 days after publication of this document in the 

Federal Register

. 



Executive Order 12866 and Regulatory Flexibility Act 



This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12866. For this action, the Office of Management and Budget
has waived its review process required by Executive Order 12866. 

The number of requests for overtime services of a VS employee at the locations affected by our rule represents an insignificant
portion of the total number of requests for these services in the United States. 
Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that
this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. 



Executive Order 12372 


This program/activity is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance under No. 10.025 and is subject to Executive
Order 12372, which requires intergovernmental consultation with State and local officials. (See 7 CFR part 3015,
subpart V.) 



Executive Order 12778 


This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This rule is intended to have
preemptive effect with respect to any State or local laws, regulations, or policies that conflict with its provisions
or that would otherwise impede its full implementation. This rule is not intended to have retroactive effect. There
are no administrative procedures that must be exhausted prior to any judicial challenge to the provisions of this
rule or the application of its provisions. 



Paperwork Reduction Act 


This rule contains no new information collection or recordkeeping requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act
of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501

 et seq

.). 



List of Subjects in 9 CFR Part 97

Airworthiness Directives; Airbus Model A320 Series Airplanes 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to 
certain Airbus Model A320 series airplanes, that requires either the removal of the girt 
bar visual indicator brackets on passenger exit doors, or modification of the lanyard 
connecting the survival kit to the slide/raft. This amendment is prompted by a report that, 
during an emergency evacuation demonstration, the lanyard became entangled on the girt 
bar indicator mechanism, and subsequently prevented an exit door from opening fully to a 
locked position. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent the lanyard from 
becoming entangled and interfering with proper opening of the exit door, a situation which 
could impede the successful evacuation of passengers through the door during an 
overwater operation where ditching is required. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal 
Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) to include an airworthiness directive (AD) that is 
applicable to certain Airbus Model A320 series airplanes was published as a supplemental 
notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) in the 

Federal Register

 on April 25, 1994 (59 FR 
19681). That action proposed to require either the removal of the girt bar visual indicator 
brackets on passenger exit doors, or modification of the lanyard that connects the survival 
kit to the slide/raft. 



Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making 
of this amendment. Due consideration has been given to the comments received. 

Two commenters support the proposal. 

One commenters requests that airplanes on which Airbus Industrie Modification 
23605 has been accomplished be excluded from the applicability of the rule. That 
modification is described in Airbus Service Bulletin A320-25-1109, dated April 20, 1993, 
and entails removing the girt bar visual indicator brackets (plates) and replacing them with 
a red arrow placard that is used to indicate positive girt bar engagement. (The commenter 
also states that all Model A320 series airplanes up to serial number 413 have been 
delivered with this modification.) The FAA concurs with the commenter's request. The 
FAA addressed Modification 23605 in the preamble to the supplemental NPRM, and 
found that, although removal of the brackets will prevent possible interference between 
the overwater survival kit lanyard and the slide/raft decorative cover, the red arrow 
placard did not provide for an acceptable means of girt bar position indication. However, 
since one of the options for complying with this AD [as provided by paragraph (a)(1)] is 
to remove the girt bar visual indicator brackets, the FAA now considers that airplanes on 
which Modification 23605 has been accomplished are in compliance with that paragraph 
of the rule because the brackets have been removed on those airplanes. (Whether or not 
the red arrow placard, installed as part of Modification 23605, is used to determine the 
engagement of the girt bar is of no consequence, since the girt bar position/arming 
indicator in the cockpit remains as a source to obtain positive indication of the position of 
the girt bar.) Accordingly, the applicability of the final rule has been revised to exclude 
airplanes on which Modification 23605 has been installed. 

After careful review of the available data, including the comments noted above, the 
FAA has determined that air safety and the public interest require the adoption of the rule 
with the change previously described. The FAA has determined that this change will 
neither increase the economic burden on any operator nor increase the scope of the AD. 

This is considered interim action. Airbus Industrie has advised the FAA that it is 
developing an alternative method of girt bar position indication for all Model A320 series 
airplanes that will not entail a design feature that would contribute to the addressed 
problem of lanyard entanglement. Once this modification is developed, approved, and 
available, the FAA may consider further rulemaking. 

The FAA estimates that 59 Model A320 airplanes of U.S. registry will be affected 
by this AD. 

Accomplishment of the removal of the girt bar visual indicator brackets will take 
approximately 1 work hour per airplane, at an average labor rate of $55 per work hour. 
Based on these figures, the total cost impact of this removal action on U.S. operators who 
elect to accomplish it is estimated to be $55 per airplane. 

The time necessary to accomplish the modification of the lanyard may vary from operator to operator, depending upon
the design submitted for approval by the FAA. However, the FAA estimates that a typical modification will require
an average of 2 work hours to accomplish, at an average labor rate of $55 per work hour. Based on these figures, the total
cost impact of this modification action on U.S. operators who elect to accomplish it is estimated to be $110 per airplane.

Based on the figures discussed above, the total cost impact of this AD on U.S. 
operators is estimated to be between $3,245 and $6,490. This total cost impact figure is 
based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the requirements of 
this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this 
AD were not adopted. 

The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the 
States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the 
distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. 
Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule 
does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism 
Assessment. 

For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant 
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT 
Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) will not 
have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small 
entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been 
prepared for this action and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be 
obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption

Modification of Class E Airspace; Arcata Municipal Airport, Arcata, CA



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This action modifies Class E airspace at Arcata, CA. An Instrument Landing System/Distance Measuring Equipment
(ILS/DME) standard instrument approach procedure (SIAP) has been developed for the Arcata Municipal Airport. Controlled
airspace extending from 700 feet above the surface is needed for aircraft executing the approach. The effect of this
proposal is to provide adequate Class E airspace for instrument flight rules (IFR) operations at Arcata Municipal
Airport.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
History




On April 15, 1994, the FAA proposed to amend part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to establish
Class E airspace at Arcata, CA. (59 FR 23034). An Instrument Landing System/Distance Measuring Equipment (ILS/DME)
standard instrument approach procedure (SIAP) has been developed for the Arcata Municipal Airport. Controlled
airspace extending from 700 feet above the surface is needed for aircraft executing the approach.

Interested parties were invited to participate in this rulemaking proceedings by submitting written comments on
the proposal to the FAA. No objections were received concerning this proposal.

The coordinates in the proposal are based on North American Datum 83. Class E airspace designations are published
in Paragraph 6005 of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated
by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993).

The Class E airspace designations listed in this document will be published subsequently in this Order.



The Rule



This amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations establishes Class E airspace at Arcata, CA, to modify
controlled airspace from 700 to 1200 feet AGL at the Arcata Municipal Airport at Arcata, CA.

The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which
frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore, (1) is not a ``significant
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies
and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as
the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and
air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

Establishment and Modification of Class E Airspace; Lompoc Municipal Airport, Lompoc, CA



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This action modifies Class E airspace at Lompoc, CA. Controlled airspace extending from the surface and a transition
area from 700 feet above the surface is needed for aircraft executing the approach. The effect of this proposal is to
provide adequate Class E airspace for instrument flight rules (IFR) operations at Lompoc Municipal Airport.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 




History



On May 4, 1994, the FAA proposed to amend part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to establish and
modify Class E airspace at Lompoc, CA. (59 FR 23034). Controlled airspace extending from the surface and a 700 foot
transition area is needed for aircraft executing the approach.

Interested parties were invited to participate in this rulemaking proceedings by submitting written comments on
the proposal to the FAA. No objections were received concerning this proposal.

The coordinates in the proposal are based on North American Datum 83. Class E airspace designations are published
in Paragraph 6002 and Paragraph 6005 of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which
is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993).

The Class E airspace designations listed in this document will be published subsequently in this Order.



The Rule



This amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations establishes Class E airspace extending from the surface
at Lompoc, CA, and modifies controlled airspace from 700 to 1200 feet AGL at the Lompoc Municipal Airport at Lompoc,
CA.

The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which
frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore, (1) is not a ``significant
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies
and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as
the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and
air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

Insurance Requirements, the Exchange Visitor Program





<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

United States Information Agency.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Interim final rule with request for comments.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Agency issued a final rule on March 19, 1993 which included a requirement that all exchange visitors and their spouses
and dependents on J visas have insurance to cover themselves for sickness and accidents, effective September 1, 1994.
In response to concerns raised by the public, the Agency is amending the types of insurance allowed under the Exchange
Visitor Program regulations.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Since implementing the final rule on March 19, 1993 (58 FR 15180), USIA has been requested to amend the insurance requirement
set forth in 22 CFR 514.14(c). The main concern has been with the requirement that policies be underwritten by an insurance
corporation having an A.M. Best rating of ``A^'' or above, an Insurance Solvency International, Ltd. (ISI) rating
of ``A^i'' or above, a Standard & Poor's Claims-paying Ability rating of ``A^'' or above, a Weiss Research, Inc.
rating of B+ or above, or such other rating as the Agency may from time to time specify. A rating is not presently required
when the insurance coverage is backed by the full faith and credit of the government of the exchange visitor's home
country or when the sponsor is allowed to self-insure or to accept full financial responsibility.


A number of the Agency's constituents have expressed the view that  514.14(c) is too restrictive and that compliance
could end longstanding and reliable insurance relationships. A number of major insurance plans and almost all health
maintenance organizations reportedly do not meet the current regulations. The Agency has been informed that the
net effect on exchange visitors and family members could be to actually reduce in some cases the quality of the health
care they have been receiving.
Approximately 800 of the 1,200 designated sponsors are colleges and universities, many of which provide health insurance
for their students and faculty. Other sponsors include major corporations, government agencies, non-profit organizations,
and research institutions, many of which also offer insurance for their employees who are exchange visitors. A number
of sponsors expressed concern that the current regulations disqualify reliable insurance policies, plans, and
contracts that they provide to their exchange visitors. In response to sponsors' comments, the Agency is amending
the regulations to broaden the types of insurance permitted under  514.14(c). The Agency is proposing two additional
ways to satisfy  514.14(c).
The first is to qualify a policy, plan, or contract which is part of a health benefits program offered on a group basis
to employees or enrolled students by a designated sponsor. Here, the sponsor is in a position to consult with insurance
professionals, rating services, insurance commissioners, legal counsel, and other experts before determining
which coverage to offer to its employees and enrolled students.
The second is to qualify a policy, plan, or contract which is underwritten by a federally qualified health maintenance
organization (HMO) or an eligible competitive medical plan (CMP) as determined by the Health Care Financing Administration.
While these HMO's and CMP's often are not rated by insurance rating services, they are monitored for fiscal soundness
on a regular basis by the federal government, in addition to being regulated by one or more states.

22 CFR 514.14 sets forth only minimum insurance requirements, so exchange visitors and their families are encouraged
to be educated consumers and consult with insurance professionals, rating services, and insurance regulators before
determining their insurance coverage.



Comment



The Agency invites comments from the public on this interim final rule. The Agency is under no legal requirement to
invite comments. The designation of exchange visitor sponsors and the administration of the Exchange Visitor Program
are deemed to be foreign affairs functions of the United States Government. The Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C.
553(a)(1)(1989) specifically exempts such functions from the rulemaking requirements of the Act.

The Agency will accept comments for 30 days after publication of this interim final rule. A final rule will be published
thereafter to respond to comments received and to promulgate changes, if any, as part of the Exchange Visitor Program
regulations, 22 CFR Part 514. In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Agency certifies that this rule does not have
a significant adverse economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This rule is not considered to be
a major rule within the meaning of section 1(b) of E.O. 12291, nor does it have federalism implications warranting
the preparation of a Federalism Assessment in accordance with Executive Order 12612.
