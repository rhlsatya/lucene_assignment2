ACTION:

 Notice of proposed rulemaking. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Department of Energy (DOE) proposes to amend its regulations by adding a new Part to contain procedural regulations
governing proceedings before the Office of Hearings and Appeals (OHA), a quasi-judicial branch of the DOE, pertaining
to matters within the jurisdiction of that Office. These proposed rules have been organized into a new part 1003 within
chapter X of title 10 of the Code of Federal Regulations. They streamline and distill the procedures governing the
conduct of proceedings before the OHA and update pertinent filing information. They will be utilized by OHA in cases
that do not involve the former Federal petroleum price and allocation control regulations.

<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 




I. Introduction and Proposal 

II. Procedural Requirements 

III. Opportunity For Public Comment 



I. Introduction and Proposal 



The Office of Hearings and Appeals (OHA) is a quasi-judicial body reporting to the Secretary of Energy. It is generally
responsible for conducting informal adjudicative proceedings of DOE where there is provision for separation of
functions, other than those which are subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. In
connection with these duties, OHA holds hearings, receives evidence, develops the record, and issues final agency
determinations, which are subject to review in the Federal courts. Except for regulations governing proceedings
before the Board of Contract Appeals and other transaction appeals boards in DOE, which are components of the Office
of Hearings and Appeals, procedural regulations governing OHA practice generally appear in part 205 of title 10 of
the Code of Federal Regulations. Part 205 is a part of chapter II, Subchapter A of the DOE regulations, and are designed
to apply to matters involving the former oil price and allocation control regulations which were in effect during
the period 1973 through 1981. Because those oil-related proceedings are winding down, and the OHA is conducting a
variety of other informal adjudications for the Department, it has become apparent that the OHA procedural regulations
should appear in chapter X of title 10, which contains the general provisions of DOE regulations. The rules will be
organized into a new part 1003 within chapter X. At the same time, procedures governing the conduct of proceedings
before the OHA have been streamlined, and pertinent filing information has been updated. 

Apart from general filing procedures, the regulations proposed today set forth OHA procedures for adjudicating
various applications, petitions, motions and related requests filed by the public. These regulations include procedures
for the filing of: 

(1) Applications for Exception from DOE orders, regulations and rulings; 

(2) Appeals of DOE orders; 

(3) Applications for Stay of DOE orders; 

(4) Motions for Modification or Rescission of OHA orders; 

(5) Requests for Conferences and Hearings before OHA; and 

(6) Petitions for Special Redress or Other Relief. 

These rules are not intended to grant by themselves any new authority to the Office of Hearings and Appeals to conduct
informal adjudications. They are designed to provide standard procedural rules that may be used to cover a variety
of situations that may be encountered by the many different programs that the Department implements. There are two
ways these regulations become effective. First, the procedures outlined in these rules become effective where program
rules specifically reference them and state that a member of the public can make a request for relief under these rules.
For example, the program regulations that the Department promulgated in the Energy Conservation Program for Consumer
Products states that any person receiving an order may file an appeal with the Office of Hearings and Appeals utilizing
that office's appellate rules. See 10 CFR 430.27(n). Similarly, in implementing the Payments-Equal-to-Taxes provisions
of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, the Department stated that an entity may file an appeal with the Office of Hearings
and Appeals of a DOE payment equal to taxes (PETT) determination utilizing the OHA's 10 CFR part 205, subpart H appellate
rules. See Payments-Equal-To-Taxes Provisions of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, as Amended, Interpretation
and Procedures, as published in the 

Federal Register

 on August 27, 1991 (56 FR 42314). 

Second, these rules may be effective where a statute requires the Department to provide procedures that permit the
public to seek redress, and the appropriate departmental official has delegated the responsibility to implement
that requirement to the Office of Hearings and Appeals. For example, section 504 of the Department of Energy Organization
Act requires the Secretary to provide for the making of adjustments to any rule, regulation or order issued under four
statutes_the Emergency Petroleum Allocation Act of 1973 (since expired), the Federal Energy Administration Act,
the Energy Supply and Environmental Coordination Act of 1974, and the Energy Policy and Conservation Act_as may be
necessary to prevent serious financial hardship, inequity, or unfair distribution of burdens. The Secretary has
delegated that responsibility to the Office of Hearings and Appeals, which promulgated rules by which members of
the public could seek an exception to rules, regulations or orders issued under the four named statutes.

Despite the establishment of standard procedures in these rules, there may be situations where the Office of Hearings
and Appeals needs to use procedures specific to the particular needs of a program. In those situations, DOE program
regulations themselves contain procedures governing OHA proceedings conducted under authority of those particular
regulations, rather than a reference to OHA procedural rules. For example, the DOE Contractor Employee Protection
Program contains procedural rules governing OHA proceedings in 10 CFR part 708. Similarly, the Department has proposed
procedural rules governing OHA proceedings for determining eligibility for access to classified matter as a part
of 10 CFR part 710. Under these circumstances, the rules in the program rules would govern OHA proceedings in those
matters, and the rules in part 1003 would not apply. 
With the exception of the regulations governing the filing and adjudication of an Application for Exception, explained
below, the proposed rules correspond to nearly identical procedural rules contained in 10 CFR part 205, which were
promulgated in the 1970's to adjudicate matters relating to the federal oil regulations. Part 205 will continue to
be used only to adjudicate matters which relate specifically to the federal oil regulations. The new part 1003, proposed
today, shall be utilized for adjudicating all other matters under OHA's jurisdiction. For instance, the DOE will
modify  430.27(n) of 10 CFR part 430 (DOE Energy Conservation Program for Consumer Products) to provide that
an aggrieved person filing an appeal under that part shall proceed under subpart C of the new part 1003. The DOE will
also issue a conforming amendment to the interpretation and procedures implementing the Payments-Equal-to-Taxes
provisions of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, as amended, to change the reference to the appellate procedures
that are available. Future rulemakings which invoke OHA's adjudicatory authority will refer to the rules contained
in part 1003 as the operative administrative process. 
Regulations concerning the filing and adjudication of an Application for Exception have been revised and are contained
in 10 CFR part 1003, subpart B. Generally, an Application for Exception may be filed by a person seeking an exception
from or an adjustment to a DOE regulatory requirement, where such relief is authorized by the pertinent regulations
or underlying statute concerned. Similar to the regulations appearing in 10 CFR part 205, subpart D, the proposed
rules provide that an aggrieved person may file an Application for Exception from a DOE regulation on the basis that
the specific regulatory requirement results in a serious hardship, gross inequity or unfair distribution of burdens.
The proposed rules set forth in part 1003, subpart B, present a simpler procedure than part 205, subpart D, by (1) eliminating
the issuance of a Proposed Decision and Order and related procedures prior to issuance of a final Decision and Order,
and (2) providing for an administrative appeal of the final Decision and Order by an aggrieved party directly to OHA,
except in exception proceedings brought under section 504 of the DOE Act which will continue to be appealable to the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. The proposed rules make the adjudication of Applications for Exception more
effective since they are more practicable than the more complex procedures of part 205, subpart D, which were formulated
in contemplation of the federal oil regulations. 


II. Procedural Requirements 


Executive Order 12866 


Today's regulatory action has been determined not to be a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order
12866, ``Regulatory Planning and Review'' (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993). Accordingly, today's action was not subject
to review under the Executive Order by the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs. 


Executive Order 12778 


Section 2 of Executive Order 12778 instructs each agency to adhere to certain requirements in promulgating new regulations
and reviewing existing regulations. These requirements, set forth in section 2(a) and (b)(2), include eliminating
drafting errors and needless ambiguity, drafting regulations to minimize litigation, providing clear and certain
legal standards for affected legal conduct, and promoting simplification and burden reduction. Agencies are also
instructed to make every reasonable effort that the rulemaking notice defines key terms, specifies the effect on
existing law, and describes any administrative proceeding to be available prior to judicial review and any provisions
for the exhaustion of administrative remedies. DOE certifies that these proposed rules meet the requirements of
section 2(a) and (b)(2) of Executive Order 12778. 


Executive Order 12612 


Executive Order 12612 requires that regulations or rules be reviewed for direct effects on States, on the relationship
between the national government and the States, or in the distribution of power among various levels of government.
If there are sufficient substantial direct effects, then Executive Order 12612 requires preparation of a federalism
assessment to be used in all decisions involved in promulgating or implementing a regulation or rule.

Today's regulations do not affect any traditional State function. There are therefore no substantial direct effects
requiring evaluation or assessment under Executive Order 12612. 


Regulatory Flexibility Act Certification 


These regulations were reviewed under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 

et seq.,

 which requires preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis for any regulations that will have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities, i.e., small businesses, small government jurisdictions.
The proposed regulatory amendment updates and gives greater flexibility to previously existing procedural regulations.
DOE therefore certifies that the proposed rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities, and the preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis is not warranted. 


Paperwork Reduction Act 


No additional information and recordkeeping requirements are imposed by this rule (44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq.

). 


National Environmental Policy Act 


The proposed rules are strictly procedural in nature. Preparation of an environmental assessment or environmental
impact statement under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4321 

et seq.

) is not required for such rules under Appendix A to subpart D of 10 CFR part 1021.

III. Opportunity for Public Comment 


Interested persons are invited to submit written views or arguments regarding the proposed amendment set forth in
this notice. Seven copies of these comments should be submitted to Marcia B. Carlson, Chief, Docket and Publications
Branch, Office of Hearings and Appeals, at the address shown in the beginning of this notice. The envelope and document
submitted should be identified with the designation ``Office of Hearings and Appeals Procedural Regulations.''
Comments may also be sent via electronic mail to an Office of Hearings and Appeals internet mail address, which is:
OHA@HQ.DOE.GOV. All comments received on or before the date specified in the beginning of this notice will be carefully
assessed and fully considered prior to publication of the proposed amendment as a final rule. All comments will be
available for public inspection and copying in the Office of Hearings and Appeals Public Reference Room, Room 1E-234,
telephone number (202) 586-8001, between 1:00 and 5:00 p.m., Monday through Friday. 
Any person submitting information which that person believes to be confidential and which may be exempt by law from
public disclosure should submit seven complete copies, as well as two copies from which the information claimed to
be confidential has been deleted. DOE reserves the right to determine confidential status of the information or data
and to treat it according to its determination. This procedure is set forth in 10 CFR 205.9, which will be superseded
by the proposed 1004.10. 
The Department has concluded that this proposed rule does not involve a substantial issue of fact or law and that the
proposed rule is unlikely to have a substantial impact on the Nation's economy or large numbers of individuals or businesses.
Therefore, pursuant to section 501(c) (42 U.S.C. 7191(c)) of the DOE Organization Act (Pub. L. 95-91; 42 U.S.C.
7101 

et seq.

), the Department does not plan to hold a public hearing on this proposed rule.

Subpart A_General Provisions 


 1003.1

 Purpose and scope. 


This part establishes the procedures to be utilized and identifies the sanctions that are available in proceedings
before the Office of Hearings and Appeals of the Department of Energy. These procedures provide standard rules of
practice in a variety of informal adjudications when jurisdiction is vested in the Office of Hearings and Appeals.
The procedures contained in this part may generally be incorporated by reference in proceedings established by rule,
regulation or by specific designation, under statutory authority of the Department of Energy, which invoke the adjudicatory
authority of the Office of Hearings and Appeals. e.g., 10 CFR part 430 (DOE Energy Conservation Program for Consumer
Products). These rules do not apply in instances in which DOE regulations themselves contain procedures governing
OHA proceedings conducted under authority of those particular regulations. e.g., 10 CFR part 708 (DOE Contractor
Employee Protection Program).

 means a written directive or verbal communication of a written directive, if promptly confirmed in writing, issued
by the DOE. For purposes of this definition a written directive shall include telegrams, telefax, telecopies and
similar transcriptions. This definition does not include internal DOE orders and directives issued by the Secretary
of Energy or delegate in the management and administration of departmental elements and functions. 


Person

 means any individual, firm, estate, trust, sole proprietorship, partnership, association, company, joint-venture,

in any proceeding described in this part on his own behalf or by a duly authorized representative. Any application,
appeal, petition, or request filed by a duly authorized representative shall contain a statement by such person certifying
that he is a duly authorized representative. Falsification of such certification will subject such person to the
sanctions stated in 18 U.S.C. 1001. 
(b) Suspension and disqualification. The OHA may deny, temporarily or permanently, the privilege of participating
in proceedings, including oral presentation, to any individual who is found by the OHA_
(1) To have made false or misleading statements, either verbally or in writing;

regulations or by an order of the OHA, the day of the act, event, or default from which the designated period of time begins
to run is not to be included. The last day of the period so computed is to be included unless it is a Saturday, Sunday, or
Federal legal holiday, in which event the period runs until the end of the next day that is neither a Saturday, Sunday,
nor a Federal legal holiday. 

(2) Saturdays, Sundays or intervening Federal legal holidays shall be excluded from the computation of time when
the period of time allowed or prescribed is 7 days or less. 

(b) 

Hours.

 If the period of time prescribed in an order issued by the OHA is stated in hours rather than days, the period of time shall
begin to run upon actual notice of such order, whether by verbal or written communication, to the person directly affected,
and shall run without interruption, unless otherwise provided in the order, or unless the order is stayed, modified,
suspended or rescinded. When a written order is transmitted by verbal communication, the written order shall be served
as soon thereafter as is feasible. 

(c) 

Additional time after service by mail.

 Whenever a person is required to perform an act, to cease and desist therefrom, or to initiate a proceeding under this
part within a prescribed period of time after issuance to such person of an order, notice or other document and the order,
notice or other document is served solely by mail, 3 days shall be added to the prescribed period. 



 1003.6

 Extension of time. 



When a document is required to be filed within a prescribed time, an extension of time to file may be granted by the OHA
upon good cause shown. 



 1003.7

 Service. 



(a) All documents required to be served under this part shall be served personally or by first class United States mail,
except as otherwise provided. 

(b) Service upon a person's duly authorized representative shall constitute service upon that person.

(a) In accordance with the provisions of this section and as otherwise authorized by law, the Director may sign, issue
and serve subpoenas; administer oaths and affirmations; take sworn testimony; compel attendance of and sequester
witnesses; control dissemination of any record of testimony taken pursuant to this section; subpoena and reproduce
books, papers, correspondence, memoranda, contracts, agreements, or other relevant records or tangible evidence
including, but not limited to, information retained in computerized or other automated systems in possession of
the subpoenaed person. 

(b) The Director may issue a Special Report Order requiring any person subject to the jurisdiction of the OHA to file
a special report providing information relating to OHA regulations, including but not limited to written answers
to specific questions. The SRO may be in addition to any other reports required. 

(c) The Director, for good cause shown, may extend the time prescribed for compliance with the subpoena or SRO and negotiate
and approve the terms of satisfactory compliance. 

(d) Prior to the time specified for compliance, but in no event more than 10 days after the date of service of the subpoena
or SRO, the person upon whom the document was served may file a request for review of the subpoena or SRO with the Director.
The Director then shall provide notice of receipt to the person requesting review, may extend the time prescribed
for compliance with the subpoena or SRO, and negotiate and approve the terms of satisfactory compliance. 

(e) If the subpoena or SRO is not modified or rescinded within 10 days of the date of the Director's notice of receipt:


(1) The subpoena or SRO shall be effective as issued; and 

(2) The person upon whom the document was served shall comply with the subpoena or SRO within 20 days of the date of the
Director's notice of receipt, unless otherwise notified in writing by the Director. 

(f) There is no administrative appeal of a subpoena or SRO. 

(g) A subpoena or SRO shall be served upon a person named in the document by delivering a copy of the document to the person

(2) Leaving it at the person's office with the person in charge of the office; 

(3) Leaving it at the person's dwelling or usual place of abode with a person of suitable age and discretion who resides
there; 

(4) Mailing it to the person by certified mail, at his last known address; or 

(5) Any method that provides the person with actual notice prior to the return date of the document. 

(i) Delivery of a copy of the document to a person who is not a natural person may be made by: 

(1) Handing it to a registered agent of the person; 

(2) Handing it to any officer, director, or agent in charge of any office of such person; 

(3) Mailing it to the last known address of any registered agent, officer, director, or agent in charge of any office
of the person by registered or certified mail; or 

(4) Any method that provides any registered agent, officer, director, or agent in charge of any office of the person

(j) A witness subpoenaed by the OHA may be paid the same fees and mileage as paid to a witness in the district courts of
the United States. 

(k) If in the course of a proceeding a subpoena is issued at the request of a person other than an officer or agency of the
United States, the witness fees and mileage shall be paid by the person who requested the subpoena. However, at the
request of the person, the witness fees and mileage may be paid by the OHA if the person shows: 

(1) The presence of the subpoenaed witness will materially advance the proceeding; and 

(2) the person who requested that the subpoena be issued would suffer a serious hardship if required to pay the witness
fees and mileage. 

(l) If any person upon whom a subpoena or SRO is served pursuant to this section, refuses or fails to comply with any provision
of the subpoena or SRO, an action may be commenced in the appropriate United States District Court to enforce the subpoena
or SRO. 

(m) Documents produced in response to a subpoena shall be accompanied by the sworn certification, under penalty of
perjury, of the person to whom the subpoena was directed or his authorized agent that: 

(1) A diligent search has been made for each document responsive to the subpoena; and 

(2) To the best of his knowledge, information, and belief each document responsive to the subpoena is being produced.


(n) Any information furnished in response to an SRO shall be accompanied by the sworn certification under penalty
of perjury of the person to whom it was directed or his authorized agent who actually provides the information that:


(1) A diligent effort has been made to provide all information required by the SRO; and 

(2) All information furnished is true, complete, and correct. 

(3) If any document responsive to a subpoena is not produced or any information required by an SRO is not furnished,
the certification shall include a statement setting forth every reason for failing to comply with the subpoena or
SRO. 

(o) If a person to whom a subpoena or SRO is directed withholds any document or information because of a claim of attorney-client

representative. (A false certification is unlawful under the provisions of 18 U.S.C. 1001). The signature by the
person or duly authorized representative constitutes a certificate by the signer that the signer has read the document
and that to the best of the signer's knowledge, information and belief formed after reasonable inquiry, the document
is well grounded in fact, warranted under existing law, and submitted in good faith and not for any improper purpose
such as to harass or to cause unnecessary delay. If a document is signed in violation of this section, OHA may impose
the sanctions specified in  1003.3 and other sanctions determined to be appropriate. 

(c) 

Labeling.

 An application, petition, or other request for action by the OHA should be clearly labeled according to the nature
of the action involved both on the document and on the outside of the envelope in which the document is transmitted.


(d) 

Obligation to supply information.

 A person who files an application, petition, appeal or other request for action is under a continuing obligation during
the proceeding to provide the OHA with any new or newly discovered information that is relevant to that proceeding.
Such information includes, but is not limited to, information regarding any other application, petition, appeal
or request for action that is subsequently filed by that person with any DOE office. 

(e) 

The same or related matters.

 A person who files an application, petition, appeal or other request for action by the OHA shall state whether, to the
best knowledge of that person, the same or related issue, act or transaction has been or presently is being considered
or investigated by any other DOE office, other Federal agency, department or instrumentality; or by a state or municipal
agency or court; or by any law enforcement agency, including, but not limited to, a consideration or investigation
in connection with any proceeding described in this part. In addition, the person shall state whether contact has
been made by the person or one acting on his behalf with any person who is employed by the DOE with regard to the same issue,
act or transaction or a related issue, act or transaction arising out of the same factual situation; the name of the

document in its entirety. 



(2) The OHA retains the right to make its own determination with regard to any claim of confidentiality, under criteria
specified in 10 CFR 1004.11. Notice of the decision by the OHA to deny such claim, in whole or in part, and an opportunity
to respond shall be given to a person claiming confidentiality of information no less than five days prior to its public
disclosure.

person and shall notify each such person that the OHA will receive and endeavor to consider, subject to time constraints
imposed by the urgency of the proceeding, written comments on the application that are submitted immediately. 

(b) Any person submitting written comments to the OHA with respect to an application filed under this subpart shall
send a copy of the comments, or a copy from which confidential information has been deleted in accordance with  1003.9(f),
to the applicant. The person shall certify to the OHA that it has complied with the requirements of this paragraph.
The OHA may notify other persons participating in the proceeding of such comments and provide an opportunity for such

(c) The OHA shall require the applicant to take reasonable measures depending on the circumstances and urgency of
the case to notify each person readily identified as one that will be directly aggrieved by the OHA action sought of
the date, time and place of any hearing or other proceedings in the matter. However, if the Director of the OHA or his
designee concludes that the circumstances presented by the applicant justify immediate action, the OHA may issue

affected parties.

and accept submissions from third persons relevant to an application provided that the applicant is afforded an opportunity
to respond to all third person submissions. In evaluating an application, the OHA may also consider any other source
of information, and may conduct hearings or conferences either in response to requests by parties in the proceeding
or on its own initiative. 

(2) If the OHA determines that there is insufficient information upon which to base a decision and if upon request additional
information is not submitted by the applicant, the OHA may dismiss the application without prejudice. If the failure
to supply additional information is repeated or willful, the OHA may dismiss the application with prejudice. 

(3) The OHA shall process applications for stay as expeditiously as possible. When administratively feasible, the
OHA shall grant or deny an Application for Stay within 10 business days after receipt of the application. 

(4) Notwithstanding any other provision of the DOE regulations, the OHA may make a decision on any Application for
Stay prior to the receipt of written comments. 

(b) The criteria to be considered and weighed by the OHA in determining whether a stay should be granted are: 

(1) Whether a showing has been made that an irreparable injury will result in the event that the stay is denied; 

(2) Whether a showing has been made that a denial of the stay will result in a more immediate hardship or inequity to the
applicant than to the other persons affected by the proceeding; 

(3) Whether a showing has been made that it would be desirable for public policy reasons to grant immediate relief pending
a decision on the merits of the underlying proceedings; 

(4) Whether a showing has been made that it is impossible for the applicant to fulfill the requirements of an outstanding
order or regulatory provision; and 

(5) Whether a showing has been made that there is a strong likelihood of success on the merits.

or conference in which an official transcript is maintained or in a separate written Decision and Order. Any such order
shall include a statement of the relevant facts and the legal basis of the decision. The approval or denial of a stay
is not an order of the OHA that is subject to administrative or judicial review. 
(b) In its discretion and upon a determination that it would be desirable to do so in order to further the objectives
stated in the regulations or in the statutes the DOE is responsible for administering, the OHA may order a stay on its
own initiative.

names and addresses of all affected persons (if reasonably ascertainable); a complete statement of the business
or other reasons that justify the act or transaction; a description of the acts or transactions that would be affected
by the requested action; and a full description of the pertinent provisions and relevant facts contained in any relevant
documents. Copies of all contracts, agreements, leases, instruments, and other documents relevant to the application
shall be submitted to the OHA upon its request. A copy of the order of which modification or rescission is sought shall
be included with the application. When the application pertains to only one step of a larger integrated transaction,

 OHA evaluation. 


(a)(1) The OHA may initiate an investigation of any statement in an application and utilize in its evaluation any relevant
facts obtained by such investigation. The OHA may solicit and accept submissions from third persons relevant to any
application for modification or rescission provided that the applicant is afforded an opportunity to respond to
all third person submissions. In evaluating an application for modification or rescission, the OHA may convene a
conference, on its own initiative, if, in its discretion, it considers that such conference will advance its evaluation
of the application. 
(2) If the OHA determines that there is insufficient information upon which to base a decision and if upon request the
necessary additional information is not submitted, the OHA may dismiss the application without prejudice. If the
failure to supply additional information is repeated or willful, the OHA may dismiss the application with prejudice.
If the applicant fails to provide the notice required by  1003.53, the OHA may dismiss the application without
prejudice. 
(b)(1) An application for modification or rescission of an order shall be processed only if_
(i) The application demonstrates that it is based on significantly changed circumstances; and 
(ii) The period within which a person may file an appeal has lapsed or, if an appeal has been filed, a final order has been
issued. 
(2) For purposes of this subpart, the term ``significantly changed circumstances'' shall mean_
(i) The discovery of material facts that were not known or could not have been known at the time of the proceeding and
action upon which the application is based. 
(ii) The discovery of a law, regulation, interpretation, ruling, order or decision on appeal or exception that was
in effect at the time of the proceeding upon which the application is based and which, if such had been made known to the
OHA, would have been relevant to the proceeding and would have substantially altered the outcome; or 
(iii) There has been a substantial change in the facts or circumstances upon which an outstanding and continuing order
of the OHA affecting the applicant was issued, which change has occurred during the interval between issuance of such
order and the date of the application and was caused by forces or circumstances beyond the control of the applicant.

 Decision and order. 


(a) Upon consideration of the application and other relevant information received or obtained during the proceeding,
the OHA shall issue an order granting or denying the application.

order shall state that it is a final order of which the applicant may seek judicial review. 
(c) The OHA shall serve a copy of the order upon the applicant, any other person who participated in the proceeding and
upon any other person readily identifiable by the OHA as one who is aggrieved by such order. 


Subpart F_Conferences and Hearings 


 1003.60

 Purpose and scope. 


This subpart establishes the procedures for requesting and conducting an OHA conference or hearing. Such proceedings
shall be convened in the discretion of the OHA, consistent with OHA requirements. 


 1003.61

 Conferences. 


(a) The OHA in its discretion may direct that a conference be convened, on its own initiative or upon request by a person,
when it appears that such conference will materially advance the proceeding. The determination as to who may attend
a conference convened under this subpart shall be in the discretion of the OHA, but a conference will usually not be
open to the public. 
(b) A conference may be requested in connection with any proceeding of the OHA by any person who might be aggrieved by
that proceeding. The request may be made in writing or verbally, but must include a specific showing as to why such conference
will materially advance the proceeding. The request shall be addressed to the OHA, as provided in  1003.11.

(c) A conference may only be convened after actual notice of the time, place and nature of the conference is provided
to the person who requested the conference. 
(d) When a conference is convened in accordance with this section, each person may present views as to the issues involved.
Documentary evidence may be presented at the conference, but will be treated as if submitted in the regular course
of the proceeding. A transcript of the conference will not usually be prepared. However, the OHA in its discretion
may have a verbatim transcript prepared. 
(e) Because a conference is solely for the exchange of views incident to a proceeding, there will be no formal reports
or findings unless the OHA in its discretion determines that such would be advisable. 


 1003.62

 Hearings. 


(a) The OHA in its discretion may direct that a hearing be convened on its own initiative or upon request by a person,
when it appears that such hearing will materially advance the proceeding. The determination as to who may attend a
hearing convened under this subpart shall be in the discretion of OHA, but a hearing will usually be open to the public.

(b) A hearing may be requested by an applicant, appellant, or any other person who might be aggrieved by the OHA action
sought. The request shall be in writing and shall include a specific showing as to why such hearing will materially
advance the proceeding. The request shall be addressed to the OHA at the address provided in  1003.11. 
(c) The OHA will designate an agency official to conduct the hearing, and will specify the time and place for the hearing.

(d) A hearing may only be convened after actual notice of the time, place, and nature of the hearing is provided both
to the applicant or appellant and to any other person readily identifiable by the OHA as one who will be aggrieved by
the OHA action involved. The notice shall include, as appropriate: 

(1) A statement that such person may participate in the hearing; or 

(2) A statement that such person may request a separate conference or hearing regarding the application or appeal.


(e) When a hearing is convened in accordance with this section, each person may present views as to the issue or issues
involved. Documentary evidence may be presented at the hearing, but will be treated as if submitted in the regular
course of the proceeding. A transcript of the hearing will usually be prepared. 

(f) If material factual issues remain in dispute after an application or appeal has been filed, the Director of the
OHA or his designee may issue an order convening an evidentiary hearing in which witnesses shall testify under oath,
subject to cross-examination, for the record and in the presence of a Presiding Officer. A Motion for Evidentiary
Hearing should specify the type of witness or witnesses whose testimony is sought, the scope of questioning that is
anticipated, and the relevance of the questioning to the proceeding. A motion may be summarily denied for lack of sufficient
specificity, because it would place an undue burden on another person or the DOE or because it will cause undue delay.


(g) A Motion for Evidentiary Hearing must be served on any person from whom information is sought. Any person who wishes
to respond to a Motion for Evidentiary Hearing must do so within ten days of service. 

(h) In reaching a decision with respect to a request for a hearing or motion filed under this subpart, the OHA shall consider
all relevant information in the record. If an order is issued granting a hearing or evidentiary hearing, in whole or
in part, the order shall specify the parties, any limitations on the participation of a party, and the issues to be considered.
An order of the OHA issued under this section is an interlocutory order which is subject to further administrative
review or appeal only upon issuance of a final Decision and Order in the proceeding concerned. 

(i) All hearings convened pursuant to this subpart shall be conducted by the Director of the OHA or his designee. At
any hearing, the parties shall have the opportunity to present material evidence that directly relates to a particular
issue set forth for hearing. The Presiding Officer may administer oaths or affirmations, rule on objections to the
presentation of evidence, receive relevant material, require the advance submission of documents offered as evidence,
dispose of procedural requests, determine the format of the hearing, modify any order granting a Motion for Evidentiary
Hearing, direct that written motions, documents or briefs be filed with respect to issues raised during the course
of the hearing, ask questions of witnesses, issue subpoenas, direct that documentary evidence be served upon other
parties (under protective order if such evidence is deemed confidential) and otherwise regulate the conduct of the
hearing. 



Subpart G_Private Grievances and Redress 



 1003.70

Purpose and scope. 



The OHA shall receive and consider petitions that seek special redress, relief or other extraordinary assistance

persons to respond. 



 1003.75

or transaction that is the subject of the petition and to the OHA action sought. Such facts shall include, but not be
limited to, the names and addresses of all affected persons (if reasonably ascertainable); a complete statement
of the business or other reasons that justify the act or transaction, if applicable; a description of the act or transaction,
if applicable; a description of the acts or transactions that would be affected by the requested action; a full discussion
of the pertinent provisions and relevant facts contained in the documents submitted with the petition, and an explanation

(a) (1) The OHA may initiate an investigation of any statement in a petition and utilize in its evaluation any relevant
facts obtained by such investigation. The OHA may solicit and accept submissions from third persons relevant to any

Type Certificates for Surplus Aircraft of the Armed Forces



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Proposed rulemaking, reopening of comment period.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This notice announces the reopening of the comment period for the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) No. 94-12,
Type Certificates for Surplus Aircraft of the Armed Forces. The reopening of the comment period responds to requests
by some members of Congress and several companies in the aircraft industry for additional time for the public to comment
on the proposal. Because of the unanticipated public interest in the proposed rule change, the FAA has decided to provide
the public additional time to develop and submit comments responsive to the NPRM.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Comments Invited


Interested persons are invited to submit such written data, views, or arguments as they may desire concerning NPRM
94-12. Comments relating to the environmental, energy, federalism, or economic impact that might result from
adopting the proposals in this notice are also invited. Substantive comments should be accompanied by cost estimates.
Comments should identify the regulatory docket or notice number and should be submitted in triplicate to the Rules
Docket address specified above. All comments received on or before the closing date for comments specified will be
considered by the Administrator before taking further rulemaking action. The proposals contained in this notice
may be changed in light of comments received. All comments received, both before and after the closing date for comments,
will be available in the Rules Docket for examination by interested persons. Anyone wishing the FAA to acknowledge
receipt of their comments submitted in response to this proposed rule, must submit a self-addressed stamped postcard
with their comments on which the following statement is made: ``Comments to Docket 27699.'' The postcard will be date
stamped and mailed to the commenter.



Availability of NPRM


Any person may obtain a copy of this notice and Notice 94-12 by submitting a request to the Federal Aviation Administration,
Office of Public Affairs, Attention: Public Inquiry Center (APA-200), 800 Independence Avenue SW., Washington,
DC 20591, or by calling (202) 267-3484. Communications must identify the appropriate notice numbers.
Persons interested in being placed on the mailing list for future NPRM's should request from the above office, a copy
of Advisory Circular No. 11-2A, Notice of Proposed Rulemaking Distribution System, which describes the application
procedure.


Background


On April 21, 1994, the FAA issued Notice 94-12, entitled ``Type Certificates for Surplus Aircraft of the Armed
Forces'' (59 FR 19114, April 21, 1994) proposing changes that would remove the regulations for issuing type certificates
for surplus aircraft of the Armed Forces. The purpose of the proposed removal is to eliminate references to obsolete
airworthiness standards that are no longer appropriate for type certification of surplus airworthiness standards
that are no longer appropriate for type certification of surplus military aircraft. Surplus aircraft of the Armed
Forces may still be certificate in normal, utility, acrobatic, commuter, transport, and restricted categories
when compliance with the applicable regulations is shown. This proposal, if a adopted as final, would become effective
on April 21, 1994, and is intended to provide a greater level of assurance that the appropriate airworthiness standards
are met before standard airworthiness certificates are issued for surplus military aircraft.
Several telephone and written requests received between June 13 and 14, 1994, asked that the comment period be extended
for up to 60 days. In view of these comments and the unanticipated level of public interest in the proposed rule change,
the comment period for this notice needs to be reopened to accommodate the requests. Copies of the written requests
are available in the docket.


Conclusion


The FAA has determined that the reopening of the comment period will allow several companies in the aircraft industry
additional time for a more thorough review of applicable issues and questions raised by the NPRM, and the drafting
of responsive comments. Accordingly, the FAA finds that it is in the public interest to reopen the comment period until
August 26, 1994.

On March 15, 1994, the Commission solicited comments on proposed amendments to the net capital rule relating to capital
charges for listed options and related positions.
 In the release, the Commission also solicited comments on the applicability of the proposed theoretical pricing
haircut methodology to assess the market risk for over-the-counter (``OTC'') options. The Commission requested
that comments be received on or before May 16, 1994. 




The Commission already has received several letters commenting on the release. Broker-dealers, however, have requested
from the staff of the Division of Market Regulation an extension of the comment period. Specifically, industry members
have requested additional time to respond to the Commission's request for comments relating to the net capital treatment
of OTC options.




II. Discussion



The Commission appreciates the complexity of the issues addressed by the Commission's proposed amendments to the
net capital rule, particularly with respect to OTC options. Therefore, in order to receive additional serious and
well-reasoned responses from the industry participants, the Commission is extending the comment period for all
commenters to September 16, 1994.

Nevertheless, the Commission is eager to address these important issues in a timely fashion. Accordingly, the Commission
staff will continue to develop rulemaking in this area while it is awaiting further responses from the industry. 



III. Conclusion



The comment period for responding to Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33761 is extended until September 16, 1994.




Dated: June 29, 1994.



By the Commission.

Proposed rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

In accordance with Section 1176 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1994, Pub. L. 103-160,
the Department of the Army is proposing to amend the regulations governing eligibility for interment in Arlington
National Cemetery to include former prisoners of war (POWs).



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The Department of the Army is proposing changes to 32 CFR Part 553 in accordance with section 1176 of the National Defense
Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1994, Pub. L. 103-160. That Section extended eligibility for interment in
Arlington National Cemetery to any former prisoner of war who, while a prisoner of war, served honorably in the active
military, naval, or air service and who dies on or after the date of enactment of the 1994 Authorization Act (November
30, 1993).




This proposed rule governs eligibility for interment in Arlington National Cemetery, an Army national cemetery
which is under the jurisdiction of the Department of the Army. Because the proposed rule pertains to a military function
of the Department of the Army, the provisions of Executive Order 12866 do not apply. It is hereby certified that this
proposed rule will not have a significant impact on small business or governments in the area.



Lists of Subjects in 32 CFR Part 553





Cemeteries, National Cemeteries.




For the reasons set out in the preamble, 32 CFR Part 553 is proposed to be amended as follows:



PART 553_ARMY NATIONAL CEMETERIES

Permits for Structures Located Within Shipping Safety Fairways



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, DoD.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Advance notice of proposed rulemaking.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Corps seeks comments on a tentative proposal to change its rules regarding permits for the placement of temporary
anchors, cables and chains for floating or semisubmersible drilling rigs within shipping safety fairways. Shipping
safety fairways and anchorages are established on the Outer Continental Shelf by the U.S. Coast Guard to provide unobstructed
approaches for vessels using U.S. ports. This initiative arises as a result of requests by offshore oil companies
for exemptions to the provisions of the rule because drilling and production technologies have greatly extended
the range of deepwater drilling and the limits placed on temporary structures allowed within fairway boundaries
may no longer be reasonable.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Department of the Army permits are required for the construction of any structure in or over any navigable water of
the United States pursuant to Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899 (30 Stat. 1151; 33 U.S.C. 403). This authority
was extended to artificial islands and fixed structures located on the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) by Section 4(f)
of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act of 1953 (67 Stat. 463; 43 U.S.C. 1333(f)).




Background



Pursuant to the cited authorities, the Corps promulgated regulations in 33 CFR 209.135 establishing shipping safety
fairways in the Gulf of Mexico to provide obstruction-free routes for vessels in approaches to United States ports.
The Corps provided these obstruction-free routes by denying permits for structures within certain designated lanes.
In 1978, the Ports and Waterways Safety Act (PWSA), was amended to delegate authority to the Department of Transportation
and the Commandant, U.S. Coast Guard to establish vessel routing measures, including fairways and fairway anchorages.
In accordance with the PWSA, the Coast Guard completed the required studies and published final rules establishing
shipping safety fairways on May 13, 1982. The Corps subsequently revoked its fairway regulations in  209.135(d)
but retained paragraph (b), which contained the conditions under which the nationwide permit for oil exploration
and production structures on the OCS (33 CFR 330.5(a)(8)), was issued. On November 13, 1986, the fairway regulations
were repromulgated in 33 CFR 322.5(l) to consolidate all permit regulations for structures in the same part.

When the regulations allowing temporary structures within fairways were promulgated by the Corps in 1981, deepwater
drilling occurred in water depths of 300 to 600 feet. At that time, the limitation of 120 days that temporary anchors
would be allowed within fairways was considered reasonable. If the exploratory well was successful, a conventional
fixed production platform would be used and there would be no further need to maintain the anchors within the fairway.
According to offshore hydrocarbon exploration and production companies, the existing technology has extended
the range of deepwater drilling to water depths of 1,000 to 4,000 feet. As a result, drilling times have increased and
production methods have changed. Today, the limitation on the length of time (120 days), that an anchor is allowed
within a fairway is no longer appropriate, particularly in water depths in excess of 600 feet. The industry has available
many different types of production platforms, including floating production systems that are anchored in place
during the productive life of the reserves and then moved to a new location. In water depths greater than 600 feet, the
floating production platform becomes an important production option and in water depths greater than 1,000 feet
these units are essential. In many instances, the only obstacle to using this type of system to drill and produce hydocarbons
is the location of a fairway. Current regulations require that the production system be placed a great distance from
the fairway in order to keep the anchors clear of the fairway. The result is that there are many hydrocarbon bearing
lease areas that cannot be effectively penetrated and produced. It should be noted that if one of the following proposals
is adopted, the requirement that the rig must be situated as necessary to insure that the minimum clearance over an
anchor line within a fairway is 125 feet, will not be changed, unless we find that an individual permit is required and
the minimum clearance over an anchor line would be determined on a case-by-case basis.

Another option that we are exploring is to revise the nationwide permit 

#

8 to eliminate the authorization for all anchors and cables and chains associated with oil and gas drilling and production
in water depths greater than 600 feet within fairways. This would result in the requirement that the activities occurring
in water depths greater than 600 feet would be subject to the Corps individual permit procedures. The nationwide permit
in 33 CFR 330 would continue to apply to those activities in waters less than 600 feet in depth, without any changes to
the regulations.
The following is the text in 33 CFR 322.5(l)(1) 

(Existing):



(l) * * * (1) Shipping safety fairways and anchorage areas. 

DA permits are required for structures located within shipping safety fairways and anchorage areas established
by the U.S. Coast Guard. (1) The Department of the Army will grant no permits for the erection of structures in areas
designated as fairways, except that district engineers may permit temporary anchors and attendant cables or chains
for floating or semisubmersible drilling rigs to be placed within a fairway provided the following conditions are
met:
(i) The installation of anchors to stabilize semisubmersible drilling rigs within fairways must be temporary and
shall be allowed to remain only 120 days. This period may be extended by the district engineer provided reasonable
cause for such extension can be shown and the extension is otherwise justified.
(ii) Drilling rigs must be at least 500 feet from any fairway boundary or whatever distance necessary to insure that
minimum clearance over an anchor line within a fairway will be 125 feet.
(iii) No anchor buoys or floats or related rigging will be allowed on the surface of the water or to a depth of 125 feet
from the surface, within the fairway.
(iv) Drilling rigs may not be placed closer than 2 nautical miles of any other drilling rig situated along a fairway
boundary, and not closer than 3 nautical miles to any drilling rig located on the opposite side of the fairway.
(v) The permittee must notify the district engineer, Bureau of Land Management, Mineral Management Service, U.S.
Coast Guard, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the U.S. Navy Hydrographic Office of the approximate
dates (commencement and completion) the anchors will be in place to insure maximum notification to mariners.
(vi) Navigation aids or danger markings must be installed as required by the U.S. Coast Guard.

<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 



Background





Castilleja levisecta

 (golden paintbrush), a perennial herb in the snapdragon family, once occurred from the Willamette Valley in Oregon
north to Vancouver Island in British Columbia, Canada. Only ten disjunct populations of this plant now exist, in open
grasslands ranging from south of Olympia, Thurston County, Washington; north through the Puget Trough to southwest
British Columbia, Canada. Threats to the species include competition with encroaching native and alien plant species,
habitat modification through succession in the absence of fire, predation, and stochastic (random) events, such
as catastrophic fire. Commercial and residential development also threaten this species. The plant occurs on Federal,
State, and privately owned land.

On May 10, 1994, the Service published a proposed rule in the 

Federal Register

 to list 

Castilleja levisecta

 as a threatened species (59 FR 24106). The rule initiated a public comment period which closes on July 11, 1994. In order
that the best information be available before making a final determination on the proposed listing of this plant species,
the Service now extends the comment period for a period of 30 days until August 11, 1994.

<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

I. Background 



The Fair Housing Act (Title VIII of the Civil Right Act of 1968, as amended by the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988,
42 U.S.C. 3601-19) exempts ``housing for older persons'' from the prohibitions against discrimination because
of familial status. The purpose of the prohibition against discrimination on the basis of familial status and the
``housing for older persons'' exemption is to protect families with children from discrimination in housing without
unfairly limiting housing choices for elderly persons (see 134 Cong. Rec. S 19722 (Aug. 1, 1988) statement of Senator
Karnes). 

On January 23, 1989 (54 FR 3232), HUD published a final rule implementing the Fair Housing Act. This rule included regulations
governing housing for older persons. The ``housing for older persons'' regulations implement, among other things,
section 807(b)(2)(C) of the Fair Housing Act, which exempts housing intended and operated for occupancy by at least
one person 55 years of age or older per unit that satisfies certain criteria. These regulations are codified in 24 CFR
part 100, subpart E. In drafting the housing for older persons regulations, HUD took into consideration the public
comments that addressed the issue of what constitutes ``significant facilities and services specifically designed
to meet the physical or social needs of older persons.'' 

Congress mandated that, in determining whether housing qualifies as housing for persons 55 years of age or older,
the Secretary develop regulations which require at least the following factors: 

(1) The existence of significant facilities and services specifically designed to meet the physical or social needs
of older persons, or if the provision of such facilities is not practicable, that such housing is necessary to provide
important housing opportunities for older persons; and 

(2) That at least 80 percent of the units are occupied by at least one person 55 years of age or older per unit; and 

(3) The publication of, and adherence to, policies and procedures which demonstrate an intent by the owner or manager
to provide housing for persons 55 years of age or older. 



II. Overview of Proposed Rule 



Section 919 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 (Pub. L. 102-550, approved October 28, 1992
(the 1992 Act)), requires the Secretary of HUD to issue rules further defining what are ``significant facilities
and services especially designed to meet the physical or social needs of older persons'' required under section 807(b)(2)
of the Fair Housing Act to meet the definition of the term ``housing for older persons.''

1

 This proposed rule would implement the rulemaking required by section 919 of the 1992 Act. Specifically, this proposed
rule would revise the ``55 or over'' housing regulation, codified at 24 CFR 100.304.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940707-1-00030 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940707-1-00011 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

This proposed rule would expound upon the significant facilities and services requirements governing ``55 or over
housing'' currently set forth in  100.304(b)(1). A new  100.305 would be added and would address the requirements
for ``facilities and services specifically designed to meet the physical or social needs of older persons.'' A new
 100.306 would be added and would address the requirement that such facilities and services be ``significant.''
In addition to adding these two new sections, the substance of existing  100.304(b)(2) would be located in the
new  100.310. Existing subsections   100.304(c)(1) and 100.304(d) and 100.304(e) would provide
the substance of new  100.315, and existing  100.304(c)(2) would be redesignated as new  100.316.



In developing this proposed regulation, the Department desires to provide as much certainty as possible regarding
the determination that housing qualifies as housing for older persons. It has sought to structure the regulation
to allow both housing providers and protected classes alike to ascertain with confidence whether a community qualifies
under the Fair Housing Act. 

However, it is the Department's view that a single, precise, mathematical-like standard that fully implements the
Act is not possible, nor may it be equitable. 

As a result, the Department has concluded that a flexible standard is necessary in order to reflect regional variations
in services and facilities that distinguish housing for older persons from other similar housing, as well variations
determined by the geography of the site or by the differences in the nature or cost of the housing in question. To do otherwise
could unnecessarily restrict housing opportunities for older persons by holding all housing to a single arbitrary
standard that was not intended by the framers of the Act. 

Services common to older persons in one region of the country are often not commonly provided or expected in another
where weather, for example, or terrain make them unnecessary or undesirable. Similarly, facilities expected as
the norm at large, single family older community developments may not be expected at small, mobile home parks with
limited acreage, or at large, multi-story, multi-family condominium complexes. And services or facilities common
or needed in urban communities near transportation may differ substantially from those appropriate to rural locations.


In addition, the Department recognizes that housing for older persons is not limited to the affluent. Therefore,
the Department is concerned lest a single standard that offers certainty would not be sufficiently flexible to accommodate
housing for low and moderate income older persons. 

In structuring the proposed rule which follows, the Department has sought to identify as many as possible of the factors
and considerations which are germane to capture the differences required by housing for older persons, thus making
it possible for wide varieties of communities to qualify who meet the statutory requirements of the Act. In addition,
through the publication of the appendix and the illustrative examples it contains, the Department has sought to provide
further guidance to assist in the application of the regulation. 

However, the Department specifically requests detailed comment on how the proposed standards can be modified to
provide greater certainty and precision while still providing the flexibility necessary to accommodate the other
factors essential to carry out the Act. To allow for this, the Department has extended the comment period to 90 days
and will provide for a public hearing process, described elsewhere in the preamble, to receive public comments. 

As is the case with other exemptions to civil rights statutes and other exemptions under the Fair Housing Act (the Act),
the exemption to the Act's requirements provided by the ``housing for older persons'' exemption will be interpreted
narrowly. A narrow construction of this exemption is intended to give full force and effect to the protection against
familial status discrimination afforded by the Act. 

The burden of demonstrating that the ``older persons'' exemption applies rests on the party asserting the exemption.
Part of that party's burden in establishing qualification for the exemption requires affirmatively demonstrating
through credible and objective evidence that the requirements for the exemption exist as of the date of an alleged
violation of the Act or at any time that the exemption is asserted as a basis for allowing a practice that would otherwise
be prohibited as discriminatory on the basis of familial status. 

The Department believes that the Fair Housing Act imposes a strict burden upon a person claiming the exemption to provide
credible and objective evidence showing that the facilities and services offered by the housing provider were designed,
constructed or adapted to meet the particularized needs of older persons. In order to be considered as sufficient
to qualify a housing facility for the exemption, the evidence must show that the housing in question is clearly distinguished
from the bulk of other housing (except for other older persons' housing) in a particular area, by the existence of those
facilities and services which set the housing facility apart as housing intended for and operated as housing for older
persons. Absent such evidence, the familial status prohibitions of the Act will apply. 

There is no indication in the Act or in its legislative history that Congress intended that only the most expensive
housing with the most expansive and expensive facilities and services, should qualify for the exemption. Housing
in all affordable categories may offer the types of facilities and services for older persons which make that housing
unique for the class of persons who can afford that housing. This determination is made by contrasting the housing
being offered as housing for older persons to comparable housing not claiming the exemption and evaluating the significance
of the facilities and services being offered to meet the requirements of the exemption (See  100.306(c)(l);
Comparable housing is of similar type, size and cost of lease or purchase.)

Proposed Amendments



New  100.305_Specifically Designed Facilities and Services



New  100.305 proposes to set forth the criteria by which a facility or service will be determined to be ``specifically
designed to meet the physical or social needs of older persons.'' 



New  100.306_Significant Facilities and Services. 



New  100.306 proposes to set forth the criteria by which facilities or services that meet the requirements of
 100.305 (i.e., specifically designed facilities and services) will be determined to be ``significant.''
The factors listed in new  100.306 are intended to measure the relative importance of the facilities and services
so that their significance can be determined. New  100.306 would approach the ``significance'' determination
as an aggregate one_that is, a determination with respect 
to all facilities and services as a whole, rather than a determination with respect to each facility and service individually.




New  100.310_Impracticability 



Existing  100.304(b)(2), which would be redesignated as new  100.310, would be revised by adding the
following language as the introductory text to the current provisions contained in paragraph (b)(2): 

The provisions regarding familial status in this part shall not apply to housing intended and operated for occupancy
by at least one person 55 years of age or older per unit, provided that the person or entity affirmatively demonstrates
through credible and objective evidence that the housing satisfies the requirements of   100.305, 100.306,
100.315 and 100.316 or 100.310, 100.315 and 100.316. Housing satisfies the requirements of section 100.310 if * * *



New  100.315_80% Occupancy



Existing   100.304(c)(1), 100.304(d) and 100.304(e) would be combined as new  100.315, and the
following language would be added to the new  100.315: 

The provisions regarding familial status in this part shall not apply to housing intended and operated for occupancy
by at least one person 55 years of age or older per unit, provided that the person or entity affirmatively demonstrates
through credible and objective evidence that the housing satisfies the requirements of   100.305, 100.306,
100.315 and 100.316 or 100.310, 100.315 and 100.316. Housing satisfies the requirements of this section 100.315
if * * *



New  100.316 _Intent To Provide Housing for Older Persons 



Existing  100.304(c)(2), which would be redesignated as new  100.316, would be revised by adding the
following language as the introductory text to new  100.316: 

The provisions regarding familial status in this part shall not apply to housing intended and operated for occupancy
by at least one person 55 years of age or older per unit, provided that the person or entity affirmatively demonstrates
through credible and objective evidence that the housing satisfies the requirements of   100.305, 100.306,
100.315 and 100.316 or 100.310, 100.315 and 100.316. Housing satisfies the requirements of section 100.316 if * * *




III. Appendix



HUD is also proposing to publish an Appendix to the proposed rule. This Appendix is intended to provide members of the
public with detailed guidance interpreting the provisions of the Fair Housing Act that pertain to the exemption for
``housing for older persons'' (55 or over housing). The Department believes that supplementing the regulatory language
with interpretive guidance in the Appendix is the best way to comply with the Congressional mandate to further define
the term ``significant facilities and services specifically designed to meet the physical or social needs of older
persons.'' 

The Department intends for the Appendix to serve as guidance for housing providers and others in determining whether
housing qualifies for the ``housing for older persons'' exemption (55 or over housing). The Appendix illustrates
the application of the factors that the Department will consider in making its determination. The Department will
refer to the interpretive guidance in the Appendix when considering whether there is reasonable cause to believe
that a discriminatory practice has occurred or is about to occur. It should be clearly understood, however, that the
illustrative examples provided in this Appendix are not dispositive of any actual case; i.e., a bare claim by a housing
provider that the operation of a particular housing development duplicates the fact pattern of any example presented
in this Appendix will not preclude the Department from conducting an investigation under the Fair Housing Act of an
alleged discriminatory housing practice directed against an aggrieved person with familial status; nor will it
preclude the Secretary from issuing a determination based upon the evidence obtained through such an investigation.


The Department will apply the criteria for ``specifically designed'' and ``significant'' facilities and services
on a case-by-case basis, and a determination will be based upon the totality of the factual circumstances examined.


The Department may revise or supplement the Appendix from time to time in order to incorporate additional guidance,
fact patterns, and relevant Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) and court decisions that reflect future developments
in administrative and case law. This will be accomplished through the publication of formal notices in the 

Federal Register

IV. Other Matters



Environmental Impact



A Finding of No Significant Impact with respect to the environment has been made in accordance with HUD regulations
at 24 CFR part 50, which implements section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA). This
Finding of No Significant Impact is available for public inspection between 7:30 a.m. and 5:30 p.m. weekdays in the
Office of the Rules Docket Clerk, Office of the General Counsel, Department of Housing and Urban Development Room
10276, 451 Seventh Street, SW, Washington, DC 20410.



Executive Order 12866



This rule was reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under Executive Order 12866 on Regulatory Planning
and Review, issued by the President on September 30, 1993. Any changes made in this rule as a result of that review are
clearly identified in the docket file, which is available for public inspection in the office of the Department's
Rules Docket Clerk, Room 10276, 451 Seventh Street, SW, Washington, DC.



Impact on Small Entities



The Secretary, in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), has reviewed this proposed rule
before publication and, by approving it, certifies that the proposed rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial
number of small entities. The proposed rule would implement section 919 of the Housing and Community Development
Act of 1992, which requires the Secretary of HUD to further define the term ``significant facilities and services
specifically designed to meet the physical or social needs of older persons.'' The Department anticipates that the
proposed rule will have an impact on some small housing providers. However, the number of small housing providers
affected is not considered to be so great as to constitute a significant economic impact on a substantial number of
small entities. 



Executive Order 12612, Federalism



The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under section 6(a) of Executive Order 12612, 

Federalism,

 has determined that this proposed rule would not have substantial, direct effects on States, on their political subdivisions,
or on their relationship with the Federal government, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among
the various levels of government. The Fair Housing Act, and section 919 of the Housing and Community Development Act
of 1992 direct HUD to provide further guidance on the meaning significant facilities and services so that States,
local governments, and housing providers will have a better understanding of what housing is exempt from the Fair
Housing Act's prohibition against discrimination on the basis of familial status. 



Regulatory Agenda



This proposed rule was listed as sequence 1662 in the Department's Semiannual Regulatory Agenda, published on April
25, 1994 (59 FR 20424, 20464) under Executive Order 12866 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act. 



List of Subjects in 24 CFR Part 100 



Aged, Fair housing, Individuals with disabilities, Mortgages, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements. 




Accordingly, 24 CFR part 100 would be amended as follows: 



PART 100_DISCRIMINATORY CONDUCT UNDER THE FAIR HOUSING ACT 



1. The authority citation for part 100 would be revised to read as follows: 






Authority:

 42 U.S.C. 3535(d) and 3600-3620. 




2. In subpart E,  100.304 would be revised, new   100.305, 100.306, 100.310, 100.315 and 100.316
would be added, and an appendix to subpart E would be added to read as follows:

Subpart E_Housing for Older Persons 



 100.304 

55 or over housing. 



(a) The provisions regarding familial status in this part shall not apply to housing intended and operated for occupancy
by at least one person 55 years of age or older per unit, provided that, at the time of an alleged violation of the Act or
at any time that the exemption is asserted as a basis for allowing a practice that would otherwise be prohibited as discriminatory
on the basis of familial status, the housing satisfies the requirements of: 

(1)   100.305, 100.306, 100.315 and 100.316; or 

(2)   100.310, 100.315 and 100.316. 

(b) With reference to complaints filed pursuant to the Act, this means that the person or entity claiming the exemption
must affirmatively demonstrate through credible and objective evidence as of the date of the alleged violation of
the Act or at any time that the exemption is asserted as a basis for allowing a practice that would otherwise be prohibited
as discriminatory on the basis of familial status that the housing meets the requirements of paragraph (a) of this
section. 

(c) For purposes of   100.305, 100.306, 100.310, 100.315 and 100.316 of this subpart, ``older persons''
means persons 55 years of age or older. For purposes of   100.305 and 100.306, ``housing provider'' means:


(1) The owner or manager of a housing facility; or 

(2) The owner or manager of the common and public use areas of a housing facility, where the dwelling units are individually
owned. 



 100.305 

Specifically designed facilities and services. 



(a) The provisions regarding familial status in this part shall not apply to housing intended and operated for occupancy
by at least one person 55 years of age or older per unit, provided that the person or entity asserting the exemption affirmatively
demonstrates through credible and objective evidence that the housing has facilities and services specifically
designed to meet the physical or social needs of older persons. In order to satisfy this paragraph, there must be more
than one facility and more than one service specifically designed to meet the physical or social needs of older persons.
Both facilities and services specifically designed to meet the physical or social needs of older persons must exist
as of the date of an alleged violation of the Act or at any time that the exemption is asserted as a basis for allowing a
practice that would otherwise be prohibited as discriminatory on the basis of familial status. 

(b)(1) In determining that a facility or service is ``specifically designed to meet the physical or social needs of
older persons,'' the Department will first consider whether the facility or service is readily accessible to and
usable by older persons with mobility, visual and hearing impairments. 

(i) If the housing is a covered multifamily dwelling as defined in 24 CFR 100.201 constructed for first occupancy and
use after March 13, 1991, in order for a facility to satisfy  100.305(b)(1) it must meet the requirements of  100.205.
In order for a service to satisfy  100.305(b)(1), the Department will consider whether older persons with mobility,
visual and hearing impairments occupying units can readily access and use the service and the extent to which the service
is designed to meet the mobility, visual and hearing impairments of an aging population. 

(ii) If the housing is not a covered multifamily dwelling as defined in 24 CFR 100.201 constructed for first occupancy
after March 13, 1991, in order for a facility or service to satisfy  100.305(b)(1), the Department will consider
whether older persons with mobility, visual and hearing impairments occupying units can readily access and use the
facility or service, and the extent to which the facility or service is designed to meet the mobility, visual and hearing
impairments of an aging population. However, if the facility meets the Fair Housing Accessibility Guidelines for
new construction (24 CFR Ch. 1, Subch. A, App. II), the facility will satisfy the requirements of this paragraph (b).


(2) If the requirements of paragraph (b)(1) of this section are met, the Department will consider such factors as the
following as relevant in determining whether a facility or service is ``specifical
