<DOCTITLE>Submission of Information Collection to OMB (Under Paperwork Reduction Act and 5 CFR Part 1320) </DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Rural Development Administration, USDA. 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The proposed information collection requirements described below have been submitted to the Office of Management
and Budget (OMB) for expedited clearance under 5 CFR 1320.18. The Agency is soliciting public comments on the subject
submission. This action is necessary in order for the Agency to promulgate a new regulation to administer the Rural
Technology Development Grants (RTDG) program as required by legislation. Fiscal year (FY) 1994 appropriation contained
$1.5 million for the RTDG program. Implementation of this regulation is required to administer FY 1994 grants before
the end of the FY, since appropriated funds cannot be carried forward. It is essential that ample time be given for applicants
to complete the application process. Failure to implement this program and award FY 1994 grants will result in a negative
impact in the rural areas. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 This Notice informs the public that the Rural Development Administration (RDA), USDA, has submitted to OMB, for expedited
processing, this proposal for collection of information for clearance as required by the Paperwork Reduction Act
(44 U.S.C. Chapter 35). It is requested that OMB approve this submission within 10 days. 






Authority:

 Section 3507 of the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3507. 



Supporting Statement

Farmers Home Administration (FmHA) State Office. 


7 CFR 4284 Subpart F contains the specific eligibility requirements, the application procedures, the evaluation
process RDA uses to make selection decisions, and the servicing requirements. Grants are competitive and 
will be awarded based on specific selection criteria required by legislation. Project selection will be given to
those projects that contribute the most to the improvement of economic conditions of rural areas. The information
submitted should provide an accurate picture of the economic conditions of the rural areas to be served. 
 

2. How, by whom, and for what purpose the information is to be used_The various forms and narrative requirements contained
within this regulation are collected from applicants who are public bodies or nonprofit institutions. This information
is used for determining such factors as: (1) eligibility; (2) the specific purposes for which grant funds will be utilized;
(3) timeframes or dates by which funds will be used; (4) who will be carrying out the purposes for which the grant is made;
(5) project priority; (6) applicant's experience in administering a rural economic development program; (7) employment
and economic development improvement; and (8) geographic location of the area/business(s) to be served. This information
is collected in the process of developing the full application and will be gathered in the FmHA State Offices. 


Grant selection priority points and general project evaluation will be provided for applications based on the economic
conditions, project proposal, applicant experience, as well as commitments by other funding sources. 


If the information is not collected, FmHA will not be able to determine: (a) the eligibility of the applicant/projects;
(b) whether applicable laws and regulations are complied with; and (c) the feasibility of the project. 


A summary of the reporting burden to be cleared with this request is described as follows:

Evidence of Fidelity Bond Coverage



Fidelity bonds are required for an amount equal to the greatest amount of funds on hand by a grantee. This is to ensure
that if funds are somehow lost, stolen, misappropriated, etc., that the actual loss to the grantee will be mitigated
and that purposes of the grant will continue.



Project Performance Report



Applicants are required to submit project performance reports in accordance with 7 CFR parts 3015 and 3016. These
reports are necessary to monitor the appropriate use of grant funds. The project performance report shall include,
but need not be limited to:

1. A comparison of actual accomplishments to the objectives established for that period;

2. Reasons why established objectives were not met;

3. Problems, delays, or adverse conditions which will materially affect attainment of planned project objectives,
prevent the meeting of time schedules or objectives, or preclude the attainment of project work elements during established
time periods. This disclosure shall be accompanied by a statement of the action taken, or contemplated, to resolve
the situation;

4. Objectives established for the next reporting period;

5. Why available information cannot be used or modified._Status of compliance with any special conditions on the
use of grant funds.



Audit Report



Audit reports will be required in accordance with 7 CFR 3015 and 3016 to determine that grant funds have been utilized
for approved purposes.



AD-1049, Certification Regarding Drug-Free Workplace Requirements (Grants) Alternative I_for Grantees
Other Than Individuals



AD-1049 will be executed by the applicant no later than grant closing to certify that the drug-free workplace
requirements will be met. The use of this form complies with 7 CFR part 3017.



SF-424.1, Application for Federal Assistance



The SF-424 will be utilized for preapplications for the program. Applicants are initially requested to utilize
a preapplication to provide detailed information for RDA to use in determining eligibility and priority for available
funds. The information will be utilized by RDA to determine that applicants meet the eligibility criteria mandated
by law and have the capability and resources to carry out the proposed projects.



SF-424.1, Application for Federal Assistance



The application and related information will be used by RDA to approve the project. The applicants are asked to provide
a minimum amount of additional information with their applications.



SF-269, Financial Status Report



SF-269 will be used by RDA to quarterly monitor the financial status of the grantee. The use of this form complies
with 7 CFR parts 3015 and 3016.



SF-270, Request for Advance or Reimbursement



SF-270 will be submitted by the grantee and used by RDA to document disbursement of grant funds. The use of this
form complies with 7 CFR parts 3015 and 3016.



Exhibit A_Agreement of Administrative Requirements for Rural Technology Development Grants



This exhibit contains information regarding the responsibilities of the grantee for receipt of grant funds under
the Rural Technology Development Grant program. The grantee must read, understand, and sign this agreement.



Record Keeping Requirements 

Financial Records



Grantees must maintain financial management systems and retain financial records in accordance with standards
prescribed in 7 CFR parts 3015 and 3016, as appropriate, in accordance with terms and conditions of the grant. Grantee
records must include an accurate accounting and must document how these funds are used.



Property Records



Grantees must maintain property records in accordance with standards prescribed in 7 CFR parts 3015 and 3016, as appropriate,
in accordance with terms and conditions of the grant.

3. Use of improved technology._Improved information technology may be used by the grantee; however, each grantee
may be relatively small and high technology information transfer is not considered economically justifiable by
FmHA or the grantees. The collection of information required by this regulation is minimal and is more a synopsis of
grantee activities than original data.

4. Efforts to identify duplication._The Agency has reviewed all grant programs it administers to determine which
programs may be similar in intent and purpose. The Agency has several grant programs that are similar. It is doubtful
that an applicant would apply for funding under the RTDG program at the same time and for the same purpose as an application
under another program. However, if there were simultaneous participation in more than one grant program, the Agency
would make every effort to accommodate the requests within the same set of applications and processing forms. This
effort is presently facilitated by assignment of management of these programs to the same program area of responsibility.
If a grantee is applying for, or receiving, a grant from another Federal agency, the forms and documents furnished
to the other agency would be utilized to the extent possible.

5. Why available information cannot be used or modified._As stated in 4, if similar information is available within
RDA or another agency, every effort would be made to utilize that information as is or in an appropriately modified
form for this program.

6. Methods to minimize burden of small businesses or entities._The information to be collected is in a format designed
to minimize the paperwork burden on small businesses and other small entities. The information collected is the minimum
needed by the Agency to approve grants and monitor the grantee performance.

7. Consequence if information collection were less frequent._If the collection of information were conducted less
frequently, it could have an adverse effect on the Agency's ability to administer the grant program. The Agency must
determine that the grant funds are to be used by the eligible applicants for authorized purposes.

8. Inconsistency with guidelines in 5 CFR 1320.6._There are no special circumstances that require the collection
to be conducted in a manner inconsistent with the guidelines in 7 CFR 1320.6, except for SF-270. The SF-270
is submitted voluntarily during the disbursement period; requests are limited to one every 30 days.

9. Consultation with persons outside of Agency._The regulation is being published as an interim rule in the 

Federal Register

 with a request for comments. Implementation of this program is required by legislation. No consultations have been
made at this time; however, comments on the interim rule will be considered. 
10. Confidentially provided to respondent._No assurance of confidentiality is provided to applicants and grantees
beyond that required by law. 
11. Questions of a sensitive nature._There will be no collection of any information that would be considered sensitive
in nature or commonly considered private. 
12. Annualized costs to Federal Government and respondents._The Agency estimates the cost to the respondents to
comply with this regulation to be $78,715. This is based on an estimate of 100 organizations filing a preapplication
and the Agency making 50 of them a grant. The Agency used $13.00 per hour based on information from similar programs.
It is estimated that the primary respondents for the grantee would be a director earning $10.80 to $15.45 per hour.

The cost to the Federal Government to collect and evaluate this information is estimated to be $71,718. This includes
staff time, printing, publication of regulations, operational expenses, and overhead. Staff time will vary with
appropriation levels because the amount of available resources does affect how many applicants will apply and need

evaluation for funding and how many projects will need monitoring and servicing. This estimated cost is based on the
grants being approved and serviced in the State Office. 
13. Estimate of burden._We estimate the total annual man hours required to comply with this regulation to be 6,055.
It is estimated that 100 organizations will file a preapplication and 50 grantees will be selected for funding. This
estimate is based on historical data from similar FmHA programs. 
14. Reason for changes in burden._This is an initial request for OMB clearance. 
15. Tabulation, analysis, and publication plans._The information collected is not for the purpose of publication.

(a) Grants may be made to public bodies or nonprofit institutions.

(1) The RDA will proceed as follows in rural area determinations: When the RDA determines an area to be urbanized or
urbanizing, he/she must then determine the population density per square mile. If the project otherwise appears
to be eligible, the RDA will request the National Office to provide the correct density figure.

(2) All such density determinations will be made on the basis of minor civil division or census county division as used
by the Bureau of the Census. In making the density calculations, large nonresidential tracts 
devoted to urban land uses such as railroad yards, airports, industrial sites, parks, golf courses, and cemeteries
or land set aside for such purposes will be excluded.

Civil rights compliance requirements. 

All grants made under this subpart are subject to the requirements of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 which prohibits
discrimination on the basis of race, color, and national origin as outlined in subpart E of part 1901 of this title.
In addition, the grants made under this subpart are subject to the requirements of section 504 of the Rehabilitation
Act of 1973 which prohibits discrimination on the basis of handicap; the requirements of the Age Discrimination Act
of 1975 which prohibits discrimination on the basis of age; and Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act, Pub.
L. 101-336, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability by private entities in places of public
accommodations.

(b) 

Environmental requirements.

(1) General applicability. 

Unless specifically modified by this section, the requirements of subpart G of part 1940 of this title apply to this
subpart. RDA will give particular emphasis to ensuring compliance with the environmental policies contained in
  1940.303 and 1940.304 of subpart G of part 1940 of this title. Although the purpose of the grant program
established by this subpart is to improve business, industry, and employment in rural areas, this purpose is to be
achieved, to the extent practicable, without adversely affecting important environmental resources of rural areas
such as important farmland and forest lands, prime rangelands, wetland and floodplains. Prospective recipients
of grants, therefore, must consider the potential environmental impacts of their applications at the earliest planning
stages and develop plans and projects that minimize the potential to adversely impact on the environment.

(2) 

Technical assistance. 

An application for a technical assistance project is generally excluded from the environmental review process by
 1940.333 of subpart G of part 1940 of this title. However, as further specified in that section, the grantee
of a technical assistance grant, in the process of providing technical assistance, must consider the potential environmental
impacts of the recommendations provided to the recipient of the technical assistance.

(3) 

Applications for grants to provide financial assistance to third-party recipients. 

As part of the preapplication, the applicant must provide a complete Form FmHA 1940-20, ``Request for Environmental
Information,'' for each project specifically identified in its plan to provide financial assistance to third parties
who will undertake eligible projects with such assistance. RDA will review the preapplication, supporting materials,
and any required Forms FmHA 1940-20 and initiate a Class II assessment for the preapplication in accordance
with  1940.318 of subpart G of part 1940 of this title. This assessment will focus on the potential cumulative
impacts of the projects as well as any environmental concerns or problems that are associated with individual projects
and that can be identified at this time from the information submitted. Because RDA's approval of this type of grant
application does not constitute RDA's commitment to the use of grant funds for any identified third-party projects
(see  4284.541 of this subpart), no public notification requirements for a Class II assessment will apply to
the preapplication. After the grant is approved, each third-party project to be assisted under the grant will undergo
the applicable environmental review and public notification requirements in subpart G of part 1940 of this title
prior to RDA providing its consent to the grantee to assist the third-party project. If the preapplication reflects
only one specific project which is specifically identified as the third-party recipient for financial assistance,
RDA may perform the appropriate environmental assessment in accordance with the requirements of subpart G of part
1940 of this title and forego initiating a Class II assessment with no public notification. However, the applicant
must be advised that if the recipient or project changes after the grant is approved, the project to be assisted under
the grant will undergo the applicable environmental review and public notification requirements in subpart G of
part 1940 of this title.

(c) 

Governmentwide debarment and suspension (nonprocurement) and requirements for drug-free workplace. 

All projects must comply with the requirements set forth in part 3017 of this title and FmHA Instruction 1940-M
(available in any State RDA/FmHA office).

(d) 

Restrictions on lobbying. 

All grants must comply with the lobbying restrictions set forth in part 3018 of this title.

(e) 

Excess capacity or transfer of employment.

(1) If a proposed grant is for more than $1 million and will increase direct employment by more than 50 employees, the
applicant will be requested to provide written support for an RDA determination that the proposal will not result
in a project which is calculated to, or likely to, result in:

(i) The transfer of any employment or business activity from one area to another (this limitation shall not prohibit
assistance for the expansion of an existing business entity through the establishment of a new branch, affiliate,
or subsidiary of such entity if the expansion will not result in an increase in the unemployment in the area of original
location or in any other area where such entity conducts business operations unless there is reason to believe that
such expansion is being established with the intention of closing down the operations of the existing business entity
in the area of its original location or in any other area where it conducts such operations), or

(ii) An increase in the production of goods, materials, or commodities or the availability of services or facilities
in the area when there is not sufficient demand for such goods, materials, commodities, services, or facilities to
employ the efficient capacity of existing competitive commercial or industrial enterprises, unless such financial
or other assistance will not have an adverse effect upon existing competitive enterprises in the area. The applicant's
written support will consist of a resolution from the applicant and Form FmHA 449-22, ``Certification of Non-Relocation
and Market and Capacity Information Report,'' from each existing and future occupant of the site. The applicant may
use Guide 2 of subpart G of part 1942 (available in any State RDA/FmHA office) as an example in preparing the resolution.
Future occupants of the site must be certified by Department of Labor (DOL) as outlined in paragraph (e)(3) of this
section for a period of 3 years after the initial certification by DOL.

(2) RDA will check each document for completeness and accuracy and submit nine copies of each to the National Office
for forwarding to DOL.

(3) Grants shall not be made if the Secretary of Labor certifies within 30 days after the matter has been submitted by
the Secretary of Agriculture that the provisions of paragraph (e)(1) of this section have not been met. Information
for obtaining this certification will be submitted, in writing, by the applicant to RDA. The information will be submitted
to DOL by the RDA National Office. Grant approval may be given and funds may be obligated, subject to the DOL certification
being received, provided RDA has made its own separate determinations of (e)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section when applicable.

(f) Management assistance. 

Grant recipients will be supervised, as necessary, to ensure that projects are completed in accordance with approved
plans and specifications and that funds are expended for approved purposes. Grants made under this subpart will be
administered under, and are subject to parts 3015, 3016, and 3017 of this title, as appropriate, and established RDA
guidelines.

(g) 

National Historic Preservation Act of 1966. 

All projects will be in compliance with the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 in accordance with subpart
F of part 1901 of this title.

(h) 

Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act. 

All projects must comply with the requirements set forth in part 21 of this title.

(i) 

Floodplains and wetlands. 

All projects must comply with Executive Order 11988, ``Floodplain Management,'' and Executive Order 11990, ``Protection
of Wetlands.''

(j) 

Flood or mudslide hazard area precautions. 

If the grantee financed project is in a flood or mudslide area, flood or mudslide insurance must be provided. 

(k) 

Termination of Federal requirements. 

Once the grantee has provided 29 assistance to projects from a revolving fund, in an amount equal to the grant provided
by RDA, the requirements imposed on the grantee shall not be applicable to any new projects thereafter financed from
the revolving funds. Such new projects shall not be considered as being derived from Federal funds. 

(l) 

Intergovernmental review. 

Grant projects are subject to the provisions of Executive Order 12372 which requires intergovernmental consultation
with State and local officials. A revolving fund established in whole, or in part, with grant funds will also be considered
a project for the purpose of intergovernmental review as well as the specific projects funded with grant funds from
the revolving loan project. For each project to be assisted with a grant under this subpart and for which the State has
elected to review the project under their intergovernmental review process, the State Point of Contact must be notified.
Notification, in the form of a project description, can be initiated by the grantee. Any comments from the State must
be included with the grantee's request to use RDA grant funds for the specific project. Prior to RDA's decision on the
request, compliance with requirements of intergovernmental consultation must be demonstrated for each project.
These requirements should be carried out in accordance with subpart V, ``Intergovernmental Review of Department
of Agriculture Programs and Activities,'' of part 3015 of this title (see subpart J of part 1940 of this title, available
in any State RDA/FmHA office).

Grant Selection Criteria

 


Grants will be awarded under this subpart on a competitive basis. The priorities described below will be used by the
RDA to rate preapplications and applications. Points will be distributed as indicated in paragraph (a) of this section.
Points will be distributed according to ranking as compared with other preapplications/ applications on hand. A
copy of the score sheet (Exhibit B) (available in any State RDA/FmHA Office) should be placed in the casefile for future
reference. 
(a) The selection criteria are as follows:

Preference will be given to proposed projects which will serve a rural area(s) that has few rural industries and 
agribusinesses; high levels of unemployment or underemployment; high rates of outmigration of people, businesses,
and industries; and low levels of per capita income. RDA will consider data supporting these demographics from the
United States Bureau of the Census or other reliable data from recognized local, regional, State or Federal sources
or from surveys conducted by reliable, impartial sources. Outmigration of businesses and industries, for example,
may be supported by county business patterns data available from the Bureau of the Census. Data to support all categories
must be for the most current full calendar year for which the data is available and the 3 calendar years prior to that
year. The competitive range for proposed projects is as follows: 
(i) Number of rural industries and agribusinesses in comparison with the population of the area(s) to be served: 1
or less per 5,000 residents_25 points; 1 or less per 3,000 residents_15 points; or 1 or less per 1,000 residents_5 points.

(ii) Unemployment rate in the area(s) to be served: Exceeds the State rate by 25 percent or more_15 points; or exceeds
the State rate by less than 25 percent but more than 5 percent_10 points. 
(iii) Underemployment in the area(s) to be served exceeds the State rate of underemployment by 25 percent or more_20
points; exceeds the State rate by less than 25 percent_10 points; or is equal to or less than State rate_0 points. 
(iv) Outmigration of rural residents from the area(s) as evidenced by a 
population loss in the last full calendar year of at least 20 percent_20 points. 
(v) Outmigration of business and industry and/or business and industry closures in the area(s) of at least 20 percent
in the last 3 years_20 points. 
(vi) Average per capita income of the area(s) is less than the State average by: 50 percent_25 points; or 25 percent_10
points. 
(2) 

Project proposal. 

The project proposal will contribute the most to the improvement of economic conditions of the rural area(s) by: 
(i) Creation of industries or agribusinesses in the area(s): 1 or more per 5,000 residents_20 points; 1 or more per
10,000 residents_10 points; or 1 or more per 20,000 residents_5 points. 
(ii) Increasing employment by 10 percent or more_10 points. 
(iii) Stemming the flow of outmigration of people, businesses, or industries by 10 percent or more_10 points. 
(iv) Increasing the tax base of the area(s) by 2 percent or more_5 points.

Review of decision. 

Each application for assistance will be carefully reviewed in accordance with the priorities established in this
section. A priority rating will be assigned to each application. Applications selected for funding will be based
on the priority rating assigned each application and the total funds available. All applications submitted for funding
should contain sufficient information to permit RDA to complete a thorough priority rating. When a determination
is made that favorable action will not be taken on a preapplication or application, the applicant will be notified
in writing of the reasons why the request was not favorably considered. The notification to the applicant will state
that a review of this decision by RDA may be requested by the applicant in accordance with subpart B of part 1900 of this
title.

RDA Instruction 4284-F 
 Exhibit A 

Agreement of Administrative Requirements for 
Rural Technology Development Grants 




This exhibit contains information regarding the responsibilities of the grantee for receipt of grant funds under
the Rural Technology Development Grant (RTDG) program. These requirements do not supersede the requirements for
receipt of Federal funds as stated in 7 CFR part 3015 and 3016; however, specific areas related to the program are cited
below. 

In consideration for the RTDG grant by RDA, grantee agrees to: 

1. Cause the RTDG program to be completed within the total sums available to it, including grant funds, in accordance
with the scope of work and any necessary modifications thereof prepared by grantee and approved by grantor. 

2. Permit periodic inspection of the program operations by a representative of grantor. 

3. Make the program available to all persons in grantee's service area without regard to race, color, national origin,
religion, sex, marital status, age, physical or mental handicap. 

4. Not use grant funds to replace any financial support previously provided or assured from any other source. The grantee
agrees that the general level of expenditure by the grantee for the benefit of program 
area and/or program covered by this agreement shall be maintained and not reduced as a result of the Federal share funds
received under this grant. 

5. Provide financial management systems which will include: 

(a) Accurate, current, and complete disclosure of the financial result of each grant. 

(b) Records which identify adequately the source and application of funds for grant-supporting activities. Those
records shall contain information pertaining to grant awards and authorizations, obligations, unobligated balances,
assets, liabilities, outlays, and income. 

(c) Effective control over and accountability for all funds. Grantee shall adequately safeguard all such assets
and shall ensure that they are used solely for authorized purposes. 

(d) Accounting records supported by source documentation. 

6. Retain financial records, supporting documents, statistical records, and all other records pertinent to the
grant for a period of at least 3 years after grant closing except that the records shall be retained beyond the 3-year
period if audit findings have not been resolved. Microfilm copies may be substituted in lieu of original records.
The grantor and the Comptroller General of the United States, or any of their duly authorized representatives, shall
have access to any books, documents, papers, and records of the grantee which are pertinent to the specific grant program
for the purpose of making audits, examinations, excerpts, and transcripts. 

7. Provide an audit report prepared in accordance with generally accepted Government auditing standards using the
publication, ``Standards for Audit of Governmental Organizations, Programs, Activities and Functions.'' 

8. Provide grantor with such periodic reports as it may require and permit periodic inspection of its operations by
a designated representative of the grantor. 

9. Execute Form FmHA 400-1, ``Equal Opportunity Agreement,'' Form FmHA 400-4, ``Assurance Agreement,''
and any other agreements required by grantor to implement the civil rights requirements. If any such form has been
executed by grantee as a result of a grant being made to grantee by grantor contemporaneously with the making of this
grant, another form of the same type need not be executed in connection with this grant. 

10. That upon any default under its representations or agreements set forth in this instrument, grantee, at the option
and the demand of grantor, will, to the extent legally permissible, repay to grantor forthwith the original principal
amount of the grant stated herein above, with interest equal to the rate of interest paid on U.S. 26-week Treasury Bills
adjusted quarterly from the date of the default. The provisions of this exhibit may be enforced by grantor at its option
and without regard to prior waivers by it of previous defaults of grantee, by judicial proceedings to require specific
performance of the terms of this exhibit, or by such other proceedings in the law or equity in either Federal or State
courts as may be deemed necessary by grantor to assure compliance with the provisions of this exhibit and the laws and
regulations under which this grant is made.

11. That no member of Congress shall be admitted to any share or part of this grant or any benefit that may arise therefrom;
but this provision shall not be construed to bar, as a contractor under the grant, a publicly held corporation whose
ownership might include a member of Congress. 
12. That all non-confidential information resulting from its activities shall be made available to the general public
on an equal basis. 
13. That the purpose and scope of work for which this grant is made shall not duplicate programs for which monies have
been received, are committed, or are applied to from other sources (public or private). 
14. That grantee shall relinquish any and all copyrights and/or privileges to the materials developed under this
grant as published in whole or in part. The material shall contain a notice and be identified by language to the following
effect: ``The material is the result of tax-supported research and as such is not copyrightable. It may be freely reprinted
with the customary crediting of the source.'' 
15. That the grantee shall abide by the policies promulgated in the USDA Uniform Assistance Regulations, 7 CFR parts
3015 and 3016, which provides standards for use by grantee in establishing procedures for the procurement of supplies,
equipment, and other services with Federal grant funds. 
16. Obtain prior approval from grantor for use of grant funds for uses or amounts not consistent with the approved scope
of work and budget. 
17. That the grantee, except for States, will remit interest earned on grant funds deposited in an interest bearing
account in accordance with the USDA Uniform Assistance Regulation 7 CFR parts 3015 and 3016. 
18. Grantee will comply with property management standards established by 7 CFR parts 3015 and 3016 for personal property.
``Personal property'' means property of any kind except real property. It may be tangible_having physical existence_or
intangible_having no physical existence; such as patents, inventions, and copyrights. ``Nonexpendable personal
property'' means tangible personal property having a useful life of more than 1 year and an acquisition cost of $300
or more per unit. A grantee may use its own definition of nonexpendable personal property provided that such definition
would at least include all tangible personal property as defined above. ``Expendable personal property'' refers
to all tangible personal property other than nonexpendable property. When nonexpendable property is acquired by
a grantee with project funds, title shall not be taken by the Federal Government but shall be vested in the grantee subject
to the following conditions. 
(a) Right to transfer title. For items of real or nonexpendable personal property having a unit acquisition cost of
$1,000 or more, RDA may reserve the right to transfer the title to the Federal Government or to a third party named by
the Federal Government when such third party is otherwise eligible under existing statutes. Such reservation shall
be subject to the following standards: 
(i) The property shall be appropriately identified in the grant or otherwise made known to the grantee in writing.

(ii) RDA shall issue disposition instructions within 120 calendar days after the end of the Federal support of the
project for which it was acquired. If RDA fails to issue disposition instructions within the 120 calendar day period,
the grantee shall apply the standards of paragraph 18. (b) of this exhibit. 
(iii) When RDA exercises its right to take title, the personal property shall be subject to the provisions for federally
owned nonexpendable property discussed in paragraphs 18. (b) and (c) of this exhibit. 
(iv) When title is transferred either to the Federal Government or to a third party and the grantee is instructed to
ship the property elsewhere, the grantee shall be reimbursed by the benefiting Federal agency with an amount which
is computed by applying the percentage of the grantee participation in the cost of the original grant project or program
to the current fair market value of the property, plus any reasonable shipping or interim storage costs incurred.

(b) Use of other nonexpendable personal property for which the grantee has title. 
(i) The grantee shall use the property in the project or program for which it was acquired as long as needed, whether
or not the project or program continues to be supported by Federal funds. When it is no longer needed for the original
project or program, the grantee shall use the property in connection with its other federally sponsored activities,
in the following order of priority:

(

1

) Activities sponsored by RDA. 
(

2

) Activities sponsored by other Federal agencies. 

(ii) Shared use. During the time that nonexpendable personal property is held for use on the project or program for
which it was acquired, the grantee shall make it available for use on other projects or programs if such other use will
not interfere with the work on the project or program for which the property was originally acquired. First preference
for such other use shall be given to projects or programs sponsored by RDA; second preference shall be given to projects
or programs sponsored by other Federal agencies. If the property is owned by the Federal Government, use for other
activities not sponsored by the Federal Government shall be permissible if authorized by RDA. User charges should
be considered, if appropriate. 
(c) Disposition of nonexpendable personal property. When the grantee no longer needs the property as provided in
paragraph 18. (b) of this exhibit, the property may be used for other activities in accordance with the following standards:

(i) Personal property with a unit acquisition cost of less than $1,000. The grantee may use the property for other activities
without reimbursement to the Federal Government or sell the property and retain the proceeds. 
(ii) Nonexpendable personal property with a unit acquisition cost of $1,000 or more. The grantee may retain the property
for other use 
provided that compensation is made to RDA or its successor. The amounts of compensation shall be computed by applying
the percentage of Federal participation in the cost of the original project or program to current fair market value
of the property. If the grantee has no need for the property and the property has further use value, the grantee shall
request disposition instructions from the original grantor agency. 
(iii) RDA shall determine whether the property can be used to meet the Agency's requirements. If no need exists within
RDA, the General Services Administration Federal Property Management Regulations will be used by RDA to determine
whether a need for the property exists in other Federal agencies. RDA shall issue instructions to the grantee no later
than 120 days after the grantee request and the following procedures shall govern: 
(

1

) If so instructed or if disposition instructions are not issued within 120 calendar days after the grantee's request,
the grantee shall sell the property and reimburse RDA an amount computed by applying the percentage of the grantor
participation in the grant program to the sales proceeds. However, the grantee shall be permitted to deduct and retain
from the Federal share $100 or 10 percent of the proceeds, whichever is greater, for the grantee's selling and handling
expenses. 
(

2

) If the grantee is instructed to dispose of the property other than as described in paragraphs 18. (b) and (c) of this
exhibit, the grantee shall be reimbursed by RDA for such costs incurred in its disposition. 
(

3

) Property management standards for nonexpendable personal property. The grantee's property management standards
for nonexpendable personal property shall include the following procedural requirements: 
(

a

) Property records shall be maintained accurately and shall include: 
(

i

) A description of the property. 
(

ii

) Manufacturer's serial number, model number, Federal stock number, National stock number, or other identification
number. 
(

iii

) Sources of the property including grant or other agreement number. 
(

iv

) Whether title vests in the grantee or the Federal Government. 

(

v

) Acquisition date (or date received, if the property was furnished by the Federal Government) and costs. 
(

vi

) Percentage (at the end of the budget year) of Federal participation in the cost of the project or program for which
the property was acquired. (Not applicable to property furnished by the Federal Government). 
(

vii

) Location, use, and condition of the property and the date the information was reported. 
(

viii

) Unit acquisition cost. 
(

ix

) Ultimate disposition data, including date of disposal and sales price or the method used to determine current fair
market value where a grantee compensates the Federal agency for its share.

(

b

) Property owned by the Federal Government must be marked to indicate Federal ownership. 
(

c

) A physical inventory of property shall be taken and the results reconciled with the property records at least once
every 2 years. Any differences between quantities determined by the physical inspection and those shown in the accounting
records shall be investigated to determine the causes of the difference. The grantee shall, in connection with the
inventory, verify the existence, current utilization, and continued need for the property. 
(

d

) A control system shall be in effect to ensure adequate safeguards to prevent loss, damage, or theft of the property.
Any loss, damage, or the theft of nonexpendable property shall be investigated and fully documented; if the property
was owned by the Federal Government, the grantee shall promptly notify RDA. 
(

e

) Adequate maintenance procedures shall be implemented to keep the property in good condition. 
(

f

) Where the grantee is authorized or required to sell the property, proper sales procedures shall be established which
would provide for competition to the extent practicable and result in the highest possible return. 
(

g

) Expendable personal property shall vest in the grantee upon acquisition. If there is a residual inventory of such
property exceeding $1,000 in total aggregate fair market value upon termination or completion of the grant and if
the property is not needed for any other federally sponsored project or program, the grantee shall retain the property
for use on nonfederally sponsored activities or sell it, but must in either case compensate the Federal Government
for its share. The amount of compensation shall be computed in the same manner as nonexpendable personal property.

This exhibit covers the following described personal property and any additional property acquired wholly or in
part with grant funds (use continuation sheets as necessary): 
19. To the following termination provisions: 
(a) Termination for cause: The grantor agency may terminate any grant in whole, or in part, at any time before the date
of completion, whenever it is determined that the grantee has failed to comply with the conditions of the grant. The
grantor agency shall promptly notify the grantee in writing of the determination and the reasons for the termination,
together with the effective date. 
(b) Termination for convenience: The grantor agency or grantee may terminate grants in whole, or in part, when both
parties agree that the continuation of the program would not produce beneficial results commensurate with the further
expenditure of funds. The two parties shall agree upon the termination conditions, including the effective date
and, in the case of partial terminations, the portion to be terminated. The grantee shall not incur new obligations
for the terminated portion after the effective date, and shall cancel as many outstanding obligations as possible.
The grantor agency shall allow full credit to the grantee for the Federal share of the noncancelable obligations properly
incurred by the grantee prior to termination. 
RDA agrees that it will: 
1. Assist grantee, within available appropriations, with such technical assistance as grantor deems appropriate
in planning the program and coordinating the plan with local official comprehensive plans and with any State or area
plans for the area in which the program is located. 
2. At its sole discretion, RDA may at any time give any consent, deferment, subordination, release, satisfaction,
or termination of any or all of grantee's grant obligations, with or without valuable consideration, upon such terms
and conditions as RDA may determine to be: 
(a) Advisable to further the purposes of the grant or to protect the Government's financial interest therein; and

(b) Consistent with both the statutory purposes of the grant and the limitations of the statutory authority under
which it is made.

Regulatory Guidance Letter, RGL 94-1


Date: 23 May 1994, Expires: 31 December 1999.
Subject: Expiration of Geographic Jurisdictional Determinations.
1. Regulatory Guidance Letter (RGL) 90-6, Subject: ``Expiration Dates for Wetlands Jurisdictional Delineations''
is extended until 31 December 1999, subject to the following revisions.
2. This guidance should be applied to all jurisdictional determinations for all waters of the United States made pursuant
to Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899, Section 404 of the Clean Water Act, and Section 103 of the Marine Protection
Research and Sanctuaries Act of 1972.
3. To be consistent with paragraph IV.A. of the 6 January 1994, interagency Memorandum of Agreement Concerning the
Delineation of Wetlands for Purposes of Section 404 of the Clean Water Act and Subtitle B of the Food Security Act, all
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers geographic jurisdictional determinations shall be in writing and normally remain valid
for a period of five years. The Corps letter (see paragraph 4.(d) of RGL 90-6) should include a statement that
the jurisdictional determination is valid for a period of five years from the date of the letter unless new information
warrants revision of the determination before the expiration date.
4. For wetland jurisdictional delineations the ``effective date of this RGL'' referred to in paragraphs 4 and 5 of
RGL 90-6 was and remains 14 August 1990. For jurisdictional determinations, other than wetlands jurisdictional

district engineer will normally extend the three year period to a total of five years unless new information warrants
a new jurisdictional determination.
6. Districts are not required to issue a public notice on this guidance but may do so at their discretion.
7. This guidance expires on 31 December 1999 unless sooner revised or rescinded.

 Notice to solicit public comments. 





</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Assistant Secretary solicits written public comment on the implementation by the Office of Educational Research
and Improvement (OERI) of its new authorizing legislation, the ``Educational Research, Development, Dissemination,
and Improvement Act of 1994.'' Comments will be used to help the Assistant Secretary plan for the reorganization of
OERI and the activities it will carry out, as well as establish, in collaboration with the National Educational Research
Policy and Priorities Board, priorities for OERI's future work. 


 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On March 31, 1994, President Clinton signed Public Law 103-227, which includes both the ``Goals 2000: Educate
America Act'' and the ``Educational Research, Development, Dissemination, and Improvement Act of 1994.'' The latter
Act creates a new Office of Educational Research and Improvement with a broad mandate to conduct an array of research,
development, dissemination, and improvement activities aimed at strengthening the education of all students.
It also requires the establishment of a National Educational Research Policy and Priorities Board, which is to work
collaboratively with the Assistant Secretary to identify priorities to guide the work of OERI. 



The mission of OERI, which the new authorizing legislation requires be accomplished in collaboration with researchers,
teachers, school administrators, parents, students, employers, and policymakers, is to provide national leadership
in:

(1) expanding fundamental knowledge and understanding of education; (2) promoting excellence and equity in education
and the achievement of the National Education Goals by spurring reform in the school systems of the United States;
(3) promoting the use and application of research and development to improve practice in the classroom; and (4) monitoring
the state of education. 



The statute requires that OERI establish five new research institutes and a national dissemination system. Specifically,
the new OERI must include: 

 The National Institute on Student Achievement, Curriculum, and Assessment; 

 The National Institute on the Education of At-Risk Students; 

 The National Institute on Early Childhood Development and Education; 

 The National Institute on Educational Governance, Finance, Policymaking, and Management; 

 The National Institute on Postsecondary Education, Libraries, and Lifelong Learning; 

 The Office of Reform Assistance and Dissemination; and 

 The National Library of Education. 

The Assistant Secretary is interested in receiving comments and recommendations from the public regarding the functions
and responsibilities of these new organizational components, the priorities that should govern their work, and
the mix of activities that would best serve OERI's mission. The Assistant Secretary welcomes recommendations related
to any aspect of the implementation of the ``Educational Research, Development, Dissemination, and Improvement
Act of 1994,'' but is especially interested in recommendations regarding: 

 Research priorities for each institute, especially those topics and issues that should be the focus of long-term,
sustained, systematic, and integrated research and development; 

 Strategies to help ensure that the research agenda is relevant to the needs of educators working with students;


 Dissemination strategies that will be most effective in meeting the needs of a range of different customers_education
researchers, practitioners, policymakers, parents, students, and employers; 

 Strategies and technical assistance activities that will help ensure that knowledge gained from research
will help improve teaching and learning; 

 Strategies for identifying proven and promising educational practices and programs; 

 Coordination of OERI's research, development and dissemination with similar activities of other agencies
and organizations, including other units of the Department and other federal agencies, to ensure that customer needs
are met and the federal investment is maximized; 

 Peer review and program evaluation activities to ensure that the programs and projects OERI supports meet
the highest standards of professional excellence; 

 Education topic areas in which syntheses of research-based information are urgently needed to help guide
improvement efforts; and 

 Information services, resources and materials that should be available to the public through a National Library
of Education. 

The Assistant Secretary is interested in wide public comment_from education researchers, practitioners, policymakers,
parents, students, employers and others interested in systemic education reform_regarding the policies and priorities
OERI must identify and develop. 

In seeking public comment, OERI is committed to supporting Executive Order 12862, Setting Customer Service Standards,
which provides that the Federal Government be ``customer driven.'' To deliver the highest quality service, OERI
must understand its customers' needs and interests and how it can be most responsive to these needs and interests.




Availability of Reauthorization Legislation and Topic Papers

: To provide the public with a complete description of the provisions of the new legislation, OERI will make available
upon request a copy of the ``Educational Research, Development, Dissemination, and Improvement Act of 1994.'' Prior
to submitting any comments, OERI encourages commenters to review this legislation. In addition, OERI has prepared
topic papers on a number of discrete subject areas, including each of the major OERI organizational entities required
by the new legislation. Individuals who wish to respond to this notice may find these topic papers helpful as they develop
their comments. The purpose of these topic papers is to share information and to generate discussion and recommendations.




Invitation to Comment 



Interested persons are invited to submit comments and recommendations regarding this notice. 

All comments and recommendations will be available for public inspection, during and after the comment period, in
room 600, 555 New Jersey Avenue, NW., Washington, DC between the hours of 8:30 a.m. and 4 p.m. Monday through Friday

<DOCTITLE>Eastern Shore Natural Gas Company; Proposed Changes in FERC Gas Tariff</DOCTITLE>



June 30, 1994.



Take notice that on June 21, 1994 Eastern Shore Natural Gas Company (Eastern Shore) tendered for filing certain revised
tariff sheets and refund reports, included in Appendix A and B of the filing, to comply with the Commission's Order
dated May 19, 1994, in the above referenced proceeding. Eastern Shore has separately filed a request for rehearing
of the May 19 Order.

Eastern Shore states that the subject tariff sheets are being filed to comply with Ordering Paragraph C of the Commission's
Order. Such paragraph directed Eastern Shore to revise its tariff to provide either a Unit-of-Sales or Unit-of-Purchase
methodology for computing both its demand current adjustment and monthly deferred demand costs in accordance with
 154.303(c)(2)(ii) of the Commission's PGA regulations and file such revised tariff sheets within 30 days
of the date of the Order to be made effective prospectively from the date of the Order.

As stated in Eastern Shore's request for rehearing, Eastern Shore believes its PGA tariff provisions and its PGA filings
during the past six years have consistently used a Unit-of-Purchase methodology for computing both the current demand
charge adjustment and the monthly demand deferrals. Eastern Shore, however, states it is willing to revise its tariff
provisions to be effective May 19, 1994, in accordance with the Commission's Order to further clarify that both its
current demand charge adjustments and monthly demand deferrals will be calculated using a Unit-of-Purchase methodology.

Eastern Shore states that two ``refund reports'' are being filed to comply with Ordering Paragraph D, which requires
Eastern Shore to refund with interest its overcharges from November 1, 1992 to the current billing month and to file
a report showing how the refund was calculated. Due to what Eastern Shore believes to be an inconsistency or contradiction
with respect to the Commission's language in its Order, Eastern Shore has submitted for the Commission's review two
separate refund scenarios with significantly different results, each of which it states is arguably in compliance
with the Commission's Order.

Eastern Shore states that upon notification from the Commission as to which refund report it accepts, it will credit
the appropriate refund amount to its Account No. 191 Demand Refund Sub-Account and refund such amount, as provided
in  21.6, ``Rufunds'' of its PGA tariff provisions.

Eastern Shore states that copies of the filing have been served upon its jurisdictional customers and interested
State Commissions.

Any person desiring to protest said filing should file a protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825
North Capitol Street, N.E., Washington D.C., 20426, in accordance with Rule 211 of the Commission's Rules of Practice
and Procedure (18 CFR 385.211). All such protests should be filed on or before July 8, 1994. Protests will be considered
by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties
to the proceeding. Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection.

<DOCTITLE>Northwest Pipeline Corp.; Petition To Amend</DOCTITLE>



June 30, 1994.



Take notice that on June 24, 1994, Northwest Pipeline Corporation (Northwest), 295 Chipeta Way, Salt Lake City, Utah
84158, filed in Docket No. CP93-437-001 a petition to amend the certificate of public convenience and
necessity issued September 13, 1993, in Docket No. CP93-437-000 to upgrade the horsepower of the Snohomish
and Sumner Compressor Stations on its mainline transmission system in Washington, all as more fully set forth in the
application on file with the Commission and open to public inspection.

Northwest proposes to upgrade the existing compressor unit at Sumner from 4,000 horsepower to 6,350 horsepower instead
of the 5,200 horsepower authorized in the September 13, 1993, order. It is stated that the previously authorized increase
would not be sufficient to achieve the desired capacity increase because of compressor cylinder limitations. It
is stated that the previously estimated cost of $1.08 million for the upgrade would remain the same. It is asserted
that the proposed increase in horsepower would increase Northwest's capability to receive Canadian gas supplies
during off-peak periods and would enhance Northwest's flexibility in utilizing receipt point options under existing
transportation agreements.

Any person desiring to be heard or to make any protest with reference to said petition to amend should on or before July
21, 1994, file with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20426, a motion to intervene or a protest
in accordance with the requirements of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 384.214 or 385.211)
and the Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.10). All protests filed with the Commission will be considered
by it in determining the appropriate action to be taken but will not serve to make the protestants parties to the proceeding.
Any person wishing to become a party to a proceeding or to participate as a party in any hearing therein must file a motion
to intervene in accordance with the Commission's Rules.

Acid Rain Provisions 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency.

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 EPA today announces the allocation of allowances to small diesel refineries for desulfurization of fuel from October
1, 1993 through December 31, 1993. The eligibility for and calculation of allowances to small diesel refineries is
in accordance with Section 410(h) of the Clean Air Act, implemented at 40 CFR part 73 subpart G. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
EPA's Acid Rain Program was established by Title IV of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (CAAA) to reduce acid rain
in the continental United States. The Acid Rain Program will achieve a 50 percent reduction in sulfur dioxide (SO

2

) emissions from utility units. The SO

2

 reduction program is a flexible market-based approach to environmental management. As part of this approach, EPA
allocates ``allowances'' to affected utility units. Each allowance is a limited authorization to emit up to one ton
of SO

2

. At the end of each calendar year, each unit must hold allowances in an amount equal to or greater than its SO

2

 emissions for the year. Allowances may be bought, sold, or transferred between utilities and other interested parties.
Those utility units whose annual emissions are likely to exceed their allocation of allowances may either install
pollution control technologies or switch to cleaner fuels to reduce SO

2

 emissions, or buy additional allowances. 


Section 410(h) of the Clean Air Act provides allowances for small diesel refineries which desulfurize diesel fuel
from October 1, 1993 through December 31, 1999. Small diesel refineries are not otherwise affected by the Acid Rain
Program and do not need the allowances to comply with any provision of the Clean Air Act. Thus, the allowances serve
as a financial benefit to small diesel refineries desulfurizing diesel fuel. The following table lists the allowances
to be allocated to each eligible small diesel refinery for desulfurization of fuel from October 1, 1993 to December
31, 1993: 


 


A total of 7944 allowances are allocated. Allowances for desulfurization which occurs from 1994 through 1999 will
be made annually. 


The allowances listed above will be placed in the refiners' accounts in the Allowance Tracking System (ATS) this fall.
Until that time, the refiners can trade their allowances but the trades cannot be recorded in the ATS. Allowances allocated
to small diesel refineries in 1994 (for 1993 desulfurization) and 1995 (for 1994 desulfurization) will have a compliance
year of 1995, the first compliance year of the Acid Rain Program. The compliance year of allowances allocated subsequent
to 1995 will be the year the allowances are allocated.

<DOCTITLE>Campo Band of Mission Indians; Tentative Adequacy Determination of Tribal Municipal Solid Waste Permit Program
</DOCTITLE>


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Extension of Comment Period. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 Section 4005(c)(1)(B) of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), as amended by the Hazardous and Solid
Waste Amendments (HSWA) of 1984, requires States to develop and implement permit programs to ensure that municipal
solid waste landfills (MSWLFs) which may receive hazardous household waste or conditionally exempt small quantity
generator waste will comply with the revised Federal MSWLF Criteria (40 CFR Part 258). RCRA Section 4005(c)(1)(C)
requires the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to determine whether States have adequate permit programs for
MSWLFs. EPA believes that adequate authority exists under RCRA to allow Tribes to seek an adequacy determination
for purposes of Sections 4005 and 4010. 


On May 11, 1994, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued in the 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 24422) a notice of tentative determination on the application of the Campo Band of Mission Indians. In order
to provide additional opportunity for all interested parties to review and comment on this proposed action, EPA is
extending the public comment period beyond the original July 14, 1994, date provided for in the May 11, 1994 

Federal Register

 notice to August 1, 1994.

<DOCTITLE>Arthropod Pheromones; Experimental Use Permits </DOCTITLE>




<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 EPA is announcing in this notice that it is expanding the acreage cut-off for when an experimental use permit (EUP)
is required under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) from 10 acres to 250 acres for certain
uses of biological pesticides. These uses include arthropod pheromones, irrespective of formulation, when used
in non-food areas at a maximum use rate of 150 grams active ingredient (ai)/acre/year. Tests conducted on these pheromone
uses under the conditions specified in this notice would not require an EUP at acreages up to and including 250 acres.
Tests conducted with pheromone products on food crops entering commerce would still require an EUP and a temporary
tolerance or an exemption from the requirement of a temporary tolerance. Similarly, testing on acreages exceeding
250 acres for all pheromones (food and nonfood uses) still requires an EUP. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 


I. Introduction


Biological pesticides, which include biochemical and microbial pesticides, comprise the single fastest growing
segment of registration activity within EPA's Office of Pesticide Programs. Biochemical pesticides encompass
both semiochemicals and pheromones plus other naturally occurring substances that elicit pesticidal effects by
a nontoxic mode of action to the target pest [40 CFR 158.65(a)]. A semiochemical is a biochemical that transmits messages
between living organisms. A pheromone is a subclass of semiochemicals and is defined as a chemical produced by an arthropod
that modifies the behavior of other individuals of the same species [40 CFR 152.25(b)(1)]. Currently only pheromones
labeled for use in pheromone traps and in which the pheromone are the sole active ingredient(s) are exempt from regulation
under FIFRA [40 CFR 152.25(b)]. 
The Agency recognizes that pheromones are inherently different in their nontoxic pesticidal mode of action, low
use rate, and target species specificity, and is employing various measures to facilitate their registration. Most
recently the Agency has provided some regulatory relief for pheromones in retrievably sized polymeric matrix dispensers.
EPA exempted the inert ingredients in the polymeric matrix dispenser from the requirement of a tolerance under the
Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) on December 8, 1993 (58 FR 64493). EPA issued in the 

Federal Register

 of January 26, 1994 (59 FR 3681), a notice expanding the minimum acreage required for an experimental use permit from
10 to 250 acres for arthropod pheromones in polymeric matrix dispensers with an annual application rate limitation
of 150 grams/acre for pest control in or on all raw agricultural commodities. And most recently, on March 30, 1994 (59
FR 14757), EPA exempted from the requirement of a tolerance under FFDCA the residues of arthropod pheromones resulting
from the use of these compounds in polymeric matrix dispensers at the above use rates. 
EPA has determined that additional regulatory relief for pheromones is warranted. The Agency now wishes to further
broaden the scope of regulatory relief for arthropod pheromone researchers and producers to formulations beyond
traps and polymeric matrix dispensers by including broadcast applications under certain non-food use conditions
outlined in this notice. With the implementation of this policy, EPA hopes to encourage the development and use of
environmentally acceptable biological pesticides as alternatives to more toxic conventional chemical pesticides.
The aim is to ease the testing requirements of these products, to speed their market entry, and promote their integration
into pest management strategies. It is important to note that this policy is only applicable to arthropod pheromone
products where the pheromone is the sole active ingredient(s). For pheromone products formulated to include other
pesticide active ingredients, the data requirements for biological/chemical pesticides is appropriate [40 CFR
part 158]. 
The need for further regulatory relief above that provided for retrievable polymeric matrix dispensers prompted
the Agency to reconsider broadcast application. Of consideration were human dietary exposure, promotion of reduced
risk alternative pesticides, persistence, and environmental risk. In regard to nontarget organism effects, the
risks from broadcast application should not be appreciably greater than from a polymeric dispenser application
if the broadcast formulations are also for terrestrial use only and experimental application does not include use
in or around marshes, swamps, rivers, streams, ponds, lakes, estuaries, flood plains, or drainage ditches, nor should
the product be allowed to wash or drain into water. Low rates of experimental application, high volatility, limited
acreage, and the current extent of knowledge indicating generally low orders of toxicity are all justifications
to overcome potential increased risks to nontarget organisms due to exposure to foliar residues. 
Today's notice sets forth that for non-food uses of arthropod pheromone pesticides only, EPA is permitting the acreage
expansion from 10 to 250 acres for experimental testing at a maximum use rate of 150 grams ai/acre/year before triggering
the requirement of an EUP under FIFRA. The Agency contends, that for experimental uses involving non-food crops and
other nondietary uses, this change in policy provides significant flexibility to determine product efficacy without
resulting in significant risk to human health or the environment due to the active ingredient's low use rate, high
volatility, and lack of dietary exposure. 


II. Toxicology 


A. Ecological Effects 


Wildlife toxicity data indicate high toxicity to aquatic invertebrates and moderate toxicity to fish, but practically
no toxicity to birds tested. Therefore, these products should not be applied directly to water nor be allowed to runoff
into water. To minimize the potential toxic effects on aquatic organisms, this policy is limited to pheromone products
tested for terrestrial use only and would not apply to pheromones for use in or around marshes, swamps, rivers, streams,
ponds, lakes, estuaries, flood plains, or drainage ditches. The Agency believes that aquatic exposure will be minimal
if experimental use is limited to the terrestrial use only pattern of the pheromone. Similarly, the Agency has determined
that exposure to wildlife will be minimal when release of the pheromone is confined to experimental purposes only
and applications are limited to a maximum of 150 grams ai/acre/year on a maximum of 250 acres. 


B. Human Health


The data available to date on arthropod pheromones, including several pheromones with aromatic structures, have
indicated no mammalian toxicity at the limit dose levels recommended for the following studies: acute oral toxicity
(LD

50

 >5,000 mg/kg - category IV, nontoxic), acute dermal toxicity (LD

50

 >2,000 mg/kg category III-IV, nontoxic), acute inhalation toxicity (LD

50

 generally >5 mg/L - category III-IV, practically nontoxic), no evidence of mutagenicity (Ames Salmonella assay),
and minimal eye and skin irritation. In general, the Agency recommends, however, that whenever using pesticides,
adequate precautions to minimize applicator exposure should be taken. 
Human health concerns arise for any experimentally treated crops that may enter the food supply. Experimentally
treated food crops are normally destroyed as a routine provision to prevent the food from entering commerce. Crop
destruction, however, may not be economically feasible for crop acreages of up to 250 treated acres. Under FFDCA,
a food tolerance or an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance must be established prior to any treated crop entering
commerce or the seller of the food crop will be in violation of FFDCA provisions for pesticide residues in food. Temporary
tolerances may be established for food crops that have been treated with experimental pesticides under an EUP. 
EPA is not able at this time to make a no unreasonable adverse effects finding for arthropod pheromone pesticides for
use on food crops. Subsequent testing on food or feed crops of other formulations involving, for example, broadcast
sprays or dispensers that are not retrievable, will require an EUP to generate adequate data for determining a food
tolerance, or exemption from tolerance, and the greater exposure potential of the pesticide to the resulting food.
For these uses, an EUP is needed to accompany a temporary tolerance and to generate adequate data to allow for a food
tolerance determination. Requests for exemption from the requirement of a temporary tolerance will also be considered
in conjunction with an EUP. EPA would consider waivers for many requirements for an experimental use permit on acreages
from 10 to 250 acres and use rates up to a maximum of 150 grams ai/acre/year. 
In the past, EPA has waived some or all of the required toxicology studies for volatile biochemical pesticide active
ingredients in dispensers when the registrant has demonstrated an extremely low exposure scenario, lack of food
residues, and inert materials of the dispenser were cleared by the Agency. The Agency will consider waivers for studies
of other pheromone formulations when the registrant can adequately demonstrate that either a low application rate,
rapid degradation of the active ingredient, high volatilization, and/or timing of the last application prior to
harvest will result in no detectable pesticide residues in or on the food crop. 


III. Statutory and Regulatory Authority


Section 5 of FIFRA, 7 U.S.C. 136c, and 40 CFR part 172 provide for issuance by the Agency of experimental use permits
for the testing of new, unregistered pesticides or new uses of existing pesticides for product performance and registration
purposes. Such permits are generally issued for large-scale testing of pesticides on more than 10 acres. Contained
within the scope of the regulation, however, is the presumption that small-scale testing, i.e., on less than 10 acres
of land, does not require an EUP providing that any treated crops are destroyed or a temporary tolerance for residues
in or on the crop is in place (40 CFR 172.3(a)). This presumption, however, is caveated not to preclude experimental
testing on larger areas in certain circumstances where the purpose of the large acreage test is only to determine the
substance's value for pesticidal purposes or to determine its toxicity or other properties, and no benefit from pest
control is expected (40 CFR 172.3(b)). EPA issued in the 

Federal Register

 of January 22, 1993 (58 FR 5878), a proposed amendment to 40 CFR part 172. The proposed amendment would, among other
things, modify  172.3 to clarify that the determination of whether an EUP is required is based on risk considerations.
The amendment would provide that tests conducted on not more than 10 acres of land are presumed not to involve unreasonable
risks, and therefore, do not require an EUP. 
Due to the unique characteristics of pheromones, EPA believes that pheromone products used for non-food purposes
must be tested at acreages larger than 10 acres and as large as 250 acres to determine the products' value for pesticidal
purposes. Many pheromone uses are effective as mating disruptants to the adult insects. Larger test acreages are
needed to evaluate sufficiently the disruption of the natural flight range of the adult target insect. An additional
factor necessitating larger acreages is the volatile nature of most pheromone compounds. Separate treatments in
adjoining small plots is unfeasible, and test plot sizes ranging from 20 to 60 acres are usually required depending
upon the nature of the treated site and the pest in question. Thus, EPA believes that 250 acres should be sufficient
to determine the value for pesticidal purposes of most pheromones. 
The Agency has found that given the generally low expected toxicity and high volatility of arthropod pheromones,
an upper limit of 150 grams ai/acre/year is adequate for testing the pheromone product performance while still protecting
the public health, nontarget organisms and the environment from unreasonable risks. These application rates encompass
the majority of pheromone uses seen by the Agency to date. 


IV. Agency Determination


EPA is now expanding the terrestrial use limitation for testing arthropod pheromone pesticides without the need
for an experimental use permit from 10 acres to 250 acres for non-food use patterns at treatment rates not exceeding
150 grams ai/acre/year. Upon meeting the above conditions, the Agency has determined that pheromones of the type
described do not present an unreasonable adverse effect to human health or the environment due to unlikely exposure.

The above policy applies to only the experimental phase of pheromone product development and not to registration
of the product. The intent of this regulatory relief policy is to permit adequate conditions for practical research
and development, while protecting the food supply and nontarget species from higher pheromone levels than occur
naturally. The current set of studies listed in 40 CFR 158.690 are still required for the registration and sale of the
final product.

<DOCTITLE>Tributyltin Fluoride (TBTF); Receipt of Request to Cancel </DOCTITLE>





<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 




</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of Receipt of Request to Cancel Registrations.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This Notice, issued pursuant to section 6(f)(1) of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA),
7 U.S.C. 136 et seq., announces EPA's receipt of a request from ELF ATOCHEM North America, Inc. (``Atochem'') to voluntarily
cancel its registrations for products containing Tributyltin Fluoride (TBTF). Following a 30-day comment
period, EPA intends to cancel these registrations. Further, this notice announces the Agency's proposal regarding
sale, distribution and use of existing stocks of these products. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 This notice announces the receipt of a request for cancellation of Atochem's registrations for TBTF products and
the Agency's intent to accept these cancellations. In addition, this notice sets forth the Agency's proposal regarding
sale, distribution and use of existing stocks of products bearing the affected registration numbers. 



I. Background 



TBTF compounds are registered for use in paint formulations as an antifoulant treatment for hulls, outboard motors,
and lower drive units of certain types of marine vessels. They are used to inhibit the growth of fouling organisms such
as barnacles and algae. Atochem manufactures the technical product, an intermediate formulation, and one end-use
product. In October, 1991, under sections 4 and 3(c)2(B) of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide
Act (FIFRA), as amended, a Data Call-in (DCI) for the data necessary for the reregistration of TBTF was issued to certain
registrants of products containing TBTF, including Atochem. Two bridging studies (studies used to justify the use
of data developed on one pesticide for another pesticide) and the associated progress reports required by this DCI
are now overdue, and Atochem's registrations of TBTF are subject to suspension. 



II. Receipt of Request and Notice of Intent to Cancel



Section 6(f) of FIFRA provides that a pesticide registrant may, at any time, request that any of its pesticide registrations
be cancelled. FIFRA further provides that EPA must publish a notice of receipt of any such request in the 

Federal Register

 before acting on the request and provide for a 30-day comment period.

In a letter dated April 21, 1994, Atochem requested voluntary cancellation of its TBTF registrations, EPA registration
numbers 5204-19, 5204-61, and 5204-64. EPA proposes to accept these voluntary cancellations,
and intends to issue a cancellation order for these product registrations immediately after the close of the comment
period.

If, during the 30-day comment period, Atochem chooses to withdraw its request for cancellation, it must submit
a request for withdrawal in writing to the address listed above prior to (insert date 30 days after date of publication
in the 

Federal Register

). Should Atochem withdraw its request for cancellation, its affected registrations of TBTF will remain subject
to suspension until overdue data requirements are satisfied. The Agency will issue a Notice of Intent to Suspend these
registrations as soon as possible after any such withdrawal. 



III. Existing Stocks Determination



In its letter of April 21, 1994, Atochem also requested that EPA allow Atochem a 1-year timeframe to continue
the distribution and sale of existing stocks.

The Agency's established policy for determinations concerning existing stocks was published in the 

Federal Register

 on June 26, 1991 (56 FR 29362). In that Notice, EPA said that it would permit a registrant to sell and distribute existing
stocks for 1 year after the earliest date that the registrant failed to meet an obligation of registration. In addition,
persons other than the registrant would generally be permitted to sell, distribute, or use existing stocks of the
cancelled product until supplies are exhausted.

EPA has determined that Atochem has failed to meet an obligation of reregistration of its TBTF products by its failure
to meet certain data requirements of the DCI of October, 1991, as follows:






EPA has considered the registrant's request for sale and distribution of existing stocks for 1 year. In accordance
with EPA's policy on existing stocks, EPA has determined that the 1 year for existing stocks sale, distribution, and
use by Atochem or its agents began January 8, 1993, the earliest date that the registrant failed to meet an obligation
of reregistration, and expired January 8, 1994. Therefore, Atochem will not be permitted to sell, distribute, or
use existing stocks as of the effective date of cancellation. Furthermore, it is Atochem's responsibility as the
basic registrant to notifiy any and all supplemental registrants of its product(s) that this Agency action also applies
to their supplementally registered products. Registrants may be held liable for violations committed by their supplemental
registrants. Other dealers and distributors will be permitted to sell and distribute existing stocks of affected
Atochem products until stocks are exhausted. End users may use existing stocks until stocks are exhausted.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
Part I. Introduction


A. Goals of the Administration on Developmental Disabilities


The Administration on Developmental Disabilities (ADD) is located within the Administration for Children and Families
(ACF), Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS). Although different from the other ACF program administrations
in the specific populations it serves, ADD shares a common set of goals that promote the economic and social well-being
of families, children, individuals and communities. Through national leadership, ACF and ADD envision:
 Families and individuals empowered to increase their own economic independence and productivity;
 Strong, healthy, supportive communities having a positive impact on the quality of life and the development
of children;
 Partnerships with individuals, front-line service providers, communities, States and Congress that enable
solutions which transcend traditional agency boundaries;
 Services planned and integrated to improve client access; and

 A strong commitment to working with Native Americans, persons with developmental disabilities, refugees
and migrants to address their needs, strengths and abilities. 

Emphasis on these goals and progress toward them will help more individuals, including people with developmental
disabilities, to live productive and independent lives integrated into their communities. The Projects of National
Significance Program is one means through which ADD promotes the achievement of these goals. 



B. Purpose of the Administration on Developmental Disabilities 



The Administration on Developmental Disabilities (ADD) is the lead agency within ACF and DHHS responsible for planning
and administering programs which promote the self-sufficiency and protect the rights of persons with developmental
disabilities. 

The Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights Act (42 U.S.C. 6000, 

et seq.

) (the Act) supports and provides assistance to States and public and private nonprofit agencies and organizations
to assure that individuals with developmental disabilities and their families participate in the design of and have
access to culturally competent services, supports, and other assistance and opportunities that promote independence,
productivity and integration and inclusion into the community. 

The Act points out that: 

 Disability is a natural part of the human experience that does not diminish the right of individuals with developmental
disabilities to enjoy the opportunity for independence, productivity and inclusion into the community; 

 Individuals whose disabilities occur during their developmental period frequently have severe disabilities
that are likely to continue indefinitely; 

 Individuals with developmental disabilities often require lifelong specialized services and assistance,
provided in a coordinated and culturally competent manner by many agencies, professionals, advocates, community
representatives, and others to eliminate barriers and to meet the needs of such individuals and their families; 

The Act further finds that: 

 Individuals with developmental disabilities, including those with the most severe developmental disabilities,
are capable of achieving independence, productivity, and integration and inclusion into the community, and often
require the provision of services, supports and other assistance to achieve such; 

 Individuals with developmental disabilities have competencies, capabilities and personal goals that should
be recognized, supported, and encouraged, and any assistance to such individuals should be provided in an individualized
manner, consistent with the unique strengths, resources, priorities, concerns, abilities, and capabilities of
the individual; 

 Individuals with developmental disabilities and their families are the primary decision makers regarding
the services and supports such individuals and their families receive; and play decision making roles in policies
and programs that affect the lives of such individuals and their families; and 

 It is in the nation's interest for people with developmental disabilities to be employed, and to live conventional
and independent lives as a part of families and communities. 

Toward these ends, ADD seeks to enhance the capabilities of families in assisting people with developmental disabilities
to achieve their maximum potential to support the increasing ability of people with developmental disabilities
to exercise greater choice and self-determination; to engage in leadership activities in their communities; as
well as to ensure the protection of their legal and human rights.

Programs funded under the Act are: 

 Federal assistance to State developmental disabilities councils; 

 State system for the protection and advocacy of individual rights; 

 Grants to university affiliated programs for interdisciplinary training, exemplary services, technical
assistance, and information dissemination; and 

 Grants for Projects of National Significance. 



Part II. Background Information 



A. Description of Projects of National Significance 



Under Part E of the Act, grants and contracts are awarded for projects of national significance that support the development
of national and State policy to enhance the independence, productivity, and integration and inclusion of individuals
with developmental disabilities through: 


 Data collection and analysis; 

 Technical assistance to enhance the quality of State developmental disabilities councils, protection and
advocacy systems, and university affiliated programs; and 

 Other projects of sufficient size and scope that hold promise to expand or improve opportunities for people
with developmental disabilities, including:




_Technical assistance for the development of information and referral systems; 

_Educating policy makers; 

_Federal interagency initiatives; 

_The enhancement of participation of racial and ethnic groups in public and private sector initiatives in developmental
disabilities; 

_Transition of youth with developmental disabilities from school to adult life; and 

_Special pilots and evaluation studies to explore the expansion of programs under part B (State developmental disabilities
councils) to individuals with severe disabilities other than developmental disabilities. 



B. Comments on FY 1994 Proposed Priority Areas 



The notice soliciting comments on the FY 1994 proposed priority areas was published in the 

Federal Register

 on February 24, 1994. A 60 day period was required to allow the public to comment on the proposed areas. After review
and analysis of these comments, ADD is publishing its final priorities in this announcement. 

The public comment notice requested specific comments and suggestions on the proposed funding priorities, in addition
to recommendations for additional priority areas which would assist in bringing about the increased independence,
productivity, and integration into the community of people with developmental disabilities. 

ADD received a total of 52 letters and 93 individual comments in response to the public comment notice. The majority
of the comments expressed support of the priority areas. Other comments were supportive of the priority areas, but
suggested changes. 

Agencies which commented were identified as follows: 

 Advocacy agencies, which includes national organizations and associations, national advocacy groups and
State/local advocacy groups; 

 Service organizations, which includes agencies that provide services for individuals with developmental
disabilities as well as providing advocacy services on behalf of a particular disability, including developmental
disabilities councils; 

 Educational systems, which includes schools, colleges and universities, programs located within a university
setting (CA/N, R&TC, youth w/disabilities) and university affiliated programs; 

 Private agencies, which includes national, State and local non-profit organizations; 

 Government agencies, which includes Federal, State, county and local government agencies; 

 Private individuals; and 

 Foundations.

<TEXT>
 

The comments ranged from requests for copies of the final application solicitation to general support to substantive,
insightful responses for this year's proposed funding priorities and recommendations for other priority areas.
Few of the comments provided specific guidance on the development of the final priority areas. Rather, the majority
were supportive of and expanded upon what we proposed in the announcement, in addition to relating specifically to
the program goals and priorities of the particular agencies submitting the comments. 

The comments received were helpful in highlighting the concerns of the developmental disabilities field and have
been used in refining the final priority areas. 



Comment: 

24 letters were submitted to ADD recommending additional funding priorities for FY 1994. Suggestions included best
practice and systems change, development of standards, and training in Personal Assistance Services (PAS); projects
that focus on the integration into community activities of families who have a child who is medically fragile and severely
disabled; a project that cares for children with HIV/AIDS; projects on home ownership; dissemination of information
to families and practitioners; and aging and developmental disabilities. 



Response: 

ADD funded five PAS projects in FY 1993. We continue to fund those projects and support a variety of other activities
in the area of personal assistance services. 

Although ADD has not funded any recent projects on community integration of individuals with severe disabilities
or medically fragile children through the PNS program, we continue to support projects and activities in this area
through the university affiliated program. 

ADD funded five HIV/AIDS projects from FY 1990-1992. We continue to support HIV/AIDS projects and activities
through the university affiliated program. 

ADD funded two projects on home ownership from FY 1991-1994. We also awarded a five year grant in FY 1993 to the
university affiliated program at the University of New Hampshire to establish a national information network on
consumer based housing. 

ADD supports a number of grant-related activities that focus on dissemination of information on issues relating
to developmental disabilities. It has become a requirement of each grant award made. 

We continue to fund projects on elderly persons with disabilities through the university affiliated program's Training
Initiative component. 

ADD appreciates the suggestions for additional priority areas for this fiscal year. While we are unable to add new

priority areas at this time because of budget constraints, we will consider these suggestions and recommendations
for future grant announcements. 



Comment: 

ADD received 34 comments on Proposed Priority Area 1, Leadership Education and Development of Individuals with Disabilities
and Their Families from Culturally Diverse Backgrounds. The majority of the comments received in this priority area
were supportive of what was proposed in the published notice. However, some of the comments provided recommendations
for project design and specific suggestions for how the projects should be funded (based on the particular focus of
the organization submitting the comments). There was also a letter writing campaign from advocacy groups supporting
strong linkages to and between ADD's national network associations. That writing campaign also included adding
a qualifier to the grant requirements regarding composition of the funded agencies board of directors (at least 51%
individuals with disabilities or family members of individuals with disabilities). Another letter writer suggested
that we collaborate our activities with other Federal and State agencies. There was a suggestion that the requirements
of the final priority area be specific about how information would be disseminated as well as how the project would
be evaluated. There were also numerous recommendations for ADD to specifically focus its FY 1994 efforts on Youth
Leadership Development.

Response:

 The above comments are representative of the comments received in this priority area. We will make every effort to
coordinate this priority area's activities with the Department of Education and other Federal agencies. We will
also make every effort to collaborate with our national network associations during the funded projects' grant period.
We agree with the recommendation for information dissemination and evaluation. The final priority area project
design requirements include dissemination, evaluation, and composition of the project's advisory body. In addition,
because there was interest expressed that ADD focus this priority area on youth leadership development, the final
leadership education and development priority area will be an inclusive one_to cover individuals and families of
all ages. 



Comment:

 ADD received fifteen comments on Proposed Priority Area 2, Expanding the Scope of Developmental Disabilities Councils.
The majority of the comments received in this priority area were supportive of what ADD proposed in the published notice.
Some of the comments also provided recommendations for project length, specific suggestions for which Councils
should be eligible for funding, and ideas on project design. There were two non-supportive letters submitted in this
priority area. Those letters will be addressed at the end of this discussion. 

There was a recommendation that the project conduct an assessment of the population of persons with disabilities
served by the developmental disabilities network (Developmental Disabilities Councils, University Affiliated
Programs, and Protection and Advocacy Systems) in their States. Several writers suggested that participation in
the fifteen month pilot studies not be limited to just the additional five States. It was also noted that six months
to complete the short-term study would be too short of a time frame. ADD was also encouraged to receive input for the
studies from the States and not limit participation to the network associations. We were cautioned that each of the
DD program components not lose sight of their specific mission and focus during the expansion studies. This was reiterated
in one of the non-supportive letters, in addition to the fact that expansion would duplicate the efforts of other State
and Federally funded agencies. The other non-supportive letter indicated that the Councils were not adequately
addressing the issues of the disability groups they already serve, and suggested that the Councils make some changes
in the way they do business before they take on expansion. 



Response:

 The expansion priority area is a legislatively mandated activity. ADD is limited in the number of States to participate
in the pilot studies or the length of time to complete each phase of the expansion study. In addition, the short term
study of Councils and the national study have already been funded under a separate contractual solicitation. The
fifteen month pilot studies are the only part of the expansion study to be funded through this grant announcement.
We do, however, agree with the remainder of the comments (including the non-supportive ones) and the final priority
area reflects such, as well as a sensitivity to specific foci of Councils and their ability to take on expansion activities
without negatively impacting their original mission. 



Comment:

 ADD received three comments on providing technical assistance (through separate contractual solicitations) to
improve the functions of the developmental disabilities planning council, protection and advocacy system, and
the university affiliated program; and to develop information and referral systems. Two letters supported and expanded
upon what we proposed. One letter was non-supportive. The supportive letters recommended specific technical assistance
activities, i.e., ongoing technical assistance and information and referral on cultural diversity; and technical
assistance activities on self-advocacy of consumers. The one non-supportive letter 
requested that the technical assistance contract solicitations be provided to all Councils, P&As, and UAPs,
and not a sole source contractor.

Response:

 The technical assistance component of the PNS program is a legislatively mandated activity targeted at supporting
and improving the functions of the developmental disabilities program components (Councils, P&As, and UAPs).
Contract awards for technical assistance to UAPs and P&As are in their last year of funding. A full and open competition
for UAP and P&A technical assistance funds will be announced during the FY 1995 PNS funding cycle. Likewise, an
announcement for a full and open competition for technical assistance funds for Councils has been made through the
ACF procurement process. Technical assistance for information and referral systems will not be announced this fiscal
year, but considered for future PNS funding announcements. 



Comment:

 ADD received two comments on funding projects through demonstrations as well as procurements that would ensure the
integration and active participation of racial and ethnic groups into the ``mainstream'' of theservice delivery
system. Both letters recommended that we offer an additional solicitation for a data collection and analysis project
to establish a national multicultural database. 



Response:

 The FY 1994 PNS program budget is limited in providing funds for additional grants and contracts. Therefore, these
recommendations will not be considered this fiscal year, but considered for future PNS announcements. 



Comment:

 ADD received fifteen general comments, the majority of which were supportive of what we proposed for our FY 1994 funding
priorities. Several comments were received that commended us for the way in which we approached this year's priorities,
but wanted to see changes in the focus of the priority areas. 



Response:

 We appreciate the input and commendations given for this year's priority areas. We believe the final priority areas
reflect the input received from the public comment process and a sensitivity to the concerns expressed in each of the
letters received. 



Part III. The Review Process 



A. Eligible Applicants 



Before applications are reviewed, each will be screened to determine that the applicant is eligible for funding,
as specified under the selected priority area. Applications from organizations which do not meet the eligibility
requirements for the priority area will not be considered or reviewed in the competition, and the applicant will be
so informed. 

Only public or non-profit private entities, 

not individuals,

 are eligible to apply under any of the priority areas. On all applications developed jointly by more than one agency
or organization, the applications must identify only one organization as the lead organization and official applicant.
The other participating agencies and organizations can be included as co-participants, subgrantees or subcontractors.


Any non-profit organization submitting an application must submit proof of its non-profit status in its application
at the time of submission. One means of accomplishing this is by the non-profit agency providing a copy of the applicant's
listing in the Internal Revenue Service's most recent list of tax-exempt organizations described in section 501(c)(3)
of the IRS code 

or

 by providing a copy of the currently valid IRS tax exemption certificate. 

ADD cannot fund a non-profit applicant without acceptable proof of its non-profit status. 



B. Review Process and Funding Decisions 



Applications from eligible applicants that meet the deadline date requirements under Part V, Section C will be reviewed
and scored competitively. Experts in the field, generally persons from outside of the Federal government, will use
the appropriate evaluation criteria listed later in this part to review and score the applications. The results of
this review are a primary factor in making funding decisions. 





</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940707-2-00077 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940707-2-00049 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

ADD reserves the option of discussing applications with, or referring them to, other Federal or non-Federal funding
sources when this is determined to be in the best interest of the Federal government or the applicant. It may also solicit
comments from ADD Regional Office staff, other Federal agencies, interested foundations, national organizations,
specialists, experts, States and the general public. These comments, along with those of the expert reviewers, will
be considered by ADD in making funding decisions.

In making decisions on awards, ADD may give preference to applications which focus on or feature: Culturally diverse
racial or ethnic populations; a substantially innovative strategy with the potential to improve theory or practice
in the field of human services; a model practice or set of procedures that holds the potential for replication by organizations
involved in the administration or delivery of human services; substantial involvement of volunteers; substantial
involvement (either financial or programmatic) of the private sector; a favorable balance between Federal and non-Federal
funds available for the proposed project; the potential for high benefit for low Federal investment; a programmatic
focus on those most in need; and/or substantial involvement in the proposed project by national or community foundations.

To the greatest extent possible, efforts will be made to ensure that funding decisions reflect an equitable distribution
of assistance among the States and geographical regions of the country, rural and urban areas, and ethnic populations.
In making these decisions, ADD may also take into account the need to avoid unnecessary duplication of effort.



C. Evaluation Criteria



Using the evaluation criteria below, a panel of at least three reviewers (primarily experts from outside the Federal
government) will review the applications. Applicants should ensure that they address each minimum requirement
in the priority area description under the appropriate section of the Program Narrative Statement.

Reviewers will determine the strengths and weaknesses of each proposal in terms of the evaluation criteria, provide
comments and assign numerical scores. The point value following each criterion heading indicates the maximum numerical
weight that each section may be given in the review process.



1. Objectives and Need for Assistance (20 points)



The extent to which the application pinpoints any relevant physical, economic, social, financial, institutional
or other problems requiring a solution; demonstrates the need for the assistance; States the principal and subordinate
objectives of the project; provides supporting documentation or other testimonies from concerned interests other
than the applicant; and includes and/or footnotes relevant data based on the results of planning studies. The application
must identify the precise location of the project and area to be served by the proposed project. Maps and other graphic
aids may be attached.



2. Results or Benefits Expected (20 points)



The extent to which the application identifies the results and benefits to be derived, the extent to which they are
consistent with the objectives of the proposal, and the extent to which the application indicates the anticipated
contributions to policy, practice, theory and/or research. The extent to which the proposed project costs are reasonable
in view of the expected results.



3. Approach (35 points)



The extent to which the application outlines a sound and workable plan of action pertaining to the scope of the project,
and details how the proposed work will be accomplished; cites factors which might accelerate or decelerate the work,
giving acceptable reasons for taking this approach as opposed to others; describes and supports any unusual features
of the project, such as design or technological innovations, reductions in cost or time, or extraordinary social
and community involvements; and provides for projections of the accomplishments to be achieved. It lists the activities
to be carried out in chronological order, showing a reasonable schedule of accomplishments and target dates.

The extent to which, when applicable, the application identifies the kinds of data to be collected and maintained,
and discusses the criteria to be used to evaluate the results and successes of the project. The extent to which the application
describes the evaluation methodology that will be used to determine if the needs identified and discussed are being
met and if the results and benefits identified are being achieved. The application also lists each organization,
agency, consultant, or other key individuals or groups who will work on the project, along with a description of the
activities and nature of their effort or contribution.

<PARENT> FR940707-2-00049 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

4. Staff Background and Organization's Experience (25 points)



The application identifies the background of the project director/principal investigator and key project staff
(including name, address, training, educational background and other qualifying experience) and the experience
of the organization to demonstrate the applicant's ability to effectively and efficiently administer this project.
The application describes the relationship between this project and other work planned, anticipated or underway
by the applicant which is being supported by Federal assistance.



D. Structure of Priority Area Descriptions



Each priority area description is composed of the following sections:

 

Eligible Applicants:

 This section specifies the type of organization which is eligible to apply under the particular priority area.

 

Purpose: 

This section presents the basic focus and/or broad goal(s) of the priority area.

 

Background Information: 

This section briefly discusses the legislative background as well as the current state-of-the-art and/or current
state-of-practice that supports the need for the particular priority area activity. Relevant information on projects
previously funded by ACF and/or other State models are noted, where applicable.

 

Minimum Requirements for Project Design: 

This section presents the basic set of issues that must be addressed in the application. Typically, they relate to
project design, evaluation, and community involvement. This section also asks for specific information on the proposed
project. Inclusion and discussion of these items is important since they will be used by the reviewers in evaluating
the applications against the evaluation criteria. Project products, continuation of the project effort after the
Federal support ceases, and dissemination/utilization activities, if appropriate, are also addressed.

 

Project Duration: 

This section specifies the maximum allowable length of time for the project period; it refers to the amount of time
for which Federal funding is available.

 

Federal Share of Project Costs: 

This section specifies the maximum amount of Federal support for the project.

 

Matching Requirement: 

This section specifies the minimum non-Federal contribution, either through cash or in-kind match, that is required
to the maximum Federal funds requested for the project.

 

Anticipated Number of Projects To Be Funded: 

This section specifies the number of projects that ADD anticipates it will fund in the priority area.

 

CFDA: 

This section identifies the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA) number and title of the program under which
applications in this priority area will be funded. This information is needed to complete item 10 on the SF 424.

Please note that applicants that do not comply with the specific priority area requirements in the section on ``

Eligible Applicants

'' will not be reviewed.

Applicants must clearly identify the specific priority area under which they wish to have their applications considered,
and tailor their applications accordingly. In addition, previous experience has shown that an application which
is broader and more general in concept than outlined in the priority area description is less likely to score as well
as one which is more clearly focused on and directly responsive to the concerns of that specific priority area.



E. Available Funds



ADD intends to award new grants resulting from this announcement during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 1994, subject
to the availability of funding. The size of the actual awards will vary. Each priority area description includes information
on the maximum Federal share of the project costs and the anticipated number of projects to be funded.

The term ``budget period'' refers to the interval of time (usually 12 months) into which a multi-year period of assistance
(project period) is divided for budgetary and funding purposes. The term ``project period'' refers to the total time
a project is approved for support, including any extensions.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940707-2-00079 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940707-2-00049 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Where appropriate, applicants may propose project periods which are shorter than the maximums specified in the various
priority areas. Non-Federal share contributions may exceed the minimums specified in the various priority areas
when the applicant is able to do so. 
For multi-year projects, continued Federal funding beyond the first budget period, but within the approved project
period, is subject to the availability of funds, satisfactory progress of the grantee and a determination that continued
funding would be in the best interest of the Government. 


F. Grantee Share of Project Costs 


Other than the exception described below, Federal funds will be provided to cover up to 75% of the total allowable project
costs. The total allowable project costs are the sum of the ACF share and the non-Federal share. Therefore, the non-Federal
share must amount to at least 25% of the total (Federal plus non-Federal) project cost. This means that, for every $3
in Federal funds received, up to the maximum amount allowable under each priority area, applicants must contribute
at least $1. For example, the cost breakout for a project costing $100,000 to implement would be:

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940707-2-00080 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940707-2-00049 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The exception to the grantee cost sharing requirement relates to applications originating from American Samoa,
Guam, the Virgin Islands, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. Applications from these areas are
covered under section 501(d) of Pub. L. 95-134, which requires that the Department waive ``any requirement
for local matching funds for grants under $200,000.'' 
The applicant contribution must generally be secured from non-Federal sources. Except as provided by Federal statute,
a cost-sharing or matching requirement may not be met by costs borne by another Federal grant. However, funds from
some Federal programs benefitting Tribes and Native American organizations have been used to provide valid sources
of matching funds. If this is the case for a Tribe or Native American organization submitting an application to ADD,
that organization should identify the programs which will be providing the funds for the match in its application.
If the application successfully competes for PNS grant funds, ADD will determine whether there is statutory authority
for this use of the funds. The Administration for Native Americans and the DHHS Office of General Counsel will assist
ADD in making this determination. 
The non-Federal share of total project costs may be in the form of grantee-incurred costs and/or third party in-kind
contributions. ADD strongly encourages applicants to meet their match requirement through a cash contribution,
as opposed to an in-kind contribution. For further information on in-kind contributions, refer to the instructions
for completing the SF 424A_Budget Information, in Part IV. 
The required amount of non-Federal share to be met by the applicant is the amount indicated in the approved application.
Grant recipients will be required to provide the agreed upon non-Federal share, even if this exceeds 25% (or other
required portion) of the project costs. Therefore, an applicant should ensure the availability of any amount proposed
as match prior to including it in its budget. 
The non-Federal share must be met by a grantee during the life of the project. Otherwise, ADD will disallow any unmatched
Federal funds. 


G. Cooperation in Evaluation Efforts 


Grantees funded by ADD may be requested to cooperate in evaluation efforts funded by ADD. The purpose of these evaluation
activities is to learn from the combined experience of multiple projects funded under a particular priority area.



H. Closed Captioning for Audiovisual Efforts 


Applicants are encouraged to include ``closed captioning'' in the development of any audiovisual products. 


Part IV. Fiscal Year 1994 Priority Areas for Projects of National Significance 


The following section presents the final priority areas for Fiscal Year 1994 Projects of National Significance (PNS)
and solicits the appropriate applications. 


Fiscal Year 1994 Priority Area 1: Leadership Education and Development of Individuals With Disabilities and Their
Families From Culturally Diverse Backgrounds 


 

Eligible Applicants:

 State agencies, public or private nonprofit organizations, institutions or agencies. 
 

Purpose:

 Under this priority area, ADD will award demonstration grant funds on Leadership Education and Development of Individuals
With Disabilities and Their Families From Culturally Diverse Backgrounds. The lead initiative intends to target
individuals with developmental disabilities and their families from culturally diverse backgrounds to enable
them to impact service delivery and fully access the services they need. This priority area is also a very inclusive
one meant to cover individuals and families of all ages. However, we are particularly interested in proposals that
foster the leadership development of young adults (15-25 years of age). 
These projects would strengthen the ability of individuals with developmental disabilities and their families
from culturally diverse backgrounds to serve as leaders and advocates on critical issues in the developmental disabilities
field in the nation, and in their own communities. 
 

Background Information:

 Demographic trends continue to rapidly change the character of our Nation. As communities become more culturally,
ethnically, and racially diverse, the need has increased to assist individuals from culturally diverse backgrounds
and their families in the development and implementation of effective methods of communication that increase public
awareness, inform individuals from other ethnic groups with disabilities of issues and services, and develop and
implement networking strategies that improve access to community resources. Therefore, it is imperative to include
persons with disabilities who are from diverse cultural and ethnic backgrounds in all aspects of service delivery.

The institutionalization of action strategies that promote culturally competent policies and practices which
are family-centered and community-based will depend on the ease with which physicians and other practitioners successfully
incorporate ethnic and cultural factors in their work. For example, issues of importance may include: cultural and
ethnic background of the health care professionals; sensitivity and competence of the health care professionals
to deal with cultural and ethnic factors; or language and the strength of cultural and ethnic identification. 

 

Minimum Requirements for Project Design: 

ADD is seeking Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), grassroots organizations, racial and ethnic
coalitions, civil rights and other private non-profit organizations experienced in working with culturally diverse
populations to develop successful models for accessing services; and supporting the ability of these constituencies
with developmental disabilities to perform leadership functions, and make their own choices_personal or professional.


In order to successfully compete under this priority area, the application must include activities which would:


 Strengthen the ability of members of culturally diverse racial and ethnic groups with disabilities to serve
as leaders and advocates on critical issues in the developmental disabilities field, particularly in their own communities;


 Enable and actively support members of culturally diverse racial and ethnic groups with disabilities and
their families to take part in and benefit from advocacy in accessing health care services; recreational activities,
public education efforts and employment programs; 

 Support and train members of culturally diverse racial and ethnic groups with disabilities and their families
to participate on boards of organizations that plan for and make decisions on their behalf; 

 Support and train members of culturally diverse racial and ethnic groups and their families in establishing
effective methods of communication at the community level, and establishing collaborative relationships between
local systems in the provision of individualized services that they have choice and control of; 

 Develop and implement public awareness campaigns and other written materials specifically geared toward
members of culturally diverse groups with disabilities to inform them of the services available in their catchment
areas; 

 Provide evidence of the applicant's ability to establish an advisory board comprised of 51% persons with disabilities
and 51% persons from culturally diverse groups. Applicants must also commit to including members of the project's
advisory body into the board membership of the organization. A plan to accomplish this goal must be submitted to ADD;
and 

 Provide leadership development and training to increase and strengthen active participation by individuals
with developmental disabilities and their families from culturally diverse racial and ethnic backgrounds. 

 Proposals should also include provisions for the travel of two key personnel during the first and last year
of the project to Washington, DC. for a one day meeting with ADD staff. 

 Describe an evaluation component which will measure the project's effectiveness in achieving desired objectives.


 In addition, proposals should provide for the widespread dissemination of their products (reports, summary
documents, audio-visual materials, and the like) in accessible formats. A plan to accomplish this goal must be submitted
to ADD. 

 

Project Duration:

 This announcement is soliciting applications for project periods up to three years under this priority area. Awards,
on a competitive basis, will be for a one-year budget period, although project periods may be for three years. Applications
for continuation grants funded under this priority area beyond the one-year budget period, but within the three year
project period, will be entertained in subsequent years on a non-competitive basis, subject to the availability
of funds, satisfactory progress of the grantee and determination that continued funding would be in the best interest
of the Government.

Federal Share of Project Costs:

 The maximum Federal share is not to exceed $100,000 for the first 12-month budget period or a maximum of $300,000 for
a 3-year project period. 

 

Matching Requirement:

 The minimum non-Federal matching requirement in proportion to the maximum Federal share of $300,000 is $100,000
for a 3-year project period. This constitutes 25 percent of the total project budget. 

 

Anticipated Number of Projects to be Funded:

 It is anticipated that up to two (2) projects will be funded. 

 

CFDA:

 ADD's CFDA (Code of Federal Domestic Assistance) number is 93.631_Developmental Disabilities_Projects of National
Significance. 



Fiscal Year 1993 Priority Area 2: Expanding the Scope of Developmental Disabilities Planning Councils 



 

Eligible Applicants:

 State Developmental Disabilities Councils (DDCs) in States with approved State plans and assurances as required
by the Act which do not have a State mandate to focus on individuals with disabilities other than developmental disabilities.


 

Purpose:

 Under this priority area, ADD will award up to five (5) individual grants at a maximum of $150,000 and/or one or more
consortium grants to consortiums including a total of no more than five States to explore the implications of expanding
the current scope of DDC activities to include individuals with a broad range of severe disabilities. Individuals
with severe disabilities other than developmental disabilities can and have benefitted from the systems change,
capacity building and advocacy activities of the DDCs. ADD is interested in determining the feasibility and implications
of expanding the focus constituency of the DDCs in States differing in size, population, geographical distribution,
and allotments received under Part B of the Act. 

 

Background Information:

 While individuals with developmental disabilities and their families directly benefit from DDC advocacy, systemic
change, and capacity building activities, there are many people with severe disabilities other than developmental
disabilities who might benefit further if their concerns were within the purview of DDCs. Therefore, ADD is accepting
proposals, as mandated through a special initiative under Part E of the Act, for studies in consultation with and active
support from State Protection and Advocacy Systems and University Affiliated Programs, to explore the feasibility
and implications of expanding the scope of DDC systems change, capacity building, advocacy and other activities
mandated under Part B of the Act to address the issues and concerns of people with a broader range of severe disabilities.
ADD is looking for information which examines the potential effect, positive and/or adverse, of expanding the target
constituency to include individuals with severe disabilities whose eligibility will be based on an extended age
of onset and other determining criteria. 

 

Minimum Requirements for Project Design:

 These projects must be conducted in consultation with and active support from the State Protection and Advocacy System
and the University Affiliated Program. Through this collaboration, DDCs should conduct an assessment of the characteristics
of individuals with disabilities currently served by all three ADD-funded networks in their States and address consumer
comments and 1990 report findings, particularly those pertaining to individuals who are unserved or underserved.
The project must address the needs of individuals with developmental disabilities and other severe disabilities
from culturally diverse racial and ethnic backgrounds. Individuals with disabilities, advocacy groups, and State
and other service agencies must play a role in these studies. 

ADD is particularly interested in supporting projects which include the following: 

 Propose criteria which define the constituency to be served through potential DDC expansion (e.g.; age, functional
limitations, or other factors such as individuals from culturally diverse racial and ethnic backgrounds, disadvantaged
individuals, individuals with limited-English proficiency, individuals from underserved geographic areas,
or specific groups of individuals with severe disabilities, including individuals with developmental or other
disabilities attributable to physical impairment, mental impairment, or a combination of physical and mental impairments).


 Identify the service and support needs of the expanded population of individuals with severe disabilities
other than developmental disabilities, and provide strategies that will assist all such individuals and their families,
the developmental disabilities network, and others, in effecting positive changes on their behalf. 

 Identify State and local linkages that would be essential to establishing collaborative relationships with
service organizations. 

 Delineate the barriers, opportunities, and critical issues related to DDC expansion to a broader range of
disabilities as well as other economic and organizational implications, and the allocation of resources. 

 Define outreach activities and collaborative relationships with other State agencies, organizations,
task forces and commissions, and the impact of these relationships on systems change, advocacy and capacity building
for the expanded constituency. 

 Explore the effects of expansion activities on the staff support and other resources of the DDC. Provide a cost
analysis of the proposed expansion.

 Describe how Federal, State, or other funds would be used. 

 Identify the potential for, and the strategies to avoid, duplication of activities funded by the State or by
other Federal agencies. 

 Describe the anticipated changes in DDC board membership, agency policies and procedures, and other requirements
necessary to respond to the needs of the expanded constituency. 

 

Project Duration:

 This announcement is soliciting applications for a 15-month project period to meet the legislative provision for
a 15-month investigation under this priority area. Awards, on a competitive basis, will be for a 15-month budget period.
Applications for continuation grants will not be entertained. 

 

Federal Share of Project Costs:

 The maximum Federal share is not to exceed $150,000 for the 15-month budget period for individual DD Council grants
and/or $750,000 for one or more consortium grants to consortiums that include a total of no more than five States for
the 15-month budget period. 

 

Matching Requirement:

 The minimum non-Federal matching requirement in proportion to the maximum Federal share of $150,000 is $50,000 for
a 15-month project period for individual DD Council grants. The minimum non-Federal matching requirement in proportion
to the maximum Federal share of $750,000 is $250,000 for a 15-month project period for one consortium grant. This constitutes
25 percent of the total project budget. 

 

Anticipated Number of Projects to be Funded:

 It is anticipated that up to five individual DD Council expansion studies and/or at least one consortium DD Council
expansion project will be funded. 

 

CFDA:

 ADD's CFDA (Code of Federal Domestic Assistance) number is 93.631_Developmental Disabilities_Projects of National
Significance. This information is needed to complete item 10 on the SF 424. 



Fiscal Year 1994 Priority Area 3: Technical Assistance Projects 



(This priority area appeared in the February 1994 announcement without a priority area number designation) 




For this priority area, ADD will be awarding funds separately using the procurement process to provide technical
assistance to improve the functions of the Developmental Disabilities Planning Councils. Protection and Advocacy
Systems, and University Affiliated Programs have ongoing technical assistance contracts and will not be competing
for funds this fiscal year. 



Part V. Instructions for the Development and Submission of Applications 



This Part contains information and instructions for submitting applications in response to this announcement.
Application forms are provided along with a checklist for assembling an application package. Please copy and use
these forms in submitting an application. 

Potential applicants should read this section carefully in conjunction with the information contained within the
specific priority area under which the application is to be submitted. The priority area descriptions are in Part
IV. 



A. Required Notification of the State Single Point of Contact 



All applications under the ADD priority areas are required to follow the Executive Order (E.O.) 12372 process, ``Intergovernmental
Review of Federal Programs,'' and 45 CFR part 100, ``Intergovernmental Review of Department of Health and Human Services
Program and Activities.'' Under the Order, States may design their own processes for reviewing and commenting on
proposed Federal assistance under covered programs. 

All States and territories, except Alabama, Alaska, Connecticut, Hawaii, Idaho, Kansas, Louisiana, Minnesota,
Montana, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Virginia, Washington, American Samoa and Palau,
have elected to participate in the Executive Order process and have established a State Single Point of Contact (SPOC).
Applicants from these 18 jurisdictions need take no action regarding E.O. 12372. Applications for projects to be
administered by Federally-recognized Indian Tribes are also exempt from the requirements of E.O. 12372. Otherwise,
applicants should contact their SPOCs as soon as possible to alert them of the prospective applications and receive
any necessary instructions. 

Applicants must submit all required materials to the SPOC as soon as possible so that the program office can obtain
and review SPOC comments as part of the award process. It is imperative that the applicant submit all required materials
and indicate the date of this submittal (or date SPOC was contact, if no submittal is required) on the SF 424, item 16a.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940707-2-00084 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940707-2-00049 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Under 45 CFR 100.8(a)(2), a SPOC has 60 days from the application due date to comment on proposed new or competing continuation
awards. However, because PNS grant applications are due 30 days from the date of publication, and grants are to be awarded
in September 1994, there is insufficient time to allow for a complete SPOC comment period. Therefore, we have reduced
the comment period to 30 days from the closing date for applications. These comments are reviewed as part of the award
process. Failure to notify the SPOC can result in delays in awarding grants. 

SPOCs are encouraged to eliminate the submission of routine endorsements as official recommendations. Additionally,
SPOCs are requested to clearly differentiate between mere advisory comments and those official State process recommendation
which may trigger the ``accommodate or explain'' rule. 

When comments are submitted directly to ACF, they should be addressed to: Department of Health and Human Services,
Administration for Children and Families, Division of Discretionary Grants, Sixth Floor, 370 L'Enfant Promenade
SW., Washington, DC 20447, Attn: 93.631 ADD_Projects of National Significance. 

Contact information for each State's SPOC is found at the end of this Part. 



B. Notification of State Developmental Disabilities Planning Councils 



A copy of the application must also be submitted for review and comment to the State Developmental Disabilities Council
in each State in which the applicant's project will be conducted. A list of the State Developmental Disabilities Councils
is included at the end of this announcement. 



C. Deadline for Submittal of Applications 



One signed original and two copies of the application must be submitted on or before August 8, 1994 to: Department of
Health and Human Services, Administration for Children and Families, Division of Discretionary Grants, 370 L'Enfant
Promenade SW., 6th Floor, Washington, DC. 20447, Attn: 93.631 ADD_Projects of National Significance.
 
Applications may be mailed or hand-delivered. Hand delivered applications are accepted during the normal working
hours of 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., Monday through Friday. Applications shall be considered as meeting an announced deadline
if they are either: 




1. Received 

on or before

 the deadline date at the ACF Grants Office specified in this section; or 

2. Sent 

on or before

 the deadline date and received by ACF in time for the independent review.




(Applicants are cautioned to request a legibly dated U.S. Postal Service postmark or to obtain a legibly dated receipt
from a commercial carrier or U.S. Postal Service. Private metered postmarks shall not be acceptable as proof of timely
mailing)


 



Late applications:

 Applications which do not meet the criteria stated above are considered late applications. ACF/ADD shall notify
each late applicant that its application will not be considered in the current competition. 



Extension of deadlines:

 ACF may extend the deadline for all applicants due to acts of God, such as floods, hurricanes or earthquakes; or when
there is a widespread disruption of the mails. However, if the granting agency does not extend the deadline for all
applicants, it may not waive or extend the deadline for any applicants.

Local and State governments should enter the amount of indirect costs determined in accordance with HHS requirements.
When an indirect cost rate is requested, these costs are included in the indirect cost pool and should not be charged
again as direct costs to the grant. 
In the case of training grants to other than State or local governments (as defined in title 45, Code of Federal Regulations,
part 74), the Federal reimbursement of indirect costs will be limited to the lesser of the negotiated (or actual) indirect
cost rate or 8 percent of the amount allowed for direct costs, exclusive of any equipment charges, rental of space,
tuition and fees, post-doctoral training allowances, contractual items, and alterations and renovations. 
For training grant applications, the entry under line 6j should be the total indirect costs being charged to the project.
The Federal share of indirect costs is calculated as shown above. The applicant's share is calculated as follows:

(a) Calculate total project indirect costs (a*) by applying the applicant's approved indirect cost rate to the total
project (Federal and non-Federal) direct costs. 
(b) Calculate the Federal share of indirect costs (b*) at 8 percent of the amount allowed for total project (Federal
and non-Federal) direct costs exclusive of any equipment charges, rental of space, tuition and fees, post-doctoral
training allowances, contractual items, and alterations and renovations. 
(c) Subtract (b*) from (a*). The remainder is what the applicant can claim as part of its matching cost contribution.



Justification:

 Enclose a copy of the indirect cost rate agreement. Applicants subject to the limitation on the Federal reimbursement
of indirect costs for training grants should specify this. 


Total_Line 6k.

 Enter the total amounts of lines 6i and 6j. 


Program Income_Line 7.

 Enter the estimated amount of income, if any, expected to be generated from this project. Do not add or subtract this
amount from the total project amount. 


Justification:

 Describe the nature, source, and anticipated use of program income in the Program Narrative Statement. 


Section C_Non-Federal Resources.

 This section summarizes the amounts of non-Federal resources that will be applied to the grant. Enter this information
on line 12 entitled ``Totals.'' In-kind contributions are defined in title 45 of the Code of Federal Regulations,
  74.51 and 92.24, as ``property or services which benefit a grant- supported project or program and which
are contributed by non-Federal third parties without charge to the grantee, the subgrantee, or a cost-type contractor
under the grant or subgrant.'' 


Justification:

 Describe third party in-kind contributions, if included. 


Section D_Forecasted Cash Needs.

 Not applicable. 


Section E_Budget Estimate of Federal Funds Needed For Balance of the Project.

 This section should only be completed if the total project period exceeds 17 months. 


Totals_Line 20.

 For projects that will have more than one budget period, enter the estimated required Federal funds for the second
budget period (months 13 through 24) under column ``(b) First.'' If a third budget period will be necessary, enter
the Federal funds needed for months 25 through 36 under ``(c) Second.'' Columns (d) and (e) are not applicable in most
instances, since ACF funding is almost always limited to a three-year maximum project period. They should remain
blank. 


Section F_Other Budget Information. 
Direct Charges_Line 21.

 Not applicable. 


Indirect Charges_Line 22.

 Enter the type of indirect rate (provisional, predetermined, final or fixed) that will be in effect during the funding
period, the estimated amount of the base to which the rate is applied, and the total indirect expense.

Remarks_Line 23. 

If the total project period exceeds 17 months, you must enter your proposed non-Federal share of the project budget
for each of the remaining years of the project. 



3. Project Summary Description 



Clearly mark this separate page with the applicant name as shown in item 5 of the SF 424, the priority area number as shown
at the top of the SF 424, and the title of the project as shown in item 11 of the SF 424. The summary description should not
exceed 300 words. These 300 words become part of the computer database on each project. 

Care should be taken to produce a summary description which accurately and concisely reflects the proposal. It should
describe the objectives of the project, the approaches to be used and the outcomes expected. The description should
also include a list of major products that will result from the proposed project, such as software packages, materials,
management procedures, data collection instruments, training packages, or videos (please note that audiovisuals
should be closed captioned). The project summary description, together with the information on the SF 424, will constitute
the project ``abstract.'' It is the major source of information about the proposed project and is usually the first
part of the application that the reviewers read in evaluating the application. 



4. Program Narrative Statement 



The Program Narrative Statement is a very important part of an application. It should be clear, concise, and address
the specific requirements mentioned under the priority area description in Part IV. The narrative should also provide
information concerning how the application meets the evaluation criteria, using the following headings:

(a) 

Objectives and Need for Assistance; 

(b) Results and Benefits Expected; 

(c) Approach; 

and 

(d) 

Staff Background and Organization's Experience. 

The specific information to be included under each of these headings is described in Section C of Part III, Evaluation
Criteria. 


The narrative should be typed double-spaced on a single-side of an 81/2
'
' x 11
'
' plain white paper, with 1
'
' margins on all sides. All pages of the narrative (including charts, references/footnotes, tables, maps,
exhibits, etc.) must be sequentially numbered, beginning with ``Objectives and Need for Assistance'' as page number
one. Applicants should not submit reproductions of larger size paper, reduced to meet the size requirement. 

The length of the application, including the application forms and all attachments, should not exceed 60 pages. A
page is a single side of an 81/2
'
' x 11
'
' sheet of paper. Applicants are requested not to send pamphlets, brochures or other printed material along
with their application as these pose xeroxing difficulties. These materials, if submitted, will not be included
in the review process if they exceed the 60-page limit. Each page of the application will be counted to determine the
total length. 



5. Organizational Capability Statement 



The Organizational Capability Statement should consist of a brief (two to three pages) background description of
how the applicant organization (or the unit within the organization that will have responsibility for the project)
is organized, the types and quantity of services it provides, and/or the research and management capabilities it
possesses. This description should cover capabilities not included in the Program Narrative Statement. It may include
descriptions of any current or previous relevant experience, or describe the competence of the project team and its
demonstrated ability to produce a final product that is readily comprehensible and usable. An organization chart
showing the relationship of the project to the current organization should be included. 



6. Part V_Assurances/Certifications 



Applicants are required to file an SF 424B, Assurances_Non-Construction Programs and the Certification Regarding
Lobbying. Both must be signed and returned with the application. Applicants must also provide certifications regarding:
(1) Drug-Free Workplace Requirements; and (2) Debarment and Other Responsibilities. These two certifications
are self-explanatory. Copies of these assurances/certifications are reprinted at the end of this announcement
and should be reproduced, as necessary. A duly authorized representative of the applicant organization must certify
that the applicant is in compliance with these assurances/certifications. A signature on the SF 424 indicates compliance
with the Drug Free Workplace Requirements, and Debarment and Other Responsibilities certifications, and need not
be mailed back with the application. 

In addition, applicants are required under section 162(c)(3) of the Act to provide assurances that the human rights
of all individuals with developmental disabilities (especially those individuals without familial protection)
who will receive services under projects assisted under Part E will be protected consistent with section 110 (relating
to the rights of individuals with developmental disabilities). Each application must include a statement providing
this assurance. 

For research projects in which human subjects may be at risk, a Protection of Human Subjects Assurance may be required.
If there is a question regarding the applicability of this assurance, contact the Office for Research Risks of the
National Institutes of Health at (301) 496-7041.

Instructions for the SF 424


This is a standard form used by applicants as a required facesheet for preapplications and applications submitted
for Federal assistance. It will be used by Federal agencies to obtain applicant certification that States which have

complete address of the applicant, and name and telephone number of the person to contact on matters related to this
application.
6. Enter Employer Identification Number (EIN) as assigned by the Internal Revenue Service.

Instructions for the SF-424A





General Instructions





This form is designed so that application can be made for funds from one or more grant programs. In preparing the budget,
adhere to any existing Federal grantor agency guidelines which prescribe how and whether budgeted amounts should
be separately shown for different functions or activities within the program. For some programs, grantor agencies
may require budgets to be separately shown by function or activity. For other programs, grantor agencies may require
a breakdown by function or activity. Sections A, B, C, and D should include budget estimates for the whole project except
when applying for assistance which requires Federal authorization in annual or other funding period increments.
In the latter case, Sections A, B, C, and D should provide the budget for the first budget period (usually a year) and
Section E should present the need for Federal assistance in the subsequent budget periods. All applications should
contain a breakdown by the object class categories shown in Lines a-k of Section B.






Section A. Budget Summary Lines 1-4, Columns (a) and (b)






For applications pertaining to a 

single

 Federal grant program (Federal Domestic Assistance Catalog number) and 

not requiring

 a functional or activity breakdown, enter on Line 1 under Column (a) the catalog program title and the catalog number
in Column (b).

For applications pertaining to a 

single

 program 

requiring

 budget amounts by multiple functions or activities, enter the name of each activity or function on each line in Column
(a), and enter the catalog number in Column (b). For applications pertaining to multiple programs where none of the
programs require a breakdown by function or activity, enter the catalog program title on each line in 

Column

 (a) and the respective catalog number on each line in Column (b).

For applications pertaining to 

multiple

 programs where one or more programs 

require

 a breakdown by function or activity, prepare a separate sheet for each program requiring the breakdown. Additional
sheets should be used when one form does not provide adequate space for all breakdown of data required. However, when
more than one sheet is used, the first page should provide the summary totals by programs.






Lines 1-4, Columns (c) through (g.)








For new applications, 

leave Columns (c) and (d) blank. For each line entry in Columns (a) and (b), enter in Columns (e), (f), and (g) the appropriate
amounts of funds needed to support the project for the first funding period (usually a year).



For continuing grant program applications, 

submit these forms before the end of each funding period as required by the grantor agency. Enter in Columns (c) and
(d) the estimated amounts of funds which will remain unobligated at the end of the grant funding period only if the Federal
grantor agency instructions provide for this. Otherwise, leave these columns blank. Enter in Columns (e) and (f)
the amounts of funds needed for the upcoming period. The amount(s) in Column (g) should be the sum of amounts in Columns
(e) and (f).



For supplemental grants and changes

 to existing grants, do not use Columns (c) and (d). Enter in Column (e) the amount of the increase or decrease of Federal
funds and enter in Column (f) the amount of the increase or decrease of non-Federal funds. In Column (g) enter the new
total budgeted amount (Federal and non-Federal) which includes the total previous authorized budgeted amounts
plus or minus, as appropriate, the amounts shown in Columns (e) and (f). The amount(s) in Column (g) should not equal
the sum of amounts in Columns (e) and (f).

Line 5_Show the totals for all columns used.

Section B Budget Categories

In the column headings (1) through (4), enter the titles of the same programs, functions, and activities shown on Lines
1-4, Column (a), Section A. When additional sheets are prepared for Section A, provide similar column headings
on each sheet. For each program, function or activity, fill in the total requirements for funds (both Federal and non-Federal)
by object class categories.

Lines 6a-i_Show the totals of Lines 6a to 6h in each column.

Line 6j_Show the amount of indirect cost.

Line 6k_Enter the total of amounts on Lines 6i and 6j. For all applications for new grants and continuation grants the
total amount in column (5), Line 6k, should be the same as the total amount shown in Section A, Column (g), Line 5. For
supplemental grants and changes to grants, the total amount of the increase or decrease as shown in Columns (1)-(4),
Line 6k should be the same as the sum of the amounts in Section A, Columns (e) and (f) on Line 5.

Line 7_Enter the estimated amount of income, if any, expected to be generated from this project. Do not add or subtract
this amount from the total project amount. Show under the program narrative statement the nature and source of income.
The estimated amount of program income may be considered by the federal grantor agency in determining the total amount
of the grant. 





Section C. Non-Federal-Resources 





Line 8-11_Enter amounts of non-Federal resources that will be used on the grant. If in-kind contributions are
included, provide a brief explanation on a separate sheet. 

Column (a)_Enter the program titles identical to Column (a), Section A. A breakdown by function or activity is not
necessary. 

Column (b)_Enter the contribution to be made by the applicant.

Column (c)_Enter the amount of the State's cash and in-kind contribution if the applicant is not a State or State agency.
Applicants which are a State or State agencies should leave this column blank. 

Column (d)_Enter the amount of cash and in-kind contributions to be made from all other sources. 


Column (e)_Enter totals of Columns (b), (c), and (d).

Section E. Budget Estimates of Federal Funds Needed for Balance of the Project 



Line 16-19_Enter in Column (a) the same grant program titles shown in Column (a), Section A. A breakdown by function
or activity is not necessary. For new applications and continuation grant applications, enter in the proper columns
amounts of Federal funds which will be needed to complete the program or project over the succeeding funding periods
(usually in years). This section need not be completed for revisions (amendments, changes, or supplements) to funds
for the current year of existing grants. 

If more than four lines are needed to list the program titles, submit additional schedules as necessary. 

Line 20_Enter the total for each of the Columns (b)-(e). When additional schedules are prepared for this Section,
annotate accordingly and show the overall totals on this line. 



Section F. Other Budget Information

out of the ordinary or to explain the details as required by the Federal grantor agency. 


Line 22_Enter the type of indirect rate (provisional, predetermined, final or fixed) that will be in effect during
the funding period, the estimated amount of the base to which the rate is applied, and the total indirect expense. 


Line 23_Provide any other explanations or comments deemed necessary.

White House Conference on Aging, AoA, HHS.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This notice complements the March 17 and April 19, 1994 

Federal Register 

Notices announcing the White House Conference on Aging's (WHCoA's) intent to recognize local programs/events and
mini-conferences as part of its grass roots pre-1995 WHCoA strategy. The WHCoA proposes to recognize an additional
category of events which is national in scope and which will precede the official 1995 WHCoA. Recognition implies
the WHCoA's acknowledgement of the relevancy of the event to the goals of the WHCoA. To qualify for this additional
category, interested organizations must adhere to the guidelines listed below.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

A White House Conference on Aging is intended to produce policy recommendations to guide national aging policy over
the next decade. To further these efforts, the WHCoA proposes to recognize National Pre-White House Conferences
on Aging (National Pre-Conference) to address in detail and to develop substantive recommendations for those topics
identified as WHCoA agenda items.



Guidelines



In order for an organization to qualify as a National Pre-Conference, it must have nationwide representation and/or
an affiliate structure; have a national focus and an impact on national policy; have an organizational mission or
purpose related to aging and related issues; conduct national substantive meetings and propose to conduct the National
Pre-Conference in conjunction with an annual or regular national meeting. The program of the proposed National Pre-Conference
must be structured to ensure specific discussion on one or more of the major topic areas of the White House Conference
on Aging as listed in the agenda expected to be published in the 

Federal Register 

in the fall of 1994. Recommendations in each of these topic areas must be the specific product of the National Pre-Conference.
Organizations are encouraged to develop discussion papers which could be presented to the participants in these
National Pre-Conferences and which may later be distributed to the delegates to the 1995 White House Conference on
Aging. The proposed National Pre-Conference should be held by March 31, 1995.

Recognition by the White House Conference on Aging allows the organization conducting the event to publicize that
the event has been recognized by the WHCoA and that it will be listed in the final report of the Conference. However,
recognition is not meant to imply and does not signify that the WHCoA agrees with or endorses the recommendations.
Interested organizations should submit a letter of intent to the above address by August 31, 1994. The letter should
include the name, address, telephone number and contact person of the organization as well as a brief description
of the proposed National Pre-Conference including the theme and/or title.

Initiatives by Organizations To Strengthen 
National Tobacco Control Activities in the United States 



Introduction 



The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announces the availability of fiscal year (FY) 1994 funds for
cooperative agreements to establish programs to demonstrate methodologies to train personnel, provide national
leadership, and mobilize constituencies regarding tobacco control programs. This announcement's purpose is to
develop capacity among organizations, which have not previously focused efforts on tobacco control, to develop
the infrastructure necessary to educate, support, and mobilize their membership to promote and implement Healthy
People 2000 tobacco control objectives. The primary constituencies served by the organizations should be minorities
(African-Americans, Hispanics/Latinos, Asians/Pacific Islanders, and American Indians/Alaska Natives), youth,
women, blue collar and/or agricultural workers. Tobacco control is defined as preventing tobacco use, encouraging
cessation, and protecting both smokers and nonsmokers through public policy and public education. 

Organizations that have not traditionally been active in the tobacco control field, but have a newly emerging interest
in tobacco control, are encouraged to apply for this award. Upon receiving funding, organizations will be expected
to demonstrate a focus on increasing tobacco control capacity within target communities or among an organization's
constituents at the national, State or local level. Funding will be used to build the organization's capacity for
leadership among its constituency for, and to assist State and local health agencies and other appropriate organizations
and agencies in, the development of tobacco prevention and control. 

The Public Health Service (PHS) is committed to achieving the health promotion and disease prevention objectives
of ``Healthy People 2000,'' a PHS-led national activity to reduce morbidity and mortality and improve the quality
of life. This announcement is related to the priority area of tobacco, with emphasis on target populations specified
in risk reduction objective 3.4 and reducing the initiation of smoking by children and youth as described in Objective
3.5. (For ordering a copy of ``Healthy People 2000,'' see the section ``Where to Obtain Additional Information.'')




Authority 



This program is authorized under Section 317(k)(3) [42 U.S.C. 247b(k)(3)] of the Public Health Service Act, as amended.



Smoke-Free Workplace 



The Public Health Service strongly encourages all grant recipients to provide a smoke-free workplace and promote
the nonuse of all tobacco products. This is consistent with the PHS mission to protect and advance the physical and
mental health of the American people. 



Eligible Applicants 



Eligible applicants are public and private, nonprofit, and minority organizations. Experience with tobacco control
activities or programs is not required. However, applicants must have established organizational capacities and
experience in: 

 Coalition building; 
 Leadership; 
 Advocacy skills; 
 Impacting policy development at the local, State, regional, and/or national level; 
 Working with legislators and decision makers; 
 Serving one or more of the following constituencies: minorities (African-Americans, Hispanics/Latinos,
Asians/Pacific Islanders, and American Indians/Alaska Natives), youth, women, blue collar and/or agricultural
workers; 
 Collaboration with State and local health agencies, and/or other relevant agencies, on programmatic activities.


In addition to the requirements described above, national eligible organizations must have a primary relationship
to one of the target populations. A primary relationship is one in which the organization's service to the target population
is viewed as the most important component of its mission. The relationship to the target population must be direct
(membership, service, advocacy) rather than indirect or secondary (philanthropy, fund raising, educational).


Eligible organizations must have affiliate offices or organizations in more than one State or territory. Individual
chapters or affiliates of parent organizations are not eligible to apply. 

States or their bona fide agents or instrumentalities are not eligible for funding under this program announcement.
States are currently funded for tobacco control activities under Program Announcement 332 or by the National Cancer
Institute under the America Stop Smoking Intervention Study (ASSIST) demonstration program. CDC intends to support
full and open competition among the States at the termination of the ASSIST demonstration program. 

In addition to the eligibility requirements above, minority applicants must meet the following criteria:

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940707-2-00112 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940707-2-00051 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

1. At least 51 percent of persons on the governing board must be members of racial or ethnic minority populations. 

2. The organization must possess a documented history of serving racial and ethnic minority populations through
its offices, affiliates, or participating minority organizations for at least 12 months before the submission of
the application to CDC. 

Limited competition is justified under this program announcement because of the need to diversify and increase the
number and type of organizations with the capacity to serve and represent a diverse target population. In addition,
the organizations must have the capacity to work with these target populations to effectively strengthen existing
tobacco control coalitions and assist State tobacco control programs. It is critical that organizations, in working
with their target populations, are able to create leadership networks and mobilize them for action, and work with
other organizations representative of the target population to increase their commitment to tobacco control. The
coordination and implementation of a more inclusive and comprehensive tobacco control strategy requires organizations
with the capacity, experience, leadership, and organizational skills to influence the health-related actions
of their constituency, and an interest in developing the capacity to identify, assess, and advocate scientifically
proven, 
environmental (policy and legislative changes at State, local, and community levels) tobacco control activities.




Availability of Funds 



Approximately $1,000,000 is available in FY 1994 to fund approximately 10 awards. It is expected that the average
award will be $150,000, ranging from $50,000 to $200,000. 

1. Approximately one award will be funded in each of the following target populations: youth, women, and blue collar
and/or agricultural workers. 

2. Approximately $500,000 of the total $1,000,000, will be available to fund approximately 5 minority organizations
which serve one or more of the following constituencies: African-Americans, Hispanics/Latinos, Asians/Pacific
Islanders, and American Indians/Alaska Natives. 

It is expected that the awards will begin on or about 
September 30, 1994, and will be made for a 12-month budget period within a project period of up to 3 years. Funding estimates
may vary and are subject to change. Continuation awards within the project period will be made on the basis of satisfactory
progress and the availability of funds. 



Purpose 



This is a demonstration program to expand the developing network of organizations beyond those traditionally involved
with tobacco control. The purpose is to demonstrate that these organizations can provide leadership, assistance,
and training to facilitate the development, organization, and implementation of tobacco control programs among
selected target populations, in order to achieve Healthy People 2000 tobacco objectives. 



Program Requirements 



In conducting activities to achieve the purpose of this program, the recipient will be responsible for the activities
under A. (Recipient Activities), and CDC will be responsible for the activities listed under B. (CDC Activities).

Notice of Social Security Acquiescence Ruling.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

In accordance with 20 CFR 422.406(b)(2) published January 11, 1990 (55 FR 1012), the Commissioner of Social Security
gives notice of Social Security Acquiescence Rule 94-2(4).


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Although not required to do so pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(1) and (a)(2), we are publishing this Social Security Acquiescence
Ruling in accordance with 20 CFR 422.406(b)(2).



A Social Security Acquiescence Ruling explains how we will apply a holding in a decision of a United States Court of
Appeals that we determine conflicts with our interpretation of a provision of the Social Security Act or regulations
when the Government has decided not to seek further review of that decision or is unsuccessful on further review.
We will apply the holding of the Court of Appeals decision as explained in this Social Security Acquiescence Ruling
to claims at all levels of administrative adjudication within the Fourth Circuit. This Social Security Acquiescence
Ruling will apply to all determinations and decisions made on or after July 7, 1994. If we made a determination or decision
on your application for benefits between June 29, 1987, the date of the Court of Appeals' decision and July 7, 1994,
the effective date of this Social Security Acquiescence Ruling, you may request application of the Social Security
Acquiescence Ruling to your claim if you first demonstrate, pursuant to 20 CFR 404.985(b) or 416.1485(b), that application
of the Ruling could change our prior determination or decision. 
If this Social Security Acquiescence Ruling is later rescinded as obsolete, we will publish a notice in the 

Federal Register

 to that effect as provided for in 20 CFR 404.985(e) or 416.1485(e). If we decide to relitigate the issue covered by this
Social Security Acquiescence Ruling as provided for by 20 CFR 404.985(c) or 416.1485(c), we will publish a notice
in the 

Federal Register

 stating that we will apply our interpretation of the Act or regulations involved and explaining why we have decided
to relitigate the issue.

Arising Under the Same Title of the Social Security Act_Titles II and XVI of the Social Security Act. 


Issue


Whether, in making a disability determination or decision on a subsequent disability claim with respect to an unadjudicated
period, an adjudicator must adopt a finding regarding a claimant's residual functional capacity, or other finding

Circuit


Fourth (Maryland, North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia, West Virginia) 

Lively v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, 

820 F.2d 1391 (4th Cir. 1987).


Applicability of Ruling


The Ruling applies to determinations or decisions at all levels of the administrative review process (i.e., initial,
reconsideration, Administrative Law Judge hearing and Appeals Council).


Description of Case


In a decision dated October 19, 1981, an Administrative Law Judge found that the plaintiff, Mr. Lively, was not disabled
under Rule 202.10 of the medical-vocational guidelines, 20 CFR Part 404, Subpart P, Appendix 2, and denied his application
for disability insurance benefits. In applying Rule 202.10, the Administrative Law Judge found that Mr. Lively had
the residual functional capacity for light work. The decision that Mr. Lively was not entitled to disability insurance
benefits became the final decision of the Secretary and was affirmed by the district court.
The plaintiff filed a second application for disability insurance benefits on December 14, 1983. After holding a
hearing, an Administrative Law Judge concluded that the plaintiff was not entitled to disability insurance benefits.
The Administrative Law Judge determined that Mr. Lively retained the functional capacity for the performance of
work activity of any exertional level on and prior to December 31, 1981, the date his insured status expired. The Administrative
Law Judge did not discuss in his decision the 1981 finding by another Administrative Law Judge that the plaintiff had
the residual functional capacity to do only light work. This decision became the final decision of the Secretary and
was appealed to the district court. The case was referred to a United States Magistrate who found that the evidence
before the Administrative Law Judge on the plaintiff's 1983 application was sufficient to sustain the Secretary's
decision that the plaintiff was not disabled as of December 31, 1981. The district court adopted the Magistrate's
Report and Recommendation. Mr. Lively then appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.


Holding


The Fourth Circuit stated that:



Congress has clearly provided by statute that 

res judicata 

prevents reappraisal of both the Secretary's findings and his decision in Social Security cases that have become
final, 42 U.S.C.  405(h), and the courts have readily applied 

res judicata

 to prevent the Secretary from reaching an inconsistent result in a second proceeding based on evidence that has already
been weighed in a claimant's favor in an earlier proceeding.



The court noted that the plaintiff became 55 years of age two weeks after the Administrative Law Judge, in connection
with the first application for benefits, found that Mr. Lively was limited to light work. The court further noted that
a person with the plaintiff's education and vocational background who is 55 years of age or older and limited to light
work would be considered disabled under Rule 202.02 of the medical-vocational guidelines, 20 CFR Part 404, Subpart
P, Appendix 2. The court found it inconceivable that Mr. Lively's condition had improved so much in two weeks as to enable
him to perform medium work. Accordingly the court held:



Principles of finality and fundamental fairness * * * indicate that the Secretary must shoulder the
burden of demonstrating that the claimant's condition had improved sufficiently to indicate that the claimant was
capable of performing medium work. * * * [E]vidence, not considered in the earlier proceeding, would
be needed as an independent basis to sustain a finding contrary to the final earlier finding.

Statement as to How Lively Differs From SSA Policy




Under SSA policy, if a determination or decision on a disability claim has become final, the Agency may apply administrative


res judicata

 with respect to a subsequent disability claim under the same title of the Act if the same parties, facts and issues are
involved in both the prior and subsequent claims. However, if the subsequent claim involves deciding whether the
claimant is disabled during a period that was not adjudicated in the final determination or decision on the prior claim,
SSA considers the issue of disability with respect to the unadjudicated period to be a new issue that prevents the application
of administrative 

res judicata.

 Thus, when adjudicating a subsequent disability claim involving an unadjudicated period, SSA considers the facts
and issues 

de novo

 in determining disability with respect to the unadjudicated period.


The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit concluded that where a final decision of the Secretary after
a hearing on a prior disability claim contained a finding about a claimant's residual functional capacity, the Secretary
may not make a different finding in adjudicating a subsequent disability claim with an unadjudicated period arising
under the same title of the Act as the prior claim unless there is new and material evidence relating to the claimant's
residual functional capacity.



Explanation of How SSA Will Apply the Decision Within the Circuit



This Ruling applies only to disability findings in cases involving claimants who reside in Maryland, North Carolina,
South Carolina, Virginia, or West Virginia at the time of the determination or decision on the subsequent claim at
the initial, reconsideration, Administrative Law Judge hearing or Appeals Council level. It applies only to a finding
regarding a claimant's residual functional capacity or other finding required at a step in the sequential evaluation
process for determining disability provided under 20 CFR 404.1520, 416.920 or 416.924, or a finding required under
the evaluation process for determining disability provided under 20 CFR 404.1578, as appropriate, which was made
in a final decision by an Administrative Law Judge or the Appeals Council on a prior disability claim. When adjudicating
a subsequent disability claim with an unadjudicated period arising under the same title of the Act as the prior claim,
adjudicators must adopt such a finding from the final decision by an Administrative Law Judge or the Appeals Council
on the prior claim in determining whether the claimant is disabled with respect to the unadjudicated period unless
there is new and material evidence relating to such a finding.

<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Department of Health and Human Services notifies Federal agencies of the laboratories currently certified to
meet standards of Subpart C of Mandatory Guidelines for Federal Workplace Drug Testing Programs (53 FR 11979, 11986).
A similar notice listing all currently certified laboratories will be published during the first week of each month,
and updated to include laboratories which subsequently apply for and complete the certification process. If any
listed laboratory's certification is totally suspended or revoked, the laboratory will be omitted from updated
lists until such time as it is restored to full certification under the Guidelines. 


If any laboratory has withdrawn from the National Laboratory Certification Program during the past month, it will
be identified as such at the end of the current list of certified laboratories, and will be omitted from the monthly
listing thereafter. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Mandatory Guidelines for Federal Workplace Drug Testing were developed in accordance with Executive Order 12564
and section 503 of Pub. L. 100-71. Subpart C of the Guidelines, ``Certification of Laboratories Engaged in Urine
Drug Testing for Federal Agencies,'' sets strict standards which laboratories must meet in order to conduct urine
drug testing for Federal agencies. To become certified an applicant laboratory must undergo three rounds of performance
testing plus an on-site inspection. To maintain that certification a laboratory must participate in an every-other-month
performance testing program plus periodic, on-site inspections. 


Laboratories which claim to be in the applicant stage of certification are not to be considered as meeting the minimum
requirements expressed in the HHS Guidelines. A laboratory must have its letter of certification from SAMHSA, HHS
(formerly: HHS/NIDA) which attests that it has met minimum standards. 
In accordance with Subpart C of the Guidelines, the following laboratories meet the minimum standards set forth in
the Guidelines:

SUMMARY: 

This redelegation of authority redelegates from the Assistant Secretary for Housing_Federal Housing Commissioner
to the Director, Office of Mortgage Insurance Accounting and Servicing, Office of the FHA-Comptroller, and to each
Debt Management Center (``DMC'') Director of the HUD FHA-Debt Management Centers in Albany, New York, Chicago, Illinois,
and Seattle, Washington the power and authority to perform the following functions, without respect to geographical
area, in connection with FHA debt referred to the DMC for collection and debt arising from the payment of claims under
Title I of the National Housing Act: 1) execute documents necessary to transfer or subordinate title in and to any debt,
contract, claim or security instrument obtained by the Secretary; 2) satisfy and/or execute deeds, liens, and notes;
and 3) execute settlement agreements and/or write-offs in connection with the collection of any such debt, contract,
claim, or security instrument. The Director of the Title I Accounting and Servicing Division, Office of Mortgage
Insurance Accounting and Servicing, Office of the FHA-Comptroller is also redelegated the authority to issue implementing

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

On October 25, 1991, at 48 FR 40959, the Assistant Secretary for Housing_Federal Housing Commissioner redelegated
to the Director, Office of Mortgage Insurance Accounting and Servicing, Office of the FHA-Comptroller, and to each
Debt Management Center (``DMC'') Director of the HUD Debt Management Centers in Albany, New York, Chicago, Illinois,
and Seattle, Washington the power and authority to execute documents necessary to transfer title in and to any debt
and contract, claim or security instrument obtained by the Secretary in connection with the payment of claims under
Title I of the National Housing Act and to execute settlement agreements in connection with the collection of any such
debt, contract, claim, or security instrument.



In FY 1987 HUD began consolidating the Title I program by establishing the first of three multi-regional Debt Management
Center (``DMC's'') in Seattle, Washington. The purpose of the DMC was to collect debts owed to the Department which
result from defaulted Title I loans assigned to the Department. The consolidation effort was completed in FY 1989
with the opening of the Chicago, Illinois center. The three DMC's are located in Albany, New York, Chicago, Illinois,
and Seattle, Washington. The role of the Debt Management Centers has expanded to include collection and management
responsibility for not only Title I, but other FHA debt that has been referred to the DMCs for collection.

This redelegation of authority grants to the Director, Office of Mortgage Insurance Accounting and Servicing, Office
of the FHA-Comptroller, and to each of the three DMC Directors the power and authority to perform the following functions,
without regard to geographical area, in connection with FHA debt referred to the DMC for collection and debt arising
from the payment of claims under Title I of the National Housing Act: 1) execute documents necessary to transfer or
subordinate title in and to any debt, contract, claim or security instrument obtained by the Secretary; 2) satisfy
and/or execute deeds, liens, and notes; and 3) execute settlement agreements and/or write-off in connection with
the collection of any such debt, contract, claim, or security instrument. The Director of the Title I Accounting and
Servicing Division, Office of Mortgage Insurance Accounting and Servicing is also redelegated the authority to
issue implementing policies and procedures with respect to all functions specified in this redelegation. This redelegation
does not in any way include the power and authority to transfer title to real property, except as it relates to the collection
and settlement of Title I and referred FHA debt.

Accordingly, the Assistant Secretary for Housing_Federal Housing Commissioner redelegates the following authority:



Section A. Redelegation of Authority



The Assistant Secretary for Housing_Federal Housing Commissioner redelegates to the Director of the Office of Mortgage
Insurance Accounting and Servicing, Office of the FHA-Comptroller, and to the Director of the HUD FHA-Debt Management
Centers in Albany, New York, Chicago, Illinois, and Seattle, Washington the power and authority to perform the following
functions, without regard to geographical area, in connection with FHA debt referred to the DMC for collection and
debt arising from the payment of claims under Title I of the National Housing Act: 1) execute documents necessary to

Shooting Closure on Public Lands in San Diego County, CA



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Bureau of Land Management.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Closure order.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) is closing part of the public lands on Otay Mountain, located in San Diego County,
California, to recreational target shooting. The closure is permanent and covers all public lands located on and
within 300 feet of the Otay Mountain Truck Trail, communication sites, historic bunkers, and water tank structures.
The closure does not apply to hunters in lawful pursuit of game. It is BLM's intent to protect public users on the road,
eliminate shooting damage occurring to numerous structures, and reduce the litter occurring near wilderness study
areas. The closure will affect all of the current, popular shooting areas being accessed by vehicle, thus eliminating
target shooting from most of the public lands on Otay Mountain.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

BLM administers 16,675 acres of public lands in the Otay Mountain area. The area includes two wilderness study areas,
one area of critical environmental concern, four communication tower sites, three historic military bunker structures,
and five water storage tanks. Although there are several existing roads, the general public's only access through
the area is on the Otay Mountain Truck Trail, which connects Otay Mesa Road on the West to Marron Valley Road on the East.
This primitive road, with the adjacent communication sites, bunker structures, and water tanks, is where most public
users concentrate on the mountain. It is used by four-wheelers, off-highway vehicles, mountain bikers, hikers,
hang gliders, remote control airplane operators, target shooters, hunters, and law enforcement personnel. Three
problems exist from the target shooters that this closure will address: First, most of the popular shooting areas
are located so that individuals are shooting from, down, or across the roadway, or are shooting from ridge lines offering
no backstop. This creates a safety hazard for all recreationists using the road and, more than once, has jeopardized
law enforcement officers in the field not visible from the road. Second, most of the communication, bunker, and water
tank structures are being used as backstops or targets by target shooters. This has result in damaged communications
equipment, cracked concrete water tanks, and scarred bunker structures. Finally, all of the shooting areas were
trashed, seriously impacting the wilderness values of the area. Over 3 tons of trash were removed from the mountain
in December, 1993, and most of it was debris left from target shooters. By closing this area to one type of recreational
activity, the health and safety of all other recreationists using the mountain will be protected, the man-made structures
will be protected, and the natural resource values of the public lands will be enhanced. The closure does not limit
hunters in lawful pursuit of game, nor address other BLM lands in San Diego County where target shooting is still legal.


Authority for this permanent closure is established by 43 CFR 8364.1. Violation of the closure is punishable by a fine
not to exceed $1000 and/or imprisonment not to exceed 12 months.

<DOCTITLE>Managing Migratory Bird Subsistence Hunting in Alaska; Strategy for Regulating the Spring and Summer Taking of Migratory
Birds in Alaska for Subsistence Purposes</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>

Fish and Wildlife Service, Interior.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of availability of final environmental assessment and finding of no significant impact.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This Notice is to inform the public of the availability of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's (Service) final environmental
assessment (EA) evaluating alternatives for resolving the problem of ongoing spring and summer migratory bird subsistence
hunting. This notice also makes available to the public the substance of the Service's proposed Finding of No Significant
Impact which results from the EA. The Service has finalized the selection of the preferred alternative set out in the
EA, i.e., to amend the 1916 Convention Between the United States and Great Britain for the Protection of Migratory
Birds (Convention) to allow a regulated migratory bird subsistence harvest during what is now the closed period of
March 10 to September 1. The final EA is available from the Service upon request at either of the addresses provided
below (See 

ADDRESSES:

 and/or 

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:

).



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Subsistence hunting of migratory birds for cultural and nutritional purposes occurs in Alaska and in the far northern
areas of Canada as a customary and traditional activity during the closed period (between March 10 and September 1)
required by the Convention and the Migratory Bird Treaty Act (16 U.S.C. 703 

et seq.

), which implements the terms of the Convention. Apparently, the framers of the Convention were aware of migratory
bird subsistence hunting activity but unaware of the extent to which it was needed and practiced by far northern rural
peoples. Thus, the Convention provides inadequately for this particular subsistence use, with the result that much
of the current subsistence hunting activity is illegal. However, restricting subsistence hunting to a time period
outside of that in which birds are available neither provides equitable access to the resource nor accommodates customary
and traditional uses. Because the Service recognizes the legitimate need for equitable access to the migratory bird
resource for subsistence purposes, regulatory strategies have been under evaluation which would bring about successful
resolution of the problem. The Service has recently completed the environmental assessment process regarding this
issue and the results are contained in the final EA titled ``Regulation of Migratory Bird Subsistence Hunting in Alaska,''
dated May 1994. All comments received during the review of the draft EA have been considered in the preparation of the
final EA. The Service has also completed a proposed Finding of No Significant Impact for the EA process, which is as
follows:



Finding of No-Significant Impact



Finding of no significant impact for managing migratory bird subsistence hunting in Alaska




On the basis of the final environmental assessment analysis contained in the document titled ``Managing Migratory
Bird Subsistence Hunting in Alaska'' and dated May 1994, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service finds that no significant
impacts will result from the action to be taken to amend the 1916 Convention Between the U.S. and Great Britain [For
Canada] For the Protection of Migratory Birds (Convention). The Service examined five alternatives for dealing
with the subsistence hunting of migratory bird issue, which are: (1) maintaining the status quo; (2) expanding the
universe of cooperative agreements; (3) enforcing the terms of the current Convention; (4) amending the Convention;
and (5) amending the Migratory Bird Treaty Act to allow subsistence hunting outside of the Convention. Action modifiers
which specify how subsistence harvest of migratory birds would be managed were considered in conjunction with the
five alternatives. Amendment of the Convention is the Service's preferred strategy for resolving problems associated
with the illegal subsistence hunting of migratory birds by far northern peoples in Alaska and Canada.

<TEXT>
 

Of the five alternatives considered, only amending the Convention responds to problems created by its current provisions
for subsistence harvest. Selection of this alternative, amending the Convention, is based on the following factors:
The Convention currently proscribes hunting for migratory birds during the period March 10 to September 1, except
under very limited circumstances; there is an existing need for the customary and traditional use of migratory bird
resources that must be accommodated; accommodation of this need recognizes existing levels of use and will not significantly
increase levels of harvest; migratory birds used for subsistence purposes are generally not available when harvest
is allowed under the Convention; regulatory mechanisms now available to management agencies to monitor and control
harvest will be enhanced by this action; and that, because the same subsistence harvest problems exist within Canada
because of inadequacies in the Convention, amendment is the best alternative for ensuring the future of the North
American migratory bird resource. Also, there is a preponderance of public opinion that believes amending the Convention
is the most satisfactory way of dealing with the migratory bird subsistence hunting issue.

Based upon my review and evaluation of the enclosed environmental assessment and other supporting documentation,
I have determined that the action that is anticipated to be taken to regulate migratory bird subsistence hunting in
Alaska is not a major Federal action which would significantly affect the quality of the human environment within
the meaning of section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969. Accordingly, preparation of an
environmental impact statement on the proposed action is not required.




The EA presents a menu of action modifiers that allow the Service a range of approaches to regulating subsistence harvest
within an amended Convention. Action modifiers selected that specify how the Service would regulate a migratory
bird subsistence harvest, as well as associated principles that are intended to guide the process, are as follows:


First, 

the subsistence harvest should be available to Alaska Natives and other qualified residents residing in designated
subsistence harvest areas; 

Second, 

the Service believes that nothing in this action should grant entitlement, rights or preference of some users over
any other users of migratory birds in the U.S. As with sport hunting, promulgation of appropriate regulations will
be the vehicle for opening subsistence hunting season(s). A management system would be established that allows coordination
among user groups, State and Federal interests, and the Flyway Councils. All the ordinary strategies of bag limits,
seasons, species restrictions, quotas, management units, zones, etc., could be used to manage, as appropriate.
Windows of harvest opportunity would be set that would vary from area to area, but would, to the maximum extent possible,
protect breeding birds; 

Third, 

the migratory bird and/or migratory bird egg subsistence harvest should be regionally limited, e.g., Southeast
and Southcentral Alaska generally would be excluded because of fall harvest options, and urban areas such as the North
Star Borough would be similarly excluded. Communities outside of the proposed inclusion areas should be allowed
to petition for consideration of hunting opportunity based on specific criteria including past and ongoing customary
and traditional take of migratory birds for food during the closed season; 

Fourth, 

birds should be taken for food, for personal and family use and could be shared within the communities. Items crafted
from non-edible by-products could be utilized for personal, cultural or ceremonial uses. Birds, parts, eggs and
craft items may be bartered or traded in limited quantities but may not be sold; 

Fifth, 

variable levels of harvest should be set that fluctuate with population numbers. However, it is the Service's goal
that there should be no significant increase in levels of harvest in the future beyond the variable levels referenced
above. Harvest of eggs should be considered for all traditional species. However, limited harvest of waterfowl eggs
would be considered where it is shown as an established customary use 

and

 egg resources from nonwaterfowl species are not available; and 

Sixth, 

there should be moderate enforcement in cooperation with subsistence users. That is, enforcement for this activity
should be consistent with enforcement during the other part of the year and sufficiently great on an as-needed basis
to help ensure compliance.

Since international agreement negotiations of the U.S. Department of State are not bound by agency NEPA process results,
the foregoing position of the Service represents the desired, but may not be the actual, results of Convention amendment.
However, it is the Service's intent to pursue amendment results which incorporate these features.

the recovery effort, the Service is working to prepare recovery plans for most of the listed species native to the United
States. Recovery plans describe actions considered necessary for conservation of the species, establish them,
and estimate time and cost for implementing the recovery measures needed.

The Endangered Species Act of 1973 (Act), as amended (16 U.S.C. 1531 

et seq

.) requires the development of recovery plans for listed species unless such a plan would not promote the conservation
of a particular species. Section 4(f) of the Act, as amended in 1988, requires that public notice and an opportunity
for public review and comment be provided during recovery plan development. The Service and other Federal agencies
will also take these comments into account in the course of implementing approved recovery plans.


This Technical/Agency Draft is for seven Puerto Rican endangered ferns, all endemic to the island of Puerto Rico.
These ferns are currently restricted to one, two or three locations each. 

Adiantum vivesii, Tectaria estremerana 

and 

Thelypteris verecunda 

are found in the limestone or karst region of northwestern Puerto Rico. 

Adiantum vivesii 

and 

Tectaria estremerana 

are only known from one locality each in Quebradillas and Arecibo, respectively. 

Thelypteris verecunda 

is known from Quebradillas, Hatillo and San Sebastian. 

Elaphoglossum serpens, Polystichum calderonense, Thelypteris inabonensis, 

and 

Thelypteris yaucoensis 

are found in the mountains of the central region of Puerto Rico. 

Elaphoglossum serpens 

and 

Thelypteris inabonensis 

are known from the Toro Negro commonwealth Forest and 

Polystichum calderonense 

is known from Monte Guilarte Commonwealth Forest. 

Thelypteris yaucoensis 

is known from Yauco and Ciales. The seven species face extinction due to the extreme rarity and restricted distribution,
habitat destruction and modification, forest management practices, hurricane damage and possible collection.

Notice of document availability and public comment period. 
 


 
 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) announces the availability for public review of an agency draft recovery
plan for rough-leaved loosestrife (

Lysimachia asperulaefolia

). This rare perennial herb, native only to North Carolina and South Carolina, grows on moist sand or peat in the transition
zone between longleaf pine or oak savannas and wetter, shrubby plant communities. Only nine populations of rough-leaved
loosestrife are currently known to exist. The Service solicits review and comment from the public on this draft plan.

 


 
 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
 
 
Background 
 


Restoring endangered or threatened animals and plants to the point where they are again secure, self-sustaining
members of their ecosystems is a primary goal of the Service's endangered species program. To help guide the recovery
effort, the Service is working to prepare recovery plans for most of the listed species native to the United States.
Recovery plans describe actions considered necessary for conservation of the species, establish criteria for recognizing
the recovery levels for downlisting or delisting them, and estimate time and cost for implementing the recovery measures
needed. 
 
The Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (16 U.S.C. 1531 

et seq.

) (Act), requires the development of recovery plans for listed species unless such a plan would not promote the conservation
of a particular species. Section 4(f) of the Act, as amended in 1988, requires that a public notice and an opportunity
for public review and comment be provided during recovery plan development. The Service will consider all information
presented during a public comment period prior to approval of each new or revised recovery plan. The Service and other
Federal agencies will also take these comments into account in the course of implementing approved recovery plans.

 
The primary species considered in this draft recovery plan is rough-leaved loosestrife (

Lysimachia asperulaefolia

). The areas of emphasis for recovery actions are the southern coastal plain and sandhills of North Carolina (Cumberland,
Pamlico, Onslow, Brunswick, Beaufort, and Pender Counties) and the sandhills of South Carolina (Richland County).
Habitat protection and management, reintroduction, and preservation of genetic material are major objectives
of this recovery plan.

<DOCTITLE>Notice of Intent to Repatriate a Cultural Item in the Possession of the Anchorage Museum of History and Art, Anchorage,
Alaska</DOCTITLE>





<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

National Park Service, Interior



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 



 Notice.









Notice is hereby given under the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act of 1990 of the intent to repatriate
a cultural item in the possession of the Anchorage Museum of History and Art that meets the definition of ``object of
cultural patrimony'' under Section 2 of the act.


The item consists of a headdress in the form of a wolf's head, with a wicker frame, calico lining, red trade cloth tongue,
and cape with ermine skins. The headdress was purchased by the Museum in 1983 from Boyd Didrickson and is designated
accession number 83.134 in the Museum records.

Evidence provided by the Yanyeidi Clan of the Taku Tlingit confirms that the headdress is of ongoing historical, traditional,
and cultural importance to the clan, and that at the time the headdress was separated from the Yanyeidi Clan of the Taku
Tlingit, no individual clan member was considered to have the right to convey it to a non-clan member without clan consent.
The Douglas Indian Association, an association recognized as eligible for the special programs and services provided
by the United States to Indians because of their status as Indians, has petitioned for the repatriation of the headdress
on behalf of the Yanyeidi Clan of the Taku Tlingit. Representatives of the Douglas Indian Association, the Yanyeidi
Clan of the Taku Tlingit, and the Museum have determined pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001 (2) that there is a relationship
of shared group identity which can be reasonably traced between the headdress, the Douglas Indian Association, and
the Yanyeidi Clan of the Taku Tlingit. The Museum has agreed to repatriate the headdress.
Representatives of any other Indian tribe or Alaska Native village or corporation that believes itself to be culturally
affiliated with this item should contact Patricia B. Wolf, Museum Director, Anchorage Museum of History and Art,
121 W. 7th Avenue, Anchorage, Alaska 99501, (907) 343-4326, before [

thirty days following publication of this notice

]. Repatriation of the item to the Douglas Indian Association, on behalf of the Yanyeidi Clan of the Taku Tlingit, may
begin after that date if no additional claimants come forward.

Decision Not To Review an Initial Determination 
Finding a Violation of Section 337 and Schedule 
for the Filing of Written Submissions on 
Remedy, the Public Interest, and Bonding 


<AGENCY>

ACTION:

 Notice. 




In the Matter of: Certain Devices for Connecting Computers Via Telephone Lines. 


</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 Notice is hereby given that the U.S. International Trade Commission has determined not to review the presiding administrative
law judge's (ALJ) final initial determination (ID) issued on May 24, 1994, in the above-captioned investigation
finding a violation of section 337 in the importation into the United States, and the sale within the United States
after importation, of certain devices for connecting computers via telephone lines. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Farallon Computing, Inc. (``Farallon'') filed a complaint on October 12, 1993, pursuant to section 337 of the Tariff
Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C.  1337) alleging that 16 respondents had violated section 337 in the importation into the
United States, the sale for importation, or the sale within the United States after importation of certain devices
for connecting computers via telephone lines. Those 16 respondents were: (1) ABL Electronics Corp. (``ABL''), (2)
Caltechnology International Ltd. (``Caltechnology''), (3) CPU Products (``CPU''), (4) Enhance Cable Technology
(``Enhance''), (5) Focus Enhancements, Inc. (``Focus''), (6) Full Enterprises Corp. (``Full''), (7) Good Way Industrial
Co., Ltd. (``Good Way''), (8) MACProducts (USA) (now known as DGR Technologies, Inc.) (``DGR''), (9) MicroComputer
Cable Co., Inc. (``MCC''), (10) Ming Technology Corp. (``Ming''), (11) Pan International (USA) (``Pan''), (12)
Shiunn Yang Enterprises Co., Ltd. (``Shiunn Yang''), (13) Taiwan Techtron Corp. (``Techtron''), (14) Technology
Works, Inc. (``TechWorks''), (15) Total Technologies, Ltd. (``Total''), and (16) Tremon Enterprises Co., Ltd.
(``Tremon''). Complainant Farallon alleged infringement of certain claims of U.S. Letters Patent 5,003,579, which
it owns. The Commission published a notice of investigation in the 

Federal Register

 on November 17, 1993 (58 

FR

 60671). Two additional respondents were subsequently added to the investigation: Ji-Haw Industrial Co., Ltd. (``Ji-Haw''),
and Tri-Tech Instruments Co., Ltd. (``Tri-Tech''). 

See

 59 

Fed. Reg.

 10164 (March 3, 1994). 


Of the 18 respondents named in this investigation, the Commission has approved terminations based on settlements
with respect to the following 16 respondents: ABL, Caltechnology, CPU, DGR, Enhance, Focus, Full, Good Way, Ji-Haw,
MCC, Ming, Pan, Shiunn Yang, Techtron, Total, and Tremon. Only respondents Tri-Tech and TechWorks have not settled
with complainant Farallon. 
On April 26, 1994, the ALJ granted Farallon's motion for a summary determination that a domestic industry exists in
accordance with subsections 337(a)(2) and (a)(3). The Commission published a notice of its decision not to review
that ID on May 24, 1994. 

See

 59 

Fed. Reg.

 26811-12 (May 24, 1994). 
On April 28, 1994, Farallon filed a motion for summary determination of violation of section 337. The motion was unopposed
by any respondent and was supported by the Commission investigative attorney. On May 24, 1994, the presiding ALJ issued
an ID finding that there was a violation of section 337. The ALJ found that the '579 patent was valid and infringed, that
Tri-Tech imported the infringing product into the United States, and that after importation, TechWorks sold the
infringing product in the United States. No petitions for review of the ID or government comments were received by
the Commission. 
In connection with final disposition of this investigation, the Commission may issue (1) An order that could result
in the exclusion of the subject articles from entry into the United States, and/or (2) cease and desist orders that
could result in respondents being required to cease and desist from engaging in unfair acts in the importation and
sale of such articles. Accordingly, the Commission is interested in receiving written submissions that address
the form of remedy, if any, that should be ordered. 
If the Commission contemplates some form of remedy, it must consider the effects of that remedy upon the public interest.
The factors the Commission will consider include the effect that an exclusion order and/or cease and desist orders
would have on (1) The public health and welfare, (2) competitive conditions in the U.S. economy, (3) U.S. production
of articles that are like or directly competitive with those that are subject to investigation, and (4) U.S. consumers.
The Commission is therefore interested in receiving written submissions that address the aforementioned public
interest factors in the context of this investigation. 
If the Commission orders some form of remedy, the President has 60 days to approve or disapprove the Commission's action.
During this period, the subject articles would be entitled to enter the United States under a bond, in an amount determined
by the Commission and prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury. The Commission is therefore interested in receiving
submissions concerning the amount of the bond that should be imposed, if remedial orders are issued. 


Written Submissions


The parties to the investigation, interested government agencies, and any other interested persons are encouraged
to file written submissions on the issues of remedy, the public interest, and bonding. 
Complainant and the Commission investigative attorney are also requested to submit proposed remedial orders for
the Commission's consideration. The written submissions and proposed remedial orders must be filed no later than
the close of business on July 8, 1994. Reply submissions must be filed no later than the close of business on July 15,
1994. No further submissions will be permitted unless otherwise ordered by the Commission. 
Persons filing written submissions must file with the Office of the Secretary the original document and 14 true copies
thereof on or before the deadlines stated above. Any person desiring to submit a document (or portion thereof) to the
Commission in confidence must request confidential treatment unless the information has already been granted such
treatment during the proceedings. All such requests should be directed to the Secretary of the Commission and must
include a full statement of the reasons why the Commission should grant such treatment. 

See

 19 CFR 201.6. Documents for which confidential treatment is granted by the Commission will be treated accordingly.
All nonconfidential written submissions will be available for public inspection at the Office of the Secretary.

This action is taken under the authority of section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1337), and sections
210.53 and 210.58 of the Commission's Interim Rules of Practice and Procedure (19 CFR 210.53 and 210.58). 
Copies of the ID and all other nonconfidential documents filed in connection with this investigation are or will be
available for inspection during official business hours (8:45 a.m. to 5:15 p.m.) in the Office of the Secretary, U.S.
International Trade Commission, 500 E Street, SW., Washington, DC 20436, telephone 202-205-2000. Hearing-impaired

<USDEPT>JOINT BOARD FOR THE ENROLLMENT OF ACTUARIES</USDEPT>



<DOCTITLE>Advisory Committee on Actuarial Examinations; Invitation for Membership on Advisory Committee </DOCTITLE>



The Joint Board for the Enrollment of Actuaries (Joint Board) established under the Employment Retirement Income
Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), is responsible for the enrollment of individuals who wish to perform actuarial services
under ERISA. The Joint Board has established an Advisory Committee on Actuarial Examinations (Advisory Committee)
to assist in its examination duties mandated by ERISA. The term of the current Advisory Committee will expire on November
1, 1994. The charter for the Joint Board's Advisory Committee has been renewed, and a new Advisory Committee will be
formed. This notice describes the Advisory Committee and invites applications from those interested in service
on it.



1. General



To qualify for enrollment to perform actuarial services under ERISA, an applicant must have requisite pension actuarial
experience and must satisfy knowledge requirements as provided in the Joint Board's regulations. The knowledge
requirements may be satisfied by successful completion of Joint Board examinations in basic actuarial mathematics
and methodology, and in actuarial mathematics and methodology relating to pension plans qualifying under ERISA.

The Joint Board, the Society of Actuaries and the American Society of Pension Actuaries jointly offer examinations
acceptable to the Joint Board for enrollment purposes and acceptable to those actuarial organizations as part of
their respective examination programs.



2. Purposes



The Advisory Committee plays an integral role in the examination program by assisting the Joint Board in offering
examinations which will enable examination candidates to demonstrate the knowledge necessary to qualify for enrollment.
The purpose of the Advisory Committee, as renewed, will remain that of assisting the Joint Board in fulfilling this
responsibility. The Advisory Committee will discuss the philosophy of such examinations, will review topics appropriately
covered in them, and will make recommendations relative thereto. It also will recommend to the Joint Board proposed
examination questions. The Joint Board will maintain liaison with the Advisory Committee in this process to ensure
that its views on examination content are understood.



3. Function



The manner in which the Advisory Committee functions in preparing examination questions is intertwined with the
jointly administered examination program. Under that program, the participating actuarial organizations draft
questions and submit them to the Advisory Committee for its consideration. After review of the draft questions, the
Advisory Committee selects appropriate questions, modifies them as it deems desirable, and then prepares one or
more drafts of actuarial examinations to be recommended to the Joint Board. (In addition to revisions of the draft
questions, it may be necessary for the Advisory Committee to originate questions and include them in what is recommended.)



4. Membership



The Joint Board will take steps to ensure maximum practicable representation on the Advisory Committee of points
of view regarding the Joint Board's actuarial examination extant in the community of actuaries. In this regard, appointment
will be made from the actuarial community at large and from nominees provided by the actuarial organizations. Since
the members of the actuarial organizations comprise a large segment of the actuarial profession, this appointive
process ensures expression of a broad spectrum of viewpoints. All members of the Advisory Committee will be expected
to act in the public interest, that is, to produce examinations which will help ensure a level of competence among those
who will be accorded enrollment to perform actuarial services under ERISA.

Membership normally will be limited to actuaries previously enrolled by the Joint Board. However, individuals having
academic or other special qualifications of particular value for the Advisory Committee's work also will be considered
for membership. The Advisory Committee will be comprised of not more than nine members.

The Advisory Committee will meet about four times a year. Advisory Committee members should be prepared to devote
from 100 to 150 hours, including meeting time, to the work of the Advisory Committee over the course of a year. Members
will be reimbursed for Advisory Committee travel, meals and lodging expenses incurred in accordance with applicable
government regulations.

Actuaries interested in serving on the Advisory Committee should express their interest and fully state their qualifications
in a letter addressed to: Joint Board for the Enrollment of Actuaries, c/o Office of Director of Practice, Internal
Revenue Service, suite 600, 801 Pennsylvania Avenue NW., Washington, DC 20004.

Any questions may be directed to the Joint Board's Executive Director at 202-376-1421.

The deadline for accepting applications is September 6, 1994.

Notice of Public Meeting.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Commission on the Future of Worker-Management Relations was established in accordance with the Federal Advisory
Committee Act (FACA) Pub. L. 92-463. Pursuant to Section 10(a) of FACA, this is to announce that the Commission
will meet at the time and place shown below:



Time and Place




The meeting will be on Monday, July 25, 1994 from 9:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m. in Room N-3437 A-D, U.S. Department
of Labor, 200 Constitution Avenue, NW., Washington, DC.



Agenda




The agenda for the meeting is as follows:


The Commission is seeking proposals and options to deal with the problems identified in its Fact Finding Report related
to the appropriate coverage of labor relations and employment law with respect to (1) the dividing line between employee
and individual contractor (part of ``contingent workers''), and (2) the proper scope of the exclusion of managers,
supervisors and salaried employees from the protection of such laws.


The Fact Finding Report identifies some of the facts and questions relevant to these issues at varying points including
the following pages: 21-22, 39-40, 55-57, 93-95, 110-111, 123-125.


The Commission invites the views of interested parties about both problems cited above that are reported to arise
under current law and the recommendations they would make to deal with these problems. The Commission would also welcome
comparisons of the current treatment of these questions under the National Labor Relations Act and various forms
of employment regulation (such as FLSA, OSHA, ERISA and civil rights law).



Public Participation




The meeting will be open to the public. It will be in session from 9:00 a.m. until 3:00 p.m. when it will adjourn. Seating
will be available to the public on a first-come, first-served basis. Disabled individuals wishing to attend should

if they indicate they would like to appear, in addition to organizational representatives invited to present proposals
to the Commission. Individuals who wish to submit written statements should send 15 copies on or before July 18, to
Mrs. June M. Robinson, Designated Federal Official, Commission on the Future of Worker-Management Relations, U.S.
Department of Labor, 200 Constitution Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20210, telephone (202) 219-9148.

<DOCTITLE>Coal Mine Respirable Dust Standard; </DOCTITLE>
Single-Shift and Noncompliance Determinations 



AGENCIES:

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of public hearings. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)
will hold additional hearings to receive comments on proposed changes to the Federal program for respirable coal
mine dust. The first hearing will address a joint finding by the Secretary of Labor and the Secretary of Health and Human
Services that the average concentration of respirable dust to which each miner in the active workings of a coal mine
is exposed can be measured accurately over a single shift. This hearing is being held under section 101 of the Federal
Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 (Mine Act). Following that hearing, MSHA will hold a second hearing to receive public
comments on the Agency's intent to use single, full-shift respirable dust measurements to determine noncompliance
under the MSHA coal mine respirable dust standard. The hearings will be held in Salt Lake City, Utah. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On February 18, 1994, the Secretary of Labor and the Secretary of Health and Human Services jointly published a notice
in the 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 8357) announcing a new finding that the average concentration of respirable dust to which each miner in the active
workings of a coal mine is exposed can be accurately measured over a single shift in accordance with section 202(f)(2)
of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977. Based on this finding, the Secretaries are proposing to rescind the
finding issued on July 17, 1971, and affirmed on February 23, 1972. 




Concurrently, MSHA published a notice in the 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 8356) announcing its intention to use both single, full-shift respirable dust measurements, and the average
of multiple, full-shift respirable dust samples, to determine noncompliance and issue citations for violations
of the respirable dust standard under the MSHA coal mine respirable dust program. 


Public hearings on these matters were held on July 6, 1994, in Morgantown, West Virginia (59 FR 29348-29349).
In response to requests from the mining community, MSHA has scheduled a second set of public hearings in the West. NIOSH
concurs with this action and will participate. The hearings will be held in accordance with the same procedures cited
in the 

Federal Register

 notices for the July 6, 1994, hearings. 


To allow for the submission of post-hearing comments, the record will remain open until August 5, 1994.

<DOCTITLE>Northeast Nuclear Energy Company; Consideration of Issuance of Amendment to Facility Operating License, Proposed
No Significant Hazards Consideration Determination, and Opportunity for a Hearing </DOCTITLE>



The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an amendment to Facility Operating
License No. DPR-21, issued to the Northeast Nuclear Energy Company (NNECO/the Licensee), for operation of
the Millstone Nuclear Power Station, Unit No. 2, located in New London County, Connecticut. 

The proposed amendment would revise the Technical Specifications (TS) to change the Administrative Controls section
to require an individual who serves as the Operations Manager to either hold a Millstone Unit 2 senior reactor operator
(SRO) license or have an SRO license at another pressurized water reactor (PWR). If the Operating Manager does not
hold a Millstone Unit 2 SRO license, then an individual serving as the Assistant Operations Manager would be required
to possess an SRO license at Millstone Unit 2. 

The proposed change would permit Millstone Unit 2 to accelerate efforts to strengthen the Millstone Unit 2 Operations
Department. Exigent action is justified in order to permit the licensee to proceed with their efforts to strengthen
the Millstone Unit 2 Operations Department in a prompt and decisive manner. 

Before issuance of the proposed license amendment, the Commission will have made findings required by the Atomic
Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act) and the Commission's regulations. 

Pursuant to 10 CFR 50.91(a)(6) for amendments to be granted under exigent circumstances, the NRC staff must determine
that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration. Under the Commission's regulations
in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not (1) involve
a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated; or (2) create the
possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant
reduction in a margin of safety. As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue
of no significant hazards (SHC) consideration, which is presented below: 

The proposed changes do not involve a SHC because the changes would not: 

1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. 

The proposed change affects an administrative control, which was based on the guidance of ANSI N18.1-1971.
ANSI N18.1-1971 recommended that the Operations Manager hold an SRO license. The current guidance in Section
4.2.2 of ANSI/ANS-3.1-1987 recommends, as one option, that the Operations Manager have held a license
for a similar unit and the Operations Middle Manager hold an SRO license. While the Operations Middle Manager position
does not exist at Millstone Unit No. 2, we are proposing to create the position of Assistant Operations Manager (staffed
by an individual with an SRO license at Millstone Unit No. 2). This individual will be required to meet the requirements
for, and will have responsibilities as recommended in ANSI/ANS-3.1-1987 for the Operations Middle Manager
position.

<DOCNO> FR940707-2-00166 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940707-2-00091 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Therefore, the proposed change requests an exception to ANSI N18.1-1971 to allow use of ANSI/ANS-3.1-1987
in a limited circumstance. Specifically, the proposed revision to Technical Specification 6.3.1 would require
the Operations Manager to either hold an SRO license at Millstone Unit No. 2 or have held an SRO at a PWR other than Millstone
Unit No. 2.
If the Operations Manager does not hold an SRO license at Millstone Unit No. 2, the proposal will require the Assistant
Operations Manager to hold, and continue to hold, an SRO license. The proposed change includes the requirement to
have held a license for a similar unit (a PWR) in accordance with Section 4.2.2 of ANSI/ANS-3.1-1987, if
the Operations Manager does not hold an SRO license at Millstone Unit No. 2. For those areas of knowledge that require
an SRO license, the Assistant Operations Manager will hold an SRO license and provide technical guidance normally
required by the Operations Manager.
The proposed change does not alter the design of any system, structure, or component, nor does it change the way plant
systems are operated. It does not reduce the knowledge, qualifications, or skills of licensed operators, and does
not affect the way the Operations Department is managed by the Operations Manager. The Operations Manager will continue
to maintain the effective performance of his personnel and ensure the plant is operated safely and in accordance with
the requirements of the operating license. Additionally, the Control Room operators will continue to be supervised
by the licensed Shift Supervisors.
The proposed change does not detract from the Operations Manager's ability to perform his primary responsibilities.
In this case, by having previously held an SRO license for a similar unit, he has achieved the necessary training, skills,
and experience to fully understand the operation of plant equipment and the watch requirements for operators.
In summary, the proposed change does not affect the ability of the Operations Manager to provide the plant oversight
required of his position. Thus, it does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an
accident previously evaluated.
2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated.
The proposed change to Technical Specification 6.3.1 does not affect the design or function of any plant system, structure,
or component, nor does it change the way plant systems are operated. It does not affect the performance of NRC licensed
operators. Operation of the plant in conformance with technical specifications and other license requirements
will continue to be supervised by personnel who hold an NRC SRO license. The proposed change to Technical Specification
6.3.1 ensures that the Operations Manager will be a knowledgeable and qualified individual by requiring the individual
to have held an SRO license at a PWR. Based on the above, the proposed change does not create the possibility of a new or
different kind of accident from any previously evaluated.
3. Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.
The proposed change involves an administrative control which is not related to the margin of safety as defined in the
technical specifications. The proposed change does not reduce the level of knowledge or experience required of an
individual who fills the Operations Manager position, nor does it affect the conservative manner in which the plant
is operated. The Control Room operators will continue to be supervised by personnel who hold an SRO license. Thus,
the proposed changes do not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.
The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.
The Commission is seeking public comments on this proposed determination. Any comments received within 15 days after
the date of publication of this notice will be considered in making any final determination.
Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendment until the expiration of the 15-day notice period. However,
should circumstances change during the notice period, such that failure to act in a timely way would result, for example,
in derating or shutdown of the facility, the Commission may issue the license amendment before the expiration of the
15-day notice period, provided that its final determination is that the amendment involves no significant hazards
consideration. The final determination will consider all public and State comments received. Should the Commission
take this action, it will publish in the 

Federal Register

 a notice of issuance. The Commission expects that the need to take this action will occur very infrequently.
Written comments may be submitted by mail to the Rules Review and Directives Branch, Division of Freedom of Information
and Publications Service, Office of Administration, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555,
and should cite the publication date and page number of this 

Federal Register

 notice. Written comments may also be delivered to Room 6D22, Two White Flint North, 11545 Rockville Pike, Rockville,
Maryland, from 7:30 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. Federal workdays. Copies of written comments received may be examined at the
NRC Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555.
The filing of requests for hearing and petitions for leave to intervene is discussed below.
By August 8, 1994, the licensee may file a request for a hearing with respect to issuance of the amendment to the subject
facility operating license and any person whose interest may be affected by this proceeding and who wishes to participate
as a party in the proceeding must file a written request for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene. Requests
for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's ``rules of Practice
for Domestic Licensing Proceedings'' in 10 CFR Part 2. Interested persons should consult a current copy of 10 CFR 2.714
which is available at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington,
DC 20555 and at the local public document room located at the Learning Resource Center, Three Rivers Community-Technical
College, Thames Valley Campus, 574 New London Turnpike, Norwich, Connecticut 06360. If a request for a hearing or
petition for leave to intervene is filed by the above date, the Commission or an Atomic Safety and Licensing Board,
designated by the Commission or by the Chairman of the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board Panel, will rule on the request
and/or petition; and the Secretary or the designated Atomic Safety and Licensing Board will issue a notice of hearing
or an appropriate order.
As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall set forth with particularity the interest of the
petitioner in the proceeding, and how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding. The petition
should specifically explain the reasons why intervention should be permitted with particular reference to the following
factors: (1) The nature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made a party to the proceeding; (2) the nature and
extent of the petitioner's property, financial, or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect
of any order which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest. The petition should also identify
the specific aspect(s) of the subject matter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Any person
who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has been admitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting
leave of the Board up to 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended
petition must satisfy the specificity requirements described above.
Not later than 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file
a supplement to the petition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions which are sought to be litigated
in the matter. Each contention must consist of a specific statement of the issue of law or fact to be raised or controverted.
In addition, the petitioner shall provide a brief explanation of the bases of the contention and a concise statement
of the alleged facts or expert opinion which support the contention and on which the petitioner intends to rely in proving
the contention at the hearing. The petitioner must also provide references to those specific sources and documents
of which the petitioner is aware and on which the petitioner intends to rely to establish those facts or expert opinion.
Petitioner must provide sufficient information to show that a genuine dispute exists with the applicant on a material
issue of law or fact. Contentions shall be limited to matters within the scope of the amendment under consideration.
The contention must be one which, if proven, would entitle the petitioner to relief. A petitioner who fails to file
such a supplement which satisfies these requirements with respect to at least one contention will be permitted to
participate as a party.
Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subject to any limitations in the order granting leave
to intervene, and have the opportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, including the opportunity
to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses.
If the amendment is issued before the expiration of the 30-day hearing period, the Commission will make a final determination
on the issue of no significant hazards consideration. If a hearing is requested, the final determination will serve
to decide when the hearing is held.

If the final determination is that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration, the Commission
may issue the amendment and make it immediately effective, notwithstanding the request for a hearing. Any hearing
held would take place after issuance of the amendment.

If the final determination is that the amendment request involves a significant hazards consideration, any hearing
held would take place before the issuance of any amendment.

A request for a hearing or a petition for leave to intervene must be filed with the Secretary of the Commission, U.S.
Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Docketing and Services Branch, or may be delivered
to the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555, by the above
date. Where petitions are filed during the last 10 days of the notice period, it is requested that the petitioner promptly
so inform the Commission by a toll-free telephone call to Western Union at 1-(800) 248-5100 (in Missouri
1-(800) 342-6700). The Western Union operator should be given Datagram Identification Number N1023
and the following message addressed to John F. Stolz, Director, Project Directorate I-4: petitioner's name
and telephone number, date petition was mailed, plant name, and publication date and page number of this 

Federal Register

 notice. A copy of the petition should also be sent to the Office of the General Counsel, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,
Washington, DC 20555, and to Gerald Garfield, Esquire, Day, Berry & Howard, City Place, Hartford, Connecticut
06103-3499, attorney for the licensee.

Nontimely filings of petitions for leave to intervene, amended petitions, supplemental petitions and/or requests
for hearing will not be entertained absent a determination by the Commission, the presiding officer or the presiding
Atomic Safety and Licensing Board that the petition and/or request should be granted based upon a balancing of the
factors specified in 10 CFR 2.714(a)(1)(i)-(v) and 2.714(d).

For further details with respect to this action, see the application for amendment dated June 24, 1994, which is available

<DOCTITLE>In the Matters of Tennessee Valley Authority (Bellefonte Nuclear Plant, Units 1 and 2)</DOCTITLE>



Order



I



Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA or the applicant) is the current holder of Construction Permit Nos. CPPR-122
and CPPR-123, issued by the Atomic Energy Commission on December 12, 1974, for construction of the Bellefonte
Nuclear Plant (BLN), Units 1 and 2. These facilities are currently under construction at the applicant's site on a
peninsula at Tennessee River Mile (TRM) 392 on the west shore of Guntersville Reservoir, about 6 miles east-northeast
of Scottsboro, Alabama.

On April 19, 1994, the TVA filed a request pursuant to 10 CFR 50.55(b) for extensions of the completion dates. The extensions
were sought because construction activities had been deferred in 1988 due, in part, to a lower than expected load forecast.
On March 23, 1993, TVA notified NRC that it planned to resume completion activities 120 days from the date of the letter.
However, as a result of the delay from the inactivity during the construction deferral and a need to conduct an Integrated
Resource Planning (IRP) process to consider the lowest-cost options for providing an adequate supply of electricity
to TVA's customers pursuant to the provisions of the Energy Policy Act of 1992, TVA is unable to complete the construction
of the two units before the expiration of CPPR-122 on July 1, 1994, and CPPR-123 on July 1, 1996, and construction
permits extensions now need to be extended. As part of the planning process, TVA will evaluate the completion of the
BLN units along with other generating options. The IRP process is presently scheduled for completion in November
1995. Additional delays associated with these efforts to ensure that BLN complies with regulatory requirements
and licensing commitments make it necessary for TVA to request extensions of the expiration dates for Construction
Permit Nos. CPPR-122 and CPPR-123.



II



The NRC staff has concluded that good cause has been shown for the delays, the extensions are sought for a reasonable
period, and this action involves no significant hazards consideration, the basis for which are given in the staff's
evaluation.

The NRC staff has prepared an Environmental Assessment and Finding of No Significant Impact which was published in
the 

Federal Register

 on May 26, 1994 (59 FR 27299).

Pursuant to 10 CFR 51.32, the Commission has determined that extending the construction completion dates will have
no significant impact on the environment.

The applicant's letter dated April 19, 1994, and the NRC staff's letter and safety evaluation of the request for extensions
of the construction permits, dated June 27, 1994, are available for public inspection at the Commission's Public
Document Room, Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555-0001 and at the Local Public Document
Room, Scottsboro Public Library, 1002 South Broad Street, Scottsboro, Alabama 37402. 



III

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This is to give notice that the Commission will conduct a roundtable discussion on July 18 and July 19, 1994, at the Willard
Hotel, Washington, DC, beginning at 8:30 a.m., to inaugurate a comprehensive study of regulation under the Public
Utility Holding Company Act of 1935. The public is invited to attend.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The Commission will conduct a roundtable discussion on July 18 and July 19, 1994, at the Willard Hotel, Washington,
DC, beginning at 8:30 a.m., to inaugurate a comprehensive study of regulation under the Public Utility Holding Company
Act of 1935 (``1935 Act'').



The 1935 Act was New Deal legislation, enacted by Congress to eliminate abuses that had plagued the United States electric
and gas utility industry and threatened the interests of investors and consumers. The statute is complex and far-reaching.
Although there have been fundamental changes in the industry in the past sixty years, the 1935 Act has remained largely
unchanged.

The Commission believes that it is time to undertake a thorough evaluation of the 1935 Act, to review the regulatory
framework in light of developments in the industry, and to consider how federal regulation of utility holding companies
can best serve the public interest and the interest of investors and consumers in the approaching century.

To that end, the Commission recently announced that it will undertake a comprehensive study of the 1935 Act.
 The study will be inaugurated by a roundtable discussion in which representatives of the industry, state, local and
other federal regulators, consumer groups, trade associations, an economist, investment banks, rating agencies
and others will participate. The public is invited to attend. The agenda is set forth below:





Roundtable Agenda



Monday, July 18, 1994



Morning Session



8:30 am_Opening remarks of Chairman Arthur Levitt

8:45 am_Introductory remarks by staff of the Division of Investment Management

9:00 am_

The future of the industry




There have been profound changes in the gas and electric industries over the past few years. The Energy Policy Act of
1992, in particular, has accelerated the development of a competitive electric industry, and freed United States
companies to invest in utility operations around the world. The momentum in this area is not abating_retail wheeling
is only the most recent issue. How will the profile of the industry change in coming years? What role, if any, is envisioned
for a federal holding company statute in this evolving industry?



Afternoon Session



1:30 pm_State and federal regulation




A federal holding company statute should supplement, not supplant, the work of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
and state and local regulators. What is the role of a federal holding company statute in the regulation of the gas and
electric utility industry? Given the roles of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and state and local regulators,
is a federal holding company statute necessary for effective regulation?

Morning Session



8:30 am_Opening remarks by Commissioner Richard Y. Roberts.

8:45 am_Brief remarks by staff of the Division of Investment Management

 9:00 am_Financings and intrasystem transactions







What protections are provided by review of financing transactions under a federal holding company statute? Is this
review still necessary in light of developments in other federal and state regulation? If so, how could this review
be made more effective and efficient? Is federal oversight of intrasystem transactions needed to prevent affiliate
abuses, or can the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the states effectively safeguard the interests of consumers?






10:50 am_Integration and exemption







The requirement of a single integrated public-utility system was intended to ensure economical and efficient utility
operations. Are the interests of investors and consumers still served by this requirement? Has the requirement of
geographic integration affected the development of creative solutions to the production and delivery of energy?


Should the law prohibit foreign ownership of United States public-utility companies? If so, why and under what conditions?


The law currently exempts certain types of holding companies. Do the theories underlying these exemptions remain
valid? Should the exemptions be changed in light of recent developments? Are additional exemptions needed?



Afternoon Session



1:30 pm_Diversification







Has the requirement that nonutility interests be ``functionally related'' to a system's core utility operations
demonstrably benefited investors and consumers of registered holding companies? What has been the experience of
companies that were not similarly constrained?


Should there be limits on diversification by utility holding companies? How would increased diversification affect
the ability of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the states to protect the interests of consumers? When
would the risks associated with diversification outweigh the potential benefits?






4:00 pm_Questions and comments

5:00 pm_Session ends







Based upon the roundtable discussions and its own review, the Commission will thereafter invite public comment generally
on every aspect of the 1935 Act and specifically on certain issues. The comments will be incorporated in a report and
recommendations at the conclusion of the study.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; American Stock Exchange, Inc.; Order Approving Proposed Rule Change Relating
to the Floor Official Zone System</DOCTITLE>


June 30, 1994.


On April 18, 1994, the American Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Amex'' or ``Exchange'') submitted to the Securities and Exchange
Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission''), pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'')
 and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,
 a proposed rule change to amend Exchange Rule 22 (``Authority of Floor Officials'') to delete references to the Floor
Official zone system.





The proposed rule change was published for comment in Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33980 (April 28, 1994),
59 FR 23241 (May 5, 1994). No comments were received on the proposal. This order approves the proposed rule change.
The Exchange Floor currently is divided into zones comprised of designated trading posts. As set forth in Commentary
.01 to Amex Rule 22, each Floor Official is assigned to a specific zone and may render rulings only in that zone. Among
other things, Rule 22(c) authorizes a Floor Official to supervise openings and reopenings of securities; to halt
or reopen trading in a security; to resolve market disputes submitted to him or her by members; and to regulate and supervise
unusual situations which may arise in connection with the making of bids, offers or transactions. Finally, a majority
of the available Floor Officials assigned to a zone may (1) restrict or ban trading by Registered Traders; (2) restrict
or ban transactions pursuant to off-Floor orders in which members or member organizations have an interest; (3) prohibit
specialists from accepting stop or stop limit orders; or (4) restrict or ban the use of hand signals.





The Exchange proposes to amend Rule 22 to delete references to the zone system for purposes of establishing the authority
of Floor Officials, and to permit a Floor Official to render rulings anywhere on the Floor. In addition, the Amex proposal
will provide that those matters which currently require the approval of a majority of the Floor Officials in a zone
 may be determined by a Floor Official with the concurrence of a Senior Floor Official.






The Amex states that the proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6(b) of the Act in general and furthers the
objectives of Section 6(b)(5) in particular in that it is designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade
and remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market.
The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, with the requirements
of Section 6(b).
 In particular, the Commission believes the proposal is consistent with the Section 6(b)(5) requirements that the
rules of an exchange be designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to prevent fraudulent and manipulative
acts, and, in general, to protect investors and the public interest.




After careful review, the Commission agrees with the Amex that the Floor Official zone system may not be appropriate
for today's market environment. According to the Amex, its system of assigning Floor Officials to specific zones
was adopted in 1965, before the Exchange Floor was expanded and reconfigured. The Amex also notes that, since that
time, new securities products and improved technologies have been developed, and trading (particularly for options
and other derivatives) generally proceeds at a faster pace. Given these changes in market conditions, the Commission
finds that requiring members to deal only with the assigned Floor Officials may be unduly time-consuming and burdensome.
Accordingly, the Commission believes that the proposed rule change should facilitate quicker resolution of trading
questions. By eliminating the zone system for assignment of Floor Officials, the Amex proposal will enable members
to seek guidance from any Floor Official. In the Commission's opinion, this flexibility should reduce unnecessary
delays and encourage compliance with Exchange rules, the Act and the regulations thereunder. For those matters which
previously required the approval of a majority of the Floor Officials in a zone,
 the Commission believes that the Amex proposal contains sufficient safeguards to ensure accurate and consistent
decisionmaking. Specifically, the Floor official who determines the matter will be required to consult with, and
obtain the agreement of, a Senior Floor Official (

i.e.,

 a Floor Governor or an Exchange Official who was previously a Floor Governor).
 According to Amex staff, these individuals are among the most experienced and knowledgeable members of Exchange.





It is therefore ordered, pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act,
 that the proposed rule change (SR-Amex-94-11) is approved.



For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Order Approving a Proposed Rule Change by the Boston Stock Exchange Inc., Relating
to the Insider Trading and Securities Fraud Enforcement Act of 1988 </DOCTITLE>



June 30, 1994.



I. Introduction



On November 8, 1993, the Boston Stock Exchange Inc. (``BSE'' or ``Exchange'') submitted to the Securities and Exchange
Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission''), pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'')
 and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,
 a proposed rule change to adopt a new BSE Rule_Chapter II, Section 37(a), ITSFEA Procedures_relating to the establishment,
maintenance and enforcement of procedures designed to prevent the misuse of material, non-public information.
On January 13, 1994, the BSE submitted to the Commission an amendment to the proposed rule change.
 Notice of the proposal appeared in the 

Federal Register

 on February 14, 1994. No comments were received on the proposal.







II. Description of the Proposal


A. Background



In November 1988, Congress enacted the Insider Trading and Securities Fraud Enforcement Act of 1988 (``ITSFEA''),
designed primarily to prevent, deter, and prosecute insider trading.
 ITSFEA created a new Section 15(f) of the Act
 to require broker-dealers to maintain procedures designed to prevent the misuse of material, non-public information
by such Broker-dealers or any person associated with such broker-dealers. ITSEFEA also granted the Commission broad
rule-making authority concerning so-called ``Chinese Wall'' procedures developed by broker-dealers to deter
and prevent insider trading.
 Pursuant to this grant of rule-making authority, the Division undertook a comprehensive review of broker-dealer
policies and procedures and, in March of 1990, issued a report of its findings, conclusions and recommendations.
 In the Report, the Division stated that, among other things, it was concerned about the need for firms to ``maintain
documentation sufficient to recreate actions taken pursuant to Chinese Wall procedures.''
 Accordingly, the Division urged the self-regulatory organizations (``SRO'') to develop standards of documentation
for their member firms as well as effective examination programs.









B. The Proposal



The proposed rule change was designed to supplement Section 15(f) of the Act and ITSFEA, by requiring every member
organization of the Exchange to establish, maintain, and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed
to prevent the misuse of material, non-public information by such member and any person associated with the member.
The proposal establishes minimum standards for compliance with the record-keeping requirements of the Rule and
the Act. It mandates that all members that are required to file SEC Form X-17A-5 (``FOCUS Reports'') with
the Exchange on an annual basis submit with their FOCUS Reports signed statements by such members that the procedures
mandated by this rule have been established, enforced and maintained. The proposal requires members and associated
persons to promptly notify the Exchange's Market Surveillance Department of any securities transaction that the
firm reasonably believes may have involved the misuse of material, non-public information. Finally, the proposal
provides that when BSE members adopt written supervisory procedures relating to ITSFEA in connection with requirements
of another designated examining authority (``DEA''), that member organization shall not be subject to the ITSFEA
requirements of this Rule.

The proposal adds four Supplementary Material provisions to Chapter II, ITSFEA Procedures, Section 37(a) of the
BSE Rules. Supplementary Material 
.01 describes conduct that would constitute the misuse of material, non-public information. This conduct includes,
but is not limited to: (a) Trading in any securities, or in any related securities issued by a corporation, in any related
securities or related options on other derivative securities while knowingly in possession of material non-public
information concerning that issuer; (b) trading in a security or related option or other derivative security while
in possession of material, non-public information concerning imminent transactions in the security or related
securities; or (c) disclosing to another person or entity any material, non-public information involving a corporation
whose shares are publicly traded or an imminent transaction in an underlying security or related securities for the
purpose of knowingly facilitating the possible misuse of material, non-public information.

The Exchange states that the scope of the aforementioned definition is intended to be consistent with the goals of
Section 15(f) of the Act and ITSFEA to prevent the misuse of material, non-public information. The Exchange believes
that this definition should be broad enough to encompass frontrunning, trading on the basis of material corporate
inside information, tipping, and misappropriating material corporate inside information.
Supplementary Material .02 defines the terms ``associated person'' or ``person associated with a member.'' These
terms shall mean any partner, officer, director, or branch manager of a member (or any person occupying a similar status
or performing similar functions), any person directly or indirectly controlling, controlled by, or under common
control with a member, or any employee of a member.
Supplementary Material .03 requires, at a minimum, that each member establish, maintain and enforce certain policies
and procedures. This provision specifically requires, first, that members must advise all associated persons in
writing of the prohibition against the misuse of material, non-public information. Second, each member organization
and all persons associated with that member organization must sign statements affirming their awareness of and agreement
to abide by the prohibitions of the ITSFEA Rule. These signed statements must be maintained for at least three years,
the first two years in an easily accessible place. Third, each member organization must maintain copies of trade confirmations
and monthly account statements for each account in which an associated person has a direct or indirect interest or
makes investment decisions. These trade confirmations and monthly account statements must be maintained for at
least three years, the first two years in an easily accessible place. In addition, such brokerage accounts must be
reviewed at least quarterly by the member organization for the purpose of detecting the possible misuse of material,
non-public information. Fourth, an associated person must disclose to the member organization whether he, or any
person in whose account he has a direct or indirect financial interest, is an officer, director or 10% shareholder
in a company whose shares are publicly traded. Any transaction in the stock (or option thereon) of such company shall
be reviewed to determine whether the transaction may have involved a misuse of material, non-public information.
The Exchange states that the aforementioned policies and procedures may not, in all cases, satisfy the requirements
of this rule. The adequacy of each member's policies and procedures will depend upon the nature of such member's business.
Supplementary Material .04 and the Sample Membership Bulletin
 (Exhibit 3 to the proposal) describe a set of forms, denominated as the ``ITSFEA Compliance Procedures'' (Exhibit
4 to the proposal), which may be used by certain eligible member organizations to facilitate their compliance with
the recordkeeping and filing requirements of Chapter II, Section 37 (a) and (b). The Exchange states that the Sample
ITSFEA Compliance Procedures are intended to constitute the minimum policies and procedures required by the Act
and this rule. Their use, however, does not ensure compliance with the recordkeeping and filing requirements.




The Sample ITSFEA Compliance Procedures require identification of securities accounts as described in ITSFEA Form
1 (``Form 1''). Form 1 requires each associated person to submit a list of each securities accounts in which he/she
either has a direct or indirect financial interest, or makes investment decisions. This list is to include not only
the accounts of associated persons, but also the accounts of relatives of such persons to the extent that an associated
person has an interest in such accounts or makes investment decisions with respect thereto. Form 1 further requires
all associated persons to transmit to the member organization duplicate trade confirmations and monthly account
statements for each account in which they have a direct or indirect financial interest, or for which they make investment
decisions. These account statements must be maintained by the member organization for at least three years. In addition,
Form 1 requires all associated persons to disclose to the member organization if they, or any persons in whose account
they have a direct or indirect financial interest, or over whose account they make investment decisions, is an officer,
director or 10% shareholder in the company whose shares are publicly traded. Any transaction in the stock of any company
shall be reviewed to determine whether the transaction may have involved a misuse of material, non-public information.

<DOCNO> FR940707-2-00174 </DOCNO>

<TEXT>
 

The Sample ITSFEA Compliance Procedures requires a ``Statement of Compliance by Associated Persons'' as described
in ITSFEA Form 2 (``Form 2'').
 Form 2 outlines a sample ``Statement of Compliance'' which should be read and signed by all associated persons at the
time they join the member organization and at least annually thereafter.





The Sample ITSFEA Compliance Procedures also require a ``Statement of Compliance by Senior Reporting Member'' as
described in ITSFEA Form 3 (``Form 3'').
 Form 3 provides that each member organization must designate a Senior Reporting Member to be responsible for implementing
all necessary policies and procedures on behalf of the member organization.
 This person shall sign a Statement of Compliance on behalf of the member organization and submit such certification
to the Exchange at the time the firm files its year-end FOCUS Report (Form X-17A-5).






The Sample ITSFEA Compliance Procedures provide additional guidance regarding account review and review of proprietary
or associated person trading. For example, under the Sample ITSFEA Compliance Procedures, a member organization
shall review, at least quarterly, all account statements and/or trade confirmations for accounts in which associated
persons have a direct or indirect financial interest or make investment decisions and a written record of such review
shall be maintained for three years. The Sample ITSFEA Compliance Procedures also provide, 

inter alia

, that when conducting a review of proprietary or associated person trading, the timing or unusual nature of a transaction
shall be considered.



III. Discussion and Conclusion



The Commission believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with section 6(b) of the Act, in general, and section
6(b)(5) of the Act, in particular,
 in that it is designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices and promote just and equitable principles
of trade. The proposal will accomplish this by setting standards and bringing consistency to member practices to
prevent the misuse of material, non-public information.





Broker-dealer Chinese Walls predate section 15(f) of the Act and have evolved to include policies and physical apparatus
designed to prevent the improper or unintended dissemination of market sensitive information from one division
of a multi-service firm to another. The Chinese Wall procedures also have developed trading reviews designed to prevent
and detect illegal trading. Prior to the existence of section 15(f), however, the policies and procedures varied
from one broker-dealer to the next, ranging from very tight, centralized control of information and review to little
or no review or follow-up. The Division, in its Report, stated that broker-dealer oversight with regard to section
15(f) is an important issue and is best effectuated by SRO examinations and regulation subject to Commission oversight.
 The Commission believes that the BSE's proposal adequately addresses the concerns raised in the Division's Report
and that it should help to prevent the misuse of material, non-public information by brokers and dealers.





Specifically, the Commission believes that the policies and procedures set forth in Chapter II, Section 37(a) of
the BSE Rules and the corresponding Supplementary Material provisions will serve to ensure that BSE members establish,
maintain and enforce policies to prevent the misuse of material, non-public information, thereby helping to assure
that BSE members are in compliance with section 15(f) of the Act. First, the requirement that all associated persons
be advised in writing of the prohibition against the misuse of material, non-public information as defined in the
Rule, and the requirement that member organizations and persons associated with them sign attestations affirming
their awareness of, and agreement to abide by, the aforementioned prohibitions will serve to heighten awareness
of associated persons of this prohibition. Second, the requirements that member organizations maintain copies
of trade confirmations and monthly account statements for each account in which an associated person has a direct
or indirect financial interest or makes investment decisions and that such brokerage accounts be reviewed by the
member organization will assist Exchange and Commission review of those records and make any fraudulent acts easier
to deter and detect. Third, the requirement that an associated person disclose to the member organization whether
he, or any person in whose account he has a direct or indirect financial interest, or for which he makes investment decisions,
is an officer, director or 10% shareholder in a company whose shares are publicly traded, and the requirement that
transactions in the stock (or option thereon) of such company be reviewed to determine whether the transaction may
have involved a misuse of material, non-public information, will assist the Exchange and the Commission in the detection
and deterrence of the misuse of material, non-public information.

The Commission believes that it is consistent with the Act for the BSE Rules to require that only members who file their
FOCUS reports annually with the Exchange submit, along with their FOCUS Reports, an attestation of their compliance
with the BSE Rule. In this regard, the Commission notes that members that file FOCUS Reports on a more frequent basis
are subject to more frequent periodic audits by the Exchange. During these audits, the Exchange will review the procedures
maintained by such members pursuant to the BSE's Rule. Members who file FOCUS Reports on an annual basis, however,
are subject to audits on a more infrequent basis. Accordingly, the Commission believes that the requirement that
these members file an annual attestation that they are in compliance with the BSE Rule will serve as a continuing reminder
of the obligations of this rule. This should result in more internal compliance checks by members and, therefore,
assist the Exchange in the administration of the BSE Rule without compromising the effectiveness of the rule or adherence
to section 15(f) of the Act.

The Commission believes that Supplementary Material .02 of Chapter II, Section 37 of the BSE Rule, which defines ``associated
persons'' or ``person associated with a member'' is consistent with the Act. Currently, the Exchange, in enforcing
its rules, applies the definition of ``person associated with a member'' or ``associated person of a member'' contained
in section 3(a)(21) of the Act. The proposal adopts this definition into the Exchange's rules.

Finally, the Commission believes that the designation of a senior reporting member to be responsible for implementing
all necessary ITSFEA policies and procedures is appropriate to help ensure member firm compliance with the ITSFEA
requirements of the Act.


For the reasons stated above, 

it is therefore ordered,

 pursuant to section 19(b)(2) of the Act,
 that the proposed rule change (SR-BSE-93-19) is hereby approved.




For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Order Approving Proposed Rule Change by the Chicago Board Options Exchange, Inc.,
Relating to Termination of Registered Representatives</DOCTITLE>


June 30, 1994.


On December 14, 1993, the Chicago Board Options Exchange, Inc. (``CBOE'' or ``Exchange'') submitted to the Securities
and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission''), pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934 (``Act'')
 and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,
 a proposal to amend CBOE Rule 9.3, ``Registration and Termination of Registered Representatives,'' to require members
to file with the CBOE's Department of Compliance a termination notice for any discharge or termination of employment
of a registered person, and the reason therefor, within 30 days of the termination. In addition, the CBOE proposes
to allow members to fulfill CBOE Rule 9.3's filing requirements by submitting their filings or submissions to the
North American Securities Administrators Association (``NASAA'')/National Association of Securities Dealers,
Inc. (``NASD'') Central Registration Depository (``CRD'') within the time period allowed under CBOE Rule 9.3.





The proposed rule change was published in Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33826 (March 28, 1994), 59 FR 15467 (April
1, 1994). No comments were received on the proposed rule change.





The CBOE states that the purpose of the proposal is to modify the manner in which CBOE members report ``Termination
for Cause'' of employment or affiliation of any registered representative to the CBOE. Currently, under CBOE Rule
9.3, members must file with the CBOE's Department of Investigation a Uniform Termination Notice for Securities Industry
Registration (Form U-5) immediately after the termination of employment ``for cause'' of a registered representative.
 The proposal makes CBOE Rule 9.3 more encompassing by requiring members to file termination notices with the Exchange's
Department of Compliance for any discharge or termination of employment of a registered person, not just ``terminations
for cause.'' In addition, the proposal clarifies when termination notices must be filed, 

i.e.,

 ``immediately, but in no event later than thirty (30) days following termination,'' and requires members to file
an amended Form U-5 if the member learns of facts or circumstances which cause any information provided in the
notice to become inaccurate or incomplete. Members must file the amended Form U-5 within 30 days after learning
of the facts or circumstances giving rise to the amendment. Finally, the proposal relieves CBOE member organizations
of the obligation to file Form U-5 information in hard copy form and, instead, deems all CBOE Rule 9.3 filings
and submissions as made for purposes of the rule if they are filed with the NASAA/NASD CRD within the time period set
forth in CBOE Rule 9.3.




The CBOE believes that the proposal will reduce the costs to members of copying, handling and mailing termination
materials. Further, the CBOE states that the proposal will bring the CBOE's ``Termination for Cause'' reporting
requirements in line with similar rules of the NASD (NASD By-Law Article IV, Section 3) and the New York Stock Exchange,
Inc. (``NYSE'') (NYSE Rule 345).

<DOCNO> FR940707-2-00176 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940707-2-00096 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The CBOE believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6(b) of the Act, in general, and with Section
6(b)(5), in particular, in that it is designed to improve the CBOE's capacity to enforce compliance with the provisions
of the Act and the CBOE's rules by enabling the Exchange to monitor more efficiently all discharges or terminations
of employment of registered persons, and, in general, to protect investors and the public interest.

The Commission believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules
and regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange and, in particular, the requirements of
Section 6(b)(5)
 in that it is designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade and to protect investors and the public interest.
Specifically, the Commission believes that the proposal to require CBOE members to file Form U-5 notices for
any discharge or termination with the Exchange, rather than only for ``terminations for cause,'' should facilitate
the CBOE's oversight of members' personnel by providing a more complete and accurate record of the employment history
of registered representatives.
 The Commission also believes that the proposal should help the Exchange to fulfill its responsibility under Section
6(c) of the Act to deny membership to those who have engaged in acts or practices inconsistent with just and equitable
principles of trade. In addition, the proposal should simplify the Exchange's procedures by eliminating the need
for members to determine whether there has been a ``termination for cause'' and requiring, instead, that members
file a Form U-5 notice for all discharges and terminations.






The Commission believes that the proposal is designed to help to ensure prompt compliance with CBOE Rule 9.3 by requiring
members to file a Form U-5 immediately, but no later than 30 days after a termination. Moreover, by requiring
members to file amendments to Form U-5 within 30 days after learning of facts or circumstances giving rise to
the amendment, the proposal advises members of their continuing obligation to amend to Form U-5 to report relevant
changes and should help to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the Exchange's records. Finally, the Commission
believes that allowing members to submit the filings required under CBOE Rule 9.3 through the NASAA/NASD CRD will
facilitate timely compliance with the requirements of CBOE Rule 9.3 and reduce the cost to members of complying with
the rule. As noted above, the CBOE is under a continuing obligation to review the CRD submissions on a daily basis. This
will ensure that the CBOE is aware of the U-5 filings from CBOE members in a timely manner.

It is therefore ordered, pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act,
 that the proposed rule change (SR-CBOE-93-56) is approved.




For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Order Approving a Proposed Rule Change by National Association of Securities Dealers,
Inc. Requiring Participation in the Intermarket Trading System by Third Market Makers </DOCTITLE>


June 29, 1994. 



The National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (``NASD'') submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission
(``Commission'') a proposed rule change (File No. SR-NASD-93-10) on March 1, 1993, pursuant to
Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''),
 and Rule 19b-4 thereunder.
 The purpose of the proposed rule change is to require third market makers registered as Consolidated Quotation System
(``CQS'') market makers to register and participate in the Computer Assisted Execution System (``CAES'') and the
Intermarket Trading System/Computer Assisted Execution System (``ITS/CAES'') interface.
 







Notice of the proposal appeared in the 

Federal Register

 on July 8, 1993.
 The Commission received three comment letters opposing the proposal.
 For the reasons discussed below, the Commission is approving the proposal. 






I. Description 


The third market is where off-exchange, or over-the-counter (``OTC''), transactions in listed securities take
place. Third market makers, registered with the NASD as CQS market makers, disseminate quotations through the CQS
and through NASDAQ pursuant to rules promulgated by the NASD.
 CQS market makers, that are not registered as ITS/CAES market makers, account for approximately 17% of third market
share volume in CQS securities. Currently, 33 registered CQS market makers are not registered as ITS/CAES market
makers or as CAES market makers. Only CQS registered market makers make OTC markets in listed securities by disseminating
quotations through CQS or NASDAQ. Thus, only CQS registered market makers are subject to the requirements of the proposal.






The proposed rule change amends Schedules D and G to the NASD By-Laws and the Rules of Practice and Procedure for the
ITS/CAES Automated Interface (``ITS/CAES Rules''). The proposal requires registered CQS market makers to: (1)
register and participate in ITS/CAES and CAES; (2) quote minimum sizes of 200 or 500 shares (depending on trading characteristics
of the securities);
 and (3) abide by excess spread parameters established for NASDAQ securities.
 The proposal also will enable market makers to execute principal transactions through CAES for those specific securities
in which the market maker is registered. 






The NASD developed CAES to provide a more efficient mechanism for OTC trading in listed securities. The ITS/CAES interface
commenced operation on May 17, 1982.
 ITS is a communications network designed to facilitate intermarket trading in exchange-listed securities by linking
the eight national securities exchanges and the NASDAQ market.
 ITS enables a broker or dealer who is physically present in one market center to execute principal or agency orders
in an ITS security on another market center. 






The ITS/CAES interface permits members of participant markets to execute transactions in Rule 19c-3 securities
between the exchanges and the OTC market.
 The proposal will require registered NASD market makers that trade Rule 19c-3 securities to register and participate
in ITS/CAES. For non-Rule 19c-3 securities, which are not eligible for trading through the ITS/CAES interface,
registered market makers will be required to register and participate in CAES. Currently, participation in ITS/CAES
and CAES by CQS market makers is voluntary.

The proposal will require ITS/CAES and CAES market makers to quote minimum sizes of 200 or 500 shares (depending on
trading characteristics of the securities) and to abide by excess spread parameters established for NASDAQ securities.
ITS/CAES market makers currently are not required to include minimum sizes in their quotations or to comply with the
excess spread parameters established for NASDAQ securities. The excess spread parameters for NASDAQ and CQS securities
limit a dealer's spread in a security to 125% of the average of the narrowest three dealer spreads in that security.





ITS/CAES enables market makers in Rule 19c-3 securities to direct agency and principal orders to, and receive
orders from, the floors of ITS participant exchanges. Currently, transactions in CAES are limited to agency orders.
The proposal will enable market makers to execute principal transactions through CAES for listed securities in which
the market maker is registered.


II. Discussion


The Commission believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act, and in particular,
with Sections 15A(b)(6), 15A(b)(9), 15A(b)(11), 11A(a)(1)(C), and 11A(a)(1)(D) of the Act. Section 15A(b)(6)
of the Act requires that the NASD's rules be designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to
promote just and equitable principles of trade, to foster cooperation and coordination with persons engaged in regulating,
clearing, settling, processing information with respect to an facilitating transactions in securities, to remove
impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and a national market system. Section 15A(b)(9)
requires that the NASD's rules not impose any burden on competition not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of
the Act.
 Section 15A(b)(11) authorizes the NASD to adopt rules concerning the form and content of quotations of securities
sold in the OTC market.
 Section 11A grants the Commission the authority to facilitate the establishment of a National Market System (``NMS'')
for securities to implement certain specified Congressional goals and objectives. Sections 11A(1) (C) and (D) set
forth the Congressional finding that the linking of all markets for qualified securities through communication
and data processing facilities would foster efficiency; enhance competition; increase the information available
to brokers, dealers, and investors; facilitate the offsetting of investors' orders; and contribute to best execution
of such orders.





The Commission believes that the proposal will facilitate the further development of the NMS by integrating all registered
market makers with intermarket trading in listed securities. This will facilitate the ability of third market orders
to interact with orders of other market participants. Other ITS participant markets currently cannot execute, through
ITS, transactions with registered third market makers that are not registered as ITS/CAES market makers, even when
a better published quotation may exist in the third market.
 Thus, despite the ITS/CAES linkage, not all third market orders are exposed to other ITS participants. This inhibits
a broker's ability to ensure best execution of customer orders and impedes fair competition between and among different
types of trading markets and market professionals.




The proposal will facilitate the development of a more efficient market linkage for concurrent exchange and OTC trading
of listed securities. The ITS/CAES interface is designed to permit the execution of orders routed to exchange floors
in the OTC market when more favorable prices are offered by OTC market makers. The ITS/CAES interface likewise provides
OTC market makers access to rapid execution of their orders on exchange floors when exchange markets are quoting better
prices. The proposal will facilitate interaction of orders in Rule 19c-3 securities in all market centers,
and thus, will increase competition between the markets for order flow in Rule 19c-3 securities. For non-Rule
19c-3 securities, CAES provides an efficient mechanism for OTC trading of listed securities.
By extending application of ITS Plan provisions to all registered third market makers, the proposal also will provide
consistent trading rules for multiple trading of listed securities. The ITS Plan provides uniform rules governing:
(1) Trade-throughs, to provide price protection for customer orders;
 (2) block trades, to enable other markets to derive the benefit of a block without breaking it up;
 (3) pre-openings, to enable other markets to participate in the primary market's opening of a security;
 and (4) dispute resolution, to enable efficient resolution of disputes between market centers.

<TEXT>
 

The amendments regarding size of displayed quotations and excess spread parameters will improve the quality of the
third market, and thus, will facilitate efficient OTC trading of listed securities. The proposal will require CQS
market makers to quote a minimum size of 200 or 500 shares, depending on price, volume, and number of market makers in
the security; and will impose excess spread parameters comparable to those in the NASDAQ market.

The proposal also allows principal market maker transactions in listed securities through CAES for securities in
which the market maker is registered and active. The Commission does not perceive any basis for limiting CAES to agency
orders. The proposal will not affect the provisions of the ITS Plan, which apply to both principal and agency transactions.
The proposal will allow market makers to obtain electronic access to the quotations of other market makers through
CAES and thus, will reduce reliance on telephone contact.

The Amex, BSE, and NYSE submitted comment letters on the proposal.
 These exchanges commented that the proposal does not apply to all third market makers, but applies only to third market
makers currently registered as CQS market makers with the NASD.
 The NYSE also commented that third market and exchange transaction reporting in listed securities are not consistent.








The Commission acknowledges that brokerage firms that execute transactions in listed securities in the OTC market
are not required, by Commission or NASD Rules, to register with the NASD as market makers. Brokerage firms not registered
with the NASD as market makers cannot disseminate quotations in CQS or NASDAQ for listed securities.

The commentators' arguments against the current proposal, however, appear to based on the assumption that requiring
all CQS market markets to register and participate in ITS will increase the extent of internalization in Rule 19c-3
securities. In its study of the U.S. equity market, the Division of Market Regulation (``Division'') considered
concerns regarding internalization of transactions in Rule 19c-3 securities.
 After examining data on off-board trading for 100 most active NYSE issues during 1992,
 the division determined that the extent of internalization of transactions in Rule 19c-3 securities was not
significant.
 In addition, in their letters in response to the Division's study,
 the Amex and the regional exchanges urged that all third market makers be required to become part of the ITS/CAES linkage
and subjected to the ITS trade through rules.









The NASD's proposal will increase the interaction and exposure of third market making activity to other markets by
requiring all registered CQS market makers to participate in ITS/CAES. Thus, the proposal will increase the universe
of third market trading subject to the ITS price protection rules. On balance, the proposal will benefit the market,
advance the development of an NMS, and meet statutory goals. Thus, the Commission believes that the NASD's proposal
represents a significant step in the interaction and exposure of securities in the NMS.
The NYSE also commented that transaction reporting by third market makers is not comparable to transaction reporting
by exchanges. Because the NASD's rules require the price reported by third market makers be ``reasonably related
to the prevailing market,'' the NYSE believes that third market makers may report a transaction price different from
the execution price confirmed to customers.
In 1980, the NASD amended its rules to require third market makers to report transactions on a ``gross'' basis, excluding
any mark-up, mark-down, or service charge.
 The NASD's reporting requirements effectively eliminated any disparity in transaction reporting between the exchange
and the third market.
 These rules are still in effect. In addition, Rule 10b-10 under the Act requires broker-dealers to report on
confirmations the trade price and mark-up in principal transactions. Because Rule 10b-10 requires that the
trade price broker-dealers disclose on a customer confirmation be the same as that disseminated for transaction
reporting, the rule prevents broker-dealers from reporting a transaction price different from that confirmed to
customers.
 The Commission continues to believe that transaction reporting by the third market is sufficiently comparable to
transaction reporting by the exchange market.






III. Conclusion


For the foregoing reasons, the Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the Act and the rules
and regulations thereunder applicable to the NASD and, in particular, Sections 15A(b)(6), 15A(b)(9), 15A(b)(11),
11A(a)(1)(C), and 11A(a)(D) of the Act.
It is therefore ordered, pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act, that the proposed rule change described above be,
and hereby is, approved.



By the Commission.

<DOCTITLE>Self Regulatory Organizations; Order Approving Proposed Rule Change by the National Association of Securities
Dealers Relating to Handling of Customer Limit Orders</DOCTITLE>



June 29, 1994.



On October 13, 1993, the National Association of Securities Dealers (``NASD'' or ``Association'') filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'' or ``SEC'') pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''),
 a proposed rule change consisting of an Interpretation to the NASD's Rules of Fair Practice relating to the handling
of customer limit orders. The proposed rule change was published for comment in the 

Federal Register

.
 Two comment letters were received. For the reasons discussed below, the Commission is approving the proposed rule
change.






I. Background



Over the past several years, limit order practices involving NASDAQ stocks have become the subject of investor complaints
and Commission scrutiny. Current NASDAQ limit order handling practice often results in a market maker's delaying
execution of the customer's sell (or buy) order until the highest bid (offer) from among competing market makers equals
the customer's limit price. Moreover, firms that accept limit orders often trade for their own accounts at prices
better than the customer's limit order price without executing the customer's order.

The priority accorded a customer limit order today is different depending on the structure of the marketplace of execution,
a distinction customers do not always understand. The rules of national securities exchanges require specialists
to yield to a customer's limit order; the specialist cannot trade for its own account at prices better than the limit
order until the limit order is executed.

In 1988, the Commission expressed its views on the issue of limit order protection in the NASDAQ market when it ruled
that broker-dealers owe a fiduciary duty to their limit order customers not to trade ahead of these orders unless the
customer is first informed of the firm's limit order policy.
 As a result of the Manning decision, the NASD filed a proposed rule change with the Commission that states that a member
firm will be deemed not to have violated NASD Rules of Fair Practice if it provides to customers a statement setting
forth the circumstances in which the firm accepts limit orders and the policies and procedures that the firm follows
in handling these orders.







In July of 1993, the NASD Board of Governors reviewed the handling of limit orders in NASDAQ securities and concluded
that ``the continuation of the disclosure exception appeared inappropriate.''
 The NASD solicited member comment on eliminating the disclosure safe harbor for members trading ahead of customer
limit orders and the effect a rule prohibiting trading ahead might have on integrated broker-dealers, on limit orders
received from other firms (``member-to-member'' trades) and on market liquidity.







After full consideration of the concerns articulated in the comment process, the NASD withdrew the rule filing containing
the disclosure approach,
 and submitted this proposed Interpretation to its Rules of Fair Practice, prohibiting member firms from trading
ahead of their customers' limit orders in their market making capacity.

II. Description



The NASD is proposing to adopt an Interpretation to its Rules of Fair Practice that would prohibit member firms that
hold their own customer limit orders from trading ahead of those orders, regardless of whether the practice has been
disclosed, and would make trading in disregard of the prohibition a violation of just and equitable principles of
trade. The Interpretation establishes that a member holding its customers' limit order may not continue to trade
for its own position without executing that limit order under the specific terms and conditions that the customer
understands and accepts. If the member does trade ahead of its customer, it will be deemed a violation of Article III,
Section 1 of the Rules of Fair Practice regarding just and equitable principles of trade.






The Interpretation also states that a member that ``controls or is controlled by''
 another member will be considered affiliated in a single entity for purposes of determining the application of the
rule. Thus, if a member firm accepts a customer's limit order and forwards that limit order for execution to a market
making unit that it controls, the firms will be considered affiliated and the prohibition against trading ahead of
the customer's limit order will apply to the firm as a whole.





The Interpretation will not apply to limit orders accepted by market makers from unaffiliated members. For example,
a firm's customer limit orders that are sent to an unrelated market making firm for execution would not be covered by
the Interpretation. The NASD has decided to defer temporarily application of the Interpretation to these trades
so that a task force may complete its examination of the potential consequences of a broader application of the rule.
The Interpretation emphasizes that all members accepting customer limit orders owe those customers duties of ``best
execution'' regardless of whether the orders are executed through the member's market making capacity or sent to
another member for execution.






III. Summary of Comments



As noted above, the Commission received two comment letters on the proposal.
 Merrill Lynch, a registered broker dealer, supports the proposal, noting that it will increase investor confidence
in the NASDAQ market by improving the quality of executions they receive. The other commenter, STANY, supports the
principle that the limit order of a commission-paying customer is entitled to priority over the order of the customer's
broker-dealer. Both Merrill Lynch and STANY believe that the proposed interpretation should not apply to member-to-member
transactions. Merrill Lynch believes that requiring leaders to provide limit order protection to other broker-dealers
might have a serious deleterious effect on dealers' willingness and ability to make markets in these stocks. STANY
offers three reasons why dealers that receive the limit orders of other firms' customers should not be subject to the
restriction: (1) Agency dealers could be acting for their own customers, for themselves or for other dealers, thereby
creating the possibility that some dealers could make markets within the spread without a capital commitment; (2)
it would force a dealer to assume a fiduciary responsibility to customers of another firm with whom the dealer has no
preexisting relationship; and (3) it may require dealers to execute certain limit orders at prices which do not provide
an opportunity for any profit.





IV. Discussion



The Commission believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder
applicable to the NASD and, in particular, Sections 15A(b)(6), 15A(b)(9) and 11A(a)(1)(C) of the Act. Section 15A(b)(6)
requires that the rules of a national securities association be designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative
acts and practices, to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to foster cooperation and coordination with
persons engaged in regulating, clearing, settling and processing information with respect to, and facilitating
transactions in securities, to remove impediments to and perfect he mechanism of a free and open market and a national
market systems and in general to protect investors and the public interest. Section 15A(b)(9) requires that the rules
of the association not impose any burden on competition not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes
of the Act. Section 11A(a)(1)(C) (i) and (iv) set forth the objectives of assuring economically efficient execution
of securities transactions and the practicability of brokers executing investors' orders in the best market.






The NASD's proposal seeks to address the practice of NASDAQ market makers trading ahead of their customers' limit
orders. That practice, its origins and implications for investors was recently discussed in the Division of Market
Regulation's Market 2000 Report.
 That study concluded that the adverse effects of trading ahead exist whether the customer's limit order is handled
by the customer's firm or by another market maker. The study recommended that the NASD revise its proposal to prohibit
broker-dealers from trading ahead of all customer limit orders for NASDAQ National Market securities.

<TEXT>
 

The Commission believes that the rule change will enhance investor confidence by improving the quality of executions
for customers. By giving a customer's limit order priority over the market maker's proprietary trading, more trade
volume will be available to be matched with the customer's order, resulting in quicker and more frequent executions
for customers.
The NASD's proposal will also improve the price discovery process in NASDAQ securities. Limit orders aid price discovery
by adding liquidity to the market and by tightening the spread between the bid and ask price of a security. In the past,
customers may have refrained from placing limit orders because of the uncertainty of and difficulty in obtaining
an execution at a price between the spread. The new rule will encourage dealers to execute customer limit orders in
a timely fashion so that they may resume their proprietary trading activities. The practice of delaying executions
until the inside price reaches the customer's limit order also impedes price discovery by shielding those orders
from the rest of the investing public. More expeditious handling of customer limit orders under the proposed Interpretation
will provide investors with a more accurate indication of the buy and sell interest at a given moment.
The NASD proposal seeks to prevent a market maker from trading ahead of its own customer's limit order, but will not
prevent the same market maker from trading ahead of the limit orders of other firms' customers that are sent to the market
maker for handling.
 The NASD has determined to defer temporarily application of the Interpretation to member-to-member orders in order
to avoid any unintended consequences from a broader application of the rule and to permit a special NASD task force
to complete its examination of the ramifications of extending limit order protection to these limit orders. The Market
2000 study concluded that the adverse effects of trading ahead of a customer exist whether the customer's limit order
is handled by a customer's firm or by another market maker. The Commission, at this time, strongly believes that the
ban on trading ahead should be applied to these member-to-member trades. The NASD has requested the opportunity to
examine and report the potential impact of the ban on market liquidity and market maker capital commitment. While
such a report could be helpful to a future determination of the issue if it offers specific data regarding the potential
consequences for market liquidity and market maker capital commitment rather than the anecdotal observations of
NASD members, the Commission continues to believe that member-to-member trades raise significant concerns that
should be addressed, and if necessary, the Commission would consider instituting its own rulemaking proceeding
for that purpose. The Commission has expressed to the NASD its view that expanded limit order protection is desirable
and will be expecting their response soon after the approval of this rule filing.




As reflected in the Market 2000 study, the Commission agrees that institutional orders may qualify for special treatment.
Because most market makers cannot typically fill institution-size orders out of inventory, institutions generally
only hold market makers to a ``best efforts'' standard in return for the willingness of the market maker to put up substantial
capital to provide liquidity for large orders. In order to permit a member firm to employ the necessary trading strategy
without being subjected to the requirements of the proposed ban, the Interpretation allows the parties to set the
specific ``terms and conditions'' for acceptance of institutional orders.
Finally, the Commission believes that the proposal does not impose any burden on competition that is not necessary
or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. Because the rule will apply to all NASD members, individual
brokers and dealers will not be disparately affected by the rule change.


V. Conclusion


For the foregoing reasons, the Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the Act and the rules
and regulations thereunder applicable to the NASD and, in particular, Sections 15A(b)(6), 15A(b)(9) and 11A(a)(1)(C)
of the Act.
It is therefore ordered, pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act, that the proposed rule change (SR-NASD-93-58)
be and hereby is approved, effective July 7, 1994.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.; Order Granting Temporary Approval
and Notice of Filing and Order Granting Accelerated Approval of Amendment No. 8 of Proposed Rule Change Creating a
Short Sale Bid-Test for Nasdaq National Market Securities</DOCTITLE>


June 29, 1994.


I. Introduction


On July 22, 1992, the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (``NASD'' or ``Association'') filed with
the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission'') a proposed rule change pursuant to Section 19(b)(1)
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'')
 and Rule 19b-4 thereunder.
 The rule change creates, on a temporary basis for eighteen months, a short sale rule or ``bid-test'' for Nasdaq Stock
Market (``Nasdaq'') National Market Securities
 that will prohibit short sales at or below the current inside bid as shown on the Nasdaq screen when that bid is lower
than the previous inside bid. The rule provides certain exemptions, including an exemption for qualified Nasdaq
market makers, options market makers, and warrant market makers. The rule also provides exemptions similar to those
provided under the Commission's short sale rule, Rule 10a-1.
 Further, the NASD has submitted three interpretations regarding ``bona fide'' market making activity, the prices
at which ``legal'' short sales may be effected, and examples of conduct that will be deemed to be in violation of the
rule; these interpretations are part of the proposed rule change.







Notice of the proposed rule change and subsequent amendments appeared in the 

Federal Register

.
 The Commission received 397 comments in response to the release, 122 in support and 275 in opposition.
 In addition to amending the proposal several times, the NASD responded to issues raised by the commenters in a letter
dated June 24, 1993.
 For the reasons discussed below, the Commission is approving the proposal, effective September 6, 1994, on a temporary
basis through March 5, 1996.






II. Description of the Rule


A. Background


The opportunity for short selling can add to market liquidity and pricing efficiency, while at the same time can raise
general anti-manipulation concerns. Currently, neither the Commission nor the NASD imposes any general restriction
on short selling of OTC securities. This contrasts with short sale restrictions on exchange-listed securities that
have been in place since 1938. In general, the Commission's short sale rule, Rule 10a-1, provides that short
sales of securities may be effected only at a price above the price at which the immediately preceding sale was effected
(``plus-tick'') or at a price equal to the last sale if the last preceding transaction at a different price was at a lower
price (``zero-plus-tick'').
The NASD proposes to add two sections to Article III of the Rules of Fair Practice establishing a short sale rule based
on a ``bid-test'' for Nasdaq National Market securities.
 The first section will prohibit members from effecting short sales at or below the bid for themselves or their customers
when the current inside or best bid is below the previous bid, unless one of the exemptions applies. The second section
provides a definition of ``primary Nasdaq market maker'' which, beginning one year after the effective date of the
rule, sets forth the criteria a market maker must satisfy to be exempt from the rule. In addition, the NASD submitted
three interpretations setting forth: (a) what will constitute ``bona fide market making activity;'' (b) the prices
at which ``legal'' short sales may be effected; and (c) situations that will be deemed to be indirect violations of
the rule.

<TEXT>
 

The proposed rule also contains a limited exemption from the short sale prohibition for market makers. In addition,
in response to concerns raised by commenters, the NASD submitted a number of amendments providing limited exemptions
for options market makers and warrant market makers satisfying certain requirements, and clarifying that bona fide
market making includes, under certain conditions, risk arbitrage activity. The exemptions are designed to allow
short selling where necessary to conduct efficient and effective market making activities without allowing unrestricted
short selling. During the eighteen-month period of effectiveness of the rule, the NASD will study the impact of the
rule and its exemptions and, prior to the rule's expiration, the NASD will evaluate whether the rule and its exemptions
should be extended, modified, approved on a permanent basis, or terminated. If the NASD decides to extend, modify
or approve on a permanent basis any part or all of the rule, it must obtain Commission approval pursuant to Section 19(b)
of the Act.






B. The General Rule and Exemptions




The NASD's bid-test rule will prohibit NASD members from effecting a short sale in a security at or below the current
inside bid when this bid is below the preceding best bid.
 This prohibition applies equally to trades for customers and to trades for the member's own account.
 The rule, however, sets forth ten exemptions. Seven of these exemption mirror the exceptions provided under the Commission's
short sale rule.
 The three additional exemptions provide an exemption for bona fide market making activity by qualified market makers,
hedge transactions by options market makers registered as qualified options market makers, and hedge transactions
resulting in fully hedged positions by warrant market makers registered as market makers for the warrant.







1. The Qualified Market Maker Exemption



The NASD received substantial comment from its members that application of a short sale rule to market makers would
dramatically reduce their ability to adjust inventory positions quickly, thereby lessening liquidity throughout
the marketplace. Thus, the NASD provided an exemption for qualified market makers satisfying certain criteria.
To be exempt from the provisions of the rule, a market maker must be conducting bona fide market making activity
 and satisfy the criteria for a qualified market maker. The rule sets forth certain criteria for becoming a qualified
market maker, which criteria change after the first year of the effectiveness of the rule. Under both the criteria
applicable to the first year and those applicable to the last six months of the rule, general qualifications standards
apply. The rule then sets forth separate criteria for becoming a qualified market maker for securities subject to
a secondary offering,
 an initial public offering, or a merger or acquisition.

During the first year of the eighteen-month pilot period, a qualified market maker is defined as a market maker that
has maintained quotations in the subject security continuously for the preceding 20 business days.
 During the last six months of the eighteen-month pilot period, a qualified market maker is defined as a market maker
satisfying the criteria for a primary Nasdaq market maker. To qualify as a primary Nasdaq market maker, market makers
must satisfy at least two of the following three standards: (1) The market maker must be at the best bid or best offer
as shown in the Nasdaq system no less than 35 percent of the time; (2) the market maker must maintain a spread no greater
than 102 percent of the average dealer spread; or (3) no more than 50 percent of the market maker's quotation updates
may occur without being accompanied by a trade execution of at least one unit of trading.
 Alternatively, recognizing that overall volume is also indicative of quality market making, the NASD has proposed
a supplemental criterion for becoming a primary market maker. Under the supplemental criterion, a market maker must
satisfy one of the three criteria set forth above and account for 11/2 times its proportionate share
 of volume in the stock.

<TEXT>
 


Compliance with the criteria will be tracked through the Nasdaq system, which will enable market makers to review
their status in each criterion in each stock, and will also provide members with notice of their compliance with the
standards at set intervals.
 The NASD will monitor market makers for compliance with the primary market maker standards on a monthly review period.
A market maker failing to satisfy the qualification criteria remains a market maker in the security,
 but is subject to the short sale limitations. The NASD will establish review procedures for market makers seeking
reconsideration of their failure to satisfy the primary market maker standards. Because the primary market maker
standards are objective, however, the NASD will limit requests for reconsideration to consideration of system failures,
excused withdrawals, or related activity in derivative or convertible securities or derivative pricing mechanisms,
as seen with foreign securities or ADRs, that may affect a market maker's compliance with the criteria. 






2. The Options Market Maker Exemption 



The rule also provides an exemption for certain transactions by options market makers registered as qualified options
market makers in stock options or qualified stock index options. With certain restrictions, the exemption permits
members to execute short sales for the account of qualified options market makers that would otherwise be prohibited
by the rule. To be eligible for the exemptions, the short sale must satisfy the criteria for an ``exempt hedge transaction''
and the market maker must be designated a qualified options market maker. 

The rule provides separate definitions of ``exempt hedge transaction'' for market making in stock options and stock
index options. For stock options, the term means a short sale of an underlying security to hedge an existing offsetting
options position or an offsetting options position that was created ``contemporaneous with the short sale.''
 For stock index options, an exempt hedge transaction means a short sale to hedge an existing offsetting stock index
options position or an offsetting stock index options position that was created contemporaneously with the short
sale, provided that: (a) The security sold short must be a component security of the index underlying such index option;
(b) the index underlying such offsetting index options position must be a ``qualified stock index'';
 and (c) the dollar value of all exempt short sales effected to hedge the offsetting stock index options position does
not exceed the aggregate current index value of the offsetting options position. 






To be designated a qualified options market maker, the market maker must have received an appointment as such pursuant
to the rules of a ``qualified options exchange.'' 
 In addition, when establishing the short position, the options market maker must receive, or be eligible to receive,
good-faith margin pursuant to Section 220.12 of Regulation T under the Act.

<TEXT>
 

As discussed more fully below, options market maker short sale transactions unrelated to normal options market making
activity (

e.g

., index arbitrage and risk arbitrage) are not exempt. Nonetheless, the rule provides that a member would not violate
the short sale rule if it executed an order for the account of an options market maker with the good-faith belief that
the order was in full compliance with the rule, even though a subsequent determination was made that the order was either
not entitled to the exemption or was incorrectly marked ``long.''



3. The Warrant Market Maker Exemption


The rule also extends an exemption to registered warrant market makers, with restrictions similar to those imposed
on qualified options market makers. To be eligible for this exemption, the warrant market maker must be registered
as a market maker in the warrant and the short sale must be an ``exempt hedge transaction'' that results in a fully hedged
position. The rule defines the term ``exempt hedge transaction'' as a short sale to hedge an existing offsetting warrant
position or an offsetting warrant position that was created contemporaneous with the short sale.





Short sales unrelated to normal warrant market making activity (

e.g.

, index arbitrage and risk arbitrage) would not be exempt. As with short sales executed on behalf of options market
makers, a member who executes a short sale on behalf of a warrant market maker will not be deemed to violate the short
sale rule if it executed the order with the good-faith belief that the order was in full compliance with the rule, even
though a subsequent determination was made that the order was either not entitled to the exemption or was incorrectly
marked ``long.''



4. The Exemptions Mirroring Rule


    10a-1


The rule also incorporates the exemptions in the Commission's short sale rule that are relevant to trading in Nasdaq.
 In addition, the Commission recently proposed an amendment to Rule 10a-1 to codify an interpretation with respect
to liquidating index arbitrage positions.
 The NASD has requested that if approved by the Commission, it intends to conform its rule to the Commission's rule and
will file the proposed rule change with the Commission.








III. Comments



As indicated above, the Commission received a total of 397 comment letters on the NASD's proposed short sale bid-test,
with 275 opposing approval of the rule change and 122 supporting approval.
 In addition to amending the proposal several times, the NASD responded to issues raised by the commenters in a letter
dated June 24, 1993.







Commenters in support of the proposed short sale bid-test are mostly issuers whose securities trade on Nasdaq.
 Many of these issuers report that they have experienced short selling ``abuse'' and several commenters provide what
they believe are specific examples of ``piling-on'' and manipulation. These commenters make four principal arguments
in favor of the proposal: (1) The short sale rule is necessary to reduce intra-day volatility on Nasdaq; (2) the proposal
will reduce market manipulation that threatens the integrity of the Nasdaq market; (3) short selling abuse undervalues
stock prices; and (4) the proposed rule will provide more equal regulation of short selling between the exchange and
Nasdaq markets.






Commenters opposing the rule change make three principal arguments that remain relevant after consideration of
the NASD's amendments: (1) The NASD has failed to provide sufficient evidence of the need for a short sale rule or demonstrate
the appropriateness of a bid-test; (2) the ``primary'' market maker qualification standards will have negative
effects on both market makers and the Nasdaq market; and (3) the proposed rule is inconsistent with the requirements
of the Act.

A. The Need for a Short Sale Bid-Test 
 


Commenters argue that the NASD has failed to provide sufficient evidence demonstrating the need for short sale regulation
in the form of a bid-test. Indeed, many argue that there is no need for additional short sale restrictions. They argue
that instead of adding another layer of regulation to the OTC market, the NASD should enforce existing anti-fraud
rules more stringently and increase surveillance over market participants. Commenters further believe that the
NASD proposed the rule with the primary purpose of eliminating a competitive disadvantage vi&sacute;-&agrave;-vi&sacute;
the exchanges. They argue that the NASD is simply responding to issuer misconception of the effect of the Commission's
short sale rule, which applies only to exchange-listed securities. They believe that issuers incorrectly conclude
that manipulative short selling is substantially diminished because of the restrictions on short selling on exchanges.
Finally, these commenters believe the NASD has not adequately balanced the benefits of short selling, such as increased
liquidity and more accurate pricing of securities, against the costs that its rule will impose. 
 
Commenters also argued against the NASD's proposal on the basis that there are less restrictive alternatives. For
example, the NASD could limit short selling in a given security only when the security has experienced a certain percentage
decrease during the trading day. Many of these commenters further argued that the NASD's proposal would create long
periods of short sale prohibition in some of the less liquid Nasdaq National Market securities. Commenters also opposed
the rule due to concerns that it could encourage Market makers to manipulate bids to guard against short selling. Finally,
several commenters cited economic studies such as that of Irving M. Pollack to support their arguments that short
selling restrictions in the form of a bid-test are unnecessary.
 
 




In response to the commenters' belief that a short sale rule for the Nasdaq market is unnecessary, the NASD stated that
notwithstanding the implementation of the Pollack Report recommendations, it remains concerned about short-term
volatility and inaccurate pricing of Nasdaq securities often associated with short selling. In addition, the NASD
cited to over one hundred comment letters submitted by issuers claiming that they have experienced short selling
problems, some recounting specific instances alleging that participants sold short on the basis of rumors or inaccurate
reports. The NASD, therefore, indicated its belief that its proposal is a reasonable approach to solving these problems
and is consistent with the Act. 
 


B. Effect of Primary Market Maker Qualification Standards on Nasdaq Market Makers and the Market 
 


Many commenters indicated their believe that most short selling is done by market makers and, therefore, if the NASD
does impose a bid-test restriction on short selling, there should be no exemptions. Many market making firms and others
criticized the NASD's primary market maker qualification standards, which goes into effect one year after the effective
date of the rule. They argued that the criteria will unfairly discriminate among market makers and create two tiers
of market makes and, thus, will fragment the market making community and restrict the ability of non-primary market
makers to use short sales as a risk management technique. 
 
Some commenters also believe that requiring market makers to maintain the inside bid or offer will result in dealers
following the lead of other dealers in the issue, thus creating additional volatility. Additionally, commenters
stated that the requirements that no more than 50% of a market maker's quotation updates occur without being accompanied
by an execution appears to be in direct conflict with a market maker reflecting a customer's order in its quote. In addition,
some commenters believed that this requirement would prevent market makers from updating quotes in response to significant
external events and amounts to a penalty on efficient pricing policies.
Some commenters also strongly opposed the interim, first year 20-day qualification criteria, stating that it is
overly restrictive and disadvantageous to market makers that want to add new stocks. They believed that the inability
to short a stock at the bid price will seriously impede market makers' capital commitment to these issues and recommended
that the 20-day test be a stand-by provision, to be implemented only when abuses of the market maker exemption have
been uncovered. On the other hand, at least one commenter believed that immediate implementation of the permanent
qualification standards may have the effect of improving the quality of the market and, thus, is preferable to the
20-day registration standard.

<TEXT>
 

In response to these comments, the NASD stated that the qualification standards are designed to limit the exemption
to those market participants that add depth and liquidity to the market. This approach, according to the NASD, will
ensure that the exemption is available only to those market makers that consistently add value to the market.

Responding to the concern that the primary market maker criteria may have negative effects on market makers and the
Nasdaq market, the NASD indicated that it believes that the specific qualification criteria can be met successfully
by both small and large market makers. The NASD further noted that market making firms have direct control over whether
they meet the primary market maker qualification standards. In particular, they have control over the amount of time
at which they are at the inside bid or offer, their spread in comparison to the average spread, quotation updates accompanied
by reported transactions and accounting for 11/2 times of proportionate share of overall volume.



C. Consistency With the Requirements of the Act



Many commenters on the proposed rule change believed that it is inconsistent with the requirements of the Act. In particular,
commenters believed that the rule proposal is at odds with the Act's requirements that the NASD's rules: (a) Promote
just and equitable principles of trade, remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market,
and protect investors and the public interest;
 and (b) not impose a burden on competition not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act.







Beyond the commenters' concern that the rule will unfairly discriminate among market makers (discussed in the previous
section), commenters argued that the bid-test will create inequitable principles of trade by disadvantaging non-exempt
market participants. Further, they believed that the bid-test adds an unnecessary and poorly designed impediment
to an otherwise free and open market by restricting the ability of participants to determine the natural market price
of securities. Finally, commenters asserted that the proposal will not protect investors or the public interest
because, as drafted, the rule fails to restrict manipulative short selling, while at the same time it exempts market
makers which are the most active class of short sellers.

Notwithstanding the NASD's assertion that the proposal furthers Congress' goal of fair competition among brokers
and dealers and among markets, commenters argued that the proposal is inconsistent with Section 11A(a)(1)(C).
 These commenters asserted that the bid-test is anti-competitive in that it creates unfair advantages for certain
market participants at the expense of other market participants. Specifically, they argued that the rule provides
unfair advantages to qualified market makers at the expense of non-exempt market participants. Further, commenters
stated that the purpose of the rule is to enhance the NASD's competitive status at the expense of other markets and that
this goal is directly at odds with the requirements of the Act.




The NASD argued that its proposal complies with Section 15A(b)(6) because, similar to Rule 10a-1, it is designed
to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts. In addition, the NASD argued, because the immediate beneficiaries
of short sale regulation are the shareholders who own stock, the NASD believes the proposal ensures an environment
designed to protect investors and the public interest. The NASD also asserted that the rule is consistent with Section
15A(b)(9) because, although the proposal does impose burdens on members and their customers, these burdens are appropriate
for maintaining the integrity of the market for shareholders.

The NASD responded to the commenters' unequal regulation argument by asserting that, for the purposes of Section
3(a)(36) of the Act, NASD members and non-members are not within the same ``class.'' Thus, granting members of the
NASD an exemption to the rule while not granting investors or non-members an equivalent exemption cannot be deemed
unequal regulation. The NASD further pointed out that Congress did not ban all forms of discrimination between members
of the same class. The Act only bans 

unfair 

discrimination and the NASD asserts that to grant an exemption to those member firms that add liquidity and otherwise
improve the market is not unfair.

The NASD also addressed the unequal regulation argument by asserting that the exemption for certain Nasdaq market
makers is appropriate even though exchange specialists do not have a similar exemption under Rule 10a-1 because
of the inherent differences between the competitive dealer market and the auction markets. In particular, the NASD
pointed out that: (a) Exchange specialists have a monopoly over the securities in which they trade; (b) dealers generally
do not have an informational advantage over other dealers; and (c) dealers do not have the ability to close their markets
because of sudden volatility or an order imbalance.

IV. Discussion


Under Section 19(b) of the Act, the Commission must approve a proposed NASD rule change if it finds that the proposal
is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder that govern the NASD.
 In evaluating a given proposal, the Commission must examine the record before it and all relevant factors and necessary
information.
 Section 15A of the Act addresses with some specificity requirements applicable to NASD rules, and those standards
are particularly significant in the Commission's determination of whether the NASD's proposal is consistent with
the Act.







The Commission has determined to approve the NASD's proposal. The Commission believes that the rule change is consistent
with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to the NASD, including the requirements
of Sections 15A(b)(6), 15A(b)(9) and 15A(b)(11) of the Act.
 Section 15A(b)(6) requires, among other things, that the NASD's rules be designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative
acts and practices, to promote just and equitable principles of trade, and to protect investors and the public interest.
 Sections 15A(b)(9) and (11) require that the NASD's rule be designed not to impose any burden on competition not necessary
or appropriate in furtherance of the Act
 and to produce fair and informative quotations, to prevent fictitious or misleading quotations, and to promote orderly
procedures for collecting, distributing and publishing quotations.
 In addition, the Commission believes that the rule change will further the goals of Section 11A in that it will promote
efficient and effective market operations and economically efficient execution of investor orders in the best market
and assure fair competition between the exchange markets and the OTC market and among brokers and dealers.









A. Background of Short Sale Regulation


The Commission believes that the disparate regulation of short selling in Nasdaq and exchange markets may no longer
be warranted or justified by valid regulatory purposes. Short selling of exchange-listed securities has been the
subject of Commission regulation since 1938.
 On a number of occasions, the Commission has sought comment on and considered whether to extend short sale regulation
similar to Rule 10a-1 to securities traded solely in the OTC market. In the process of designating certain OTC
securities as National Market securities, the Commission discussed issues related to the eventual inclusion of
qualified OTC securities in additional national market system facilities.
 In response, the NASD stated that ``short selling regulations prior to and during a distribution of [National Market]
Securities would be appropriate but that it is not necessary, at this time, to impose across-the-board short sales
regulations on transactions in [National Market] Securities.''
 In 1985, the Commission again sought comment on whether short sales in Nasdaq National Market securities should be
regulated, and if so, how such regulation should occur.
 Commenters generally opposed the adoption of a tick-test for Nasdaq National Market securities. The Commission
did not act on these requests for comments.

<TEXT>
 

In 1986, the Pollack Report made a number of recommendations regarding short selling in Nasdaq stocks, but recommended
against a formal short selling rule for Nasdaq.
 Since 1986 the NASD has adopted a number of the recommendations for short sale regulation contained in the Pollack
Report. The NASD now requires each member to mark all sale transactions either ``long'' or ``short;''
 requires each member, prior to accepting a short sale from a customer, to make an affirmative determination that it
will receive delivery of the security from the customer or that it can borrow the security on the customer's behalf;
 requires each member, with certain exceptions, to make an affirmative determination that it can borrow the security
before effecting a short sale for its own account;
 imposes mandatory buy-in requirements for cash or guaranteed delivery for Nasdaq securities where the buyer is a
customer other than another NASD member, upon failure of a clearing corporation to effect delivery pursuant to a buy-in
notice;
 requires each member to report to the NASD, as of the 15th of each month, aggregate short positions in all customer and
proprietary accounts in Nasdaq securities;
 and requires a short seller's broker to close-out securities for cash or guaranteed delivery when delivery has not
occurred within 10 business days after normal settlement date.












The NASD also encouraged adoption of Rule 10b-21,
 which prohibits a person who effects a short sale of an equity security between the filing of a registration statement
and the time at which sales of such equity security may be commenced from covering the short sale with offered securities
purchased from an underwriter or other broker or dealer participating in the offering.







B. The NASD's Initiative



1. The Need for a Short Sale Rule for the OTC Market





The Commission is reluctant to approve regulations that are likely to hinder efficient price discovery. The Commission's
experience with Rule 10a-1 demonstrates that limited short sale rule restrictions have not interfered with
the efficient operation of the exchange markets, while reducing the potential for abusive short selling practices.
In addition, investors derive a certain measure of confidence from short selling limitations.

Over the past twenty years, the enhancements to, and growth of, the OTC market have led to increased expectations by
investors, issuers and broker-dealers of Nasdaq securities generally, and Nasdaq National Market securities,
in particular. Today, these participants expect safeguards in Nasdaq comparable to the exchange markets. The NASD
believes that implementation of the principal Pollack Report recommendations have not adequately provided these
safeguards.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940707-2-00193 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940707-2-00099 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The NASD and commenters have presented evidence, albeit anecdotal, of continuing problems of short selling in the
OTC market. In addition, the Commission recognizes that without a short sale rule for Nasdaq, the NASD is competitively
disadvantaged. The exchange markets can and do attract issuers and investors with claims that their markets protect
against potential short selling abuse. In 1975, Congress specifically found that the interests of the public, the
protection of investors and the maintenance of fair and orderly markets are furthered by fair competition between
the exchange markets and the OTC market.
 Thus, recognizing the potential for problems associated with short selling, the changing expectations of Nasdaq
market participants and the competitive disparity between the exchange markets and the OTC market, the Commission
believes that regulation of short selling of Nasdaq National Market securities is consistent with the Act.





2. The Design of the Proposed Restrictions



Having determined that some regulation of short selling of Nasdaq National Market securities is consistent with
the Act, the Commission must determine whether the proposed design of that regulation is consistent with the Act.
The Commission's tick-test restricts short selling based on the most recent sale price in the particular security.
This is a logical approach in the auction market environment where, generally, transactions in a given security are
executed at one location and, consequently, are typically reported sequentially.

Notwithstanding the advances over the past fifteen years in trade reporting of Nasdaq securities, the NASD is not
convinced that a tick-test would be appropriate for Nasdaq short sale regulation. In Nasdaq, the average security
has more than ten market makers. With many trades occurring over the telephone and transaction reporting occurring
up to ninety seconds after execution, the sequence in which trades are reported may not always reflect the sequence
in which the trades occurred. Thus, the NASD believes that differences between trade reporting in the auction markets
and the competing dealer market warrant consideration of a different, although analogous, approach to short sale
regulation.

The NASD's rule also differs from the Commission's short sale rule by providing, under certain circumstances, a market
maker exemption; under the Commission's rule, which generally applies only to the auction markets, specialists
do not enjoy an exemption. The NASD believes that a market maker exemption is justified, considering the inherent
differences between its competing dealer market and the auction markets. In particular, unlike competing market
makers, specialists have a monopoly over the securities in which they trade and are able to call trading halts in response
to excessive volatility or order imbalances.

The Commission believes that the NASD's short sale bid-test, including the market maker exemptions, is a reasonable
approach to short sale regulation of Nasdaq National Market securities and reflects the realities of its market structure.
The Commission believes, however, that experience with the NASD's bid-test may raise issues that require reconsideration
of some or all elements of the proposal. The Commission is sensitive to commenters' concerns about efficiency and
liquidity in the market. The Commission acknowledges, based in large part on the arguments raised by commenters,
that there will be opportunities for market makers to control short selling by moving their bids.
 The Commission is also concerned that the bid-test may restrict non-abusive short-selling for lengthy periods of
time when the bid is stable after a down-bid.







In addition, questions remain about whether market maker exemptions from these restrictions are necessary on an
ongoing basis. It is worth noting that specialists and other market makers do not enjoy similar exemptions from the
Commission's short sale rule for listed securities under Rule 10a-1. With respect to the market maker exemption,
commenters have raised concerns about one of the conditions of the proposed exemption, which requires that at least
50% of a market maker's quote updates be accompanied by an execution. The Commission acknowledges that this requirement
may decrease pricing efficiency by discouraging market makers from updating their quotes in response to external
events. Moreover, the Commission is concerned that this requirement could discourage market makers from exposing
customer orders in their quotes. The Commission has long encouraged the display of customer orders with prices better
than the interdealer quotes,
 and will scrutinize the effects of this requirement on transparency for customer orders.

<TEXT>
 

During the eighteen-month temporary approval period for the proposal, the Commission and the NASD will have an opportunity
to study the effects of the bid-test and market marker exemptions, and to determine whether the bid-test and exemptions
are practicable and necessary on an ongoing basis.
 The Commission expects the NASD to monitor the effects of its short sale rule on a continuing basis during the first
12 months of effectiveness, and expects a full report as soon as practicable thereafter. In particular, the NASD's
study should address the following issues: 





 

Effectis on Amount of Short-Selling:

 As noted, the bid-test will lead to prohibitions of short selling for longer time intervals than would a transaction
price tick-test. The study should provide data on the length of these intervals. In addition, the study should evaluate
the amount of non-market maker short selling permitted under the rule, the extent of short selling by market makers
exempt from the rule, and any incidents of perceived ``abusive short selling.'' 

 

Spreads and Volatility:

 The NASD has asserted that ``abusive short selling'' has increased volatility and spreads in Nasdaq stocks. The study
should evaluate the effects of the rule on spreads and volatility. 

 

Potential Bid Manipulation:

 As noted, the rule provides market makers with the opportunity to control short selling by moving their bids. The study
should evaluate whether the behavior of bid prices has been significantly altered by the rule. Specifically, the
study should compare the average time that short sales are prohibited after the rule is in place relative to the average
time short sales would have been prohibited in the period prior to effectiveness, had the rule been in place. 

 

Minimum Increment for Allowable Sales Above the Bid:

 The study should review the effects of permitting short selling based on a minimum bid increment of 1/16.
 





V. Conclusion 



For the reasons discussed above, the Commission has determined that the NASD's proposed short sale rule is designed
to prevent manipulative acts and practices and protect investors and the public interest, and that these goals, on
balance, outweigh any negative effects the rule may have on the market for Nasdaq National Market securities. 

Accordingly, the Commission finds that the rule change is consistent with the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder
applicable to the NASD and, in particular, Sections 15A(b)(6), 15A(b)(9), and 15A(b)(11). In addition, the Commission
finds that the rule change is consistent with the Congressional objectives for the equity markets, set out in Section
11A, of achieving more efficient and effective market operations, fair competition among brokers and dealers, and
the economically efficient execution of investor orders in the best market. 



It Is Therefore Ordered, 

pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act, that the instant rule change SR-NASD-92-12 be, and hereby
is, approved, effective September 6, 1994, on a temporary eighteen-month basis through March 5, 1996.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Pacific Stock Exchange, Inc.; Order Approving Proposed Rule Change Relating to
Amendments to Its Listing Fee Schedule for Listed Companies</DOCTITLE>



June 29, 1994.



On March 8, 1994, the Pacific Stock Exchange, Inc. (``PSE'' or ``Exchange'') submitted to the Securities and Exchange
Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission''), pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'')
 and Rule 19 8b-4 thereunder,
 a proposed rule change to amend its original listing fee, processing and fee and annual maintenance fee. 






The proposed rule change was notified in Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33928 (April 19, 1994), 59 FR 21793 (April
26, 1994). No comments were received on the proposal. 

The PSE is amending its fees for listed companies. Specifically, the Exchange is increasing its original listing
fee for the common stock of exclusively listed companies from $10,000 to $20,000. In addition, the Exchange is increasing
its initial processing fee, applicable to all original listing applications, from $250 to $500. Finally, the Exchange
is increasing its annual maintenance fee for exclusively listed companies from $1,000 to $2,000. Dually listed equity
securities would continue to be charged $10,000 for original listings, and $1,000 for the annual maintenance fee
(for one issue).







The Exchange states that the fee increases are designed to offset rising costs associated with maintaining listing
services and related overhead expenses.
 






The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and in particular, with the requirements
of Section 6 of the Act.
 More specifically, the Commission believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6(b)(4) of the
Act which requires that the rules of an exchange assure the equitable allocation of reasonable dues, fees, and other
charges among members, issuers, and other persons using its facilities. The Commission notes that an increase in
the PSE's listing fees was last approved in 1991.
 Moreover, the current increases do not place an excessive allocation of Exchange fees on its issuers as opposed to
members and other persons using its facilities. Accordingly, the Commission believes that it is appropriate to approve
the proposed rule change. 







The Commission believes that it is appropriate for the Exchange to charge greater original listing fees for exclusive
listings as opposed to dual listings due to the additional costs incident to maintaining exclusive listings. For
example, with respect to exclusively listed companies, the Exchange may incur additional costs for, among other
things, monitoring the company for corporate developments. 

The Commission further finds that the fees are reasonable because the Exchange has proposed the increases to offset
rising costs associated with maintaining listing services and related overhead expenses. Accordingly, the Commission
believes that it is appropriate to approve the proposed rule change. 

It is therefore ordered, pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act,
 that the proposed rule change (SR-PSE-94-8) is approved.







For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.
