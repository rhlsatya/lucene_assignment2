FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM 











Truth in Savings 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.

 

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule and extension of comment period.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 On May 11, 1994, the Board requested comment on a proposal to amend Regulation DD (Truth in Savings) dealing with crediting
and compounding practices and having the effect of producing an annual percentage yield (APY) that reflects the time
value of money. The Board is extending the comment period for 60 days to give the public additional time to provide comments.
In addition, the Board is publishing for comment a further alternative for APY calculations that would allow institutions
to disclose an APY equal to the contract interest rate on time accounts with maturities greater than one year that do
not compound interest but pay interest at least annually. This alternative would provide the Board with a more modest
option as it considers a final resolution to problems with APY calculations.

 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

(1) Background 



The Truth in Savings Act (12 U.S.C. 4301 et seq.) requires depository institutions to provide disclosures to consumers
about their deposit accounts, including an annual percentage yield (APY) on interest-bearing accounts. The act
is implemented by the Board's Regulation DD (12 CFR part 230), which became effective June 21, 1993 (see 57 FR 43337
and 58 FR 15077). 

Because the current formula for calculating the APY assumes that interest remains on deposit until maturity, the
resulting APY may_but does not always_reflect the time value of money. The formula produces an APY that is less than
the contract interest rate for long-term certificates of deposit (CDs) that are noncompounding but pay interest
periodically. On December 6, 1993, the Board published a proposal that called for an additional APY formula that would
have factored into the APY calculation the specific time intervals for interest paid on the account_that is, the time
value of money (58 FR 64190). The proposal was withdrawn on May 11, based on considerations of cost and regulatory burden
(59 FR 24376).

In the context of deliberations about the December 1993 proposal, the Board considered related issues regarding
depository institutions' compounding and crediting practices. On May 11, 1994, the Board proposed amendments to
clarify the relationship between compounding and crediting and provide an alternative basis for eliminating anomalies
produced by the current APY formula (59 FR 24378). The Board has received requests for an extension of the proposal's
comment period, due to end on July 5, 1994; the Board is extending the comment period to September 6, 1994. 



Alternative APY Resolution 



In addition to extending the comment period on the current proposal, the Board has decided to solicit comment on an
alternative approach for APY calculations. Under this alternative, the only institutions affected would be those
offering noncompounding multi-year CDs that pay interest at least annually. Those institutions would disclose
an APY equal to the interest rate, regardless of whether interest payments were made annually or more frequently.
The APY for all other accounts would reflect the interest rate paid and any compounding. Interest payments by check
or transfer would not be factored into the APY calculation. 

This alternative (called Approach B in the December 1993 proposal) was considered by the Board in its deliberations
on adding a new APY formula. The Board declined to adopt Approach B at that time, mainly based on concerns about the limited
resolution of anomalies associated with the APY and costs associated with its implementation. 

A number of factors have led the Board to reopen comments on this alternative. The Congress chose the APY as the primary
uniform measurement for comparison shopping among deposit accounts. The Board believes the APY formula should produce
a mathematical figure that is easily understood and readily reveals to consumers an account's comparative value.
The Board also believes that regulatory compliance should be as simple and cost-effective as possible, and that reductions
in product variety and consumer choice due to regulatory requirements should be minimized. 

Taking all these factors into account, and recognizing that all formulas contain assumptions that are valid in some
circumstances and not in others, the Board seeks comment on whether this limited approach would achieve a satisfactory
resolution of the competing interests for accuracy, consumer understanding, product flexibility, and ease of compliance.


The Board also solicits comment on whether adoption of such an alternative would reduce the incentive for institutions
to offer compounding multi-year CDs. For example, assume two institutions offer a two-year CD with a 6.00% interest
rate; one mandates monthly interest checks, the other offers annual compounding. Both could advertise a 6.00% APY,
even though a consumer depositing $1,000 receives $120 if interest checks are paid annually and $123.60 if money is
left in the account. 



(2) Proposed Regulatory Revisions: Section-by-Section Analysis



A section-by-section description of proposed amendments follows. 



Section 230.4_Account Disclosures 



Paragraph (b)(6)_Features of Time Accounts 



The regulation requires a disclosure for institutions offering time accounts that compound interest and permit
a consumer to withdraw accrued interest during the account term. The disclosure states that the APY assumes interest
remains on deposit until maturity and that a withdrawal of interest will reduce earnings. The Board request comments
on whether a similar disclosure would be helpful to consumers purchasing noncompounding multi-year CDs that pay
interest at least annually and disclose an APY equal to the interest rate. For example, the disclosure would alert
consumers that dollar earnings will be less than for a multi-year CD with the same maturity (and disclosing the same
APY) that compounds annually. The Board solicits suggestions for text that would be most helpful to consumers. 



Section 230.8_Advertising 



Paragraph (c)(6)_Features of Time Accounts 



The regulation requires institutions advertising APYs to disclose other key features about the account. The Board
solicits comment on whether institutions advertising an APY equal to the interest rate on noncompounding multi-year
accounts that make interest payments annually should be required also to make a disclosure like the one discussed
above. If so, the Board solicits suggestions for text that would be helpful to consumers and take into account the constraints
of advertising media. 



Appendix A to Part 230_Annual Percentage Yield Calculation 



Part I. Annual Percentage Yield for Account Disclosures and Advertising Purposes 



A. 

General rules. 

Under the alternative approach, the proposed amendments to Appendix A only affect institutions that offer noncompounding
multi-year CDs that pay interest at least annually. A new paragraph E is added to clarify how APYs shall be determined
for such accounts. The Board requests comment on the proposed paragraph and accompanying example.

Appendix B_Model Clauses and Sample Forms 



The Board solicits comments on model clauses or additional sample forms that may be appropriate if the amendments
are adopted. 



(3) Form of Comment Letters



Comment letters should refer to Docket No. R-0836, and, when possible, should use a standard typeface with a
type size of 10 or 12 characters per inch. This will enable the Board to convert the text into machine-readable form
through electronic scanning, and will facilitate automated retrieval of comments for review. Also, if accompanied
by an original document in paper form, comments may be submitted on 31/2 inch or 51/4 inch computer diskettes in any
IBM-compatible DOS-based format. 



(4) Regulatory Flexibility Analysis and Paperwork Reduction Act



The Board's Office of the Secretary previously prepared an economic impact statement on the proposed alternative
dealing with noncompounding multi-year CDs that pay interest at least annually. A copy of the analysis may be obtained
from Publications Services, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Washington, DC 20551, at (202) 452-3245.


In accordance with section 3507 of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 35; 5 CFR 1320.13), the proposed revisions
will be reviewed by the Board under the authority delegated to the Board by the Office of Management and Budget after
consideration of comments received during the public comment period. 



List of Subjects in 12 CFR Part 230

Certain conventions have been used to highlight the proposed revisions to the regulation. New language is shown inside
bold-faced arrows, while language that would be deleted is set off with bold-faced brackets. 

For the reasons set forth in the preamble, the Board proposes to amend 12 CFR part 230 as follows: 



PART 230_TRUTH IN SAVINGS (REGULATION DD) 



1. The authority citation for part 230 would continue to read as follows:

2. In Part 230 Appendix A would be amended by revising the second sentence in the introductory text to Part I and the first
sentence of paragraph A, and by adding a new paragraph E as follows:

For time accounts with a stated maturity greater than one year that do not compound interest on an annual or more frequent
basis, and that require (or permit) the consumer to withdraw interest at least annually, the annual percentage yield
shall be equal to the interest rate. 

Example: 

(1) If an institution offers a $1,000 two-year certificate of deposit that credits interest semi-annually solely
by check or transfer, and there is no compounding at a 6.00% interest rate, the annual percentage yield is 6.00%.

Notice of proposed special conditions.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This document proposes special conditions for the General Electric (GE) Aircraft Engines Model(s) GE90-75B/-85B/-76B
turbofan engines. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has determined that the requirements of Federal Aviation
Regulation (FAR) 14 CFR part 33, including the requirements of  33.94, Blade Containment and Rotor Unbalance
Test, relative to the location of fan blade fracture for the containment test, do not contain adequate or appropriate
safety standards for the certification of the GE90-75B/-85B/-76B turbofan engines. This finding
is based on a novel or unusual design feature of the GE90 fan blade. Therefore, this document proposes special conditions
which the Administrator finds necessary to establish a level of safety equivalent to that established by the airworthiness
standards of part 33 of the FAR.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Comments Invited 



Interested persons are invited to participate in the making of the proposed special conditions by submitting such
written data, views, or arguments as they may desire. Communications should identify the Rules Docket number and
be submitted in triplicate to the address specified under ADDRESSES

. All communications received on or before the closing date for comments, specified under 

DATES

Comments are specifically invited on the overall regulatory, economic, environmental, and energy aspects of the
proposed special conditions. All comments submitted will be available in the Rules Docket for examination by interested
persons, both before and after the closing date for comments. A report summarizing each substantive public contact
with FAA personnel concerning this proposal will be filed in the docket. 
Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments submitted in response to this notice must submit
with those comments a self-addressed, stamped postcard on which the following statement is made: ``Comments to Docket
No. 94-ANE-18.'' The postcard will be date stamped and returned to the commenter. 


Background


On December 16, 1991, General Electric Aircraft Engines applied for type certification of Model(s) GE90-75B/-85B/-76B
turbofan engines. These engines incorporate a first stage fan blade manufactured using carbon graphite composite
material. This unusual design feature results in the GE90 fan blade having significant difference in material property
characteristics when compared to conventionally designed fan blades using non-composite materials. For example,
the probability that a composite fan blade will fail below the inner flowpath diameter is highly improbable, making
inappropriate the requirement contained in  33.94 paragraph (a) subparagraph (1) to show blade containment
after a failure of the blade at the outermost retention feature. 
The current requirements of  33.94 are based on metallic blade characteristics and service history and are
not appropriate for the unusual design features of the composite fan blade found on the GE90 series turbofan engines.
The FAA has determined that a more realistic blade retention test will be achieved with a fan blade failure at the inner
flowpath diameter (complete airfoil) instead of the outermost retention feature as is currently required by  33.94
paragraph (a) subparagraph (1). 
The FAA has also determined that the composite fan blade construction presents other factors that must be considered.
Tests and analyses must account for the effects of in-service deterioration of, manufacturing and materials variations
in, and environmental effects on the composite material. Further, tests and analyses must show that a lightning strike
on the composite fan blade will not result in a hazardous condition to the aircraft and that the engine will meet the
requirements of  33.75. Therefore, these Special Conditions are proposed which define the additional requirements
which the Administrator considers necessary to establish a level of safety equivalent to that established by the
Airworthiness Standards of part 33.

Type Certification Basis 



Under the provisions of  21.101, General Electric Aircraft Engines must show that the GE Model(s) GE90-75B/-85B/-76B
turbofan engines met the requirements of the applicable regulations in effect on the date of the application. Those
Federal Aviation Regulations are  21.21, as amended through Amendment 21-68, August 10, 1990, and part
33, as amended through Amendment 33-14, August 10, 1990. 

The Administrator finds that the applicable airworthiness regulations in part 33, as amended, do not contain adequate
or appropriate safety standards for the GE90 series turbofan engine because of its novel or unusual design feature.
Therefore, the Administrator proposes these special conditions under the provisions of  21.16 to establish
a level of safety equivalent to that established in the regulations. 

Special conditions, as appropriate, are issued in accordance with  11.49 of the FAR after public notice and
opportunity for comment, as required by  11.28 and  11.29(b), and become part of the type certification
basis in accordance with  21.101 paragraph (b) subparagraph (2). 



Conclusion 



This action affects only GE Model(s) GE90-75B/-85B/-76B turbofan engines. It is not a rule of general
applicability and affects only the manufacturer who applied to the FAA for approval of these engines containing this
novel or unusual design feature. 



List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 33 



Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety, safety.




The authority citation for these special conditions continues to read as follows: 





Authority: 

49 U.S.C. App. 1354(a), 1421, 1423; 49 U.S.C. 106(g); 14 CFR 21.16, and 14 CFR 11.28. 



The Proposed Special Conditions 



Accordingly, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) proposes the following special conditions as part of the
type certification basis for the General Electric Aircraft Engines GE90 series turbofan engines. 

(a) The following must be shown by tests and analyses, or other methods acceptable to the Administrator, that, in lieu
of the fan blade containment test with the fan blade failing at the point specified in  33.94 paragraph (a) subparagraph
(1), a fan blade containment test with the fan blade failing at the inner flowpart diameter demonstrates: 
(1) That the disk and fan blade retention system can withstand without failure a centrifugal load equal to two times
the maximum load which the engine could experience within approved operating limitations, and 

(2) That by a procedure approved by the Administrator an operating limitation must be established which specifies
the maximum allowable number of start-stop stress cycles for the fan blade retention system. The fan blade retention
system includes the portion of the fan blade from the inner flowpath diameter inward to the blade dovetail, the blade
retention components, and the fan disk and fan blade attachment features. 

(b) It must be shown that the probability of fan blade retention system failure, for any cause, during the service life
of the engine to be extremely improbable. 

(c) It must be shown by test or analysis that a lightning strike on the composite fan blade structure will not result
in a hazardous condition, and that the engine will meet the requirements of  33.75. 

(d) The tests and analyses required by (a)(1) and (a)(2) of these special conditions must account for the effects of
in-service deterioration, manufacturing and materials variations, and environmental effects.

I. Introduction 


The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (Commission) seeks public comment on amending its regulations to establish
provisions concerning the recovery of wholesale and retail stranded costs by public utilities and transmitting
utilities under sections 205, 206, 211 and 212 of the Federal Power Act (FPA).
 Wholesale stranded costs are defined as any legitimate, prudent and verifiable costs incurred by a public utility
or a transmitting utility to provide service to a wholesale requirements customer that subsequently becomes, in
whole or in part, an unbundled transmission services customer
 of that public utility or transmitting utility. Retail stranded costs are defined as any legitimate, prudent and
verifiable costs incurred by a public utility or transmitting utility to provide service to a retail franchise customer
that subsequently becomes, in whole or in part, directly or indirectly, an unbundled transmission services customer
of that public utility or transmitting utility.






For recovery of wholesale stranded costs, the proposed rule distinguishes between stranded costs associated with
wholesale requirements contracts executed after the date the proposed rule is published in the 

Federal Register

 (``new'' contracts) and stranded costs associated with wholesale requirements contracts executed on or before
that date (``existing'' contracts).

The proposed rule would not allow a public utility or transmitting utility to seek recovery of stranded costs associated
with ``new'' wholesale requirements contracts through transmission rates for section 205 or 211 transmission services.
Recovery of such costs will not be allowed except through explicit stranded cost provisions contained in new wholesale
requirements contracts.

If the seller under a new wholesale requirements contract is a public utility, and the new contract explicitly addresses
stranded cost recovery, the public utility may seek recovery, in accordance with the contract, under sections 205-206
of the FPA.
 The public utility may not seek recovery of wholesale stranded costs through any transmission rate for section 205
or 211 transmission services. If the seller under a new wholesale requirements contract is a transmitting utility
subject to the Commission's jurisdiction under section 211, but not also a public utility subject to the Commission's
section 205-206 jurisdiction,
 there will be no Commission forum for addressing wholesale stranded costs associated with the new contract. Such
utilities will not be able to seek recovery of wholesale stranded costs associated with such new contracts through
rates for transmission services ordered under section 211, and the Commission does not have jurisdiction over their
power sales contracts. Therefore, these utilities must address recovery of stranded costs through their new wholesale
requirements contracts subject to the appropriate regulatory authority approval.

With regard to stranded costs associated with ``existing'' wholesale requirements contracts, the proposed rule
provides a three-year transition period during which public utilities must attempt and non-public utilities are
encouraged to attempt to renegotiate certain existing contracts, and during which they may seek recovery of stranded
costs as follows:

(a) If an existing wholesale requirements contract explicitly addresses stranded costs through an exit fee or other
stranded cost provision, no public utility or transmitting utility may seek recovery of stranded costs associated
with that contract through transmission rates; the utility may recover such costs only as specified in the requirements
contract. 

(b) If an existing wholesale requirements contract does not explicitly address stranded costs through an exit fee
or other stranded cost provision, the parties to the contract, within a three-year transition period, must make a
good faith attempt to negotiate a stranded cost amendment to the contract. If the parties are able to negotiate an amendment,
and the selling utility under the contract is a public utility, the amendment should be filed for Commission approval
under section 205 or 206 of the FPA prior to the end of the three-year period. If the parties to the existing contract
are not able to negotiate an amendment, and the selling utility under the contract is a public utility, the public utility
may unilaterally file a proposed amendment, under section 205 or 206 of the FPA, prior to the end of the three-year period.
 If an amendment is not filed and the customer leaves the public utility's system after the end of the three-year transition
period, the Commission will deny any extra-contractual stranded cost claim in a section 205 or 206 requirements rate
proceeding arising under the contract in question. 





(c) If an existing wholesale requirements contract does not explicitly address stranded costs through an exit fee
or other stranded cost provision, and if, prior to the end of the three-year transition period, the customer gives
notice pursuant to the contract
 that it will no longer purchase all or part of its requirements from the selling utility but instead will purchase from
the selling utility unbundled section 205 or section 211 transmission services
 that will begin prior to the end of the three-year period, then the selling utility may seek to recover stranded costs
from that customer through jurisdictional transmission rates. This is the only circumstance in which the rule proposes
to allow wholesale stranded cost recovery through transmission rates. 






(d) If a utility does seek recovery of stranded costs as permitted by the proposed rule, and the existing wholesale
requirements contract contains a notice provision, there will be a rebuttable presumption that the utility had no
legitimate expectation of continuing to serve the customer beyond the period provided for in the notice provision.


With regard to retail stranded costs, the proposed rule adopts a strong policy preference that appropriate State
or local regulatory authorities address, in whatever manner they deem appropriate, stranded cost recovery. The
proposed rule provides alternative proposals for how the Commission will address retail stranded costs. The Commission
expresses no preference in favor of either alternative. Under the first alternative, the rule provides that if the
appropriate State or local authority does not explicitly address retail stranded costs,
 or if there is conflict among authorities within a State or among different States, the Commission will entertain
requests to recover stranded costs in section 205-206 rates for wholesale or retail transmission services
in interstate commerce,
 or in section 212 rates for wholesale transmission services ordered under section 211. Under the second alternative,
the rule provides that the Commission will not entertain any request for recovery of retail stranded costs. However,
the Commission solicits comments on whether there should be exceptions to this alternative rule. 






Finally, the proposed rule provides guidance as to the substantive criteria and evidentiary demonstration necessary
for wholesale and retail stranded cost recovery. 

The Commission requests the general views, comments and analyses of all interested persons, pursuant to the procedures
herein. It has set forth enumerated questions in the Appendix attached hereto on which it solicits comment in particular.

II. Public Reporting Burden 


The proposed rule specifies filing requirements to be followed by public utilities seeking to recover stranded costs.
The information collection requirements of the proposed rule are attributable to FERC-516 ``Electric Rate
Filings''. The current total annual reporting burden for FERC-516 is 783,700 hours. 
The proposed rule requires public utilities seeking to recover stranded costs to provide certain information to
the Commission. The public reporting burden for the information collection requirements contained in the proposed
rule is estimated to average 50 hours per response. This estimate includes time for reviewing the requirements of
the Commission's regulations, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the necessary data,
completing and reviewing the collection of information, and filing the required information. 
There are approximately 200 public utilities. The Commission estimates that approximately ten of these utilities
will respond to the information collection annually. The respondents would be public utilities who seek to recover
stranded costs. The information will be collected on an annual basis. Accordingly, the public reporting burden is
estimated to be no more than 500 hours. 
Send comments regarding this burden estimate or any other aspect of the Commission's collection of information,
including suggestions for reducing this burden, to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 941 North Capitol
Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426 [Attention: Michael Miller, Information Services Division, (202) 208-1415],
and to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs of the Office of Management and Budget [Attention: Desk Officer
for Federal Energy Regulatory Commission]. 


III. Discussion 


A. Background 


Historically, electric utilities entered into long-term contracts to make wholesale requirements sales (bundled
sales of generation and transmission) to municipal, cooperative and investor-owned utilities. Under these contracts,
utilities often committed to provide all (full requirements) or part (partial requirements) of a customer's power
needs for the contract period. Although these wholesale requirements contracts are typically for defined terms,
they often were rolled over or extended when the contract term expired. 
The historical supply relationship between utilities and their wholesale requirements customers, however, has
begun to undergo significant change as a result of increased competition in wholesale power generation and greater
customer access to transmission services. 
Increased competition in wholesale power generation began with the enactment of the Public Utility Regulatory Policies
Act of 1978 (PURPA).
 PURPA provided incentives for the development of alternative generation sources known as qualifying facilities
(QFs). In addition, state-approved competitive bidding programs paved the way for the growth of non-traditional
utility generators. Finally, the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (Energy Policy Act)
 provided regulatory exemptions to encourage a new class of wholesale power producers known as exempt wholesale generators
(EWGs). 






As competition in wholesale power generation has increased, so has the ability of customers to gain access to the transmission
services necessary to reach competing suppliers. In earlier years, a few customers were able to obtain access as a
result of court proceedings, beginning with the Supreme Court's decision in Otter Tail Power Co. 

v. 

United States,

 410 U.S. 366 (1973). In recent years, a growing number of public utilities voluntarily agreed to file transmission
tariffs of general applicability, 

i.e., 

tariffs that permit transmission access for any entity that will be making sales for resale of electric energy.

12

 In most instances, access was provided in order to obtain Commission approval of a merger or consolidation

13

 or Commission authorization of market-based rates for generation services.

14

 The Commission, in many instances, conditioned its approval of certain mergers upon transmission access in order
to mitigate potential anticompetitive effects.

15

 








The trend toward greater transmission access has been accelerated by the passage of the Energy Policy Act, which substantially
expanded the Commission's authority to order transmission services. Under amended section 211 of the FPA, the Commission
may order wholesale transmission services, upon application, to any electric utility, Federal power marketing
agency, or any other person generating electric energy for sale for resale.

16

 Thus far, the Commission has granted requests for mandatory transmission services pursuant to section 211 in five
of the six cases it has acted on, including four proposed orders and one final order. In addition, several public utilities
have filed voluntary wholesale transmission tariffs subsequent to the passage of the Energy Policy Act.

During the transition to a fully competitive wholesale power market, some utilities may incur stranded costs as wholesale
customers leave their systems to purchase power elsewhere. A utility may have built facilities or entered into long-term
fuel or purchased power supply contracts with the reasonable expectation, based on historical experience and the
behavior of its customer, that its wholesale requirements contract to sell electric energy to that customer would
be renewed, and that the customer would pay its proportionate share of long-term investments and other costs incurred.
If the customer is able to obtain unbundled transmission service from the utility in order to reach other power suppliers,
the utility may have ``stranded costs.'' If the utility does not have an alternative buyer for the power previously
sold to the departing wholesale requirements customer, or some other means of mitigating the stranded costs, the
costs must be recovered from either thedeparting customer or the remaining customers or borne by the utility's shareholders.

Changes are also occurring in retail electric markets, which could also cause retail stranded costs.

18

 For instance, as a result of recent action by the Massachusetts legislature, discussed 

infra, 

the Massachusetts Bay Transit Authority (MBTA) changed from being a retail franchise customer to a wholesale transmission
customer of Massachusetts Electric Company. Another example is the California Public Utilities Commission's recent
initiation of a proceeding to consider the restructuring of California's retail electric industry to allow all consumers
to obtain direct access to competing generation service providers.

19

 The Michigan Public Service Commission is also considering a plan to offer consumer access to competing generation
suppliers on a limited basis.

In summary, as a result of the transition to a competitive wholesale power market, we must be concerned with three ways
in which stranded costs are most likely to occur: 

Scenario 1: A wholesale requirements customer (

i.e., 

a wholesale purchaser of bundled generation and transmission services) may obtain unbundled transmission services
from its existing supplier in order to reach an alternative generation supplier. It may obtain wholesale transmission
services either through a voluntary bilateral agreement or voluntary open-access tariff filed by a utility under
FPA section 205, or by obtaining a Commission order under FPA section 211; 


Scenario 2: A retail franchise customer (or a group of retail franchise customers) may, through State or local government
action, become a wholesale customer who obtains from its existing supplier either voluntary unbundled wholesale
transmission services under section 205 agreements or tariffs as described above, or obtains such services pursuant
to a Commission order under section 211; 


Scenario 3: A retail franchise customer may obtain unbundled retail transmission services from its existing supplier
in order to reach a new generation supplier, either through voluntary unbundled retail transmission services or
as a result of a State or local action requiring the existing supplier to provide such retail transmission services.

21

 





Below we discuss the Commission's precedent for each of these scenarios, and how we propose to deal with such stranded
costs in the future.

B. Current Stranded Cost Policy 




1. Wholesale Customers Leaving The System 




The Commission has always permitted public utilities to include reasonable cancellation provisions in power sales
contracts in order to protect themselves from stranded costs and to plan for the future needs of their systems.

22

 Reasonable cancellation provisions may include specified ``exit fees'' or ``termination charges'' that must be
paid by a purchaser if it terminates service prior to a contract's termination date. They may also include requirements
that customers provide sufficient prior notice of cancellation to allow utilities to avoid stranded costs. 






Contracts negotiated prior to the recent movement toward increased transmission access and competitive bulk power
markets may not contain provisions requiring notice of termination and/or allocating responsibility for stranded
costs. Accordingly, the Commission has permitted public utilities to include wholesale stranded investment cost
recovery provisions in wholesale transmission rates when a public utility has filed a transmission tariff of general
applicability. 


In 

Entergy, 

public utilities sought to include provisions for the recovery of wholesale stranded investment costs as part of
their proposed transmission tariff of general applicability. In that case, the Commission stated:




If Entergy has made investment decisions based on a contractual commitment or reasonable expectation at that time
that it would continue to serve these customers, it should be able to recover from them the legitimate and verifiable
costs invested on their behalf.







The Commission reasoned that the existence of a transmission tariff of general applicability could increase a public
utility's risk of stranded investment far beyond what was contemplated when the public utility originally negotiated
its power supply contracts.
 The Commission further observed that public utilities may not voluntarily offer expanded transmission access if
doing so means becoming subject to an increased risk of stranded investment.
 Therefore, the Commission stated that it would be appropriate for Entergy to seek to recover legitimate and verifiable
stranded investment costs through transmission rates, if such costs were associated with contracts entered into
before the date of the Commission's order. However, the Commission stated that it would not allow the Entergy utilities
to seek recovery of stranded costs associated with contracts entered into or extended after that date. The Commission
further indicated in 

Entergy

 that while a public utility may seek to recover stranded costs, recovery is by no means guaranteed. The public utility
bears the heavy burden of showing, among other things, that it made relevant investment decisions based on a ``contractual
commitment or reasonable expectation'' that it would continue to serve its existing wholesale power customers.
 







2. Retail-Turned-Wholesale Customers Leaving The System 



The Commission has been presented with the question of whether it should permit public utilities to seek recovery
in 

wholesale 

transmission rates of stranded investment costs incurred to serve former 

retail

 franchise customers.
 In 

United Illuminating Company, 

the Commission held that retail franchise matters are state matters that should be handled, in the first instance,
by the appropriate state regulatory bodies or courts.
 In 

Massachusetts Electric Company, 

the Commission accepted for filing and set for hearing the reasonableness of a proposed stranded cost charge involving
a utility seeking to recover stranded costs in transmission rates from a former retail franchise customer that became
a wholesale requirements customer and then became a transmission-only wholesale customer.

29

 







3. Retail Customers Leaving The System 



The Commission has not been presented with the question of whether it can or should permit public utilities to seek
recovery, in rates for unbundled interstate transmission services provided to 

retail

 customers, of stranded costs incurred to serve retail franchise customers. However, this issue could arise as a result
of voluntary retail wheeling or State or local actions resulting in retail wheeling arrangements such as those being
considered in California, Michigan and elsewhere. 



C. The Proposed Regulations 



Consistent with the policy objectives of Congress in enacting the electric provisions of the Energy Policy Act, the
Commission is committed to developing a competitive, open transmission access, wholesale bulk power market. Our
goal is to facilitate the development of competitively priced generation supply options, and to ensure that wholesale
purchasers of electric energy can reach alternative power suppliers and vice versa. We therefore believe it is important
at this stage of the evolution of the electric industry to address stranded costs.

The financial stability of the electric industry during the transition to a competitive wholesale generation market
will depend in large part on: (1) Whether the transition to a competitive environment, at either the wholesale or retail
level, will leave utility companies without an adequate opportunity to recover costs invested to serve customers
under less competitive circumstances; and (2) whether and how regulators address recovery of some or all of those
``stranded'' costs. While there is no universally accepted estimate of the potential magnitude of stranded costs,
some observers have suggested that stranded costs could total tens of billions of dollars, while others have suggested
$200 billion or more. These estimates are based, to a large degree, on the difference between the book value of generating
assets and their presumed market value.





In addition to concerns about the financial stability of the industry, we believe it is important to provide as much
regulatory certainty as possible, as early as possible, to buyers and sellers of electric energy and transmission,
regarding the recovery of these potentially significant costs. Buyers seeking competitive generation alternatives
need to know the costs associated with leaving their existing suppliers in order to make reasoned decisions. Likewise,
sellers need to know the extent, if any, to which they will be obligated to provide requirements service on an extra-contractual
basis so that they can plan their participation in competitive generation markets. 
Accordingly, the Commission believes it can best fulfill its regulatory responsibilities by addressing the issue
of stranded costs during the initial stages of the transition to a competitive wholesale generation market.
 The Commission therefore is proposing to establish generic policies and procedures covering the treatment of stranded
costs by public utilities and transmitting utilities. 




The Commission believes that stranded cost recovery is a transition problem. In the past, costs may have been incurred
by wholesale suppliers under an implicit regulatory ``bargain,'' 

i.e.

, based on a reasonable expectation that captive customers would continue taking service beyond the term of their
contracts and that the utility would continue to plan for their needs.
 This regulatory ``bargain,'' particularly in the context of the recovery of extra-contractual stranded costs,
may not be sustainable in the face of wholesale market forces. The expectation is that market forces will ensure adequate
supply and wholesale customers will be able to contract for services from alternative suppliers. 




Whereas any obligation to serve requirements customers at the wholesale level is a contractual one, the traditional
obligation to serve at the retail level arises through utility monopoly franchise rights. The traditional retail
regulatory compact has ensured the utility's financial integrity by granting it an opportunity to recover prudently
incurred costs plus a fair rate of return, in exchange for regulation by the State regulatory authority and the duty
to provide safe, reliable, reasonably priced electric service on demand. Some states have recently considered whether
the traditional franchise duty to serve all customers within the boundaries of the designated franchise area ought
to evolve and whether this duty should be modified by the State.
 




The Commission notes that new generating capacity can be built and operated at costs that are less than many utilities'
current embedded generating costs. This simple fact of current economic conditions is encouraging many users to
seek access to the new lower cost sources of supply. Utilities traditionally have been obligated to serve all retail
customers within their franchise territory and all wholesale requirements customers to whom they have contractually
agreed to provide service. They have constructed or contracted for generating capacity sufficient to meet these
service obligations. If existing customers leave their current utility suppliers, the utilities may not be able
to recover all of their prudently incurred costs. In light of the utilities' status as regulated entities with retail
franchise service obligations and contractual (and perhaps extra-contractual) wholesale service commitments,
the Commission believes it is appropriate to provide a mechanism for utilities to seek to recover prudently incurred
costs that are stranded during the transition to a competitive electricity supply market. 
However, the amount of and responsibility for any costs stranded in the transition to competitive markets should
be resolved in as short a time as possible, so as not to inhibit customers from taking advantage of the competitive market
and so that sellers can restructure their marketing strategy to reflect competitive markets.
 




The Commission assumes that stranded costs will be dominated by generating capacity. However, we believe that it
is appropriate to consider stranded costs more broadly, including the possibility that fuel supply costs, purchased
power costs, nuclear decommissioning costs, regulatory assets and possibly other costs that the utility seller
is obligated to pay may be stranded. 

The Commission seeks public comment on what categories of costs, in addition to investment costs, should be eligible
for stranded cost recovery. The Commission also seeks comment concerning how stranded costs should be allocated
to specific customers

.

The proposed regulations discussed below would allow utilities the opportunity to seek to directly assign stranded
costs to the departing wholesale and perhaps retail customers. However, an alternative policy might assign wholesale
or retail stranded costs more broadly. For example, some stranded cost proposals would require all transmission
customers (including native load which takes bundled service) to pay an access charge related to use of the transmission
system. 

The Commission invites comments on the direct assignment and alternative methods of stranded cost recovery. The
Commission also invites comments on whether alternative methods, e.g., an access charge, might give customers reasonable
certainty on the scope of their stranded cost obligation more quickly than a direct assignment approach would, and
thus might expedite the transition to a more competitive wholesale market.


The proposed regulations are discussed in detail below. 


1. Recovery of Stranded Costs Associated With New Wholesale Power Sales Contracts 


The Commission believes that future wholesale contracts should explicitly address the mutual obligations of the
seller and buyer, including the seller's obligation to continue to serve the buyer, if any, and the buyer's obligation,
if any, if it changes suppliers. Therefore, the proposed regulations regarding wholesale stranded costs encourage
the resolution of future stranded cost issues through negotiated agreement. At the same time, we are aware that many
existing contracts, entered into prior to the time that unbundled transmission access became more widely available,
may not have adequately addressed the potential for stranded costs. 
The proposed regulations regarding wholesale stranded costs distinguish between new and existing wholesale requirements
contracts. New contracts are defined as contracts executed after the date that the proposed rule is published in the


Federal Register

. Existing contracts are defined as contracts executed on or before the date that the proposed rule is published in
the 

Federal Register

. 
The proposed regulations would disallow extra-contractual recovery of wholesale stranded costs associated with
any new requirements contract. That is, we will not allow any request for recovery unless the contract contains specific
provisions allowing stranded cost recovery when it is accepted by the Commission.
 In addition, the Commission will not allow any stranded costs associated with new requirements contracts to be recovered
through transmission rates. 




Therefore, in the future, wholesale power suppliers and their customers must address stranded cost issues by including
appropriate notice and exit fee provisions, or any other explicit statement related to stranded cost recovery, in
their new requirements contracts. For example, sellers may wish to require adequate notice in contracts to reflect
the realities of supply planning, and may wish to include exit fees that buyers would be required to pay if the buyer
prematurely exits the system. Similarly, buyers may wish to preserve the rights to exit contracts when market conditions
warrant it. 
In addition to encouraging parties to explicitly address their mutual obligations in new wholesale requirements
contracts, the Commission believes it is important to address any future regulatory obligation to serve at the wholesale
level. Competitive generation markets not only require that customers be able to freely shop for competitively priced
generation, but that sellers be free to enter new markets and to exit markets. Asymmetrical rights and obligations
that allow existing customers to leave their current suppliers consistent with their existing contractual obligations,
but that require sellers to continue to serve those customers beyond the terms of their existing contracts, would
not be efficient or fair. Therefore, the Commission does not believe that it is appropriate to impose on wholesale
requirements suppliers a regulatory obligation to continue to serve their existing requirements customers beyond
the end of the contract term. This means that a requirements customer is responsible for planning to meet its power
needs beyond the end of the contract term. It may re-contract with its existing supplier, or it may contract with new
suppliers, using its existing supplier's transmission system. 


The Commission invites public comment on the extent to which there is or should be a regulatory obligation to continue
to serve wholesale requirements customers beyond the end of the contract term and the source of any such obligation.
The Commission also seeks comment concerning whether section 35.15 of the Commission's regulations, which concerns
notice of termination, should be deleted in its entirety, or only in certain circumstances (e.g., when the seller
provides transmission access on a comparable basis to the seller's own uses of its system).




2. Recovery of Stranded Costs Associated With Existing Wholesale Power Sales Contracts 


Because stranded costs are a transitional problem, and neglecting their recovery could delay the realization of
a fully competitive bulk power market, it is important to set a date beyond which the Commission will no longer permit
extra-contractual recovery of stranded costs that result from existing requirements contracts. 
The proposed regulations would establish a three-year transition period during which utilities must make a good
faith effort to negotiate with their customers to add appropriate stranded cost provisions to their existing contracts
that do not already contain exit fee or other explicit stranded cost provisions. For purposes of this rule, if an existing
contract contains an exit fee provision, that provision will be deemed to be an explicit stranded cost provision which
cannot be renegotiated unless explicitly provided for in the contract. 
One purpose of setting a time limit for renegotiation is to provide an incentive for utilities and their customers
to attempt to promptly renegotiate existing requirements contracts that do not address stranded costs, so that the
contracts reflect the new realities of emerging competitive generating markets. In these situations, the Commission
expects utilities and their customers to make a good-faith effort to reach a mutually agreeable resolution. If the
parties negotiate such a provision and the seller is a public utility, the utility must file the provision as an amendment
to the existing power sales contract prior to the end of the three-year period. 
If the parties to an existing wholesale requirements contract cannot negotiate a stranded cost provision, the selling
utility, if it is a public utility, may, before the end of the three-year transition period, unilaterally file under
FPA section 205 or 206 a proposed stranded cost provision as an amendment to the existing contract.
 This is discussed in further detail below.

<PARENT> FR940711-1-00003 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Alternatively, as discussed in the following section, if the customer under the existing wholesale requirements
contract: (1) Gives notice pursuant to the contract, before the end of the three-year transition period, that it will
no longer purchase all or part of its requirements from the selling utility, but instead will purchase unbundled section
205 or section 211 transmission services from the utility in order to reach a different supplier of electric energy;
and (2) the transmission services will commence prior to the end of the three-year transition period, the selling
utility may file before the end of the three-year transition period a proposal to recover stranded costs through rates
for the requested wholesale transmission services. This is the only circumstance under which the Commission will
allow utilities to seek wholesale stranded cost recovery through transmission rates.

37

 






Existing requirements contracts are highly variable with respect to exit conditions. While some existing contracts
may have explicit exit fee or other stranded cost provisions, many others may be totally silent with respect to exit
conditions. Yet others may have notice provisions, but may not be explicit as to stranded cost recovery. 

If a contract includes an explicit provision for payment of stranded costs or an exit fee, it will be assumed that the
parties fully intended the contract to cover the contingency of the buyer leaving the system. Therefore, as a matter
of policy announced here, the Commission proposes to reject stranded cost amendments to existing contracts that
already contain such provisions. If existing contracts permit renegotiation of existing stranded cost provisions,
the parties may renegotiate in accordance with the contract. However, if existing contracts prohibit stranded cost
recovery, or explicitly prohibit renegotiation of an existing stranded cost or exit fee provision, or prohibit renegotiation
until after the three-year period has expired, the parties will not be required to renegotiate within the three-year
period. 

The Commission invites comments on what other types of contractual provisions, if any, might demonstrate a sufficient
``meeting of the minds'' between parties so that renegotiation should be barred. The Commission also solicits comments
on whether to apply these rules regarding existing contracts only to contracts between unaffiliated entities. 

If a contract does not include an exit fee or other explicit stranded cost provision, but does contain a notice provision,
there will be a rebuttable presumption that the selling utility had no reasonable expectation of continuing to serve
the customer beyond the period provided for in the notice provision. This presumption will apply when public utilities
propose unilateral amendments to requirements contracts, as described above, as well as when public utilities or
transmitting utilities seek stranded cost recovery through transmission rates, as described above. The Commission
solicits comment on whether the rebuttable presumption should also be applied to any contract entered into after
the date of enactment of the Energy Policy Act, even though such contract does not contain an exit fee or other explicit
stranded cost provision, or a notice provision. 

For existing contracts that do not contain specific exit fee or other explicit stranded cost provisions, the Commission
proposes to require parties to make a good faith attempt at renegotiation. This is because many of these contracts
were negotiated twenty years ago, or more, when the parties likely did not foresee the advent of competition in wholesale
generation markets and the ability of transmission-dependent utilities to gain access to their supplier's transmission
system to reach other sellers. 

The Commission recognizes that new requirements contracts and renegotiated existing requirements contracts may
contain contractual features that have heretofore not been included in requirements contracts. Buyers and sellers
will seek to protect themselves from contingencies made more likely as a result of increased competition in power
markets. The Commission will not impose a preconceived notion of what those contract provisions should look like,
and does not necessarily believe that a ``one size fits all'' approach is appropriate.

We recognize that some utilities' existing contracts may be Mobile-Sierra

 contracts that prohibit unilateral rate 
changes.

38

 Under the 

Mobile-Sierra 

doctrine, for instance, a customer may waive its right to challenge the contract and/or the utility may waive its right
to make unilateral rate changes. However, the parties may not waive the indefeasible right of the Commission to alter
rates that are contrary to the public interest.

39

 Accordingly, the Commission could permit public utilities that have contracts containing 

Mobile-Sierra

 provisions an opportunity to file unilateral rate changes if the Commission finds that such an action is required
in the public interest.








The Commission believes that a failure to permit public utilities to address stranded costs through negotiation
or unilateral rate changes could harm the public interest in at least two ways. First, the inability to seek recovery
of stranded costs could impair the financial ability of a utility to continue to provide reliable service. This will
depend on the magnitude of stranded costs and the prospect or lack thereof for recovering such costs from ratepayers.
The prospect of not recovering from ratepayers significant amounts of stranded costs could seriously erode a utility's
access to capital markets, or could drive the utility's cost of capital to unprecedented levels. This high cost of
capital could precipitate other customers leaving the system which, in turn, could cause others to leave. Such a spiral
could be difficult to stop once begun. Second, if some customers are permitted to leave their suppliers without paying
for stranded costs, this may cause an excessive burden on the remaining customers who for whatever reason cannot leave
and therefore may have to bear those costs. For these reasons, our preliminary view is that it is in the public interest
to permit public utilities with 

Mobile-Sierra

 contracts a limited opportunity to unilaterally propose contract changes to address stranded costs, if those contracts
do not already explicitly address stranded costs.

41

 





We clarify that if a public utility unilaterally files a proposed stranded cost amendment under either section 205
or 206, this does not necessarily mean that the Commission ultimately will find it appropriate to allow any amendment.
The same is true for customer complaints under section 206. In addition, the Commission intends to allow the customer
to the contract to present any other proposed stranded cost amendment which it believes reasonable.

42

 Further, in analyzing what is an appropriate stranded cost amendment in the particular circumstances, we will take
into account the other contractual provisions and hear arguments as to why other contractual provisions may also
need to be amended. 







The Commission invites public comment on the proposal to establish a transition period during which utilities may
renegotiate their existing contracts. The Commission also invites public comment on whether public utilities or
customers with Mobile-Sierra contracts should be able to make unilateral filings or file complaints. The Commission
also invites comments on whether the Commission should make a Mobile-Sierra public interest finding based on company-specific
findings instead of generic industry-wide findings. 

The Commission is uncertain how long the proposed transition period should be. On the one hand, the renegotiation
process is likely to be time-consuming, since difficult issues are at stake and some utilities have multiple contracts
and may therefore be engaged in negotiations with a number of parties at the same time. On the other hand, we do not want
to extend the transition period more than is necessary, since the uncertainty concerning stranded cost recovery
may inhibit wholesale customers from pursuing more efficient or cheaper supply alternatives. The Commission's
preliminary view is that a transition period of three years strikes an appropriate balance. However, the Commission
invites comment on the appropriate length of the proposed transition period. 

The Commission requests that utility commenters include in their comments an estimate of the number of requirements
contracts that they would seek to renegotiate to address stranded cost issues. How many of these contracts are silent
on this question? How many have notice provisions, and of what duration? The Commission requests that responding
utilities estimate the amount of stranded costs associated with such contracts, the relationship of the estimated
stranded costs to the utility's total costs or revenues, and the potential cost shift to remaining customers. 



3. Recovery of Wholesale Stranded Costs in Wholesale Transmission Rates 



The Commission has previously authorized provisions that permit public utilities to seek recovery of stranded costs
in wholesale transmission rates in the context of utilities filing transmission tariffs of general applicability,
e.g., Entergy. 

As discussed in the prior section, during the transition period the proposed regulations would permit utilities
to file rates for transmission services that include stranded costs associated with existing wholesale requirements
contracts, but only if: (1) the wholesale requirements customer gives notice pursuant to the contract, prior to the
end of the three-year transition period, that it will no longer purchase all or part of its requirements from the selling
utility, but instead will purchase unbundled section 205 or section 211 transmission services from the utility in
order to reach a different supplier of electric energy; and (2) the transmission services will begin prior to the end
of the three-year transition period. After the transition period, public utilities and transmitting utilities
would no longer be permitted to recover wholesale stranded costs in rates for transmission services under section
205 or 211 of the FPA.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940711-1-00018 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940711-1-00003 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The Commission believes that utilities should retain the option of seeking recovery of stranded costs in rates for
transmission services during the transition period, but only in the limited circumstance described.

43

 The Commission is proposing this limitation in order to encourage utilities and their customers to negotiate stranded
cost provisions in accordance with the other provisions of the proposed regulations. 






The Commission proposes to apply the above limitations on recovery of stranded costs in wholesale transmission rates
to all utilities, whether or not they currently have on file transmission tariffs containing stranded cost provisions.

44

 

The Commission seeks comment on this proposal. 




Filings to recover stranded costs in transmission rates during the transition period will be permitted regardless
of whether the service is voluntarily provided (under section 205 of the FPA pursuant to an open-access tariff, a tariff
of general applicability or an individual contract) or mandated under section 211 of the FPA. However, the Commission
invites public comment on the issue of whether stranded cost recovery should be different depending on whether transmission
service is under section 205 or 211. 
As noted earlier, supra,

 section III.C., the proposed regulations allow utilities an opportunity to seek direct assignment of stranded costs
to the departing wholesale customer. 

We request comment on whether, in lieu of direct assignment, utilities should be able to seek a general surcharge to
all of their transmission customers to cover the costs stranded by a departing customer.

45

 




The Commission does not in this proposed rulemaking address who will bear the stranded costs caused by a departing
customer if the Commission finds that the utility had no reasonable expectation of continuing to serve that customer.
Under the proposed rule, the costs cannot be recovered from the departing customer through transmission rates for
that customer or through a unilateral exit fee amendment in that customer's power sales contract. We anticipate that
in such a case a public utility will seek in subsequent requirements rate cases to have the costs reallocated among
the remaining customers on its system. 
The Commission recognizes that stranded costs can occur when a customer fails to renew its requirements contract
and, instead of obtaining unbundled transmission services from its former requirements supplier, obtains unbundled
transmission services from another utility. We anticipate that in such a case any prudent costs that are stranded
as a result of the customer's departure would be reallocated to remaining customers in the utility's next requirements
rate case. This results in the departing customer bearing none of the costs which it may have caused to be stranded.


We request comments on how the Commission should deal with such costs. 


4. Filing Requirements for Wholesale Stranded Cost Recovery 


The Commission proposes to amend Part 35, Chapter I, Title 18 of the Code of Federal Regulations

 to establish filing requirements for public utilities (as defined in FPA section 201(e)) and transmitting utilities
(as defined in FPA section 3(23)) that seek stranded cost recovery. Our view is that the only circumstance in which
transmitting utilities that are not also public utilities may seek stranded cost recovery from this Commission is
through rates for transmission services under FPA sections 211 and 212. 
The proposed regulations define ``wholesale stranded cost'' as ``any legitimate, prudent and verifiable cost incurred
by a public utility or transmitting utility to provide service to a wholesale requirements customer that subsequently
becomes, in whole or in part, an unbundled transmission customer of such public utility or transmitting utility.''

46

 




The proposed regulations would permit a public utility or transmitting utility to seek recovery of wholesale stranded
costs as follows. First, for stranded costs associated with new wholesale requirements contracts (

i.e.,

 any wholesale requirements contract executed after the date that this order is published in the 

Federal Register

), the proposed regulations would allow recovery of stranded costs only if the contract explicitly provides for recovery
of stranded costs. 
Second, for existing wholesale requirements contracts (

i.e.,

 any wholesale requirements contract executed on or before the date that this order is published in the 

Federal Register

), the proposed regulations would specify that a utility may not recover stranded costs associated with such contract
if recovery is explicitly prohibited by the contract (including associated settlements) or by any power sales or
transmission tariff on file with the Commission.

<TEXT>
 

Third, for existing wholesale requirements contracts that do not address stranded costs through exit fee or other
explicit stranded cost provisions, the proposed rule would allow a public utility to seek recovery of stranded costs
only if: (1) The existing contract contains a specific provision allowing recovery of stranded costs; or (2) the parties
to the existing contract renegotiate the contract in accordance with this rule and file an amendment dealing with
stranded costs prior to the expiration of the three-year transition period; or (3) if the parties to the existing contract
do not renegotiate a stranded cost amendment, the selling utility unilaterally files, no later than the end of the
transition period, a proposed stranded cost amendment to the parties' existing contract; or (4) if the parties to
the existing contract do not renegotiate an amendment, the public utility files a request to recover stranded costs
in its transmission rates under FPA sections 205-206, or 211-212, under the limited circumstance described
in section III.C.(3) herein. 
Fourth, if the selling utility under an existing wholesale requirements contract is a transmitting utility but not
also a public utility, and the contract does not address stranded costs through an explicit exit fee or other stranded
cost provision, the transmitting utility may file a request to recover stranded costs in transmission rates under
FPA sections 211-212, as described in section III.C.(3) herein. 


5. Evidentiary Demonstration Necessary for Wholesale Stranded Cost Recovery 


In 

Entergy

 and subsequent cases, the Commission provided guidance concerning the evidentiary demonstration that utilities
must make to recover stranded costs in wholesale transmission rates. The Commission believes that this demonstration
is still relevant and appropriate. We therefore propose to apply it to any proposal for extra-contractual recovery
in accordance with this proposed rule.

48

 




The following is the proposed demonstration that a public utility or transmitting utility must satisfy in order to
recover stranded costs in wholesale transmission rates, and that a public utility must satisfy if it proposes a unilateral
amendment to its wholesale requirements contract: 
(1) A utility must show that it incurred stranded costs based on an expectation that was reasonable when the costs were
incurred that the applicable contract would be extended; 
(2) A utility must show that the stranded costs it incurred are not more than the customer would have contributed to
the utility had the customer remained a wholesale requirements customer of the utility; 
(3) A utility must show that it has taken and will take reasonable and prudent measures to mitigate stranded costs.

The question of whether a utility had a reasonable expectation of continuing to serve a customer is a factual matter
that will depend on the evidence produced in each case. Whether the utility's expectation was reasonable will depend
on the circumstances at the time that stranded costs were incurred, including, for instance, whether the customer
at that time had access to alternative suppliers. A utility also must offer evidence that its expectation was based
on the actual conduct or course of dealing of the two parties (the utility and its customer). However, the Commission
does not believe it is in the public interest to have prolonged litigation on these issues. Therefore, we will provide
general guidance as to the type of evidence that would tend to prove or disprove the existence of a reasonable expectation.

When a public utility seeks to include certain types of construction-work-in-progress (CWIP) in rate base for a particular
customer, the utility must use forward-looking cost allocators (estimates of the customer's cost responsibility
when the facility will be in service).

49

 Therefore, the fact that a utility has recovered CWIP from a particular customer (without the customer's objection)
may provide persuasive evidence of a reasonable expectation that it would continue to serve that customer for a certain
term. The Commission is aware, however, that few utilities have taken advantage of the CWIP rule, perhaps because
few utilities have been undertaking major construction projects. 




A reasonable expectation that a contract would be extended could also be shown by communications between supplier
and customer concerning system planning. For example, if a buyer has indicated that the seller should continue to
include the buyer's load in the seller's resource planning beyond the contract term or has indicated to the seller
that it has not taken active steps to secure a new supplier, the seller may have legitimately had a reasonable expectation
of continuing the service, particularly if the parties have routinely extended the contract in the past. 
On the other hand, a utility very likely would have no reasonable expectation that a contract would be extended if the
contract includes a notice of cancellation provision. Therefore, there will be a rebuttable presumption that if
a contract contains a notice provision, the utility had no reasonable expectation of serving the customer beyond
the period provided for in the notice provision. 

The Commission invites comments on all aspects of the evidence necessary to demonstrate a reasonable expectation.
We specifically request comments on our proposal that any notice provision creates a rebuttable presumption of no
reasonable expectation, or whether we should adopt a minimum notice period that would provide a presumption that
the utility had no reasonable expectation of continuing to provide service beyond the notice period, e.g., a five-year
notice period.

The second element described above concerns reasonable compensation for stranded costs. We request comments on
what is reasonable compensation:







(a) Would it be reasonable for the Commission to limit the annual amount of stranded costs that a former requirements
customer must pay to be no more than what the customer would have contributed to the utility's capital (customer revenues
minus variable costs), or would some alternative concept be appropriate? 
(b) Would it be reasonable for the Commission to limit the future time period over which a customer's liability for
stranded costs would be determined? That is, the present value of the customer's liability could be the discounted
value of an annual amount for a limited time period. This total amount could be paid in a lump sum or over any mutually
agreeable period. The limited time period over which the customer's liability is determined could be called the reasonable
compensation period. If so: 
(i) Would the Commission apply the reasonable compensation period to assess the reasonableness of an exit fee in a
revised requirements contract as well as a transmission surcharge? 
(ii) How long should such a time period be, e.g., five years or ten years or some other period; and 
(iii) When should such a period begin, e.g., if five years is a reasonable time over which a customer is liable for stranded
costs, does the five-year period begin when the Commission adopts a final rule or when the utility files for stranded
cost recovery in the future? 
(c) Should the length of a reasonable compensation period be based on what would constitute a reasonable notice period
in requirements contracts or would some other concept be appropriate? 
(d) Establishing a reasonable compensation period effectively would also establish a future date beyond which requirements
customers would no longer have any liability for stranded costs, either as an exit fee in revised requirements contracts
or as a surcharge on transmission rates. Would this be appropriate? In responding, commenters should keep in mind
that the concept of a reasonable time period for computing stranded cost liability is independent of the proposed
three-year recontracting period for which the Commission is also requesting separate comments.





The third element described above concerns mitigation measures. Adequate mitigation measures might include: (1)
Evidence that the utility has tried to market the asset or assets, market the generating capacity, reconfigure or
delay investment in or purchase of new generating capacity, or reform fuel supply contracts that form the basis for
the stranded costs charge, and that such measures to mitigate stranded costs will continue for the entire period for
which the stranded costs charge will be paid; or (2) the utility has given the customer the option to market the generating
capacity or supply of fuel or purchased power that forms the basis for the stranded costs charge in order to afford the
customer an opportunity to lower its stranded costs charge. 
The Commission expects the utility to use its best efforts to market its existing generating capacity as one way of
mitigating costs. The Commission would expect to require revenues generated from sales of the capacity to be credited
against the stranded costs to be recovered through transmission rates to the departing customer. 


The Commission invites comment on the requirement that a utility must demonstrate reasonable measures to mitigate
stranded costs and what such measures may include. 
The Commission also invites comment on how to determine the amount of stranded costs that the departing customer may
be liable to pay.

 In 

Entergy

, the Commission said that stranded costs could be no more than the revenues the departing customer would pay to the
seller over the life of the contract. However, given that parties to requirements contracts are encouraged to include
exit conditions (including notice provisions) in new contracts and renegotiated existing requirements contracts,
it can be argued that stranded cost recovery should be capped at the revenues that the departing customer would pay
after having given notice to the seller that it wishes to end all or some portion of its purchase. The problem then becomes
what is a reasonable notice period, given the needs of sellers to adequately plan supply and the ability of sellers
to find alternative buyers for power not taken by existing buyers. This issue pertains not only to determining stranded
cost recovery in transmission rates but also to determining appropriate stranded cost provisions in new requirements
contracts. 

The Commission invites comments on reasonable notice periods.




6. Recovery of Retail Stranded Costs

As discussed earlier, there are two general ways in which retail stranded costs are likely to occur:
 (1) A retail franchise customer may, through State or local government action, become a wholesale customer who can
then obtain unbundled transmission services in order to reach a new power supplier;
 (2) a retail franchise customer may obtain voluntary unbundled retail transmission services from its existing power
supplier in order to reach a new power supplier, or there may be a State or local action that results in the existing supplier
providing such retail transmission services. 






In the first example (a retail franchise customer becomes an unbundled wholesale power and transmission customer),
the Commission clearly has exclusive jurisdiction under sections 201, 205 and 206, or section 212 of the FPA, over
the rate for the wholesale interstate transmission services
 used by the new wholesale entity in order to reach its new generation supplier. In the second example, in which a retail
franchise customer becomes a retail unbundled transmission customer of its former franchise utility, and a retail
power customer of another utility, we conclude that we also have exclusive jurisdiction over the rates, terms and
conditions for the retail interstate transmission services.
 






(i) Jurisdictional Analysis 



The Commission's jurisdiction over the rates, terms and conditions of transmission in interstate commerce derives
from Congress' power to regulate interstate commerce under the United States Constitution
 and the FPA. When Congress enacted the FPA, it gave the Commission exclusive jurisdiction over the rates, terms and
conditions of transmission in interstate commerce by public utilities. The Supremacy Clause of the Constitution
provides that federal laws enacted pursuant to the powers delegated to the federal government by the United States
Constitution are the supreme law of the land.
 Accordingly, to the extent that retail wheeling involves transmission in interstate commerce by public utilities,
the rates, terms and conditions of such service are subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Commission, and the
rates for such service must be filed with the Commission.
 







Section 201 of the FPA, by its very words, does not limit the Commission's jurisdiction over transmission to transmission
of electric energy in interstate commerce sold at wholesale. 

Subsection 201(b)(1) of the FPA provides:

 


(b)(1) The provisions of this Part shall apply to the transmission of electric energy in interstate commerce and to
the sale of electric energy at wholesale in interstate commerce * * * The Commission shall have jurisdiction
over all facilities for such transmission or sale of electric energy * * *

 


16 U.S.C.  824(b)(1). 



Much of the legislative history of the FPA indicates that Congress intended the Commission's jurisdiction to extend
only to those matters which the 

Attleboro

 decision
 held to be beyond the reach of the States. For instance, the report accompanying the Senate bill states that subsection
(b) ``leaves to the States the authority to fix local rates even in cases where the energy is brought in from another
state.''
 The Senate report also states: 





The rate-making powers of the Commission are confined to those wholesale transactions which the Supreme Court held
in [

Attleboro

] to be beyond the reach of the States. Jurisdiction is asserted also over all interstate transmission lines whether
or not there is sale of the energy carried by those lines. * * *



S. Rep. No. 621, 74th Cong., 1st Sess. 48 (1935). Thus, federal jurisdiction over transmission lines is not dependent
on whether those lines are used to effect a sale, wholesale or otherwise. 



While the provisions of section 201 reserving certain regulatory authority to the States have been interpreted narrowly,
 the courts have construed ``in interstate commerce'' broadly. The term does not turn on whether the contract path
for a particular power or transmission sale crosses state lines, but rather follows the physical flow of electricity.
Because of the highly integrated nature of the electric system, this results in most transmission of electric energy
being ``in interstate commerce.'' 





For example, in 

Jersey Central Power & Light Co.

 v. 

FPC

, 319 U.S. 61 (1943), the Court stated:



It is impossible for us to conclude that this definition [of transmission in interstate commerce] means less than
it says and applies only to the energy at the instant it crosses the state line and so only to the facilities which cross
the line and only to the company which owns the facilities that cross the line.

 


319 U.S. at 71. Thus, a critical question regarding the jurisdictional status of a wheeling transaction is whether
the facilities used to provide the service transmit electric energy in interstate commerce. 

See also Connecticut Light & Power Co.

 v. 

FPC

, 324 U.S. 515 (1945) (

CL&P

); 

FPC

 v. 

Florida Power & Light Co.

, 404 U.S. 453 (1972). In 

CL&P

, the Court emphasized that whether certain facilities transmit electric energy in interstate commerce is more a
technical than a legal question. The Court stated, ``[f]ederal jurisdiction was to follow the flow of electric energy,
an engineering and scientific, rather than a legalistic or governmental, test.'' 324 U.S. at 529.

<PARENT> FR940711-1-00003 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

In all of the above cases, the Court's decisions turned on whether energy flowed in interstate commerce as a technical
matter. The decisions did not turn on whether the energy flowing in interstate commerce was being sold for resale or
was being sold to an end user. However, under FPA section 201(b), the Commission does not have jurisdiction over facilities
used in local distribution. In 

CL&P

, the Court stated that local distribution facilities are exempt from Commission jurisdiction even if those facilities
``carry no energy except extra-state energy.'' 324 U.S. at 531. The Court rejected the argument that transmission
and local distribution facilities could be distinguished by the proportion or amount of interstate energy that they
carried: 





We do not find that Congress has conditioned the jurisdiction of the Commission upon any particular volume or proportion
of interstate energy involved, and we do not think it would be appropriate to supply such a jurisdictional limitation
by construction. 





324 U.S. at 536. The determination of whether facilities are local distribution facilities remains a factual matter
to be decided in the first instance by the Commission. 

See FPC 

v. 

Southern California Edison Co., 

376 U.S. 205 (1964). 




While the precise demarcation between transmission and local distribution remains unclear, and the Commission
has not yet definitively addressed this issue, there is nothing in the statute, its legislative history, or the case
law to indicate that the Commission's jurisdiction over rates, terms and conditions of transmission in interstate
commerce extends only to wholesale transmission and not retail transmission. 



(ii) Treatment of Retail Costs 



Because the Commission has jurisdiction over the rates, terms and conditions of both wholesale and retail transmission
services in interstate commerce by public utilities, arguably it may allow retail stranded cost recovery in rates
for either wholesale or retail transmission services. There nevertheless may be important legal or policy reasons
to exclude retail stranded costs from transmission rates. As noted earlier, however, the Commission has been presented
only with the question of whether it should permit public utilities to seek recovery in 

wholesale 

transmission rates of stranded investment costs incurred to serve former retail customers (Scenario 2, section
III.A.). The Commission has not been presented with the question of whether it should permit public utilities to seek
recovery in 

retail 

transmission rates of stranded costs incurred to serve the customer when it was a retail customer (Scenario 3, section
III.A.). 


While we believe the Commission has the authority to address retail stranded costs through its jurisdiction over
the rates, terms and conditions of interstate transmission services used by retail or newly-created wholesale customers,
we also believe that the recovery of the costs of transition to competition at the retail level is a matter that should
be addressed by State authorities. This is because retail stranded costs will occur primarily as a result of State
and local decisionmaking regarding retail franchise areas and the creation of new wholesale entities. In particular,
the Commission believes it is incumbent upon states to deal with the consequences of stranded costs that occur as a
result of retail wheeling. Our strong policy preference is that states explicitly address the issue. State and local
decisionmakers have a first-hand understanding of the regulatory bargain with respect to stranded costs incurred
to serve retail customers, and they are familiar with the planning, investment and purchase activities of the utilities
they regulate. 


There are a number of procedural mechanisms which we believe States can use to address retail stranded costs. For example,
a State that permits a retail franchise customer to become a wholesale entity may consider whether to impose an exit
fee prior to, or as a condition of, creating the wholesale entity. Similarly, a State may consider whether to require
payment of an exit fee prior to a franchise customer being permitted to obtain unbundled retail wheeling. In situations
in which local distribution facilities are used by a retail wheeling customer, the State may consider whether to allow
recovery of stranded costs through rates for local distribution services. If a State decides not to impose exit fees,
or a surcharge through distribution rates, it may consider whether to allow recovery of stranded costs from remaining
customers. 

In situations in which a new wholesale entity obtains ownership or control of a franchise utility's transmission
or distribution facilities, it is possible that State condemnation proceedings will provide a forum for a utility
to seek recovery of any stranded costs. 

What types of payments, if any, do new municipal utilities make to prior service providers? Do these reimbursements
allow for recovery of stranded generation costs? Is there variation among the States as to the legal ability of local
entities to municipalize? Is there variation among the States as to the payments made by new municipal utilities to
previous suppliers? 

There may, of course, be other mechanisms which States can use to determine whether to allow stranded cost recovery,
and from whom to allow recovery. The Commission solicits comments on what other mechanisms might be used, and whether
these mechanisms are adequate to deal with retail stranded costs. 

While our strong preference is for States to address retail stranded costs in whatever way they deem appropriate,
we are willing to explore whether there are circumstances under which this Commission should consider claims for
recovery of retail stranded costs. We will therefore present two proposed alternatives regarding retail stranded
costs, and seek comment on both. 

However, as noted above, we express no preference in favor of either alternative. 



</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940711-1-00023 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940711-1-00003 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Under the first alternative, the proposed rule provides that if in a specific circumstance an appropriate State authority
explicitly considers and deals with retail stranded costs and there is no conflict within or among State regulatory
bodies regarding a State's disposition of the issue, this Commission will not entertain a request for retail stranded
cost recovery. However, in the absence of a clear expression by an appropriate State authority that it has dealt with
the issue, or in the event of a conflict between States

60

 or among State officials within a single state, the Commission proposes to entertain requests to recover retail stranded
costs. 




Under the second alternative, the proposed rule provides that the Commission will not entertain any request for recovery
of retail stranded costs. Under this proposal, State or local authorities will be the only forum for addressing the
issue. The aforementioned preference for States to address retail stranded costs in whatever way they deem appropriate,
the need for regulatory certainty, and the States' knowledge and expertise regarding utility planning, investment
and purchase activities arguably favors the second alterative. 

However, we solicit comment on whether there should be limited exceptions to the second alternative rule. 

As to both alternatives, the Commission solicits comments on the following questions. 

Are there circumstances under which it is not necessarily appropriate to defer to the States (e.g., where one State
takes an action regarding retail stranded costs which has adverse consequences for another State)? Are there circumstances
under which a State may not have an adequate mechanism for addressing retail stranded costs, and may want the Commission
to provide a forum? 

If a State does not explicitly address stranded costs resulting from an action that allows retail customers to purchase
from a supplier other than the franchised utility, should this Commission entertain requests from the utilities
left with the stranded costs? Beyond silence from the State, are there other factors that the Commission should consider
before accepting requests for retail stranded cost recovery? Specifically, would financial health and possible
adverse impacts on reliability be sufficient reason for Federal action? 

The Commission further solicits comments on the following questions: 

(1) Does the Commission have legal authority to allow retail stranded costs in rates for wholesale transmission services?
Should the Commission do so as a matter of policy? If so, which costs? 

(2) Does the Commission have legal authority to allow retail stranded costs in rates for retail transmission service?
Should the Commission do so as a matter of policy? If so, which costs? 

(3) Does FPA section 212 give the Commission legal authority to allow recovery of retail stranded costs in rates for
wholesale transmission services under FPA section 211? 

(4) Are there legal or policy reasons why in Scenario 2 (p. 15), the Commission should entertain requests for recovery
of retail stranded costs in wholesale transmission rates, but should not entertain requests for recovery of retail
stranded costs in retail transmission rates in Scenario 3 (section III.A.)? 

If the Commission determines that it will entertain requests for recovery of retail stranded costs through rates
for wholesale or retail transmission in interstate commerce, the Commission proposes not to apply the ``reasonable
expectation'' test used for wholesale stranded costs. To apply such a test would require a hearing on whether the franchise
utility had a reasonable expectation, e.g., 

of having its franchise renewed, of municipalization occurring, or of a section 212(h) non-sham wholesale entity
being created by the State or local authority. No such test appears warranted because, in general, there is at the retail
level an obligation to serve which is much stronger than any contractual obligation to serve at the wholesale level.
The regulatory compact that has governed provision of retail service includes an implicit obligation to purchase
concomitant with the utility's obligation to serve. 



The Commission requests comments on whether these assumptions are correct, i.e., is the reasonable expectation
test inapplicable to retail stranded costs? Are there situations, for instance, in which utilities could have expected
municipalization to occur based on an established course of dealing? 

Based on these assumptions, if the Commission determines that it will entertain requests for retail stranded costs,
the proposed regulations for retail stranded costs would require only a showing of the dollar amounts that have been
stranded as a result of the retail customer no longer taking bundled service from the franchise utility's system.
In essence, this results in direct assignment of retail stranded costs to the former franchise customer. The Commission
requests comments on how to determine retail stranded costs as a general matter. Is there a future time when a retail
customer's action of leaving a local franchise no longer has any adverse economic consequences on the franchise utility?
If so, what is an appropriate way to make such a determination?

IV. Regulatory Flexibility Act 


The Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA)

61

 requires that rulemakings contain either a description and analysis of the effect the proposed rule will have on small
entities or a certification that the rule will not have a substantial economic effect on a substantial number of small
entities. Because the entities that would be required to comply with the proposed rule are public utilities and transmitting
utilities that do not fall within the RFA's definition of small entities,

62

 the Commission certifies that this rule will not have a ``significant economic impact on a substantial number of small
entities.'' 





V. Environmental Statement 


Commission regulations require the preparation of an environmental assessment or an environmental impact statement
for any Commission action that may have a significant effect on the human environment.

63

 The Commission has categorically excluded certain actions from this requirement as not having a significant effect
on the human environment.

64

 No environmental consideration is necessary for the promulgation of a rule that involves electric rate filings submitted
by public utilities under sections 205 and 206 of the FPA.

65

 The proposed rule specifies the standards and procedures that public utilities must follow in a rate filing proceeding
in order to seek recovery of stranded costs. Accordingly, no environmental consideration of the proposed rule is
necessary. 






VI. Information Collection Statement 


The Office of Management and Budget's (OMB) regulations

66

 require that OMB approve certain information and recordkeeping requirements imposed by an agency. 




The information collection requirements in the proposed regulations are contained in FERC-516, ``Electric
Rate Filings'' (OMB approval No. 1902-0096). The Commission uses the data collected in this information collection
to carry out its responsibilities under Part II of the FPA. The Commission's Office of Electric Power Regulation uses
the data to review electric rate filings. The data enable the Commission to examine and evaluate the utility's costs
and rate of return. 
The Commission is submitting notification of this proposed rule to OMB. Interested persons may obtain information
on the reporting requirements by contacting the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 941 North Capitol Street,
NE., Washington, DC 20426 [Attention: Michael Miller, Information Services Division, (202) 208-1415]. Comments
on the requirements of the proposed rule can also be sent to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs of OMB
[Attention: Desk Officer for Federal Energy Regulatory Commission]. 


VII. Public Comment Procedures 


The Commission invites comments on the proposed rule from interested persons. An original and 14 copies of written
comments on the proposed rule must be filed with the Commission no later than September 9, 1994. 
The Commission will also permit interested persons to submit reply comments in response to the initial comments filed
in this proceeding. Reply comments should be submitted no later than October 11, 1994. 
In addition, commenters are requested to submit a copy of their comments on a 31/2 inch diskette in ASCII II format.
All comments should be submitted to the Office of the Secretary, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North
Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426, and should refer to Docket No. RM94-7-000. 
All written comments will be placed in the Commission's public files and will be available for inspection in the Commission's
public reference room at 941 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC, 20426, during regular business hours.

 35.26 


Recovery of stranded costs by public utilities and transmitting utilities. 



(a) 

Purpose. 

This section establishes the standards that a public utility or transmitting utility must satisfy in order to recover
stranded costs. 

(b) 

Definitions. 

(1) 

Wholesale stranded cost 

means any legitimate, prudent and verifiable cost incurred by a public utility or a transmitting utility to provide

Wholesale requirements customer 

means a customer for whom a public utility or transmitting utility provides by contract any portion of its bundled
wholesale power requirements. 

(3) 

Wholesale transmission services 

has the same meaning as provided in section 3(24) of the Federal Power Act: the transmission of electric energy sold,
or to be sold, at wholesale in interstate commerce. 

(4) 

Wholesale requirements contract

 means a contract under which a public utility or transmitting utility provides any portion of a customer's bundled
wholesale power requirements. 

(5) 

Retail stranded cost 

means any legitimate, prudent and verifiable cost incurred by a public utility or transmitting utility to provide
service to a retail franchise customer that subsequently becomes, in whole or in part, directly or indirectly, an
unbundled transmission services customer of that public utility or transmitting utility. 

(6) 

Retail transmission services 

means the transmission of electric energy sold, or to be sold, in interstate commerce directly to a retail customer.


(7) 

New contract 

means any contract executed after July 11, 1994. 

(8) 

Existing contract 

means any contract executed on or before July 11, 1994. 

(c) 

Recovery of Wholesale Stranded Costs. 

(1) General requirement. 

A public utility or transmitting utility will be allowed to seek recovery of wholesale stranded costs only as follows:

<TEXT>
 

(i) No public utility or transmitting utility may seek recovery of wholesale stranded costs if such recovery is explicitly
prohibited by a contract or settlement agreement, or by any power sales or transmission rate schedule or tariff. 

(ii) If wholesale stranded costs are associated with a new wholesale requirements contract containing an exit fee
or other explicit stranded cost provision, and the seller under the contract is a public utility, the public utility
may seek recovery of such costs, in accordance with the contract, through rates for electric energy under sections
205-206 of the FPA. The public utility may not seek recovery of such costs through any transmission rate for section
205 or 211 transmission services. 

(iii) If wholesale stranded costs are associated with a new wholesale requirements contract, and the seller under
the contract is a transmitting utility but not also a public utility, the transmitting utility may not seek an order
from the Commission allowing recovery of such costs. 

(iv) If wholesale stranded costs are associated with an existing wholesale requirements contract, if the seller
under such contract is a public utility, and if the contract does not contain an exit fee or other explicit stranded
cost provision, the parties to the contract must make a good faith attempt to negotiate an explicit stranded cost amendment
to the contract by [a date three years from the date a final rule is published in the 

Federal Register

]. If the parties negotiate a proposed amendment, the public utility seller under the contract must file the proposed
amendment under section 205 or 206 of the FPA no later than [the end of the three-year period]. If the parties do not negotiate
an explicit stranded cost amendment, the public utility seller may unilaterally file a proposed stranded cost amendment
no later than [the end of the three-year transition period]. In such case, the customer may propose an alternate amendment.
The filing or proposal of such amendment(s) will not affect any contractual rights the customer may have to continue
taking service beyond [the end of the three-year transition period]. 

(v) If a customer under an existing wholesale requirements contract, prior to [the end of the three-year period],
gives notice pursuant to the contract that it will no longer purchase requirements service under the contract but
will purchase unbundled section 205 or section 211 transmission services from the selling utility in order to reach
a different supplier of electric energy, and the transmission services will commence prior to [the end of the transition
period], a public utility or transmitting utility may file by [the end of the transition period] a proposal to recover
stranded costs in rates for the wholesale transmission services. 

(2) 

Evidentiary Demonstration for Wholesale Stranded Cost Recovery.

 
A public utility or transmitting utility seeking to recover wholesale stranded costs in accordance with paragraphs
(c)(1) (iv) and (v) of this section must demonstrate that:

<TEXT>
 

(i) it incurred stranded costs on behalf of its wholesale requirements customer based on an expectation that was reasonable
when the costs were incurred that the customer's contract would be extended; 

(ii) the stranded costs are not more than the customer would have contributed to the utility had the customer remained
a wholesale requirements customer of the utility; and 

(iii) it has and will take reasonable measures to mitigate stranded costs. 

(3) 

Rebuttable Presumption.

 If a public utility or transmitting utility seeks recovery of wholesale stranded costs associated with an existing
contract, as permitted in paragraph(c)(1) of this section, and the existing contract contains a notice provision,
there will be a rebuttable presumption that the utility had no reasonable expectation of continuing to serve the customer
beyond the term of the notice provision. 

Alternative A: 

(d) 

Recovery of Retail Stranded Costs. 

(1) General requirement. 

A public utility or transmitting utility may seek to recover retail stranded costs through rates for wholesale or
retail transmission services only if: (i) an appropriate State or local regulatory body has not explicitly considered
and addressed retail stranded costs; or (ii) an appropriate State or local regulatory body has explicitly addressed
stranded costs, but there is a conflict within or among State regulatory bodies regarding the State or local authority's
disposition of the issue. 

(2) Evidentiary Demonstration Necessary for Retail Stranded Cost Recovery.

 

A public utility or transmitting utility seeking to recover retail stranded costs must demonstrate that: 

(i) the stranded costs are not more than the customer would have contributed to the utility had the customer remained
a retail customer of the utility; and 

(ii) it has and will take reasonable measures to mitigate stranded costs. 

Alternative B: 

(d) 

Recovery of Retail Stranded Costs.
 
(1) General requirement. 

No public utility or transmitting utility may seek recovery of retail stranded costs from the Commission.

Note:

 The following appendix will not appear in the Code of Federal Regulations.] 



Appendix 



For the ease of those submitting comments, the following is a compendium of the questions contained in the proposed
rule: 



Index of Questions 



1. What categories of costs, in addition to investment costs, should be eligible for stranded cost recovery? How should
stranded costs be allocated to specific customers? 


2. The Commission invites comments on the direct assignment and alternative methods of stranded cost recovery. Would
alternative methods, 

e.g.

, an access charge, give customers reasonable certainty on the scope of their stranded cost obligation more quickly
than a direct assignment approach would, and thus expedite the transition to a more competitive wholesale market?



3. To what extent is there or should there be a regulatory obligation to continue to serve requirements customers beyond
the end of the contract term and the source of any such obligation? Should section 35.15 of the Commission's regulations,
which concerns notice of termination, be deleted in its entirety, or only in certain circumstances (

e.g.

, when the seller provides transmission access on a comparable basis to the seller's own uses of its system)? 

4. What types of contractual provisions (in addition to notice provisions), if any, might demonstrate a sufficient
``meeting of the minds'' between parties so that renegotiation of existing contracts should be barred? Should the
proposed rules regarding existing contracts apply only to contracts between unaffiliated entities? 

5. Should the rebuttable presumption which would apply to contracts containing notice provisions also be applied
to any contract entered into after the date of enactment of the Energy Policy Act, even though such contract does not
contain an exit fee or other explicit stranded cost provision, or a notice provision? 

6. Should there be a transition period during which utilities may renegotiate their existing contracts? Should utilities
or customers with 

Mobile-Sierra

 contracts be able to make unilateral filings or file complaints? Should the Commission make a 

Mobile-Sierra

 public interest finding based on company-specific findings instead of generic industry-wide findings? 

7. What is the appropriate length for a transition period.

8. The Commission requests that utility commenters include in their comments an estimate of the number of power sales
contracts that they would seek to renegotiate to address stranded cost issues. How many of these contracts are silent
on this question? How many have notice provisions, and of what duration? The Commission requests that responding
utilities estimate the amount of stranded costs associated with such contracts, the relationship of the estimated
stranded costs to the utility's total costs or revenues, and the potential cost shift to remaining customers. 


9. Should the limitations on recovery of stranded costs in wholesale transmission rates apply to all utilities, whether
or not they currently have on file transmission tariffs containing stranded cost provisions? 


10. Should stranded cost recovery be different depending on whether transmission service is under section 205 or
211? 


11. In lieu of direct assignment, should utilities be able to seek a general surcharge to all of their transmission
customers to cover the costs stranded by a departing customer? 

12. The Commission recognizes that stranded costs can occur when a customer fails to renew its requirements contract
and, instead of obtaining unbundled transmission service from its former requirements supplier, obtains unbundled
transmission service from another utility. We anticipate that in such a case any prudent costs that are stranded as
a result of the customer's departure would be reallocated to remaining customers in the utility's next requirements
rate case. This results in the departing customer bearing none of the costs which it may have caused to be stranded.
How should the Commission deal with such costs? 


13. The Commission invites comments on all aspects of the evidence necessary to demonstrate a reasonable expectation
of continuing to serve a customer beyond the period provided for in a notice provision. Should there be a rebuttable
presumption that the existence of a notice provision means the utility had no reasonable expectation of serving the
customer beyond the end of that notice period? Should we adopt a minimum notice period that would provide a presumption
that the utility had no reasonable expectation of continuing to provide service beyond the notice period, 

e.g.,

 a five-year notice period? 


14. In seeking stranded cost recovery, a utility must show that the stranded costs it incurred are not more than the
customer would have contributed to the utility had the customer remained a wholesale requirements customer of the
utility. This required evidentiary demonstration concerns the reasonable compensation for stranded costs. We
request comments on what is reasonable compensation: 


(a) Would it be reasonable for the Commission to limit the annual amount of stranded costs that a power customer must
pay to be no more than what the customer would have contributed to the utility's capital (customer revenues minus variable
costs), or would some alternative concept be appropriate? 



</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940711-1-00030 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940711-1-00003 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(b) Would it be reasonable for the Commission to limit the future time period over which a customer's liability for
stranded costs would be determined? That is, the present value of the customer's liability could be the discounted
value of an annual amount for a limited time period. This total amount could be paid in a lump sum or over any mutually
agreeable period. The limited time period over which the customer's liability is determined could be called the reasonable
compensation period. If so: 
(1) Would the Commission apply the reasonable compensation period to assess the reasonableness of an exit fee in a
revised power contract as well as a transmission surcharge? 
(2) How long should such a time period be, 

e.g.,

 five years or ten years or some other period; and 
(3) When should such a period begin, 

e.g.,

 if five years is a reasonable time over which a customer is liable for stranded costs, does the five-year period begin
when the Commission adopts a final rule or when the utility files for stranded cost recovery in the future? 
(c) Should the length of a reasonable compensation period be based on what would constitute a reasonable notice period
in power contracts or would some other concept be appropriate? 
(d) Establishing a reasonable compensation period effectively would also establish a future date beyond which existing
power customers would no longer have any liability for stranded costs, either as an exit fee in revised power contracts
or as a surcharge on transmission rates. Would this be appropriate? In responding, commenters should keep in mind
that the concept of a reasonable time period for computing stranded cost liability is independent of the proposed
three year recontracting period for which the Commission is also requesting separate comments. 

15. Should the Commission require that a public utility demonstrate reasonable measures to mitigate stranded costs?
What should such measures include? 
16. How should the Commission determine the amount of stranded costs that the departing customer may be liable to pay?

17. What are reasonable notice periods for requirements contracts? 
18. What types of payments, if any, do new municipal utilities make to prior service providers? Do these reimbursements
allow for recovery of stranded generation costs? Is there variation among the States as to the legal ability of local
entities to municipalize? Is there variation among the States as to the payments made by new municipal utilities to
previous suppliers? 
19. What mechanisms can States use to allow retail stranded cost recovery? Are these mechanisms 

adequate 

to deal with retail stranded costs?

20. The Commission solicits comments on the two proposed alternatives regarding retail stranded costs. The first
proposed alternative provides that if in a specific circumstance an appropriate State authority explicitly considers
and deals with retail stranded costs and there is no conflict within or among State regulatory bodies regarding a State's
disposition of the issue, this Commission will not entertain a request for retail stranded cost recovery. However,
in the absence of a clear expression by an appropriate State authority that it has dealt with the issue, or in the event
of a conflict between States or among State officials within a single State, the Commission proposes to entertain
requests to recover retail stranded costs. Is this proposal reasonable? Is it preferable to the second alternative
proposal? 
21. Should there be limited exceptions to the second alternative rule? 
22. As to both alternatives, the Commission further solicits comments on the following questions. 

Are there circumstances under which it is not necessarily appropriate to defer to the States (

e.g., 

where one State takes an action regarding retail stranded costs which has adverse consequences for another State)?
Are there circumstances under which a State may not have an adequate mechanism for addressing retail stranded costs,
and may want the Commission to provide a forum? 
If a State does not explicitly address stranded costs resulting from an action that allows retail customers to purchase
from a supplier other than the franchised utility, should this Commission entertain requests from the utilities
left with the stranded costs? Beyond silence from the State, are there other factors that the Commission should consider
before accepting requests for retail stranded cost recovery? Specifically, would financial health and possible
adverse impacts on reliability be sufficient reason for Federal action? 
The Commission further solicits comments on the following questions: 
(1) Does the Commission have legal authority to allow retail stranded costs in rates for wholesale transmission services?
Should the Commission do so as a matter of policy? If so, which costs? 

(2) Does the Commission have legal authority to allow retail stranded costs in rates for retail transmission service?
Should the Commission do so as a matter of policy? If so, which costs? 
(3) Does FPA section 212 give the Commission legal authority to allow recovery of retail stranded costs in rates for
wholesale transmission services under FPA section 211? 
(4) Are there legal or policy reasons why in Scenario 2, the Commission should entertain requests for recovery of retail
stranded costs in wholesale transmission rates, but should not entertain requests for recovery of retail stranded
costs in retail transmission rates in Scenario 3? 
23. Are the Commission's assumptions concerning the reasonable expectations of utilities with respect to retail
customers correct, 

i.e., 

is the reasonable expectation test inapplicable to retail stranded costs? Are there 
situations, for instance, in which utilities could have expected municipalization to occur based on an established
course of dealing? 
24. The Commission requests comments on how to determine retail stranded costs as a general matter. Is there a future
time when a retail customer's action of leaving a local franchise no longer has any adverse economic consequences
on the franchise utility? If so, what is an appropriate way to make such a determination?

<USDEPT>DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR</USDEPT>



<USBUREAU>Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement</USBUREAU>






Maryland Regulatory Program



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSM), Interior.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Proposed rule; public comment period and opportunity for public hearing.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

OSM is announcing receipt of a proposed amendment to the Maryland regulatory program (hereinafter the ``Maryland
program'') under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA). The proposed amendment establishes
minimum engineering design standards to provide the 1.3 minimum static safety factor for a normal pool with steady
state seepage conditions in lieu of engineering tests for small impoundments that are not a safety hazard. The amendment
will provide an optional approach to determine the 1.3 minimum static factor for small, non-hazardous impoundments
not built of or impounding coal mine waste. The amendment is intended to revise the Maryland program to be consistent
with the corresponding Federal regulations.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

I. Background on the Maryland Program



On February 18, 1982, the Secretary of the Interior approved the Maryland program. Background information on the
Maryland program, including the Secretary's findings, the disposition of comments, and the conditions of approval
can be found in the February 18, 1982, 

Federal Register

 (47 FR 7214). Subsequent actions concerning the conditions of approval and program amendments can be found at 30 CFR
920.15 and 920.16.



II. Description of the Proposed Amendment



On June 22, 1993, OSM published a final rule (58 FR 33910) for Maryland program amendment (Administrative Record Numbers
MD-549.00 and MD-539.16) concerning hydrologic balance, ponds and sediment control measures, and civil
penalties. The Director approved the program amendment except for COMAR 08.09.13.24H(3)(c). The intent of proposed
08.09.13.24H(3)(c) was to establish engineering design standards in lieu of engineering tests to ensure a 1.3 minimum
safety factor for small non-hazardous impoundments that are not constructed with or impound coal mine waste and not
subject to the requirements of 30 CFR 77.216(a).

The Director found that COMAR 08.13.09.24H(3)(c) was deficient in two areas. First, the soil strength values used
in the stability analysis defined dry density and optimum moisture content values associated with them but did not
specify the moisture content of the fill material necessary to achieve the required density through compaction.
Secondly, the phreatic surface defined in the analysis did not reflect normal pool conditions under a ``worst case''
scenario.

By letters dated May 16, 1994, and June 23, 1994 (Administrative Record Number MD-569.00), Maryland submitted
a program amendment to satisfy OSM's concerns delineated in the June 22, 1993, final rule. The amendment adds COMAR
08.13.09.24h(1)(q) requiring the material used in the construction of the impoundment to have sufficient moisture
content to achieve proper compaction. The amendment also revises the stability analysis to support COMAR 08.13.09.24H(3)(c)
to represent normal pool conditions under a worst case scenario.



III. Public Comment Procedures



In accordance with the provisions of 30 CFR 732.17(h), OSM is seeking comments on whether the proposed amendment satisfies
the applicable program approval criteria of 30 CFR 732.15. If the amendment is deemed adequate, it will become part
of the Maryland program.

Written comments should be specific, pertain only to the issues proposed in this rulemaking, and include explanations
in support of the commenter's recommendations. Comments received after the time indicated under 

DATES

 or at locations other than the Harrisburg Field Office will not necessarily be considered in the final rulemaking
or included in the Administrative Record. 
 


Public Hearing 
 


Persons wishing to speak at the public hearing should contact the person listed under 

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT 

by 4:00 p.m., [E.D.T.] on July 26, 1994. The location and time of the hearing will be arranged with those persons requesting
the hearing. If no one requests an opportunity to speak at the public hearing, the hearing will not be held. 
 
Filing of a written statement at the time of the hearing is requested as it will greatly assist the transcriber. Submission
of written statements in advance of the hearing will allow OSM officials to prepare adequate responses and appropriate
questions. 
 
The public hearing will continue on the specified date until all persons scheduled to speak have been heard. Persons
in the audience who have not been scheduled to speak, and who wish to do so, will be heard following those who have been
scheduled. The hearing will end after all persons scheduled to speak and persons present in the audience who wish to
speak have been heard. 
 


Public Meeting 
 


If only one person requests an opportunity to speak at a hearing, a public meeting, rather than a public hearing, may
be held. Persons wishing to meet with OSM representatives to discuss the proposed amendment may request a meeting
by contacting the person listed under 

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT. 

All such meetings will be open to the public and, if possible, notices of meetings will be posted at the locations listed
under 

ADDRESSES.

 A written summary of each meeting will be made a part of the Administrative Record. 
 


IV. Procedural Determinations 
 


Executive Order 12866 
 


This rule is exempted from review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under Executive Order 12866 (Regulatory
Planning and Review). 
 


Executive Order 12778 
 


The Department of the Interior has conducted the reviews required by section 2 of Executive Order 12778 (Civil Justice
Reform) and has determined that, to the extent allowed by law, this rule meets the applicable standards of subsections
(a) and (b) of that section. However, these standards are not applicable to the actual language of State regulatory
programs and program amendments since each such program is drafted and promulgated by a specific State, not by OSM.
Under sections 503 and 505 of SMCRA (30 U.S.C. 1253 and 1255) and 30 CFR 730.11, 732.15 and 732.17(h)(10), decisions
on proposed State regulatory programs and program amendments submitted by the States must be based solely on a determination
of whether the submittal is consistent with SMCRA and its implementing Federal regulations and whether the other
requirements of 30 CFR Parts 730, 731, and 732 have been met. 
 


National Environmental Policy Act 
 


No environmental impact statement is required for this rule since section 702(d) of SMCRA [30 U.S.C. 1292(d)] provides
that agency decisions on proposed State regulatory program provisions do not constitute major Federal actions within
the meaning of section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act (42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)). 
 


Paperwork Reduction Act 
 


This rule does not contain information collection requirements that require approval by OMB under the Paperwork
Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3507 

et seq.

). 
 


Regulatory Flexibility Act 
 


The Department of the Interior has determined that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq.

). The State submittal which is the subject of this rule is based upon corresponding Federal regulations for which
an economic analysis was prepared and certification made that such regulations would not have a significant economic
effect upon a substantial number of small entities. Accordingly, this rule will ensure that existing requirements
previously promulgated by OSM will be implemented by the State. In making the determination as to whether this rule
would have a significant economic impact, the Department relied upon the data and assumptions for the corresponding
Federal regulations.

Safety Zone; Fireworks Display, Westhampton Beach, NY


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Coast Guard, DOT.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of proposed rulemaking.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Coast Guard proposes to establish a safety zone in Moneybogue Bay, around the Marine Towing Company fireworks
barge located approximately in the center of Moneybogue Bay, Westhampton Beach, NY from 9:45 p.m. through 10:45 p.m.
on August 20, 1994. This safety zone is needed to protect the maritime community from possible navigation hazards
associated with a fireworks display. Entry into this zone will be prohibited unless authorized by the Captain of the
Port, Long Island Sound.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
Request for Comments


The Coast Guard encourages interested persons to participate in this rulemaking by submitting written data, views,
or arguments. Persons submitting comments should include their name and address, identify this rulemaking [CGD01
94-072] and the specific section of this proposal to which each comment applies, and give a reason for each comment.
Persons wanting acknowledgment of receipt of comments should enclose a stamped, self-addressed postcard or envelope.
The Coast Guard will consider all comments received during the comment period. It may change this proposal in view
of the comments. The Coast Guard plans no public hearing. Persons may request a public hearing by writing to the Project
Officer at the address under ``ADDRESSES

.'' If it determines that the opportunity for oral presentations will aid this rulemaking, the Coast Guard will hold
a public hearing at a time and place announced by a later notice in the 

Federal Register

.


Drafting Information


The principal persons involved in drafting this document are LCDR T.V. Skuby, Project Officer, Captain of the Port,
Long Island Sound, and LCDR J. Stieb, Project Attorney, First Coast Guard District, Legal Office.


Background and Purpose


On May 26, 1994, the sponsor, Mr. Ronald Feldstein, Westhampton Beach, NY requested that a fireworks display be permitted
in the port of Westhampton Beach in the vicinity of Moneybogue Bay, Westhampton Beach, NY, from 9:45 p.m. through 10:45
p.m. on August 20, 1994. The safety zone will cover all waters of Moneybogue Bay within a 1200 foot radius of the Marine
Towing Company fireworks barge, which will be located approximately in the center of Moneybogue Bay. This zone is
required to protect the maritime community from the dangers and potential hazards to navigation associated with
the fireworks display. Entry into or movement within this zone will be prohibited unless authorized by the Captain
of the Port or his on scene representative. Good cause exists for providing a comment period of less than 60 days. Due
to the date the application was received, only a 30 day comment period can be provided.


Regulatory Evaluation


This proposal is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does not require
an assessment of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that order. It has been exempted from review
by the Office of Management and Budget under that order. It is not significant under the regulatory policies and procedures
of the Department of Transportation (DOT) (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). The Coast Guard expects the economic impact
of this proposal to be so minimal that a full Regulatory Evaluation under paragraph 10e of the regulatory policies
and procedures of DOT is unnecessary.
The Coast Guard expects the economic impact to be minimal due to the limited duration of the fireworks display, the
small size of the safety zone, the low level or nonexistent commercial vessel traffic expected in the area during the
effective time of the zone, and the broadcast of marine safety advisories the day of the event.


Small Entities


Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq.

), the Coast Guard must consider whether this proposal will have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities. ``Small entities'' include independently owned and operated small businesses that are not dominant
in their field and that otherwise qualify as ``small business concerns'' under section 3 of the Small Business Act
(15 U.S.C. 632).
For the reasons addressed in the Regulatory Evaluation above, the Coast Guard certifies under 5 U.S.C. 605(b) that
this proposal, if adopted, will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.


Collection of Information


This proposal contains no collection of information requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501


et seq.

).


Federalism


The Coast Guard has analyzed this proposal in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive
Order 12612 and has determined that this proposal does not raise sufficient federalism implications to warrant the
preparation of a Federalism Assessment.


Environment


The Coast Guard has considered the environmental impact of this proposal and concluded that under section 2.B.2.c.
of Commandant Instruction M16475.1B, it is an action under the Coast Guard's statutory authority to protect public
safety, and thus is categorically excluded from further environmental documentation. A Categorical Exclusion
Determination will be made available in the docket.


List of Subjects in 33 CFR Part 165


Harbors, marine safety, Navigation (water), Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, Security measures, Waterways.

<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Proposed rule; reopening of comment period.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This document reopens the public comment period for the proposed rule published on April 26, 1994. The proposal addressed
the issues EPA is considering in deciding whether to approve, disapprove, or partially approve and partially disapprove
a recommendation by the Ozone Transportation Committee (OTC) that EPA require all State members of the OTC to adopt
an Ozone Transport Commission Low Emission Vehicle program for the entire Ozone Transportation Region. The Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) re-opened Air Docket No. A-94-11 on June 8, 1994. This docket includes the OTC
recommendation and supporting materials as well as comments submitted by interested parties. The docket was reopened
in order to allow interested parties a chance to submit relevant information that might be generated as a result of
the series of the public roundtable meetings being held in the Ozone Transport Region this summer. The docket will
close on July 20, 1994.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Acquisition Regulation: Implementation of Section 3021 
of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Department of Energy (DOE).

 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of proposed rulemaking. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Department of Energy proposes to amend the Department of Energy Acquisition Regulation (DEAR) to establish DOE
policies and procedures for establishing a program to achieve a ten percent goal for awards of prime contracts and
subcontracts for specific types of universities and of small disadvantaged concerns, including women-owned businesses,
in the implementation of section 3021 of the Energy Policy Act of 1992.

III. Public Comment 


A. Public Hearing 
B. Public Comments 


I. Background 


A. Discussion 


Section 3021(a) of Energy Policy Act of 1992 (Pub. L. 102-486) requires that DOE, to the extent practicable,
provide that the obligation of not less than 10 percent of the total combined amounts obligated for contracts and subcontracts
pursuant to competitive procedures be expended with small business concerns owned and controlled by socially and
economically disadvantaged individuals or by women, historically Black colleges and universities, or colleges
and universities having a student body in which more than 20 percent of the students are Hispanic Americans or Native
Americans. 
DOE today proposes to amend the DEAR to establish DOE policies and procedures for implementing section 3021 of the
Energy Policy Act. The proposed amendments would add a new Part 926, Other Socioeconomic Programs, as the primary
regulatory coverage concerning section 3021 requirements. Part 952 would also be amended to add solicitation provisions
and contract clauses needed to effect section 3021 requirements in procurement actions. Finally, Part 970 would
be amended to address the application of section 3021 to DOE management and operating (M&O) contracts. The specific
amendments to the DEAR needed to implement the requirements of section 3021 of the Energy Policy Act are described
below. This rulemaking provides changes to the DEAR that will supersede an earlier internal DOE directive that provided
guidance to DOE employees on the implementation of section 3021. 
The policies implementing the legislation are tailored to achieve the intent of Congress in enacting section 3021,
but they go beyond previous contracting and subcontracting mechanisms which have been used to meet participation
goals for small disadvantaged business DOE contracts and subcontracts. DOE interprets section 3021 of EPACT as requiring
the accomplishment of expanded contracting and subcontracting goals and as providing DOE with the discretion to
find appropriate methods to do this. 
DOE believes that its approach to implementing the requirements of section 3021 is consistent with both the intent
of the Congress in passing the legislation and the long-standing policies of the Government to place a fair proportion
of contracts with small businesses and small disadvantaged business and to offer maximum practicable opportunity
to those organizations to participate as subcontractors. 


B. Section-by-Section Analysis 


The regulations at 48 CFR Part 9 are proposed to be amended to add a new part 926, Other Socioeconomic Programs, consisting
of Subpart 926.70, Implementation of Section 3021 of the Energy Policy Act of 1992.

A section 926.7001 is proposed to state DOE policy, as set forth in section 3021 of the Energy Policy Act, concerning
the award of contracts and subcontracts to organizations meeting the three target group designations. In addition,
this section would establish the primary mechanisms that DOE would use in meeting its Energy Policy Act 10 percent
goal through the competitive procurement process, as follows: 
1. Competitive Energy Policy Act requirements set aside for small disadvantaged businesses, including women-owned
businesses, under the Section 8(a) program; and 
2. Competitive awards that provide an evaluation preference to offerors from among one of the three Energy Policy
Act target groups. 
A section 926.7002 is proposed to establish that the requesting organization has the principal obligation to identify
which procurements are subject to the Energy Policy Act. In that determination, a program office would use as its standard
whether the instant requirement directly satisfies an Energy Policy Act program or requirement. 
A section 926.7003 is proposed to direct the use of DOE Small Business/Labor Surplus Area Set-Aside and 8(a) Program
Review Procedures as a mechanism to ensure that full consideration be given to identifying entities from among the
Energy Policy Act target groups. 
A section 926.7004 is proposed to recognize the statutory change (as set forth in section 3021(b) of the Energy Policy
Act) to the size standard for engineering services under Energy Policy Act procurements. 
A section 926.7005 is proposed to create an evaluation preference to be used in competitive procurements for Energy
Policy Act requirements, where such procurements have not been conducted under Section 8(a) competitive procedures.
The evaluation preference would take the form of an evaluation criterion providing that award shall be made to an entity
from among the Energy Policy Act target groups where such entity is among those under consideration for final selection
and is ranked as essentially equal to the best other proposal.
Also, at section 926.7005 it is proposed to provide consideration of the proposer's subcontracting opportunities
to entities from among the Energy Policy Act target groups as part of the business management proposal evaluation
and, in Energy Policy Act requirements valued at more than $500,000, as part of the evaluation of the Small Business
and Small Business Subcontracting Plan. 
A section 926.7006 is proposed to provide guidance on reporting requirements needed to measure DOE performance in
meeting the 10 percent Energy Policy Act goal. In addition, this section identifies the types of contract awards that
will be counted toward the DOE goal. 
Instructions pertaining to the use of solicitation provisions and contract clauses relating to DOE section 3021
implementation are proposed to be contained in section 926.7007. The text of the solicitation provisions and contract
clauses relating to DOE implementation of section 3021 are provided in Subpart 952.2. 
A solicitation provision is proposed at 952.226-70, entitled Subcontracting goals under section 3021(a)
of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (Pub. L. 102-486), to set out the subcontracting evaluation preference. Most
importantly, the provision requires offerors, that are not one of the three section 3021 target groups, to propose
individual subcontracting goals for each of the three target groups. In addition, the provision explains how the
evaluation preference will be applied. 
A contract clause at 952.226-72 is proposed to be added to facilitate implementation of the subcontracting
program goals and reporting requirements. 
A clause is proposed to be added at section 952.226-73, entitled Energy Policy Act Target Group Certification,
establishing the certification to be used by entities from among the Energy Policy Act target groups to clearly establish
their qualification. 
Use of the clause at FAR 52.219-14 in all awards to entities from among the Energy Policy Act target groups would
place a contractual limitation on the amount of subcontracting that can be used by a minority college or university
or a woman-owned business in performance of a contract for an Energy Policy Act requirement. The limitation, which
restricts subcontracted effort to less than 50 percent of the cost incurred for personnel, mirrors a similar provision
now applied to small disadvantaged business under the Federal acquisition system.

Subpart 970.26 provides guidance on the application of 
section 3021 to M&O contracts which may be used to accomplish DOE responsibilities under the Energy Policy Act.




III. Procedural Requirements 



A. Review Under Executive Order 12866



The Department of Energy has determined that today's regulatory action is not a ``significant regulatory action''
under Executive Order 12866, ``Regulatory Planning and Review,'' (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993). Accordingly, this
action was not subject to review under that Executive Order by the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs of
the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). 



B. Review Under Executive Order 12778



Section 2 of Executive Order 12778 instructs each agency to adhere to certain requirements in promulgating new regulations
and reviewing existing regulations. These requirements, set forth in sections 2(a) and (b)(2), include eliminating
drafting errors and needless ambiguity, drafting the regulations to minimize litigation, providing clear and certain
legal standards for affected conduct, and promoting simplification and burden reduction. Agencies are also instructed
to make every reasonable effort to ensure that the regulation: specifies clearly any preemptive effect, effect on
existing Federal law or regulation, and retroactive effect; describes any administrative proceedings to be available
prior to judicial review and any provisions for the exhaustion of such administrative proceedings; and defines key
terms. This proposed rule would, when adopted as a final rule, have no preemptive effect; will not have any effect on
existing Federal laws; and would only clarify the existing regulations on this subject. The revised clauses would
apply only to contracts which would be awarded after the effective date of the final rule, and, thus, would have no retroactive
effect. Therefore, DOE certifies that this proposed rule meets the requirements of sections 2(a) and (b) of Executive
Order 12778. 



C. Review Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act



This proposed rule was reviewed under the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, Pub. L. 96-354, which requires
preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis for any rule which is likely to have significant economic impact
on a substantial number of small entities. DOE certifies that this rule will not have a significant economic impact
on a substantial number of small entities and, therefore, no regulatory flexibility analysis has been prepared.




D. Review Under the Paperwork Reduction Act



This rule will require only an insignificant addition to the data collection required for the Standard Forms 294 and
295. Accordingly, no OMB clearance is required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501, 

et seq.

). 



E. Review Under Executive Order 12612



Executive Order 12612, 52 FR 41685 (October 30, 1987), requires that regulations, rules, legislation, and any other
policy actions be reviewed for any substantial direct effects on States, on the relationship between the national
government and the States, and in the distribution of power and responsibilities among various levels of government.
If there are sufficient substantial direct effects, then the Executive Order requires preparation of a federalism
assessment to be used in all decisions involved in promulgating and implementing a policy action. 

Today's proposed rule, when finalized, will revise certain policy and procedural requirements. However, DOE has
determined that none of the revisions will have a substantial direct effect on the institutional interests or traditional
functions of States. 



F. Review Under the National Environmental Policy Act



DOE has concluded that this rule falls into a class of actions (categorical exclusion A5) that are categorically excluded
from NEPA review because they would not individually or cumulatively have significant impact on the human environment,
as determined by the Department's regulations (10 CFR Part 1021, Subpart D) implementing the National Environmental
Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321, 4331-4335, 4341-4347 (1976)). Therefore, this rule does not require
an environmental impact statement or an environmental assessment pursuant to NEPA. 



IV. Public Comment 



A. Public Hearing



The Department has concluded that this proposed rule does not involve a substantial issue of fact or law and that the
rule should not have a substantial impact on the nation's economy or large numbers of individuals or businesses. Therefore,
pursuant to Pub. L. 95-91, the DOE Organization Act, and the Administrative Procedures Act (5 U.S.C. 553), the
Department does not plan to hold a public hearing on this proposed rule.

for award. 

(b) 

Subcontracts. 

(1) The contracting officer shall assure that all competitive Energy Policy Act solicitations over the small purchase
threshold contain: 

(i) A solicitation provision providing for consideration, as part of the evaluation of the business management proposal,
of the extent to which the offerors have provided for subcontracting opportunities to entities from among the Energy
Policy Act target groups; and 

(ii) A clause providing for the maximum utilization of entities from among Energy Policy Act target groups in the performance
of Energy Policy Act contracts. 

(2) The contracting officer shall assure that all competitive Energy Policy Act procurements expected to exceed
$500,000 ($1,000,000 for construction) include: 

(i) A solicitation provision providing for consideration of the extent to which the offeror has provided for subcontracting
opportunities to entities from among the Energy Policy Act target groups before award as part of the effort, and

Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards; Air Over Hydraulic Brake Systems



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), Department of Transportation.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM).




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This notice responds to a petition submitted by John Kourik. The notice proposes to amend the requirements in Standard
No. 121, 

Air Brake Systems,

 to include a definition of air-over-hydraulic brake subsystems. The agency believes that this proposed definition
would clarify the classification of vehicles equipped with these subsystems and thus eliminate the need for manufacturers
to request, and the agency to respond to, interpretations about them.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Background



Air-over-hydraulic brake systems typically consist of an air brake system from the treadle valve to an air brake chamber
that provides the mechanical force to actuate a hydraulic-operated master cylinder. In turn, the hydraulic master
cylinder actuates the brake shoes or pads. The air brake chamber unit combined with the hydraulic-operated master
cylinder is called the ``power cluster'' and generally serves as the separating point between the air- and hydraulic-actuated
portions of the air-over-hydraulic brake system.

Air-over-hydraulic brake systems are installed on about one percent of medium and heavy trucks sold in the United
States. This percentage represents about 2,000 vehicles, most of which are Class 6 vehicles with gross vehicle weight
ratings (GVWRs) between 19,501 and 26,000 pounds.

Federal motor vehicle safety standard No. 121, 

Air brake systems, 

currently defines ``air brake system'' to mean



a system that uses air as a medium for transmitting pressure or force from the driver control to the service brake, but
does not include a system that uses compressed air or vacuum only to assist the driver in applying muscular force to
hydraulic or mechanical components. (49 CFR  571.121)



Part 570, 

Vehicle In Use Inspection Standards, 

defines ``Air-over-hydraulic brake system'' to mean





a subsystem of the air brake 

that uses compressed air to transmit a force from the driver control to a hydraulic brake system to actuate the service
brakes. (49 CFR Part 570, emphasis added)



The italic portion of the definition of air-over-hydraulic subsystem explicitly states that an air-over-hydraulic
brake subsystem means a subsystem of the air brake system.


In initially issuing Standard No. 121, NHTSA stated that ``it should be noted that the term `air brake system' as defined
in the standard applies to the brake configuration commonly referred to as `air-over-hydraulic,' in which failure
of either medium can result in complete loss of braking ability.'' (36 FR 3817, February 27, 1971). The agency reiterated
its position that an air-over-hydraulic brake system is subject to Standard No. 121, stating that ``Standard No.
105a [Hydraulic Brake Systems] does not apply to vehicles equipped with `air-over-hydraulic' systems, which remain
within the purview of Standard No. 121* * *.'' (37 FR 17970, September 2, 1972.) Moreover, NHTSA has
issued several interpretations stating that a vehicle equipped with an air-over-hydraulic brake system must comply
with the requirements in Standard No. 121.
NHTSA received a petition from Mr. John Kourik, requesting that the agency amend Standard No. 121 to specify that an
air-over-hydraulic brake subsystem is subject to that Standard. The petitioner stated that such an amendment would
avoid the need for manufacturers to request interpretations about air-over-hydraulic brake systems.
After reviewing the petition, NHTSA has decided to propose amending Standard No. 121 by expanding the current definition
of air brake system to incorporate the definition of air-over-hydraulic brake subsystem. The agency notes that even
though the definition of an air brake system currently includes a description of an air-over-hydraulic subsystem,
it is not explicitly clear on the face of the standard that such a subsystem is classified as an air-braked system and
that a vehicle equipped with such a subsystem would thus have to comply with the requirements in Standard No. 121. NHTSA
believes that it would be appropriate to clarify the classification of air-over-hydraulic brake systems. By amending
the definition of an air brake system to state explicitly that an air-over-hydraulic brake subsystem is classified
as an air brake system, the agency would eliminate the need felt by some manufacturers to request interpretations
regarding the standard's applicability to vehicles equipped with air-over-hydraulic brake subsystems.


Rulemaking Analyses and Notices


1. Executive Order 12866 (Federal Regulation Planning and Review) and DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures


This proposal was not reviewed under E.O. 12866. NHTSA has analyzed this proposal and determined that it is not ``significant''
within the meaning of the Department of Transportation's regulatory policies and procedures. A full regulatory
evaluation is not required because the rule, if adopted, would have no mandatory effects. Instead, the proposal would
only codify a longstanding agency interpretation. Therefore, this rulemaking would not have any cost impacts.


2. Regulatory Flexibility Act


In accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act, NHTSA has evaluated the effects of this action on small entities.
Based upon this evaluation, I certify that the proposed amendment would not have a significant economic impact on
a substantial number of small entities. Vehicle and brake manufacturers typically would not qualify as small entities.
This amendment would affect small businesses, small organizations, and small governmental units to the extent that
these entities purchase vehicles. However, this amendment would have no significant cost impact on vehicles. For
these reasons, vehicle manufacturers, small businesses, small organizations, and small governmental units which
purchase motor vehicles would not be significantly affected by the proposed requirements. Accordingly, no regulatory
flexibility analysis has been prepared.

3. Executive Order 12612 (Federalism)



This action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612,
and it has been determined that the proposed rule would not have sufficient Federalism implications to warrant preparation
of a Federalism Assessment. No State laws would be affected.



4. National Environmental Policy Act



Finally, the agency has considered the environmental implications of this proposed rule in accordance with the National
Environmental Policy Act of 1969 and determined that the proposed rule would not significantly affect the human environment.



Public Comments



Interested persons are invited to submit comments on the proposal. It is requested but not required that 10 copies
be submitted.

All comments must not exceed 15 pages in length. (49 CFR 553.21). Necessary attachments may be appended to these submissions
without regard to the 15-page limit. This limitation is intended to encourage commenters to detail their primary
arguments in a concise fashion.

If a commenter wishes to submit certain information under a claim of confidentiality, three copies of the complete
submission, including purportedly confidential business information, should be submitted to the Chief Counsel,
NHTSA, at the street address given above, and seven copies from which the purportedly confidential information has
been deleted should be submitted to the Docket Section. A request for confidentiality should be accompanied by a cover
letter setting forth the information specified in the agency's confidential business information regulation.
49 CFR part 512.

All comments received before the close of business on the comment closing date indicated above for the proposal will
be considered, and will be available for examination in the docket at the above address both before and after that date.
To the extent possible, comments filed after the closing date will also be considered. Comments received too late
for consideration in regard to the final rule will be considered as suggestions for further rulemaking action. The
NHTSA will continue to file relevant information as it becomes available in the docket after the closing date, and
it is recommended that interested persons continue to examine the docket for new material.

Those persons desiring to be notified upon receipt of their comments in the rules docket should enclose a self-addressed,
stamped postcard in the envelope with their comments. Upon receiving the comments, the docket supervisor will return
the postcard by mail.

Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard; Convex Cross View Mirrors on School Buses



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), DOT. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of proposed rulemaking. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 In response to a petition for rulemaking submitted by the Blue Bird Body Company (Blue Bird), NHTSA has decided to propose
amending Standard No. 111, 

Rearview Mirrors

, with respect to the field-of-view around school buses. Specifically, the agency is proposing to rescind a provision
in the Standard so that certain driving mirrors would no longer be required to provide a field-of-view of the ground
forward of cylinders by the bus's rear wheels to areas directly beneath the mirror surface. The agency is concerned
that the current requirement may compromise safety either by making it more difficult for the driver to use the driving
mirror when the bus is in motion as the result of having a more distorted image from a more convex mirror or by reducing
the driver's direct line of sight as the result of creating a larger blind spot near the bus. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:


I. Previous Agency Rulemakings 


On December 2, 1992, NHTSA published a final rule amending Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard No. 111, 

Rear-View Mirrors

, to ensure that a school bus provides an adequate field-of-view around a stopped school bus, thus reducing the risk
of school buses striking students as the students are approaching the buses in order to board them or as they are leaving
the buses. (57 FR 57015) The final rule requires each school bus to be equipped with two mirror systems on each side of
the bus: (1) ``System A,'' which consists of a flat driving mirror of unit magnification and typically a convex driving
mirror; and (2) ``System B,'' which consists of convex cross view mirrors for spotting students during the loading
and unloading of students. The System A mirror system must provide, among other things, a view of the area of the ground
extending rearward from the area below the mirror surface. The System B convex cross view mirrors must provide, among
other things, a view of the ground that overlaps with the view of the ground provided by System A. System A and System
B mirrors in combination are required to provide the driver with a view of the ground in front of and along both sides
of the bus and extending at least 200 feet rearward from the driving mirror. This final rule took effect on December
2, 1993. 
NHTSA again evaluated the field-of-view requirements for System A mirrors in response to a petition for reconsideration
of the final rule submitted by Ford Motor Company (Ford). (58 FR 60399, November 16, 1993) Ford stated that requiring
System A mirrors to provide a view of the ground immediately beneath them fails to meet the need for safety and may make
impracticable the use of currently designed flat unit magnification mirrors. Ford requested that NHTSA amend the
requirement in Standard No. 111 that System A mirrors provide an extended rearward view of the ground starting from
the area beneath the mirror (S9.2(b)(1), (2)). 
NHTSA decided not to adopt Ford's requested revision, because the agency was concerned that Ford's suggested System
A mirrors might have had blind spots in the area of the ground directly below the driver's mirrors and forward of the
rear edge of the side windows. The agency explained that it is permissible to use a combination of convex and flat mirrors
to meet the System A requirements, and that the convex portion of the mirror system can be used for the view beneath the
System A mirror. 57 FR at 57005. 


II. Blue Bird Petition 


Blue Bird Body Company (Blue Bird) petitioned the agency to amend Standard No. 111 with respect to the field-of-view
requirements for System A mirrors. Blue Bird stated that to comply with the final rule's requirements, either a small
radius of curvature convex mirror or a second convex mirror would have to be attached to the System A mirror. Blue Bird
argued that either approach would be impracticable and inconsistent with motor vehicle safety. According to the
petitioner, a small radius of curvature mirror would provide unreasonably small and distorted images that would
be unsafe for driving, while a second convex mirror would create a larger blind spot for the driver. Blue Bird also stated
that any convex mirror added to a system A mirror should have a radius of curvature of at least 35 inches, since convex
mirrors with low radii of curvature would provide unreasonably small and distorted images thus causing problems
for the school bus driver, while the vehicle is in motion. 
Blue Bird stated that the requirement, as adopted, is inconsistent with previous agency statements about problems
associated with using highly convex mirrors for driving. Blue Bird further stated that none of the discussions in
the NPRM explaining the requirements for System A mirrors implies the need for driving mirrors to see the area directly
below them. Blue Bird requested the agency immediately amend the wording of S9.2(b)(1) and S9.2(b)(2) to require
that System A mirrors provide views of the area of the ground that extend rearward from the test cylinders near the rear
axles to not less than 200 feet measured from the rear surface of the mirrors. As the result of such an amendment, the
System A mirrors would no longer be required to provide a view of the ground between those cylinders and the ground beneath
the mirror. 

On January 13, 1994, agency personnel met with representatives of Blue Bird and Mirror Lite Company, a mirror manufacturer,
to evaluate the field-of-view provided by various mirror configurations on school buses. At that meeting, Blue Bird
stated that the installation and use of a driving mirror with a small radius of curvature may result in unsafe driving
practices since it distorts images, thus making it difficult for a driver to judge the distance between his or her bus
and following vehicles when the driver is attempting to change lanes. Similarly, Blue Bird alleged that, with a small
radius of curvature mirror, other vehicles appear to approach suddenly (

i.e.

, images of oncoming vehicles at the rear of the bus that are very small and difficult to recognize suddenly appear greatly
distorted as the vehicles get closer to the mirror).

Thomas Built Bus, another manufacturer of school buses, has contacted the agency to express its opposition to Blue
Bird's petition. After spending significant amounts of time and money reconfiguring and retesting its buses and
mirrors to comply with the final rule, Thomas Built believes that it would be inappropriate for the agency now to amend
the standard to accommodate a specific school bus or mirror design of another manufacturer. Memoranda memorializing
these contacts have been placed in the docket. 



III. Agency Proposal 



After reviewing the petition, NHTSA has decided to propose amending Standard No. 111 so that System A mirrors would
no longer be required to provide a field-of-view of the ground forward of cylinders by the bus's rear wheels to areas
directly beneath the mirror surface. The agency tentatively believes that the current requirement makes it necessary
for school bus manufacturers to install either a small radius of curvature convex mirror or a second convex mirror.
NHTSA is concerned that the current requirement may compromise safety either by making it more difficult for the driver
to use the driving mirror when the bus is in motion as the result of having a more distorted image from a more convex mirror
or by reducing the driver's direct line of sight as the result of creating a larger blind spot near the bus, based on Blue
Bird's demonstration and other available information. The agency has tentatively concluded that the driveability
problems resulting from requiring System A mirrors to have a view of the ground directly beneath them outweigh the
safety benefits obtained by having a redundant view of this area. Specifically, the agency believes that the proposed
amendment would not adversely affect pedestrian safety because System B mirrors would still be required to have a
view of the ground directly below the System A mirrors, as well as the areas alongside the bus to the rear axles. 


NHTSA did not anticipate that there would be a driveability problem associated with the System A mirror requirements
when it issued the final rule. The requirement that the driving mirrors provide a view of the ground from beneath the
mirror surface to 200 feet rearward was considered necessary because several pedestrian fatalities have occurred
near the front entrance doors and the rear tires. In issuing the final rule, NHTSA was aware that the System B convex
crossview mirror already provides a view of these areas. The agency's intention was to reduce the number of pedestrian
fatalities by providing the school bus driver with the largest field-of-view possible. Redundant views of these
areas seemed logical and the view of the test grid was comprehensive. However, the school buses with complying System
A mirrors were not actually driven as part of the agency evaluation of the new mirror system requirements in connection
with the final rule.

NHTSA requests comments about the potential safety problems discussed in this notice. To what extent does adding
a second convex mirror to a System A mirror increase the blind spot? How significant a safety problem is caused by the
increase in the blind spot? How significant a safety problem is caused by the driver's inability to use the entire mirror
system, particularly with mirrors with a radius of curvature less than 35 inches, while operating a moving bus? If
a manufacturer added a second convex mirror to a System A mirror system, couldn't the driver use the preexisting high
radius of curvature driving mirror? 
As to Blue Bird's request for the agency to ``immediately issue'' its requested change to the Standard, NHTSA has determined
that it cannot legally accommodate Blue Bird's request. The Administrative Procedure Act generally requires an
agency to issue a notice for public comment before issuing a final rule such as a rescission of a requirement. (5 U.S.C
553) There is one narrow exception to this requirement which provides that an agency may forego notice-and-comment
procedures upon a finding that such procedures are ``impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest.''
( 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B)) However, the courts have construed this exception very narrowly, emphasizing that: 



circumstances justifying reliance on this exception are ``indeed rare'' and will be accepted only after the court
has ``examine[d]'' closely proffered rationales justifying the elimination of public procedures. 

Council of Southern Mountains, Inc.

 v. 

Donovan,

 653 F.2d 573 (DC Cir. 1981) citing 

American Federation of Government Employees

 v. 

Block,

 655 F.2d 1153 (DC Cir 1981). 



This case law and previous agency experience indicate that foregoing notice-and-comment is a disfavored approach
to be used only in emergency situations involving great urgency. The agency has determined that the circumstances
surrounding Blue Bird's petition do not rise to this level of urgency. 


Rulemaking Analyses and Notices 


A. Executive Order 12866 and DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures 


This notice was not reviewed under E.Q. 12866, ``Regulatory Planning and Review.'' NHTSA has considered the impact
of this rulemaking action under the Department of Transportation's regulatory policies and procedures. The agency
believes that a full regulatory evaluation is not required because the rule would have only minimal economic impacts.
The proposal, if adopted, would not result in any cost savings or cost increases since to comply, the small radius of
curvature mirrors would be replaced by larger radius of curvature mirrors. 


B. Regulatory Flexibility Act 


NHTSA has also considered the impacts of this notice under the Regulatory Flexibility Act. I hereby certify that this
proposed rule would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. School bus manufacturers
are generally not small businesses within the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. Small governmental units
and small organizations are generally affected by amendments to the Federal motor vehicle safety standards as purchasers
of new school buses. However, any impact on small entities from this action would be minimal since it would make a minimal
change that would not impose additional costs. Accordingly, the agency has determined that preparation of a regulatory
flexibility analysis is unnecessary. 


C. Paperwork Reduction Act 


In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511), NHTSA notes that there are no requirements
for information collection associated with this proposed rule. 


D. National Environmental Policy Act 


NHTSA has also analyzed this proposed rule under the National Environmental Policy Act and determined that it would
not have a significant impact on the human environment. 


E. Executive Order 12612 (Federalism) 


NHTSA has analyzed this proposal in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in E.O. 12612, and has determined
that this proposed rule would not have significant federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism
Assessment. 


F. Civil Justice Reform 


This proposed rule would not have any retroactive effect. Under section 103(d) of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle
Safety Act (Safety Act; 15 U.S.C. 1392(d)), whenever a Federal motor vehicle safety standard is in effect, a State
may not adopt or maintain a safety standard applicable to the same aspect of performance which is not identical to the
Federal standard, except to the extent that the state requirement imposes a higher level of performance and applies
only to vehicles procured for the State's use. Section 105 of the Safety Act (15 U.S.C. 1394) sets forth a procedure
for judicial review of final rules establishing, amending or revoking Federal motor vehicle safety standards. That
section does not require submission of a petition for reconsideration or other administrative proceedings before
parties may file suit in court. 


Submission of Comments 


Interested persons are invited to submit comments on the proposal. It is requested, but not required, that 10 copies
be submitted. 
All comments must not exceed 15 pages in length. (49 CFR 553.21). Necessary attachments may be appended to these submissions
without regard to the 15-page limit. This limitation is intended to encourage commenters to detail their primary
arguments in a concise fashion. 
If a commenter wishes to submit certain information under a claim of confidentiality, three copies of the complete
submission, including purportedly confidential business information, should be submitted to the Chief Counsel,
NHTSA, at the street address given above, and seven copies from which the purportedly confidential information has
been deleted should be submitted to the Docket Section. A request for confidentiality should be accompanied by a cover
letter setting forth the information specified in the agency's confidential business information regulation.
49 CFR part 512. 
All comments received before the close of business on the comment closing date indicated above for the proposal will
be considered, and will be available for examination in the docket at the above address both before and after that date.
To the extent possible, comments filed after the closing date will also be considered. Comments received too late
for consideration in regard to the final rule will be considered as suggestions for further rulemaking action. Comments
on the proposal will be available for inspection in the docket. The NHTSA will continue to file relevant information
as it becomes available in the docket after the closing date, and it is recommended that interested persons continue
to examine the docket for new material. 
Those persons desiring to be notified upon receipt of their comments in the rules docket should enclose a self-addressed,
stamped postcard in the envelope with their comments. Upon receiving the comments, the docket supervisor will return
the postcard by mail.

 Notice of petition findings.


 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) announces 90-day and 12-month findings for a petition to amend the List
of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants. The Service finds that the petitioners have presented substantial
information indicating reclassification of spikedace and loach minnow from threatened to endangered may be warranted.
The Service has previously found that reclassification of spikedace and loach minnow is warranted, but is precluded
by work on other pending listing actions of higher priority on which expeditious progress is being made.

 
</SUMMARY>

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Background 


Section 4(b)(3)(A) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act) (16 U.S.C. 1531 

et seq.

), requires the Service to make a finding on whether a petition to list, delist, or reclassify a species presents substantial
scientific or commercial information to indicate that the petitioned action may be warranted. To the maximum extent
practicable, this finding is to be made within 90 days of receipt of the petition, and notice of the finding is to be published
promptly in the 

Federal Register

. If the finding is positive, the Service is also required to promptly commence a status review of the species involved.
Section 4(b)(3)(B) requires that the Service make a further finding as to whether or not a petition presenting substantial
information in support of listing, delisting, or reclassification of a species is (i) warranted, (ii) not warranted,
or (iii) warranted but precluded by work on other pending listing actions of higher priority on which expeditious
progress is being made. This finding is to be made within 12 months of receipt of the petition. Depending upon the conclusion
of the finding, the Service must promptly publish in the 

Federal Register

 either a notice of the finding or a proposal on the petitioned action.

On September 22, 1993, the Department of the Interior received a petition, dated September 17, 1993, from David Hogan,
Silver City, New Mexico; Peter Galvin, Silver City, New Mexico; the Greater Gila Biodiversity Project, Silver City,
New Mexico; the Southwest Center for Biological Diversity, Phoenix, Arizona; and the Biodiversity Legal Foundation,
Boulder, Colorado. The petitioners requested the Service to reclassify the spikedace (

Meda fulgida

) and loach minnow (

Tiaroga cobitis

), from threatened to endangered. On November 10, 1993, the Service informed the petitioners that their correspondence
had been accepted as a valid petition. 

These 90-day and 12-month findings are based on published and unpublished biological and commercial information,
inter- and intra-agency communications, and communications with experts. All information used in these findings
is on file in the Service's Arizona Ecological Services State Office in Phoenix. 

Spikedace and loach minnow are two small minnows which inhabit isolated stretches of stream in the upper reaches of
the Gila River basin in Arizona and New Mexico (Minckley 1973, Propst 

et al.

 1986, Propst 

et al.

 1988, Propst and Bestgen 1991, Rinne 1991). Their historic range included most of the Gila River basin; however, both
species have undergone dramatic declines since the late 1800's. These declines were due to water developments such
as impoundment, diversion, channelization, and groundwater pumping; to watershed degradation and erosion caused
by activities such as livestock grazing, timber harvest, road building, and recreation; and to effects of the introduction
and spread of nonnative fish species. Both species live in relatively fast flowing water in perennial stream stretches.


Spikedace are presently known only from isolated stretches of the Gila River, Grant and Catron Counties, New Mexico;
Aravaipa Creek, Graham and Pinal Counties, Arizona; Eagle Creek, Greenlee County, Arizona; and the Verde River,
Yavapai County, Arizona. Loach minnow are presently known only from isolated stretches of the Gila River, Grant and
Catron Counties, New Mexico; Aravaipa Creek, Graham and Pinal Counties, Arizona; the East Fork and mainstem White
Rivers, Navajo and Gila Counties, Arizona; the San Francisco and Tularosa Rivers and Dry Blue Creek, Catron County,
New Mexico; and the Blue and San Francisco Rivers and Campbell Blue Creek, Greenlee County, Arizona. 

The spikedace was listed as a threatened species on July 1, 1986, and the loach minnow was listed as a threatened species
on October 28, 1986. Critical habitat was designated for both species on March 8, 1994. A threatened species is defined
by the Act as a species ``which is likely to become an endangered species within the foreseeable future throughout
all or a significant portion of its range.'' An endangered species is defined by the Act as one ``which is in danger of
extinction throughout all or a significant portion of its range.'' 

In 1991, the status of spikedace and loach minnow were reviewed as part of the 5-year review of the status of listed species
as required by section 4(c)(2) of the Act. That review showed that the status of the two species had become more precarious
over the previous five years due to substantial increases in threats. As a result, the Service found that both species
met the requirements for endangered status. The Desert Fishes Recovery Team and the Arizona Game and Fish Department
have recommended reclassification to endangered for both species. 

At the same time that threats to the species are increasing, new genetic information suggests a need to preserve each
of the fragmented populations of spikedace and loach minnow in order to maintain as much genetic diversity in the species
as possible (Tibbets 1992). Four of the five remaining loach minnow populations have been subjected to genetic analyses
and each appears to be distinctive. Genetic analyses on the four remaining spikedace populations indicate that each
of the four populations is quite different, with the Verde River population being most distinct. 



Petition Findings 



After reviewing the petition and all other pertinent information, the Service finds that the petition presents substantial
information to indicate that reclassification to endangered may be warranted for spikedace and loach minnow. A positive
90-day finding generally requires that a status review be conducted on the petitioned species. However, as previously
mentioned, a status review was conducted in 1991, resulting in a finding that endangered status is appropriate, but
that higher-priority listing actions precluded the rulemaking process to reclassify the species. 

Benefits to the spikedace and loach minnow from reclassification to endangered status would include recognition
of the more precarious status of the species and increased penalties for conducting activities prohibited under
section 9 of the Act. However, these benefits would be incremental to the protection under the Act already applied
to these threatened species. This incremental protective increase is of lesser priority than providing protection
to species with no current legal protection under the Act.

After reviewing all available scientific and commercial information on the spikedace and loach minnow and their
status and after consideration of other listing actions and their priorities, the Service finds that the reclassification
of spikedace and loach minnow to endangered is warranted, but is precluded by work on pending listing actions of higher
priority on which expeditious progress is being made.

SUMMARY:

 The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) announces a 90-day finding on a petition to list the plant 

Lathyrus grimesii

 (Grimes vetchling) under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act). The petition was found to present substantial
information indicating the requested action may be warranted. The Service requests information regarding the status
of this species. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Background 



Section 4(b)(3)(A) of the Act (16 U.S.C. 1531 

et seq.

), requires that the Service make a finding on whether a petition to list, delist, or reclassify a species presents
substantial scientific or commercial information indicating that the requested action may be warranted. To the
maximum extent practicable, this finding is to be made within 90 days of the receipt of the petition, and the finding
is to be published promptly in the 

Federal Register

. This finding is based on information contained in the petition and otherwise available to the Service at the time
the finding is made. If the finding is that substantial information was presented, the Service also is required to
promptly commence a review of the status of the species involved, if one has not already been initiated under the Service's
internal candidate assessment process. 

On May 19, 1993, the Service received a petition dated May 10, 1993, from Ms. Mary Pat Matheson, Director of the University
of Utah's Red Butte Garden and Arboretum, to list 

Lathyrus grimesii 

as an endangered species using the emergency provisions of the Act. The Red Butte Arboretum is a Participating Institution
of the Missouri Botanic Garden's Center for Plant Conservation, a network of 20 botanical gardens and arboreta dedicated
to the conservation of rare and endangered plants in the United States. 

A member of the pea family (Fabaceae), 

L. grimesii 

is a prostrate perennial herb. The distribution and habitat of the species are limited. It is an endemic species, known
only from the central portion of the Independence Mountains of Elko County, Nevada. 

Lathyrus grimesii 

is generally restricted to steep, barren slopes with stony-clay talus substrates at high (7,000 to 8,000 foot) elevations.
The species was originally collected in vegetative condition in 1941, but was not recognized as a previously undescribed
species until it was collected in reproductive condition in 1980. The technical description of 

Lathyrus grimesii 

was published in 1989 (Cronquist 

et al. 

1989). 

At the time the petition was submitted, 

L. grimesii 

was known from a 1-square mile area in the Dorsey Creek drainage of the Independence Mountains. More recent information
indicates that the species' distribution is more extensive. Aerial surveys conducted in August 1993 resulted in
new findings north of the Dorsey Creek drainage, in the following drainages and tributaries: Deep Creek, Ott Creek,
Sheep Creek, Frost Creek, and Cap Winn Creek; and in the Bull Run Mountains, located west of the Independence Mountains
(John C. Parks, Independence Mining Company, Elko, Nevada, in litt.). 

Lathyrus grimesii 

is located on appropriate substrates scattered within an area of approximately 50 square miles to the north and northwest
of the Dorsey Creek drainage, and several isolated populations are located outside of this area.

The petition and accompanying documentation state that the species is subject to impacts by proposed mineral exploration
and potential open pit heap leach gold mine development. Mine exploration roads have been constructed through existing
populations. With plants occurring on steep, barren slopes at high elevations, disturbance due to further mining
exploration and potential development could produce long term destabilization and erosion of slope habitat which
would reduce or eliminate populations of 

L. grimesii. 

The toxic effects of open pit heap leach gold mine development also have the potential to further reduce populations.



Lathyrus grimesii 

is not currently protected by any regulatory mechanism, as it is not included on the U.S. Forest Service ``Sensitive''
or State of Nevada ``Critically Endangered'' species lists. The available information suggests that the species'
restricted range and small population size increase the chance of extirpation resulting from stochastic (i.e. random)
or localized events such as rock slides, erosion, disease, toxic effects of contaminant spills, or predation. 
The Service has reviewed the petition and other information available in the Service's files. On the basis of the best
scientific and commercial information available, the Service finds that substantial information has been presented
indicating that listing of 

Lathyrus grimesii 

may be warranted. This species was included as a category 2 candidate for listing in the notice of review published
in the 

Federal Register

 on September 30, 1993 (58 FR 51144). Although a status review of this species was initiated upon its inclusion in category
2, the Service hereby announces its formal review of the species' status pursuant to this 90-day petition finding.
The Service requests any additional data, comments, and suggestions from the public, other concerned governmental
agencies, the scientific community, industry, or any other interested parties concerning the status of 

L. grimesii. 

Of particular interest is information regarding (1) The existence and status of additional populations, (2) environmental
factors determining distribution, (3) pollinators, (4) toxic effects of cyanide on the species, and (5) genetic
variability in known populations.

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) announces 90-day and 12-month findings on a petition to list 83 mollusc
species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act). After careful assessment of the best scientific
and commercial information available regarding the present and future threats facing the petitioned species, the
Service either finds that the petition did not present substantial information indicating that the requested action
may be warranted (90-day finding) or determines that the petitioned action is not warranted at this time (12-month
finding).


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
Background 


Section 4 of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (16 U.S.C. 1533) (Act), requires that the Service make a
finding on whether a petition to list, delist, or reclassify a species presents substantial scientific or commercial
information indicating that the petitioned action may be warranted. The finding is to be based on all information
available to the Service at the time the finding is made. To the maximum extent practicable, this finding is to be made
within 90 days of the receipt of the petition, and the finding is to be published promptly in the 

Federal Register

. If the Service finds that a petition presents substantial information indicating the requested action may be warranted,
then the Service initiates a status review on that species. Section 4 (b)(3)(b) of the Act requires that for any petition
that presents substantial scientific and commercial information, a finding be made within 12 months of the date of
receipt of the petition on whether the petitioned action is (a) not warranted, (b) warranted, or (c) warranted but
precluded from immediate proposal by other pending proposals to list, delist, or reclassify species. Such 12-month
findings are to be published promptly in the 

Federal Register

. 
The Service has made a negative 90-day finding for 75 noncandidate species referenced in a petition to list 83 mollusc
species as threatened or endangered. The Service has made a positive 90-day finding, but not warranted 12-month finding
for the eight category 2 candidate species contained in the petition to list 83 mollusc species as threatened or endangered.
The Service has been assessing the status of these eight species since their designation as category 2 candidates.
Minimal new information was received or available to the Service beyond that used to assign these species to category
2. As a result, the Service determines that the petitioned action is not warranted at this time. These eight species
will be retained in category 2. This notice also serves to announce a negative 90-day finding on a previous petition
to list the giant Columbia River limpet (short-faced lanx) (

Fisherola nuttalli

) as threatened or endangered. 
On August 18, 1993, the Service received a petition from the Oregon Natural Resources Council (ONRC) to list 83 mollusc
species as threatened or endangered. The petition was dated August 16, 1993. The document used to support the petition
was the report ``Mollusc Species of Special Concern within the Range of the Northern Spotted Owl'' (Frest and Johannes
1993) prepared for the President's Proposed Forest Plan. On November 6, 1987 the Service received a petition from
Dr. Peter Bowler of Laguna Beach, California, to list the giant Columbia River limpet as endangered. The giant Columbia
River limpet, or short-faced lanx, was one of the species included in the ONRC petition and was evaluated along with
the other petitioned species.

The petition involves 36 land snails, 7 slugs, 37 freshwater snails, and 3 freshwater clams. The species are found
primarily in the states of Washington, Oregon, California, and Idaho. Most of these species are associated with late-successional
forests or riparian areas. 
The Service's finding is based on information in the petition, references in the petition, Service files, and consultations
with malacologists, Service, and other Federal and State personnel. All documents are on file in the Service's Regional
Office in Portland, Oregon. 
Adequate rangewide surveys have not been completed for any of the species, except for the Trinity bristlesnail (

Monadenia setosa

) (a category 2 candidate). The Service also lacks evidence of specific threats throughout the ranges of any of the
petitioned taxa, especially any threat associated with a population decline. Many of the species covered by this
petition may be sensitive to ecological perturbations resulting from the impacts of human activities. However,
information was not presented to show correlations between the species' ecological sensitivity and any declines
in population numbers. The taxonomic distinctiveness or validity of many of the species has not been determined.


The Service encourages all interested parties to investigate the population status of and threats to all the species
considered in this petition. The Service also encourages all interested parties to submit information that may provide
additional specific information on the status of these species or specific threats to their survival. 

The petition has been reviewed by staff at the Regional Office in Portland, Oregon. The Service finds that the listing
of the eight category 2 candidates (Dalles sideband (

Monadenia fidelis minor

), rocky coast sideband (

Monadenia fidelis pronotis

), Trinity bristlesnail, Shasta sideband (

Monadenia troglodytes

Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants; Notice of Six-Month Extension and Reopening of Public Comment Period
on the Proposed Rule To List the Northern Copperbelly Water Snake (Nerodia Erythrogaster Neglecta) as a Threatened
Species



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Fish and Wildlife Service, Interior.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of extension and reopening of comment period on proposed rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) gives notice that the deadline to determine whether the northern copperbelly
water snake (

Nerodia erythrogaster neglecta

) is a threatened species is being extended to allow time for additional field surveys and data analysis. This species
now persists in isolated populations in southern Michigan and adjacent Indiana and Ohio, as well as southern Indiana,
southeastern Illinois, and adjacent Kentucky. It occurs in lowland swamps and adjacent woodland and upland areas.
During prior comment periods, new questions were raised by herpetologists and State conservation departments as
to the merits of including intergrades in the listing and the sufficiency of information on the boundaries between
intergrade and pure populations. The comment period on the proposal is reopened.

 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
Background 


The northern copperbelly water snake was proposed for listing as a threatened species due to strong evidence that
its range and numbers have declined dramatically, primarily as a result of the destruction of its habitat, and that
the threats to the habitat and to the snakes are continuing. 
The 

Federal Register

 notice proposing the northern copperbelly water 
snake for classification as a threatened species was published on August 18, 1993 (58 FR 43860). During the subsequent
comment period, the Service received several letters from herpetologists and State conservation departments regarding
intergradation between 

N. e. neglecta 

and 

N. e. flavigaster 

(yellow-bellied water snake). The latter subspecies occurs in southwestern Illinois and in the western portions
of Kentucky and Tennessee, and also is widespread in the Gulf Coast States and the southern Atlantic Coast States.

Where the ranges of the two subspecies come into contact there are numerous individuals having characteristics intermediate
between the two subspecies. These individuals are referred to as intergrades. There are also localized populations
which are largely composed of intergrades known as intergrade populations. 
Some of the concerns that were expressed during the comment period dealt with two inter-related issues: (1) the merits
of including intergrade populations and/or intergrade individuals in the listing and thus giving them protection
as threatened, and (2) the insufficiency of currently available information on the locations of boundaries between
intergrade populations and ``pure'' populations of 

N. e. neglecta. 

These concerns are particularly acute in southern Illinois where the Department of Conservation believes that additional
surveys are critical to an adequate understanding of the status of 

N. e. neglecta 

and its relationship to 

N. e. flavigaster. 

Results from these surveys are expected to be placed on review at the Service Office listed in the 

ADDRESSES

 section, when they become available.
