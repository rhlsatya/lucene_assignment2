Special Provision for Frozen Concentrated Orange Juice Under the North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation
Act



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Foreign Agricultural Service, USDA.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of determination of existence of price conditions necessary for imposition of temporary duty on frozen concentrated
orange juice from Mexico.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

Pursuant to Section 309(a) of the North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act (``NAFTA Implementation
Act''), this is a notification that for 5 consecutive business days the daily price for frozen concentrated orange
juice was less than the trigger price.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The NAFTA Implementation Act authorizes the imposition of a temporary duty (snapback) for Mexican frozen concentrated
orange juice when certain conditions exist. Mexican articles falling under subheading 2009.11.00 of the Harmonized
Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTS) are subject to the snapback duty provision.




Under Section 309(a) of the NAFTA Implementation Act, certain price conditions must exist before the United States
can apply a snapback duty on imports of Mexican frozen concentrated orange juice. In addition, such imports must exceed
specified quantities before the snapback duty can be applied. The price conditions exist when for each period of 5
consecutive business days the daily price for frozen concentrated orange juice is less than the trigger price.

For the purpose of this provision, the term ``daily price'' means the daily closing price of the New York Cotton Exchange,
or any successor as determined by the Secretary of Agriculture (the ``Exchange''), for the closest month in which
contracts for frozen concentrated orange juice are being traded on the Exchange. The term ``business day'' means
a day in which contracts for frozen concentrated orange juice are being traded on the Exchange. The term ``trigger
price'' means the average daily closing price of the Exchange for the corresponding month during the previous 5-year
period, excluding the year with the highest average price for the corresponding month and the year with the lowest
average price for the corresponding month.

Price conditions no longer exist when the Secretary determines that for a period of 5 consecutive business days the
daily price for frozen concentrated orange juice has exceeded the trigger price.

Whenever the price conditions are determined to exist or to cease to exist the Secretary is required to immediately
notify the Commissioner of Customs of such determination. Whenever the determination is that the price conditions
exist and the quantity of Mexican articles of frozen concentrated orange juice entered exceeds (1) 264,978,000 liters
(single strength equivalent) in any of calendar years 1994 through 2002, or (2) 340,560,000 liters (single strength
equivalent) in any of calendar years 2003 through 2007, the rate of duty on Mexican articles of frozen concentrated
orange juice that are entered after the date on which the applicable quantity limitation is reached and before the
date of publication in the 

Federal Register

 of the determination that the price conditions have ceased to exist shall be the lower of_(1) the column 1_General
rate of duty in effect for such articles on July 1, 1991; or (2) the column 1_General rate of duty in effect on that day.
For the purpose of this provision, the term ``entered'' means entered or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption
in the customs territory of the United States.




Issued at Washington, DC the 28th day of June, 1994.

<DOCTITLE>Agency Form Under Review by the Office of Management and Budget</DOCTITLE>



DOC has submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for clearance the following proposal for collection
of information under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. chapter 35).



Agency: 

Bureau of the Census.


Title: 

1995 Census Test - Field Verification Operation.


Form Number(s): 

DG-121(ADP), DG-131(ADP).


Agency Approval Number: 

None.


Type of Request: 

New collection.


Burden: 

310 hours.


Number of Respondents: 

6,190.


Avg Hours Per Response: 

3 minutes.


Needs and Uses: 

A critical component in conducting a census is a current and accurate address list of all living quarters. The Census
Bureau will use two primary methods to create and update its address files: precanvass in urban areas (enumerators
systematically canvass census blocks to verify or update addresses on the census address list) and prelist in rural
areas (enumerators systematically canvass census blocks to obtain the physical location address and/or the mailing
address of all structures where people live or could live). In addition to these methods the Census Bureau will receive
additional address update information from outside sources including the United States Postal Service, local governments,
and the ``Be Counted!'' campaign. The added addresses from these outside sources will be field verified to confirm
their existence before being added to the census address list. The 1995 Census Test - Field Verification Operation
will help verify the accuracy and completeness of the Census Bureau's address control file that we will use for the
delivery of census test questionnaires.


Affected Public: 

Individuals or households.


Frequency: 

One time only.


Respondent's Obligation: 

Mandatory.


OMB Desk Officer: 

Maria Gonzalez, (202) 395-7313.

Copies of the above information collection proposal can be obtained by calling or writing Gerald Tach&eacute;, DOC
Forms Clearance Officer, (202) 482-3271, Department of Commerce, room 5312, 14th and Constitution Avenue,
NW, Washington, DC 20230.

Written comments and recommendations for the proposed information collection should be sent to Maria Gonzalez,
OMB Desk Officer, room 3208, New Executive Office Building, Washington, DC 20503.

Notice of Preliminary Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Fresh Garlic From the People's Republic of China



<AGENCY>

 Import Administration, International Trade Administration, Department of Commerce.

Best Information Available 


We have determined, in accordance with section 776(c) of the Act, that the use of best information available (BIA)
is appropriate for sales of the subject merchandise in this investigation. In deciding whether to use BIA, section
776(c) provides that the Department may take into account whether the respondent was able to produce information
requested in a timely manner and in the form required. In this case, exporters of fresh garlic from the PRC did not respond
to our requests for information. 
As outlined in the ``Case History'' section of this notice, the Department made several attempts to obtain information
from a number of sources. We have not received any responses to our questionnaire with which to perform our antidumping
analysis. Consequently, we based our preliminary determination in this investigation on BIA. 
In determining what to use as BIA, the Department follows a two-tiered methodology, whereby the Department normally
assigns lower margins to those respondents who cooperate in an investigation, and margins based on more adverse assumptions
for those respondents who do not cooperate in an investigation. Since the potential respondents in this case have
not cooperated, we assigned a BIA margin based on the most adverse assumptions. 
In this case, BIA is the highest margin contained in the petition (

see Initiation of Antidumping Duty Investigation: Fresh Garlic from the People's Republic of China,

 59 FR 9470, February 28, 1994), and is listed below for all manufacturers, producers and exporters of fresh garlic
in the PRC. 


Critical Circumstances 


Petitioner alleges that ``critical circumstances'' exist with respect to imports of fresh garlic from the PRC. Section
733(e)(1) of the Act provides that there is a reasonable basis to believe or suspect that critical circumstances exist
if: 
(A)(i) There is a history of dumping in the United States or elsewhere of the class or kind of merchandise which is the
subject of the investigation, or 
(ii) The person by whom, or for whose account, the merchandise was imported knew or should have known that the exporter
was selling the merchandise which is the subject of investigation at less than its fair value, and 
(B) There have been massive imports of the class or kind of merchandise which is the subject of the investigation over
a relatively short period. 
Regarding criterion (A) above, we normally consider margins of 25 percent or more as sufficient to impute knowledge
of dumping. Since the preliminary estimated dumping margin for all exporters of fresh garlic in the PRC is in excess
of 25 percent, we can impute knowledge of dumping under section 733(e)(1)(A)(ii) of the Act. 
Regarding criterion (B) above, pursuant to 19 CFR 353.16(f), we generally consider the following factors in determining
whether imports have been massive over a short period of time: (1) the volume and value of the imports; (2) seasonal
trends (if applicable); and (3) the share of domestic consumption accounted for by the imports. If imports during
the period immediately following the petition increase by 15 percent over imports during a comparable period immediately
preceding the filing of a petition, we consider them massive. Respondents have failed to respond to the Department's
questionnaire, as well as to our request for monthly export data. As a result, the Department has assumed, as BIA, that
there have been massive imports over a relatively short period of time. 
Accordingly, because the dumping margin is sufficient to impute knowledge of dumping, and because we have determined
that imports of fresh garlic have been massive, we preliminarily determine that critical circumstances do exist
in this investigation. 


Suspension of Liquidation 


In accordance with section 733(d)(1) of the Act, we are directing the Customs Service to suspend liquidation of all
entries of fresh garlic from the PRC, as defined in the ``Scope of Investigation'' section of this notice, that are
entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after the date 90 days before the date of publication of
this notice in the 

Federal Register

. The Customs Service shall require a cash deposit or posting of a bond equal to the estimated margin amount by which
the foreign market value of the subject merchandise exceeds the United States price as shown below. The suspension
of liquidation will remain in effect until further notice. 




 

ITC Notification 


In accordance with section 733(f) of the Act, we have notified the ITC of this determination. 


Public Comment 


In accordance with 19 CFR 353.38, case briefs or other written comments in at least ten copies must be submitted to the
Assistant Secretary for Import Administration by no later than August 26, 1994, and rebuttal briefs by no later that
September 2, 1994. In accordance with 19 CFR 353.38(b), we will hold a public hearing, if requested, to give interested
parties an opportunity to comment on arguments raised in case or rebuttal briefs. Tentatively, the hearing will be
held on September 7, 1994, at 10:00 a.m. at the U.S. Department of Commerce, Room 3708, 14th Street and Constitution
Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20230. Parties should confirm by telephone, the time, date, and place of the hearing 48
hours before the scheduled time. 
Interested parties who wish to request a hearing must submit a written request to the Assistant Secretary for Import
Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, Room B-099, within ten days of the publication of this notice
in the 

Federal Register

. Requests should contain: (1) the party's name, address, and telephone number; (2) the number of participants; and
(3) a list of the issues to be discussed. In accordance with 19 CFR 353.38(b), oral presentations will be limited to
issues raised in the briefs. 
This notice is published pursuant to section 733(f) of the Act (19 U.S.C. 1673b(f)) and 19 CFR 353.15(a)(4).

<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Commerce.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice; Request for comments.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This proposed revision of Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 21-3, COBOL, which adopts ANSI X3.23-1985,
and ANSI X3.23a 1989, is being proposed for Federal use. This revision will adopt the forthcoming amendment (ANSI
X3.23b-1993) to American National Standard for COBOL which adds corrections and clarification to the language.
The proposed amendment is upwardly compatible with the current standard except for the reserved word FUNCTION.



Prior to the submission of this proposed revision to FIPS PUB 21-3 to the Secretary of Commerce for review and
approval, it is essential to assure that consideration is given to the needs and views of manufacturers, the public,
and state and local governments. The purpose of this notice is to solicit such views.

This proposed FIPS contains two sections: (1) An announcement section, which provides information concerning the
applicability, implementation, and maintenance of the standard; and (2) a specifications section which deals with
the technical requirements of the standard. Only the announcement section of the standard is provided in this notice.
Interested parties may obtain copies of the specifications (ANSI X3.23-1985, ANSI X3.23a-1989, and
ANSI X3.23b-1993) from American National Standards Institute (ANSI), 11 West 42nd Street, 13th Floor, New
York, NY 10036, (212) 642-4900.

Federal Information Processing Standards Publication 21-4



[proposed]



Announcing the Standard for COBOL



Federal Information Processing Standards Publications (FIPS PUBS) are issued by the National Institute of Standards
and Technology (NIST) after approval by the Secretary of Commerce pursuant to Section 111(d) of the Federal Property
and Administrative Services Act of 1949 as amended by the Computer Security Act of 1987, Public Law 100-235.

1. 

Name of Standard

. COBOL (FIPS PUBS 21-4)

2. 

Category of Standard

. Software Standard, Programming Language.

3. 

Explanation

. This publication announces the adoption of American National Standard COBOL, as specified in ANSI X3.23-1985,
X3.23a-1989 and ANSI X3.23b-1993, as a Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) This revision
supersedes FIPS PUB 21-3 and reflects corrections and clarifications to the COBOL specifications. The American
National Standards define the elements of the COBOL programming language and the rules for their use. The purpose
of the standards is to promote portability of COBOL programs for use on a variety of data processing systems. The standards
are used by implementors as the reference authority in developing processors and by users who need to know the precise
syntactic and semantic rules of the standard language.

8. 

Objectives

. Federal standards for high level programming languages permit Federal departments and agencies to exercise more
effective control over the production, management, and use of the Government's information resources. The primary
objectives of Federal programming language standards are:




_To encourage more effective utilization and management of programmers by insuring that programming skills acquired
on one job are transportable to other jobs, thereby reducing the cost of programmer re-training;

_To reduce the cost of program development by achieving the increased programmer productivity that is inherent in
the use of high level programming languages;

_To reduce the overall software costs by making it easier and less expensive to maintain programs and to transfer programs
among different computer systems, including replacement systems; and

_To protect the existing software assets of the Federal Government by insuring to the maximal feasible extent that
Federal programming language standards are technically sound and that subsequent revisions are compatible with
the installed base.




9. 

Applicability.

a. Federal standards for high level programming languages should be used for computer applications and programs
that are either developed or acquired for government use. FIPS COBOL is one of the high level programming language
standards provided for use by all Federal departments and agencies. FIPS COBOL is especially suited for applications
that emphasize the manipulation of characters, records, files, and input/output (in contrast to those primarily
concerned with scientific and numeric computations).

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940711-2-00009 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940711-2-00005 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

b. The use of FIPS high level programming languages is strongly recommended when one or more of the following situations
exist:



_It is anticipated that the life of the program will be longer than the life of the presently utilized equipment.
_The application or program is under constant review for updating of the specifications, and changes may result frequently.
_The application is being designed and programmed centrally for a decentralized system that employs computers of
different makes, models and configurations.
_The program will or might be run on equipment other than for which the program is initially written.
_The program is to be understood and maintained by programmers other than the original ones.
_The advantages of improved program design, debugging, documentation and intelligibility can be obtained through
the use of this high level language regardless of interchange potential.
_The program is or is likely to be used by organizations outside the Federal Government (i.e., State and local governments,
and others).



c. Nonstandard language features should be used only when the needed operation or function cannot reasonably be implemented
with the standard features alone. Although nonstandard language features can be very useful, it should be recognized
that their use may make the interchange of programs and future conversion to a revised standard or replacement processor
more difficult and costly.
d. It is recognized that programmatic requirements may be more economically and efficiently satisfied through the
use of report generation, database management, or text processing languages. The use of any facility should be considered
in the context of system life, system cost, data integrity, and the potential for data sharing.
e. Programmatic requirements may be also more economically and efficiently satisfied by the use of automatic program
generators. However, if the final output of a program generator is a COBOL source program, then the resulting program
should conform to the conditions and specifications of FIPS COBOL.
f. When it is determined that a programming language that has been adopted as a FIPS is to be used for an application or
program, a processor conforming to the FIPS programming language shall be used, if available. It is not intended that
existing programs be rewritten solely for the purpose of conforming to a FIPS programming language. If a program is
to be part of an existing application written in a programming language not conforming to a FIPS, the language processor
used for the existing application may be used for the new program.
10. Specifications.

 FIPS COBOL specifications are the same as American National Standard COBOL as specified in ANSI X3.23-1985,
ANSI X3.23a-1989 and ANSI X3.23b-1993.
ANSI X3.23-1985, ANSI X3.23a-1989 and ANSI X3.23a-1993 specify the form of a program written in
COBOL, formats for data, and rules for program and data interpretation.
The standards do not specify limits on the size of programs, minimum system requirements, the means of supervisory
control of programs, or the means of transforming programs internally for processing.
In addition, the following requirements apply:
a. For purposes of FIPS COBOL, the modules defined in ANSI X3.23-1985 and ANSI X3.23a-1989 are combined
into three subsets and four optional modules. The three subsets are identified as Minimum, Intermediate, and High.
The four optional modules are Report Writer, Communication, Debug, and Segmentation. These four optional modules
may be associated with any of the subsets.
The high subset is composed of all language elements of the highest level of all required modules. The intermediate
subset is composed of all language elements of level 1 of all required modules except the Intrinsic Function module.
The minimum subset is composed of all language elements of level 1 of the Nucleus, Sequential I-O, and Inter-Program
Communication modules.

The following table reflects the composition of the required subsets and the relationship of the subsets and the optional
modules. The numbers in the table refer to the level within a module as designated in ANSI X3.23-1985 and ANSI
X3.23A-1989, and a dash denotes the corresponding module is omitted or may be omitted.

<TEXT>
 




b. A facility must be available in the processor for the user to optionally specify monitoring of the source program
at compile time. The monitoring may be specified for a FIPS COBOL subset, for any of the optional modules, for all of
the obsolete language elements included in the processor, or for a combination of a FIPS COBOL subset, optional modules,
and all obsolete elements. The monitoring may be specified for any FIPS COBOL subset at or below the highest subset
for which the processor is implemented and for a level of an optional module at or below the level of the optional module
for which the processor is implemented. The monitoring is an analysis of the syntax used in the source program against
the syntax included in the user selected FIPS COBOL subset and optional modules. Any syntax used in the source program
that does not conform to that included in the user selected FIPS COBOL subset and optional modules will be diagnosed
and identified to the user through a message on the source program listing. Any syntax for an obsolete language element
included in the processor and used in the source program will also be diagnosed and identified through a message on
the source program listing. The determination of the need to flag any given source program syntax in accordance with
these requirements cannot be logically resolved until the syntactic correctness of the source program has been established.
The message provided will identify:

_The level indicator, clause, statement or header that directly contains the nonconforming or obsolete syntax.
(For the purpose of this requirement the definitions of level indicator, clause, statement and header contained
in American National Standard COBOL, ANSI X3.23-1985, Section III, Glossary, and the definition of syntax
contained in American National Dictionary for Information Processing Systems, (ANDIS), ANSI X3.172-1990,
apply.)
_The source program line and an indication of the beginning location within the line of the level indicator, clause,
statement or header which contains the nonconforming or obsolete syntax.
_The syntax as ``nonconforming standard'' if the nonconforming syntax is included in the processor but is not within
the user selected FIPS COBOL subset or optional modules unless monitoring is selected for the obsolete category;
in that case obsolete language elements are only flagged as ``obsolete''.
_The syntax as ``nonconforming nonstandard'' if the nonconforming syntax is a nonstandard extension included in
the processor.
_The syntax as ``obsolete'' if the syntax identified is in the obsolete category within a FIPS COBOL subset or optional
module included in the processor.



11. 

Implementation.

 The implementation of FIPS COBOL involves three areas of consideration: acquisition of COBOL processors, interpretation
of FIPS COBOL, and validation of COBOL processors.
11.1 

Acquisition of COBOL Processors.

 This publication is effective [insert a date 90 days after the approval date]. COBOL processors acquired for Federal
use after this date should implement at least one of the required subsets of FIPS COBOL. If the functionality of one
or more of the optional modules meets programmatic requirements, then those optional modules also should be acquired.
Each optional module that is needed to meet programmatic requirements should be explicitly cited as a requirement
in the order for the processor. Conformance to FIPS COBOL should be considered whether COBOL processors are developed
internally, acquired as part of an ADP system procurement, acquired by separate procurement, used under an ADP leasing
arrangement, or specified for use in contracts for programming services.
A transition period provides time for industry to produce COBOL processors conforming to the standard. The transition
period begins on the effective date and continues for one (1) year thereafter. The following apply during the transition
period:
a. The provisions of FIPS PUB 21-3 apply to processors ordered before the effective date but delivered subsequent
to the effective date.
b. The provisions of this publication apply to orders placed after the effective date; however, a processor conforming
to FIPS PUB 21-4, if available, may be acquired for use prior to the effective date. If a conforming processor
is not available, a processor conforming to FIPS PUB 21-3 may be acquired for interim use during the transition
period.
11.2 

Interpretation of FIPS COBOL.

 NIST provides for the resolution of questions regarding FIPS COBOL specifications and requirements, and issues
official interpretations as needed. All questions about the interpretation of FIPS COBOL should be addressed to:
National Institute of Standards and Technology, Attn: COBOL Interpretation, Technology Building, Room B-154,
Gaithersburg, MD 20899.
11.3 

Validation of COBOL Processors.

 NIST provides a service for the purpose of validating the conformance to this standard of processors offered for Federal
procurement. The validation system reports the nature of any deviations that are detected. This service is offered
on a reimbursable basis. Further information about the validation service can be obtained from the Software Standards
Validation Group, COBOL Validation, National Institute of Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, MD 20899 (301)
975-3247.
12. 

Waivers.

 Under certain exceptional circumstances, the heads of Federal departments and agencies may approve waivers to Federal
Information Processing Standards (FIPS). The head of such agency may redelegate such authority only to a senior official
designated pursuant to section 3506(b) of Title 44, United States Code. Waivers shall be granted only when:
a. Compliance with a standard would adversely affect the accomplishment of the mission of an operator of a Federal
computer system, or
b. Cause a major adverse financial impact on the operator which is not offset by Government-wide savings.
Agency heads may act upon a written waiver request containing the information detailed above. Agency heads may also
act without a written waiver request when they determine that conditions for meeting the standard cannot be met. Agency
heads may approve waivers only by a written decision which explains the basis on which the agency head made the required
finding(s). A copy of each such decision, with procurement-sensitive or classified portions clearly identified,
shall be sent to: National Institute of Standards and Technology; ATTN: FIPS Waiver Decisions, Technology Building,
Room B-154; Gaithersburg, MD 20899.
In addition notice of each waiver granted and each delegation of authority to approve waivers shall be sent promptly
to the Committee on Government Operations of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Governmental Affairs
of the Senate and shall be published promptly in the

ACTION: 

Notice; Request for comments.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This proposed revision of Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 119, Ada, will adopt the revised voluntary
industry specifications, American National Standard and the International Organization for Standardization
Reference Manual for the Ada Programming Language, ANSI/ISO/IEC 8652:1994, as a Federal Information Processing
Standard (FIPS). American National Standard and the International Organization for Standardization Reference
Manual for the Ada Programming Language, ANSI/ISO/IEC 8652:1994, specifies the form and meaning of programs written
in Ada. The purpose of the standard is to promote portability of Ada programs for use on a variety of data processing
systems. The standard is for use by implementors as the reference authority in developing compilers, interpreters,
or other forms of high level language processors; and by other computer professionals who need to know the precise
syntactic and semantic rules of the standard.


Prior to the submission of this proposed revision to the Secretary of Commerce for review and approval, it is essential
to assure that consideration is given to the needs and views of manufacturers, the public, and state and local governments.
The purpose of this notice is to solicit such views.
This proposed FIPS contains two sections: (1) An announcement section, which provides information concerning the
applicability, implementation, and maintenance of the standard; and (2) a specifications section which deals with
the technical requirements of the standard. Only the announcement section of the standard is provided in this notice.

Proposed Federal Information Processing Standards Publication 119-1


DRAFT 1994 June 7 DRAFT


Announcing the Standard for Ada



Federal Information Processing Standards Publications (FIPS PUBS) are issued by the National Institute of Standards
and Technology (NIST) after approval by the Secretary of Commerce pursuant to Section 111(d) of the Federal Property
and Administrative Services Act of 1949, as amended by the Computer Security Act of 1987, Public Law 100-235.
1. Name of Standard. Ada (FIPS PUB 119-1).
2. Category of Standard. Software Standard, Programming Language.
3. Explanation. This publication is a revision of FIPS PUB 119 and supersedes that document in its entirety.
This publication announces the adoption of American National Standard and the International Organization for Standardization
Reference Manual for the Ada Programming Language, ANSI/ISO/IEC 8652:1994, as a Federal Information Processing
Standard (FIPS). American National Standard and the International Organization for Standardization Reference
Manual for the Ada Programming Language, ANSI/ISO/IEC 8652:1994, specifies the form and meaning of programs written
in Ada. The purpose of the standard is to promote portability of Ada programs for use on a variety of data processing
systems. The standard is for use by implementors as the reference authority in developing compilers, interpreters,
or other forms of high level language processors; and by other computer professionals who need to know the precise
syntactic and semantic rules of the standard.

8. Objectives. Federal standards for high level programming languages permit Federal departments and agencies
to exercise more effective control over the production, management, and use of the Government's information resources.
The primary objectives of Federal programming language standards are:



_To encourage more effective utilization and management of programmers by insuring that programming skills acquired
on one job are transportable to other jobs, thereby reducing the cost of programmer re-training;
_To reduce the cost of program development by achieving the increased programmer productivity that is inherent in
the use of high level programming languages;
_To reduce the overall software costs by making it easier and less expensive to maintain programs and to transfer programs
among different computer systems, including replacement systems;
_To protect the existing software assets of the Federal Government by insuring to the maximal feasible extent that
Federal programming language standards are technically sound and that subsequent revisions are compatible with
the installed base.



Government-wide attainment of the above objectives depends upon the widespread availability and use of comprehensive
and precise standard language specifications.
9. Applicability.
a. Federal standards for high level programming languages should be used for computer applications that are either
developed or acquired for government use. FIPS Ada is one of the high level programming language standards provided
for use by all Federal departments and agencies. FIPS Ada is suitable for use in programming and any applications for
which there is no specific language available specifically targeted to that application.
b. The use of FIPS Ada is recommended for the following applications and situations:



_Those involving control of real-time or parallel processes.
_Very large systems.
_Systems with requirements for very high reliability.
_Systems which are to be developed with reusable software packages.
_When it is anticipated that the life of an application will be longer than the life of the presently utilized equipment.
_The application or program is under constant review for updating of the specifications, and changes may result frequently.
_The application is being designed and programmed centrally for a decentralized system that employs computers of
different makes, models and configurations.
_The program will or might be run on equipment other than that for which the program is initially written.
_The program is to be understood and maintained by programmers other than the original ones.

<TEXT>
 

_The advantages of improved program design, debugging, documentation and intelligibility can be obtained through
the use of this high level language.

_The program is or is likely to be used by organizations outside the Federal Government (i.e., State and local governments,
and others).




10. Specifications. FIPS Ada specifications are the language specifications contained in American National Standard
and the International Organization for Standardization Reference Manual for the Ada Programming Language, ANSI/ISO/IEC
8652:1994 standard.

The American National Standard and the International Organization for Standardization Reference Manual for the
Ada Programming Language, ANSI/ISO/IEC 8652:1994 standard document specifies the form of a program written in Ada,
the effect of translating and executing a program, predefined library entities that must be supplied, and detection
of compilation and/or link errors.

The standard does not specify limits on the size or complexity of programs, the results when the rules of the standard
fail to establish an interpretation, the means of supervisory control of programs, or the means of transforming programs
for processing.

11. Implementation. The implementation of FIPS Ada involves four areas of consideration: the effective date, acquisition
of Ada processors, interpretation of FIPS Ada, and validation of processors.

11.1 Effective Date. This revised standard becomes effective ninety (90) days after the publication in the


Federal Register

 announcing approval by the Secretary of Commerce. Ada Processors acquired for Federal use after this date should
conform to FIPS PUB 119-1.

A transition period provides time for industry to produce Ada language processors conforming to the standard. The
transition period begins on the effective date and ends March 1, 1997. The provisions of FIPS PUB 119-1 apply
to orders placed after the effective date of this publication. If, during the transition period, a processor conforming
to FIPS PUB 119-1 is not available, a processor conforming to FIPS PUB 119 may be acquired for interim use during
the transition period.

This transition period is intended to give implementations that conform to FIPS PUB 119 time to make the enhancements
necessary to enable conformance to FIPS PUB 119-1. No further transitional period is necessary.

11.2 Acquisition of Ada Processors. Conformance to FIPS Ada should be considered whether Ada processors
are developed internally, acquired as part of an ADP system procurement, acquired by separate procurement, used
under an ADP leasing arrangement, or specified for use in contracts for programming services. Recommended terminology
for procurement of FIPS Ada is contained in the U.S. General Services Administration publication Federal ADP &
Telecommunications Standards Index, Chapter 4 Part 1.

11.3 Interpretation of FIPS Ada. The National Institute of Standards and Technology provides for the resolution
of questions (see FIPS PUB 29-3, Interpretation Procedures for FIPS Software, 29 October 1992) regarding the
specifications and requirements, and issues official interpretations as needed. All questions about the interpretation
of this standard should be addressed to: Director, Computer Systems Laboratory, Attn: FIPS Ada Interpretation,
National Institute of Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, MD 20899, Voice: 301-975-2490, FAX:
301-948-6213, e-mail: dashiell@ecf.ncsl.nist.gov.

11.4 Validation of Ada Processors. Implementations of FIPS Ada shall be validated in accordance with the
NIST Computer Systems Laboratory (CSL) validation procedures for FIPS Ada. Recommended procurement terminology
for validation of FIPS Ada is contained in the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) publication 

Federal ADP & Telecommunications Standards Index

, Chapter 4 Part 2. This GSA publication provides terminology for three validation options: Delayed Validation,
Prior Validation Testing, and Prior Validation. The agency shall select the appropriate validation option and shall
specify whether a Validation Summary Report or Certificate of Validation is required. The agency shall specify appropriate
time frames for validation and correction of nonconformities. The agency is advised to refer to the NIST publication


Validated Products List 

for information about the validation status of Ada products. This information may be used to specify validation time
frames that are not unduly restrictive of competition.

The agency shall specify the criteria used to determine whether a Validation Summary Report (VSR) or Certificate
is applicable to the hardware/software environment of the Ada implementation offered. The criteria for applicability
of a VSR or Certificate should be appropriate to the size and timing of the procurement. A large procurement may require
that the offered version/release of the Ada implementation shall be validated in a specified hardware/software
environment and that the validation shall be conducted with specified hardware/software features or parameter
settings; e.g., the same parameter settings to be used in a performance benchmark.

e-mail: dashiell@ecf.ncsl.nist.gov.
12. Waivers. Under certain exceptional circumstances, the heads of Federal departments and agencies may approve
waivers to Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS). The head of such agency may re-delegate such authority
only to a senior official designated pursuant to section 3506(b) of Title 44, U.S. Code. Waivers shall be granted only
when:
a. Compliance with a standard would adversely affect the accomplishment of the mission of an operator of a Federal
computer system, or
b. Cause a major adverse financial impact on the operator which is not offset by Government wide savings.
Agency heads may act upon a written waiver request containing the information detailed above. Agency heads may also
act without a written waiver request when they determine that conditions for meeting the standard cannot be met. Agency
heads may approve waivers only by a written decision which explains the basis on which the agency head made the required
finding(s). A copy of each such decision, with procurement sensitive classified portions clearly identified, shall
be sent to: National Institute of Standards and Technology, ATTN: FIPS Waiver Decisions, Technology Building, Room
B-154, Gaithersburg, MD 20899.
In addition, notice of each waiver granted and each delegation of authority to approve waivers shall be sent promptly
to the Committee on Government Operations of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Governmental Affairs
of the Senate and shall be published promptly in the 

Federal Register

.
When the determination on a waiver applies to the procurement of equipment and/or services, a notice of the waiver
determination must be published in the Commerce Business Daily as a part of the notice of solicitation for offers of
an acquisition or, if the waiver determination is made after that notice is published, by amendment to such notice.
A copy of the waiver, any supporting documents, the document approving the waiver and any supporting and accompanying
documents, with such deletions as the agency is authorized and decides to make under 5 U.S.C. 552(b), shall be part
of the procurement documentation and retained by the agency.

Proposed Revision of Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 180, Secure Hash Standard


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Commerce.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice; Request for comments.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

A revision of Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 180, Secure Hash Standard (SHS), is being proposed.
This proposed revision corrects a technical flaw that made the standard less secure than had been thought. The algorithm
is still reliable as a security mechanism, but the correction returns the SHS to the original level of security.


The SHS produces a 160-bit output called a message digest for a message of any size. This message digest can be used with
FIPS 186, Digital Signature Standard (DSS), to compute a signature for the message. The same message digest should
be obtained by the verifier of the signature when the received version of the message is used as input to the Secure Hash
Algorithm (SHA). Any change to the message in transmit should produce a different message digest, indicating to the
verifier that a change has been made to the message.
The purpose of this notice is to solicit views from the public, manufacturers, and Federal, state, and local government
users prior to submission of this proposed revision to the Secretary of Commerce for review and approval.
The proposed revision contains two sections: (1) An announcement, which provides information concerning the applicability,
implementation, and maintenance of the standard; and (2) specifications which deal with the technical aspects of
the standard. Only the announcement section of the standard is provided in this notice. Interest parties may obtain
copies of the specifications section from the Standards Processing Coordinator (ADP), National Institute of Standards
and Technology, Technology Building, Room B-64, Gaithersburg, MD 20899, telephone (301) 975-2816.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

NIST has been notified that Department of Defense authorities have approved the use of the SHS with the DSS to sign unclassified
data processed by ``Warner Amendment'' systems (10 U.S.C. 2315 and 44 U.S.C. 3502(2)) as well as classified data in
selected applications.

Proposed Federal Information Processing Standards Publication 180-1



1994 May 31



Announcing the Secure Hash Standard



Federal Information Processing Standards Publications (FIPS PUBS) are issued by the National Institute of Standards
and Technology (NIST) after approval by the Secretary of Commerce pursuant to Section 111(d) of the Federal Property
and Administrative Services Act of 1949 as amended by the Computer Security Act of 1987, Public Law 100-235.

Name of Standard: Secure Hash Standard.

Category of Standard: Computer Security.

Explanation: This Standard specifies a secure hash algorithm, SHA-1, for computing a condensed representation
of a message or a data file. When a message of any length <2

64

 bits is input, the SHA-1 produces a 160-bit output called a message digest. The message digest can then be input
to the Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA) which generates or verifies the signature for the message (see Figure 1).
Signing the message digest rather than the message often improves the efficiency of the process because the message
digest is usually much smaller in size than the message. The same hash algorithm must be used by the verifier of a digital
signature as was used by the creator of the digital signature.

The SHA-1 is called secure because it is computationally infeasible to find a message which corresponds to a
given message digest, or to find two different messages which produce the same message digest. Any change to a message
in transit will, with very high probability, result in a different message digest, and the signature will fail to verify.
SHA-1 is a technical revision of SHA (FIPS 180). A circular left shift operation has been added to the specifications
in section 7, line b, page 9 of FIPS 180 and its equivalent in section 8, line c, page 10 of FIPS 180.* This revision improves
the security provided by this standard. The SHA-1 is based on principles similar to those used by Professor Ronald
L. Rivest of MIT when designing the MD4 message:



*Modification



In Section 7 of [1] (page 9), the line which reads



(b) For t=16 to 79 let W

t

 = W

t-3

 XOR W

t-8

 XOR W

t-14

 XOR W

t-16

.



is to be replaced by



(b) For t=16 to 79 let W

t

 = S

1

(W

t-3

 XOR W

t-8

 XOR W

t-14

 XOR W

t-16

.



where S

1

 is a left circular shift by one bit as defined in Section 3 of [1] (page 6), namely S

1

(X) = (X < <1) v (X > > 31).

Applications: The SHA-1 may be used with the DSA in electronic mail, electronic funds transfer, software distribution,
data storage, and other applications which require data integrity assurance and data origin authentication. The
SHA-1 may also be used whenever it is necessary to generate a condensed version of a message. 

Implementations: The SHA-1 may be implemented in software, firmware, hardware, or any combination thereof.
Only implementations of the SHA-1 that are validated by NIST will be considered as complying with this standard.
Information about the requirements for validating implementations of this standard can be obtained from the National
Institute of Standards and Technology, Computer Systems Laboratory, Attn: SHS Validation, Gaithersburg, MD 20899.


Export Control: Implementations of this standard are subject to Federal Government export controls as specified
in Title 15, Code of Federal Regulations, Parts 768 through 799. Exporters are advised to contact the Department of
Commerce, Bureau of Export Administration for more information. 

Patents: Implementations of the SHA-1 in this standard may be covered by U.S. and foreign patents. 

Implementation Schedule: This standard becomes effective (insert 90 days after approval by the Secretary of Commerce).


Specifications: Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS 180-1) Secure Hash Standard (affixed).


Cross Index: 

a. FIPS PUB 46-1, Data Encryption Standard. 
b. FIPS PUB 73, Guidelines for Security of Computer Applications. 
c. FIPS PUB 140-1, Security Requirements for Cryptographic Modules. 
d. FIPS PUB 186, Digital Signature Standard. 
e. Federal Information Resources Management Regulations (FIRMR) subpart 201.20.303, Standards, and subpart 201.39.1002,
Federal Standards. 

Objectives: The objectives of this standard are to: 
a. Specify the secure hash algorithm required for use with the Digital Signature Standard (FIPS 186) in the generation
and verification of digital signatures; 

b. Specify the secure hash algorithm to be used whenever a secure hash algorithm is required for Federal applications;
and 

c. Encourage the adoption and use of the specified secure hash algorithm by private and commercial organizations.


Qualifications: While it is the intent of this standard to specify a secure hash algorithm, conformance to this standard
does not assure that a particular implementation is secure. The responsible authority in each agency or department
shall assure that an overall implementation provides an acceptable level of security. This standard will be reviewed
every five years in order to assess its adequacy. 

Waiver Procedure: Under certain exceptional circumstances, the heads of Federal departments and agencies may approve
waivers to Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS). The head of such agency may redelegate such authority
only to a senior official designated pursuant to section 3506(b) of Title 44, United States Code. Waiver shall be granted
only when: 

a. Compliance with a standard would adversely affect the accomplishment of the mission of an operator of a Federal
computer system; or 

b. Compliance with a standard would cause a major adverse financial impact on the operator which is not offset by Government-wide
savings. 

Agency heads may act upon a written waiver request containing the information detailed above. Agency heads may also
act without a written waiver request when they determine that conditions for meeting the standing cannot be met. Agency
heads may approve waivers only by a written decision which explains the basis on which the agency head made the required
finding(s). A copy of each decision, with procurement sensitive or classified portions clearly identified, shall
be sent to: National Institute of Standards and Technology; ATTN: FIPS Waiver Decisions, Technology Building, Room
B-154, Gaithersburg, MD 20899. 

In addition, notice of each waiver granted and each delegation of authority to approve waivers shall be sent promptly
to the Committee on Government Operations of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Government Affairs
of the Senate and shall be published promptly in the 

Federal Register

.

When the determination on a waiver applies to the procurement of equipment and/or services, a notice of the waiver
determination must be published in the Commerce Business Daily as part of the notice of solicitation for offers of
an acquisition or, if the waiver determination is made after that notice is published, by amendment to such notice.


A copy of the waiver, any supporting documents, the document approving the waiver and any accompanying documents,
with such deletions as the agency is authorized and decides to make under 5 United States Code Section 552(b), shall
be part of the procurement documentation and retained by the agency. 

Where to Obtain Copies of the Standard: Copies of this publication are for sale by the National Technical Information
Service, U.S. Department of Commerce, Springfield, VA 22161. When ordering, refer to Federal Information Processing
Standards Publication 180-1 (FIPS PUB 180-1), and identify the title. When microfiche is desired, this

National Institute of Standards and Technology, Commerce.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Extension of Time Period for Notice of Prospective Grant of Exclusive Patent License.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

In the Federal Register on January 20, 1994 (59 FR 3072), the National Institute of Standards and Technology (``NIST''),
U.S. Department of Commerce, issued a notice in accordance with 35 U.S.C. 209(c)(1) and 37 CFR 404.7(a)(1)(i) that
NIST was contemplating the grant of an exclusive license in the United States to practice the invention embodied in
U.S. Patent Number 5,295,176, titled ``Method and Apparatus for Precisely Measuring Voltages Applied to X-Ray Sources''
to Radcal Corporation, having a place of Business in Monrovia, California. In the course of negotiations with Radcal
Corporation, additional matters have arisen which may affect the prospective license, and which NIST wishes to bring
to the attention of potential respondents through this notice.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

As announced in the earlier Federal Register notice, the prospective exclusive license will be royalty-bearing
and will comply with the terms and conditions of 35 U.S.C. 209 and 37 CFR 404.7. The prospective exclusive license may
be granted unless, within thirty days from the date of this published notice, NIST receives written evidence and argument
that the grant of the license would not be consistent with the requirements of 35 U.S.C. 209 and 37 CFR 404.7.




NIST now wishes to inform the public that in addition to the above identified license, NIST is willing to enter into
a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (``CRADA'') to perform further research on the invention for the
purposes of commercialization. This CRADA will be conducted by NIST without any additional charge to whatever party
or parties license the patent. Further, NIST is willing to grant to the licensee or licensees an option to negotiate
for royalty-free exclusive licenses for any jointly owned patents which occur under the CRADA which are improvements
on U.S. Patent Number 5,295,176, as well as an option to negotiate for exclusive royalty-bearing licenses for NIST
employee inventions which occur under the CRADA.

U.S. Patent Number 5,295,176 provides a method of precisely measuring the accelerating voltage applied to an x-ray
tube using a simple apparatus with a direct reading taken from a spectrographic image of the radiation produced by
the x-ray tube.

The availability of the invention for licensing was published in the Federal Register, Vol. 58, No. 93 (May 17, 1993).
A copy of the patent may be obtained from NIST at the foregoing address.

In a notice published in the 

Federal Register

 on June 28, 1993 (58 FR 34568), CITA announces that Customs would be conducting other investigations of transshipments
of textiles produced in China and exported to the United States. Based on these investigations, the U.S. Customs Service
has determined that textile products in Categories 339 and 352, produced or manufactured in China and entered into
the United States with the incorrect country of origin, were transshipped in circumvention of the Memorandum of Understanding
dated January 17, 1994 between the Governments of the United States and the People's Republic of China. Consultations
were held between the Governments of the United States and the People's Republic of China on this matter on June 9 through
10, 1994. Accordingly, in the letter published below, the Chairman of CITA directs the Commissioner of Customs to
charge the following amounts to the 1994 quota levels for the categories listed below:








As a result of the charges, the current limit for Category 352 will be filled.

U.S. Customs continues to conduct other investigations of such transshipments of textiles produced in China and
exported to the United States. The charges resulting from these investigations will be published in the 

Federal Register

.

The U.S. Government is taking this action pursuant to the U.S. letters dated July 1, 1994, U.S. diplomatic note, the
Memorandum of Understanding dated January 17, 1994 between the Govenments of the United States and the People's Republic
of China, and in conformity with Paragraph 16 of the Protocol of Extension and Article 8 of the Arrangement Regarding
International Trade in Textiles, done at Geneva on December 20, 1973 and extended on December 14, 1977, December 22,
1981, July 31, 1986, December 9, 1992 and December 9, 1993.

Commissioner of Customs,


Department of the Treasury, Washington, DC 20229.




Dear Commissioner: Under the terms of section 204 of the Agricultural Act of 1956, as amended (7 U.S.C. 1854); pursuant
to the Silk Visa Arrangement, effected by exchange of notes dated June 23, 1994 and June 27, 1994, between the Governments
of the United States and the People's Republic of China; and in accordance with the provisions of Executive Order 11651
of March 3, 1972, as amended, you are directed to prohibit, effective on July 15, 1994, entry into the Customs territory
of the United States (i.e., the 50 states, the District of Columbia and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico) for consumption
and withdrawal from warehouse for consumption of silk apparel products in Categories 733-736, 738-748,
750-752, 758 and 759, produced or manufactured in China and exported from China on and after July 15, 1994 for
which the Government of the People's Republic of China has not issued an appropriate export visa fully described below.
Should additional categories, merged categories or part categories be added to the bilateral agreement or become
subject to import quotas, the entire category(s) or part category(s) shall be included in the coverage of this arrangement
on an agreed effective date. Goods exported during the period July 15, 1994 through August 15, 1994 shall not be denied
entry for lack of a visa. 

A visa must accompany each commercial shipment of the aforementioned textile products. A circular stamped marking
in blue ink will appear on the front of the original export license/commercial invoice or successor document. The
license will be printed on a purple guilloche pattern background. The original visa shall not be stamped on duplicate
copies of the invoice. The original invoice with the original visa stamp will be required to enter the shipment into
the United States. Duplicates of the invoice and/or visa may not be used for this purpose.

Each visa stamp shall include the following information:

1. The visa number. The visa number shall be in the standard nine digit letter format, beginning with one numerical
digit for the last digit of the year of export, followed by the two character alpha country code specified by the International
Organization for Standardization (ISO)(the code for China is ``CN''), and a six digit numerical serial number identifying
the shipment; e.g., 4CN123456.

2. The date of issuance. The date of issuance shall be the day, month and year on which the visa was issued.

3. The signature of the issuing official.

4. The correct category(s), merged category(s), part category(s), quantity(s) and unit(s) of quantity in the shipment
as set forth in the U.S. Department of Commerce Correlation and in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States
(HTS or successor documents) shall be reported in the spaces provided within the visa stamp (e.g., ``Cat. 340-510
DOZ'').

Quantities must be stated in whole numbers. Decimals or fractions will not be accepted. Merged category quota merchandise
may be accompanied by either the appropriate merged category visa or the correct category visa corresponding to the
actual shipment (e.g., Categories 347/348 may be visaed as 347/348 or if the shipment consists solely of 347 merchandise,
the shipment may be visaed as ``Cat. 347,'' but not as ``Cat. 348'').

U.S. Customs shall not permit entry if the shipment does not have a visa, or if the visa number, date of issuance, signature,
category, quantity or units of quantity are missing, incorrect or illegible, or have been crossed out or altered in
any way. If the quantity indicated on the visa is less than that of the shipment, entry shall not be permitted. If the
quantity indicated on the visa is more than that of the shipment, entry shall be permitted and only the amount entered
shall be charged to any applicable quota.

If the visa is not acceptable then a new visa must be obtained from the Government of the People's Republic of China,
replacement visa issued by the Embassy of the People's Republic of China in Washington, D.C., or a visa waiver may be
issued by the Committee for the Implementation of Textile Agreements at the request of the Embassy of the People's
Republic of China in Washington, D.C., and presented to the U.S. Customs Service before any portion of the shipment
will be released. The waiver, if used, only waives the requirement to present a visa with the shipment. It does not waive
the quota requirement.

The replacement visa shall consist of a Textile Export Visa/Invoice form bearing an official Chinese Embassy embossed
stamp on the front and include the standard information required on an export visa and the signature of an official
authorized by the Government of the People's Republic of China to issue replacement visas. The signature must match
one of two original signatures of authorized officials provided to the Government of the United States by the Government
of the People's Republic of China. U.S. Customs shall not permit entry of the shipment if any of the information required
on the replacement visa is missing, incorrect or illegible, or has been crossed out or altered in any way. 

If import quotas are in force, U.S. Customs Service shall charge only the actual quantity in the shipment to the correct
category limit. If a shipment from the People's Republic of China has been allowed entry into the commerce of the United
States with either an incorrect visa or no visa, and redelivery is requested but cannot be made, U.S. Customs shall
charge the shipment to the correct category limit whether or not a replacement visa or visa waiver is provided.

The complete name and address of a company actually involved in the manufacturing process of the textile product covered
by the visa shall be provided on the textile visa document.

Merchandise imported for the personal use of the importer and not for resale, regardless of value, and properly marked
commercial sample shipments valued at U.S.$250 or less, do not require a visa for entry.

The visa stamp remains unchanged.

The actions taken concerning the Government of the People's Republic of China with respect to imports of textiles
and textile products in the foregoing categories have been determined by the Committee for the Implementation of
Textile Agreements to involve foreign affairs functions of the United States. Therefore, these directions to the
Commissioner of Customs, which are necessary for the implementation of such actions, fall within the foreign affairs
exception to the rulemaking provisions of 5 U.S.C. 553(a)(1). This letter will be published in the 

Federal Register

Notice of financial assistance award in response to a non-competitive financial assistance application.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) pursuant to the DOE Financial Assistance Rules, 10 CFR 600.7(b)(2) is announcing
its intention to make a financial assistance award to the International Geothermal Association to organize, convene
and market the World Geothermal Congress 1995, which is to be held in Florence, Italy.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

This proposal was a solicited application. The primary purpose of the World Geothermal Conference (WGC) 1995 is to
provide a forum for international exchange of scientific and technological information on geothermal development
during the period 1990-1995. The International Geothermal Association (IGA) is convening and organizing
the WGC. The Department believes that the proposed effort will benefit the public, and that providing financial assistance
through a grant mechanism is an appropriate method for providing funding. Through this financial assistance the
U.S. Department of Energy will be listed as a sponsor of the WGC. Competition for this effort would have an adverse effect
on the urgency and completion of the activities.



The proposed project will contribute to the DOE mission of ``. . . providing the scientific and educational
foundation and technology . . . necessary to achieve efficiency in energy use, diversity in energy
sources, and access to technical information . . .''. The IGA will do this by providing a forum on an
international scale where the U.S. geothermal industry can exchange scientific and technological information.

The objective of this effort is to convene an international conference where governments and industry can meet and
share scientific and technological information as well as their relevant experiences. The WGC '95 will provide the
forum for presentations of world-wide electrical and direct use, country updates, reports on international cooperative
projects and other invited papers. Pre-congress courses will be taught by experts in the field on subjects such as:
Drafting a Geothermal Project for Financing by International Organizations, Injections, Drilling Technology
and Regulation, Software for Geothermal Applications, Geothermal Heat Pumps, Small Power Plants, Direct Uses and
Environmental Aspects of Geothermal Development.

The probability of meeting the objectives listed above are very high, given that the IGA has been successful in the
past for similar endeavors.

The staff of the International Geothermal Association is qualified and positioned to provide this service. The IGA
is an international association for the geothermal industry. Its membership includes 1,971 organizations and individuals.

The IGA's base of operations is an office in Berkeley, California, and is fully capable of meeting their needs.

The budget proposed for the anticipated work was reviewed and is considered to be appropriate and adequate.

The public benefit to be derived from the World Geothermal Conference is the opportunity for the geothermal industry
to meet and exchange information and experiences, as well as to encourage research, development and use of geothermal
energy world wide.

The services provided through this proposed grant fully support the program's direction and objectives. The International
Geothermal Association is taking the lead role in organizing, convening and marketing the World Geothermal Conference
1995. The IGA is qualified and positioned to undertake this task since they organized the last WGC in New Zealand in
1993. Competition for this effort would have a significant adverse impact on the urgency and completion of the proposed
activities.

the entire geothermal industry. The newly formed industry association will be called the Geothermal Energy Association
(GEA). The Department believes that the proposed effort will benefit the public, and that providing financial assistance
through a grant mechanism is an appropriate method to providing funding. Competition for this effort would have an
adverse effect on continuity and completion of the activities.


The proposed project will contribute to the DOE mission of ``* * * providing the scientific and educational
foundation and technology * * * necessary to achieve efficiency in energy use, diversity in energy
sources, and access to technical information * * *'' (quotation from the Energy Mission Statement).
The National Geothermal Association (NGA) will do this by providing services to support the geothermal industry
through various activities and will work to create a business environment in which the industry can thrive.
Through this financial assistance the NGA (a non-profit organization) will mount an aggressive campaign of information
dissemination, technology transfer and outreach. The objectives for this grant are as follows:
(1) Geothermal Energy Conference_The second annual conference on geothermal energy will be held in the Washington,
D.C. area approximately 1 month after this Agreement is in place.
(2) Geothermal EPACT/Climate-Change Action Group_This group will be comprised of representatives of the geothermal
industry, the utility industry, utility regulators and environmental- and energy-advocacy groups. The purpose
of the group will be to devise initiatives that the geothermal industry and DOE could undertake through cost-sharing
arrangements and that address accelerated use of geothermal resources in the United States, thereby helping to reduce
greenhouse gases.
(3) Utility Outreach Program_The NGA will provide the data and documentation that utilities and utility commissioners
need in order to understand geothermal power generation better and incorporate it into their portfolios.
(4) Develop information on Exporting Goods and Services_Information will be developed that will aid the U.S. geothermal
industry in exporting its goods and services.
(5) Environmental Brochure_A brochure will be developed with the theme ``Geothermal is Clean Air''.
(6) Quarterly Newsletter_A quarterly newsletter on geothermal energy will be published and widely distributed.
(7) Educational Cooperative-Action Alliance_Formation of an alliance to exchange information and coordinate
activities of the various entities in the geothermal community who are producing educational materials.
(8) Washington, D.C. Office_The NGA will maintain an office in the Washington, D.C. area. The purpose of this office
is to develop and maintain the contacts that are necessary for the operation of a domestic as well as an international
export program, to provide educational assistance to various environmental, public interest, and government groups,
and to be able to respond rapidly to problems and opportunities that arise in Washington, D.C. No lobbying activities
will be supported through the funds provided by this grant.)
The probability of meeting the objectives listed above are very high, given that the NGA has been successful in the
past for similar endeavors.
The staff of the National Geothermal Association is qualified and positioned to provide this service. The NGA President
and President elect, respectively, is Tsvi Meidav and Phillip Michael Wright. After the merger of the NGA and GRA into
the Geothermal Energy Association, the Chairman position will be shared jointly by Phillip Michael Wright and David
R. Cox (Chairman of the GRA). David Anderson will serve as the Western Executive Director; he has been the Executive
Director of the NGA since it was established in 1985. These individuals are highly respected throughout the geothermal
industry.
The NGA's base of operation is an office in Davis, California, and is fully capable of meeting their needs.
The budget proposed for the anticipated work was reviewed and is considered to be appropriate and adequate.
The public benefit to be derived from the above mentioned projects and activities are an enhanced awareness of the
benefits of geothermal energy. All of the NGA's proposed activities, projects and efforts are to enhance the competitive
position of the U.S. geothermal industry in the domestic and international energy markets, to develop and conduct
educational programs on geothermal energy and to distribute information. Through this program the NGA will be supporting
the U.S. geothermal industry's efforts to bring more clean, domestic geothermal energy on line.
The services provided through the proposed grant fully support the program's direction and objectives. The National
Geothermal Association is qualified and positioned to perform the above mentioned tasks. The NGA is an accepted and
respected industry association and has about 40 member companies, largely from the geothermal service industries.
The NGA has established an information network which is continually growing. Competition for this effort would have
a significant adverse impact on the accomplishment and completion of the proposed activities.

<DOCTITLE>Columbia Gas Transmission Corp.; Application</DOCTITLE>



July 5, 1994.


Take notice that on July 1, 1994, Columbia Gas Transmission Corporation (Columbia), 1700 MacCorkle Avenue, SE.,
Charleston, West Virginia 25314, filed an application with the Commission in Docket No. CP94-639-000
pursuant to sections 7(b) and 7(c) of the Natural Gas Act (NGA) for permission and approval to abandon deteriorated
pipe on Line 1740 in Doddridge and Harrison Counties, West Virginia, and to replace the abandoned facilities, all
as more fully set forth in the application which is open to the public for inspection. 
Columbia proposes to abandon approximately 6.5 miles of deteriorated 20-inch diameter pipe

 in Doddridge and Harrison Counties, and replace with approximately 6.5 miles of 20-inch diameter pipe and 0.1 mile
of 16-inch diameter pipe as an auxiliary crossover pipeline on five segments of Line 1740. Columbia does not request
authorization for any new or additional service. Columbia states that the proposed pipeline sections would have
equivalent design delivery capacity and the facilities proposed for abandonment are obsolete due to class location
changes or are physically deteriorated to the extent that replacement is deemed advisable. The proposed construction
would cost approximately $6,624,000 and the estimated net debit to retirement associated with the abandonment is
$331,000.




Any person desiring to be heard or to make any protest with reference to said application should on or before July 12,
1994, file with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20426, a motion to intervene or a protest
in accordance with the requirements of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.214 or 385.211)

determining the appropriate action to be taken but will not serve to make the protestants parties to the proceeding.
Any person wishing to become a party to a proceeding or to participate as a party in any hearing therein must file a motion
to intervene in accordance with the Commission's Rules. 
Take further notice that, pursuant to the authority contained in and subject to the jurisdiction conferred upon the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission by   7 and 15 of the NGA and the Commission's Rules of Practice and
Procedure, a hearing will be held without further notice before the Commission or its designee on this application
if no motion to intervene is filed within the time required herein, if the Commission on its own review of the matter
finds that a grant of the certificate and permission and approval for the proposed abandonment are required by the
public convenience and necessity. If a motion for leave to intervene is timely filed, or if the Commission on its own
motion believes that a formal hearing is required, further notice of such hearing will be duly given. 
Under the procedure herein provided for, unless otherwise advised, it will be unnecessary for Columbia to appear
or be represented at the hearing.

Proposed Decision and Order of the Department of Energy 


Implementation of Special Refund Procedures 


Names of Firms: Western Asphalt Service, Inc., Gray Trucking Company, 
William Valentine & Sons, Inc. 
Dates of Filing: July 17, 1992; 
December 7, 1993; 
April 13, 1994.
Case Numbers: LEF-0047, LEF-0120, LEF-0123. 
In accordance with the procedural regulations of the Department of Energy (DOE), 10 C.F.R. Part 205, Subpart V, the
Economic Regulatory Administration (ERA) of the DOE filed three Petitions for the Implementation of Special Refund
Procedures with the Office of Hearings and Appeals (OHA) on July 17, 1992, December 7, 1993 and April 13, 1994, respectively.
The Petitions request that OHA formulate and implement procedures for the distribution of funds received pursuant
to settlement agreements entered into by the DOE and Western Asphalt Service, Inc. (Western), Gray Trucking Company
(Gray) and William Valentine & Sons, Inc. (Valentine). 


I. Background 


During the period of Federal petroleum price controls, Western was engaged in crude oil refining and reselling.
 The firm was therefore subject to regulations governing the pricing of crude oil set forth at 10 C.F.R. Parts 205, 210,
211, and 212 of the Mandatory Petroleum Price and Allocation Regulations. As a result of an ERA audit of its operations,
a Proposed Remedial Order (PRO) was issued to Western on April 4, 1984 pursuant to 10 C.F.R. Part 205, Subpart O (ERA
Docket No. 940X00182). The PRO alleged violations of the pricing and certification rules that applied to crude oil
resellers. Essentially, the firm was charged with selling price-controlled crude oil as uncontrolled stripper
well crude oil at unlawfully high prices in violation of the provisions of 10 C.F.R. Part 212, Subpart L and 10 C.F.R.
 212.131. In another enforcement proceeding, on May 7, 1981, a Notice of Probable Violation was issued to Western
which alleged that the firm unlawfully received Small Refiner Bias Entitlements (ERA Docket No. N00S90197) in April
and May 1977. These alleged violations of DOE crude oil regulations by Western were settled by a Consent Order between
the firm and DOE on May 30, 1984. The PRO was therefore withdrawn and the NOPV was rescinded. Western agreed to remit
$300,000, plus interest, to the DOE for deposit in an interest-bearing escrow account. Western has complied with
this obligation, remitting a total of $390,059.12 to the DOE. In return, the DOE has released Western from any liability
regarding its failure to comply with the Federal petroleum price and allocation regulations during the period August
19, 1973 through January 27, 1981, with the sole exception of any potential violations of the Entitlements Program
after September 30, 1980. 




Gray was also a crude oil reseller during the period of price controls. On March 29, 1982, Gray and the DOE entered into
a Consent Order whereby Gray would remit $31,500, plus interest, to the DOE for deposit in an interest-bearing escrow
account. The DOE agreed not to pursue its claim that, during the period March 1977 through January 1980, Gray overcharged
its customers by charging unlawfully high prices for crude oil in violation of 10 C.F.R. Part 212, Subparts F and L.
Despite its agreement with the terms of the Consent Order, Gray failed to comply fully with its financial obligations
to the DOE, and remitted only $4,738.86 to the DOE. On October 15, 1985, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District
of Texas, Amarillo Division, granted the DOE an Amended Judgment against Gray for an additional $34,625. However,
the Amended Judgment has not resulted in any additional payments to DOE by Gray. ERA has petitioned that the $4,738.86,
plus accrued interest, obtained from Gray be distributed by OHA in accordance with the Subpart V regulations.


Valentine was engaged in crude oil reclamation during the period May 1979 through December 1980.
 Through an unincorporated subsidiary, Big Muddy Oil Processors Inc. (Big Muddy), Valentine obtained waste crude
oil from oil spills, pipeline ruptures, waste oil pits and oil tank bottoms. After numerous separation and filtering
processes, the waste oil was mixed with various blending agents (naphthas, natural gasoline, natural gas by-products,
etc.) and the resulting product was sold as pipeline-quality crude oil. Big Muddy, and by extension Valentine, was
therefore a reseller of crude oil, subject to the provisions of 10 C.F.R. Part 212, Subpart L, which governed the resales
of crude oil. 




An ERA audit uncovered evidence that Valentine sold crude oil at unlawfully high prices during the period May 1979
through December 1980. On December 2, 1987, OHA issued a Remedial Order to Valentine directing the firm to refund $1,454,876
in overcharges, plus interest. 

See William Valentine and Sons, Inc., 

16 DOE  83,025 (1987). Valentine appealed OHA's determination to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
(FERC). On March 23, 1989, FERC rejected Valentine's Appeal of the Remedial Order and upheld OHA's findings. 

See William Valentine and Sons, Inc., 

46 FERC  61,252 (1989). Valentine appealed that decision and, on January 24, 1990, the U.S. District Court for
the District of Wyoming ruled that Valentine's challenge to DOE's Remedial Order and to FERC's ruling was without
merit. At the same time, the Court also approved a Settlement Agreement in which Valentine agreed to remit to DOE no
less than $108,739 plus interest. In return, DOE agreed to deem Valentine in full compliance with the price control
program and to release all administrative and civil claims against the firm. Valentine has paid $126,402.66 into
an interest-bearing DOE escrow account in compliance with the Settlement Agreement. 


II. Jurisdiction and Authority 


On July 28, 1986, the DOE issued a Modified Statement of Restitutionary Policy Concerning Crude Oil Overcharges,
51 Fed. Reg. 27899 (August 4, 1986) (The MSRP). The MSRP, issued as a result of a court-approved Settlement Agreement
(the Stripper Well Agreement) in 

In re: The Department of Energy Stripper Well Exemption Litigation, 

M.D.L. No. 378 (D.Kan. 1986), provides that crude oil overcharge funds will be divided among the states, the federal
government, and injured purchasers of refined petroleum products. Under the MSRP, up to twenty percent of these crude
oil overcharge funds will be reserved to satisfy valid claims by injured purchasers of petroleum products. Eighty
percent of the funds, and any monies remaining after all valid claims are paid, are to be disbursed equally to the states
and federal government for indirect restitution. 
Shortly after the issuance of the MSRP, the OHA issued an Order that announced its intention to apply the MSRP in all
Subpart V proceedings involving alleged crude oil violations. Order Implementing the MSRP, 51 Fed. Reg. 29689 (August
20, 1986). In that Order, the OHA solicited comments concerning the appropriate procedures to follow in processing
refund applications in crude oil refund proceedings. On April 6, 1987, the OHA issued a Notice analyzing the numerous
comments and setting forth generalized procedures to assist claimants that file refund applications for crude oil
monies under the Subpart V regulations. 52 Fed. Reg. 11737 (April 10, 1987) (the April Notice).

<TEXT>
 

The OHA has applied these procedures in numerous cases since the April Notice, 

e.g., New York Petroleum, Inc.,

 18 DOE  85,435 (1988) (

NYP

); 

Shell Oil Co., 

17 DOE  85,204 (1988); 

Ernest A. Allerkamp, 

17 DOE  85,079 (1988) (

Allerkamp

), and the procedures have been approved by the United States District Court for the District of Kansas as well as the
Temporary Emergency Court of Appeals. Various states filed a Motion with the Kansas District Court, claiming that
the OHA violated the Stripper Well Agreement by employing presumptions of injury for end-users and by improperly
calculating the refund amount to be used in those proceedings. On August 17, 1987, Judge Frank G. Theis issued an Opinion
and Order denying the States' Motion in its entirety. 

In re: The Department of Energy Stripper Well Exemption Litigation, 

671 F. Supp. 1318 (D. Kan. 1987), 

aff'd,

 857 F. 2d 1481 (Temp. Emer. Ct. App. 1988). Judge Theis concluded that the Stripper Well Agreement ``does not bar [the]
OHA from permitting claimants to employ reasonable presumptions in affirmatively demonstrating injury entitling
them to a refund.'' 

Id. 

at 1323. He also ruled that, as specified in the April Notice, the OHA could calculate refunds based on a portion of the
M.D.L. 378 overcharges. 

Id. 

at 1323-24. 

The general guidelines which the OHA may use to formulate and implement a plan to distribute refunds are set forth in
10 C.F.R. Part 205, Subpart V. The Subpart V process may be used in situations where the DOE cannot readily identify
the persons who may have been injured as a result of actual or alleged violations of the regulations or ascertain the
amount of the refund each person should receive. For a more detailed discussion of Subpart V and the authority of the
OHA to fashion procedures to distribute refunds, see 

Office of Enforcement, 

9 DOE  82,508 (1981), and 

Office of Enforcement,

 8 DOE  82,597 (1981). After reviewing the records submitted in support of the three Petitions, we have concluded
that a Subpart V proceeding is an appropriate mechanism for distributing the $521,200.64 in funds obtained from Western,
Gray and Valentine. We therefore propose to grant the ERA's Petitions and assume jurisdiction over distribution
of the funds. 



III. Proposed Refund Procedures 



A. Refund Claims 



We propose to apply the procedures discussed in the April Notice to the crude oil Subpart V proceedings that are the
subject of the present determination. As noted above, the monies deposited with the DOE in settlement of the alleged
crude oil violations totalling $521,200.64, plus accrued interest, are covered by this Proposed Decision. We have
decided to reserve the full twenty percent of the alleged crude oil violation amount, or $104,240.13 plus interest,
for direct refunds to claimants, in order to insure that sufficient funds will be available for refunds to injured
parties. 

The process which the OHA will use to evaluate claims based on alleged crude oil violations will be modeled after the
process the OHA has used in Subpart V proceedings to evaluate claims based upon alleged overcharges involving refined
products. 

E.g., Mountain Fuel Supply Co.,

 14 DOE  85,475 (1986). As in non-crude oil cases, applicants will be required to document their purchase volumes
of covered products and prove that they were injured as a result of the alleged violations. Generally, we will presume
that an applicant incurred a crude oil overcharge in the purchase of a product if the product was either identified
as a covered product in the Emergency Petroleum Allocation Act of 1973, 15 U.S.C.   751-760, or if
the product was purchased from a crude oil refinery or originated in a crude oil refinery and was purchased from a reseller.


Notice of General Interest Concerning DOE's Crude Oil Overcharge Refund Program,

 57 Fed. Reg. 30731, 30732 (July 10, 1992); 

Great Lakes Carbon Corp.,

 22 DOE  85,248, at 88,662 (1993). Applicants who were end-users or ultimate consumers of petroleum products,
whose businesses are unrelated to the petroleum industry, and who were not subject to the DOE price regulations are
presumed to have been injured by any alleged crude oil overcharges. In order to receive a refund, end-users need not
submit any further evidence of injury beyond the volume of petroleum products purchased during the period of price
controls. 

See, e.g., A. Tarricone, Inc.,

 15 DOE  85,495 at 88,893-96 (1987). However, the end-user presumption of injury can be rebutted by evidence
which establishes that the specific end-user in question was not injured by the crude oil overcharges. 

See, e.g., Berry Holding Co., 

16 DOE  85,405 at 88,797 (1987). If an interested party submits evidence that is sufficient to cast serious doubt
on the end-user presumption, the applicant will be required to produce further evidence of injury. 

See, e.g., NYP,

 18 DOE at 88,701-03. 

Reseller and retailer claimants must submit detailed evidence of injury, and may not rely on the presumption of injury
utilized in refund cases involving refined petroleum products. They may, however, use econometric evidence of the
type employed in the 

OHA Report to the District Court in the Stripper Well Litigation, reprinted in

 6 Fed. Energy Guidelines  90,507.

Applicants who executed and submitted a valid waiver pursuant to one of the escrows established in the Stripper Well
Agreement have waived their rights to apply for a crude oil refund under Subpart V. 

Mid-America Dairyman Inc., v. Herrington,

 878 F. 2d 1448 (Temp. Emer. Ct. App. 1989); 

accord, Boise Cascade Corp.,

 18 DOE  85,970 (1989).

As we have stated in previous Decisions, a crude oil refund applicant will only be required to submit one application
for its share of all available crude oil overcharge funds. 

E.g., Allerkamp, 

17 DOE at 88,176. Any party that has previously submitted a refund Application in the crude oil refund proceedings
need not file another Application. That previously filed Application will be deemed to be filed in all crude oil refund
proceedings as the procedures are finalized. The DOE has established June 30, 1994 as the final deadline for filing
an Application for Refund from the crude oil funds. 

Anchor Gasoline Corp.,

 22 DOE  85,071 (1992); 58 Fed. Reg. 26318 (May 3, 1993). It is the policy of the DOE to pay all crude oil refund claims
filed before June 30, 1994, at the rate of $0.0008 per gallon. However, while we anticipate that applicants who filed
their claims within the original June 30, 1988 deadline will receive a supplemental refund payment, we will decide
in the future whether claimants that filed later Applications should receive additional refunds. 

See, e.g., Seneca Oil Co.,

 21 DOE  85,327 (1991). Notice of any additional amounts available in the future will be published in the 

Federal Register

. 



B. Payments to the Federal Government and the States 



Under the terms of the MSRP, the remaining eighty percent of the alleged crude oil violation amounts subject to this
Proposed Decision, or $416,960.51, plus interest, should be disbursed in equal shares to the states and federal government,
for indirect restitution. Refunds to the states will be in proportion to the consumption of petroleum products in
each state during the period of price controls. The share or ratio of the funds which each state will receive is contained
in Exhibit H of the Stripper Well Agreement. When disbursed, these funds will be subject to the same limitations and
reporting requirements as all other crude oil monies received by the states under the Stripper Well Agreement. 

It Is Therefore Ordered That:

The refund amounts remitted to the Department of Energy by Western Asphalt Service, Inc., W.F. Moore and Son, Inc.,
Gibson Oil and Refining Co., and Wilfred Paige van Loben Sels, pursuant to the Consent Order signed on May 30, 1984;
by Gray Trucking Company pursuant to the Consent Order signed on March 29, 1982; and by William Valentine and Sons,
Inc., Valentine Construction, Inc., Dale L. Valentine, Verna Valentine, and James L. Marchant, pursuant to the Settlement
Agreement signed on January 24, 1990, will be distributed in accordance with the foregoing Decision.

<DOCTITLE>Proposed Power Marketing Policy for Georgia-Alabama-South Carolina System of Projects</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Southeastern Power Administration (Southeastern), DOE.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

Southeastern has developed the following proposed power marketing policy for its Georgia-Alabama-South Carolina
System of Projects pursuant to Notice published in the 

Federal Register

 of September 8, 1993, 58 FR 47273, and in accordance with Procedure for Public Participation in the Formulation of
Marketing Policy published July 6, 1978, 43 FR 29186. In the Notice, Southeastern proposed a System Policy which would
deal with the complete Georgia-Alabama-South Carolina System of Projects including systems both east and west of
the Savannah River. Based on analysis of proposals and recommendations received, consultations with interested
parties and further studies and considerations, Southeastern decided to develop a policy applying to the system
effective with the expiration of existing contracts, or as soon thereafter as is practical. The policy, when finalized,
will constitute written guidelines for future disposition of power from the system. The policy is developed under
authority of Section 5 of the Flood Control Act of 1944, 16 U.S.C. 825s, and Section 302(a) of the Department of Energy
Organization Act of 1977, 42 U.S.C. 7152. Interested persons are invited to submit written comments directly to Southeastern
and/or present written or oral views, or data at the public comment forums on the proposed policy.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Southeastern received only one response to its September 8, 1993, solicitation for proposed and recommendations
contained in its Notice of Intent to Formulate Power Marketing Policy. This response was carefully considered as
were facts gathered from those who consulted with Southeastern.


Major issues raised by the proposed policy are determination of marketing area, allocation of power among area customers,
handling of energy at pump-storage installations, utilization of area utility systems for power integration, firming,
wheeling, exchange and other essential relationships, wholesale rates, handling of resale relationships, and
conservation measures. An Environmental Assessment and Finding of No Significant Impact have been prepared indicating
that the proposed power marketing policy will not have a significant effect upon the quality of the human environment.
A copy may be obtained by contacting the Administrator at the address or telephone number listed above.
The public comment forums will not be adjudicative in nature. The Administrator shall act as or appoint a forum chairman.
At the start of the forums the chairman shall briefly explain procedures and rules. Customers and the public shall
be allowed to make oral statements and comments, introduce relevant documents, and ask questions regarding the proposed
power marketing policy of Southeastern representatives at the forum. Persons requesting to speak shall notify Southeastern
at which forum or forums they desire to speak at least 3 days before the particular forum is scheduled so that a list of
forum participants can be prepared. If necessary, the chairman may establish time limitations for oral presentations
by these participants to assure that all who register to speak shall have an opportunity to do so. Others will be permitted
to speak if time allows. Those unable to speak because of time limitations and others who so desire may submit written
comments. The chairman and Southeastern representatives may question forum participants and, the chairman, at
his discretion, may permit other participants a like privilege. Questions not answered by Southeastern representatives
during a forum shall be specifically identified by the chairman in the transcript and shall be subsequently responded
to by Southeastern in writing. All documents introduced and written answers to questions shall be available for inspection
and copying at Southeastern headquarters in accordance with the Freedom of Information Act. Forum proceedings shall
be transcribed. Copies of the transcript may be purchased from the reporter.
Customers and the public may consult or file written comments and questions with Southeastern regarding the proposed
marketing policy on or before September 16, 1994. All such questions shall receive expeditious response, September
16, 1994. All such questions shall receive expeditious response, and all such comments, questions and answers shall
be available at Southeastern headquarters for inspection or copying in accordance with the Freedom of Information
Act. The forum transcripts will likewise be available for inspection at Southeastern headquarters in Elberton,
Georgia.

General. The projects and power subject to this policy are:




There will be one policy for the Georgia-Alabama-South Carolina System of projects progressively implemented.
It will become effective upon publication in the 

Federal Register

 and will be applicable to the sale of system power in respective utility areas as then existing contracts, or necessary
extensions, expire. 
The policy will be implemented through negotiated contracts for terms not to exceed 10 years. 
Transmission facilities owned by utilities within the marketing area will be used for all necessary purposes including
transmitting power to load centers. Deliveries may be made at the projects, at utilities' interconnections or at
customer substations, as determined by Southeastern. The projects will be hydraulically, electrically, and financially
integrated, and will be operated to make maximum contribution to the power supply of the selected utility areas. Preference
in the sale of the power shall be given to public bodies and cooperatives. 
Marketing Area. The marketing area shall consist of the approximate 112,000 square mile area generally known as The
Southern Company service area, and the approximate 40,000 square mile area generally known as the service areas of
the South Carolina Public Service Authority and the South Carolina Electric and Gas Company plus that portion of the
Duke Power Company's service area within a radius of 150 miles of the Hartwell, Russell or Thurmond projects. Eligible
public bodies and cooperatives in this marketing area are listed in Appendix A attached hereto. 
Allocations of Existing Power. Existing power available under this policy for allocation from the Georgia-Alabama-South
Carolina System will primarily be peaking power. The power will be allocated as follows:

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940711-2-00041 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940711-2-00024 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 



Except where duplication of allocation would result, each public body and cooperative within the marketing areas
as shown in Appendix A will be eligible for an allocation of existing power, except for the City of Oxford, Georgia.
No reallocation of existing power for the benefit of Oxford is proposed at this time. Existing preference customers
within the marketing area will retain their present allocations of capacity and essentially the same energy accompaniment.
It is Southeastern's goal to allocate all available and useful system power (that power remaining after provision
for an appropriate capacity margin and losses) to preference customers, except power that may be used for pumping.
Allocation of Power From Russell Pumped Storage Units. Currently, the pump generator units at the Richard B. Russell
Project are undergoing a series of environmental tests to meet the requirements of an injunction imposed by the U.S.
District Court in the case of 

South Carolina Department of Wildlife and Marine Resources 

v. 

Marsh et al, 

866 F.2d 97 (4th Cir 1989). The first opportunity for commercial operation of the pumping units is after the completion
of these tests. The environmental tests and schedules were agreed upon by the Corps of Engineers and the party litigants,
and the results of the tests must be approved by the district court before the units become commercially available.
Should pumped storage units at the Russell project become commercially available during the tenure of contracts
implementing this policy, after the approval of the district court, after further mitigating modifications required
by environmental concerns, or by any other means, Southeastern will allocate this additional power as detailed in
the Power Marketing Policy for the Georgia-Alabama-South Carolina System of Projects promulgated on October 1,
1980 in the 

Federal Register

. The capacity relative to the Russell pumped storage units will be allocated to the City of Oxford, Georgia, and to
the existing customers in The Southern Company service area including Alabama Electric Cooperative and South Mississippi
Electric Power Association (130 MW), the Duke Power Company service area (65 MW), the South Carolina Electric and
Gas service area (5 MW) and the South Carolina Public Service Authority (60 MW). Adequate capacity has been retained
to provide an appropriate capacity margin. Russell pumped storage capacity is predicted a this time on testing accomplished
to date and reflects the best estimate at this time. Energy accompaniment to the pumped storage capacity will be sufficient
to provide viable peaking capacity. The Russell pumped storage power will be allocated as follows:

Power From Pumped Water. Southeastern will utilize its combination pumped storage and generation resources to produce
high-value on-peak power. Pumping power, whether generated within the system of projects or obtained by purchasing
or exchange agreement, will be used in pumped storage operations, at Southeastern's discretion. Should the purchase
alternative be selected, Southeastern will obtain pumping energy from utilities offering the best terms, and/or
resulting in the most benefits to the system. Should the exchange alternative be selected, pumped storage operations
will be handled with public bodies, cooperatives and the utilities in a manner not involving the direct purchase and
sales approach, with preference given to public bodies and cooperatives. 

 Utilization Of Utility Systems. In the absence of transmission facilities of its own, Southeastern will use area
generation and transmission systems to integrate the Government's projects, provide firming, wheeling, exchange
and backup services and such other functions as may be necessary to dispose of system power under reasonable and acceptable
marketing arrangements. Utility systems providing such services shall be entitled to adequate compensation. Specific
terms and conditions of all such arrangements shall be the subject of negotiations between Southeastern and the generation
and transmission utilities providing the services. Individual preferred agencies directly affected by the negotiations
shall, through representatives selected at the outset of negotiations, be kept currently advised on the status and
progress of negotiations. Southeastern also will consult with and seek advice from these affected parties. 

 Wholesale Rates. Rate schedules shall be drawn to recover all costs associated with producing and transmitting the
power in accordance with then current repayment criteria. Production costs will be determined on a system basis and
rate schedules will relate to the integrated output of the projects. Rate schedules may be revised periodically.


 Resale Rates. Resale rate provisions requiring the benefits of Southeastern power to be passed on to the ultimate
consumer will be included in each Southeastern customer contract that provides for Southeastern to supply more than
25 percent of the customers' total power requirements during the term of the contract. 

 Energy and Economic Efficiency Measures. Each customer who purchases Southeastern's power is encouraged to participate
in an integrated resource plan that considers both supply and demand side alternatives. It is recognized that some
Southeastern customers are members of a power supply organization that does resource planning for its customers
(i.e., power supply cooperatives and joint action agencies). Where a customer, or a power supply organization that
does resource planning for a Southeastern customer, is responsible to a regulatory body or another Government agency
for an integrated resource plan, the customer will make a copy of such integrated resource plan available to Southeastern.
All Southeastern customers shall agree to encourage the efficient use of energy by ultimate customers.

ACTION:

 Revised Provo River Project marketing proposal summary. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 In December 1993, Western Area Power Administration (Western) proposed to change the way it markets power and energy
produced by the Provo River Project (PRP) and to include it as one of the Salt Lake City Area/Integrated Projects (Integrated
Projects). During the comment period on the proposal, comments were received which indicated that customers of Western's
Integrated Projects would not support inclusion of the PRP in the Integrated Projects. Western has decided to modify
its original proposal to market this power and energy independent of the Integrated Projects. Capacity and energy
produced by the PRP will be allocated to those members of Intermountain Consumers Power Association (ICPA) and Utah
Municipal Power Agency (UMPA) located in Utah and Wasatch Counties in Utah. ICPA and UMPA are hereafter referred to
as potential contractors. Power would be allocated to these potential contractors proportional to their load. Separate
power sales contracts would be offered to the potential contractors. Potential contractors would pay all of the annual
powerplant expenses of the PRP including an amount to assist the Provo River Water Users Association (Water Users)
repayment of the United States original investment in the PRP. In return, potential contractors would receive all
of the marketable output of the PRP. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Background 


In a 

Federal Register

 notice dated December 13, 1993 (58 FR 65180-65181), Western proposed to include the PRP with the Integrated
Projects and to market the power and energy produced by the PRP to members of ICPA and UMPA within a marketing area comprised
of Utah and Wasatch Counties, Utah. Western accepted comments on its proposal until January 12, 1994. A public information/comment/scoping
meeting was held in Spanish Fork, Utah, on January 4, 1994. As a result of comments received, at both the meeting and
in writing, Western is revising its proposed marketing plan for the PRP. 


Marketing Issues 



One of the commentors, the Colorado River Energy Distributor's Association (CREDA), an organization of many Integrated
Projects customers, commented that CREDA believes ``the same principles commonly used in other Bureau of Reclamation
(Reclamation) water projects having power generation features should be applied to the extent lawful in the instance
of PRP.'' Western's review of the appropriate laws shows that construction of the PRP and the methods of repaying the
United States for its investment in the project were first established in 1936, under Contract No. Ilr-874 dated June
27, 1936 (1936 Contract). The 1936 Contract states that surplus revenue from the sale of surplus water and power shall
be applied to the repayment obligation of the Water Users. No distinction was made in the contract that this payment
was to be for irrigation investment or for investment beyond the irrigators' ability to pay as is common in other Reclamation
projects. In fact, from the beginning, almost three-fourths of the water developed by the project was for municipal
and industrial use. Western has agreed to pay from power revenues $1.623 million toward the Water Users' obligation
by 2008. Of this amount, $191,587 has been paid. 

CREDA also stated that it did not believe Western had adequately supported the need to integrate the projects. When
Western established the Integrated Projects in 1986, it intended to include the Colorado River Storage Project (CRSP),
the Collbran Project, the Rio Grande Project, and the PRP. The PRP was not included because of uncertainty associated
with commitments to the Water Users. Western's intent was to bring PRP into the Integrated Projects on an equal basis
with the rest of the projects. Western has agreed that it is not necessary to include the PRP in the Integrated Projects.

In a further comment, CREDA objected to all Integrated Projects customers paying costs of the Water Users since these
constitute repayment of municipal and industrial water development costs. CREDA had no objection to marketing the
PRP resource to ICPA and UMPA under separate contracts from the Integrated Projects. In fact, ICPA and UMPA are both
members of CREDA. Western has determined that it can still meet its objectives of beneficially marketing the PRP through
separate contractual arrangements and has revised its proposal to do so. This will require development of power sales
contracts with potential contractors. 
Since the PRP has only been sold to Western's CRSP, a rate for the capacity and energy produced has never been developed.
A power repayment study (PRS) has been prepared each year to determine the revenues needed to meet project repayment,
including operation, maintenance, and replacement expenses. The CRSP purchased the energy produced by the PRP for
this amount. Western now proposes that the PRS still be used to identify the annual revenue requirements of the PRP.
Potential contractors would pay their proportional share of one-twelfth of the annual amount each month to Western.
In addition, the potential contractors would pay a total of $102,243.80 each year to Reclamation to be applied toward
the Water Users' payment obligations. 
Two other Integrated Projects customers in Utah, the Weber Basin Water Conservancy District (Weber Basin) and Bountiful
City Light and Power (Bountiful), operate generating plants on the Weber River. Both claimed when water is diverted
from the Weber River into the Provo River under existing agreements, they incur losses in generation and asked to be
compensated for these losses. Western has determined that the water diversions from the Weber River into the Provo
River were established before Weber Basin or Bountiful constructed generation on the Weber River. Neither entity
had a power right to the waters of the Weber River. PacifiCorp, which is compensated for generating losses, owned an
operating generating plant on the Weber River and held power rights to the flows of the river prior to the Provo River
diversion. Discussions with Reclamation and examination of Weber Basin and Bountiful contracts have confirmed
this position. Weber Basin and Bountiful are not entitled to an allocation of PRP power to compensate them for harm
caused by reduced flows in the Weber River because their plants have never been entitled to, or used, the diverted water.

Another commentor, Reclamation, stated that the marketing criteria should consider arrangements for providing
assistance to the Water Users. Also, the amount of assistance should be included in the PRP power marketing contracts,
and arrangements made so that payment could be made directly to Reclamation on behalf of the Water Users during the
contract period. 
These issues are still subject to further discussions with the Water Users and Reclamation. However, Western has
committed to provide a means for annual payment to be made toward project repayment on behalf of the Water Users by the
power purchasers. 
Reclamation also noted that the amount of winter season surplus energy is affected by several factors, including
the agreement dated May 16, 1986, known as the Interim Operating Agreement of Deer Creek and Strawberry Exchange of
Bonneville Unit Water (Interim Operating Agreement), and future agreements on the operation of Deer Creek and Jordanelle
Reservoirs. 
Reclamation has made it clear that the Interim Operating Agreement and future agreements may severely impact the
amount of generation available from the PRP during the winter season. The Interim Operating Agreement anticipated
that compensation to PacifiCorp, for energy lost when water is diverted from the Weber River into the Provo River,
would be affected and it provided a remedy. However, the Interim Operating Agreement does not address compensation
to the Water Users by Central Utah Water Conservancy District (Central Utah) for other winter season generation which
would be lost. Draft language on an agreement for joint operation of Deer Creek and Jordanelle Reservoirs provides
a means for Central Utah to compensate the Water Users for this reduction. Drafts of this agreement stipulate that
a separate agreement among Central Utah, the Water Users, Western, PacifiCorp, and Reclamation will be developed
to provide for this compensation. It is anticipated that this agreement will be completed prior to initial service
under Western's proposed marketing plan. 
The Water Users commented that Western's criteria for marketing the surplus power and energy of the Deer Creek Powerplant
must fairly compensate the Water Users for the value of the surplus electric power and energy in the form of assistance
on its repayment obligation. 
Western's criteria specify that the annual revenue requirements, including Western's commitment to the Water Users,
will be recovered from the potential contractors in return for all of the marketable power and energy produced by the
PRP. 
The Water Users further commented that the rate for nonfirm energy should be the same as the blended rate of firm energy.
Western's revised proposal would eliminate any distinction between firm and nonfirm energy. All energy produced
by the PRP would be delivered in return for the potential contractors paying all of the PRP's annual powerplant expenses.

All of the Water Users' comments are concerned with their claim to a contractual obligation that surplus revenue from
the sale of power be applied toward the repayment obligation of the Water Users for the PRP. Western has stated that
it will consider $1.623 million by 2008 as a repayment assistance to the PRP. The Water Users assert that there is an
obligation to develop surplus revenue from power sales that can be applied to the repayment obligation of the Water
Users beyond 2008 until all repayment obligations have been met. Western knows of no legal basis for the Water Users'
position. Resolution of these issues are outside the scope of this proposed action. These issues have been the focus
of several meetings between the Water Users, Western, and Reclamation. Western's proposal would provide a means
to ensure that the balance of the $1.623 million commitment is paid in annual increments by 2008. 


Other Issues 


UMPA states that use of PRP energy in Utah County, Utah, will result in reduced reliance on fossil fuels and will enhance
the environment, especially air quality. 
This issue will be addressed in the environmental assessment which will be done on the proposed action. However, because
of the quantities of energy involved in the proposal, it is unlikely that the action will have a significant impact
on air quality in Utah County. 
The Stonefly Society (Society), a local environmental organization, commented that operation of the PRP on the Provo,
Duchesne, and Weber Rivers has produced devastating impacts on these river systems. Among these are: (1) Destruction
of the Provo's natural channel and riparian areas, (2) anoxic water discharge from Deer Creek Reservoir, (3) dewatering
of the Weber River, and (4) dewatering of the Duchesne River. They state that three actions should be taken: (1) studies
of the environmental impacts of the PRP should be conducted immediately; (2) funds should be allocated from Deer Creek
Power revenues to correct these serious problems; and (3) no funds should be allocated to the PRP until these environmental
impacts have been both assessed and corrected. 
Western's proposal is to only change the way power from the PRP is marketed. It will have no effect on how the PRP is operated.
The Society's issues are concerned with the way the project is operated and not on how power is marketed. Therefore,
their comments are outside the scope of this proposal. 
The Society asked ``if the PRP were included in the Integrated Projects, will the powerplant at Deer Creek Reservoir
be operated independently or will the operation be integrated with other Western generating facilities? If its operation
is integrated, will there be environmental impacts at these other facilities?'' Western's proposal is to market
the PRP independently of the Integrated Projects. There would be no operation connection between the projects. Furthermore,
since Deer Creek Powerplant is not controlled by Western, delivery of power and energy to the customer would be, as
always, on a run-of-the-river basis. 


Marketing Criteria


a. Applicability 


Congress granted to the Secretary of Energy acting by and through Western's Administrator the authority to market
Federal power. In response to requests from UMPA and ICPA to receive power produced by the PRP, Western has examined
the merits of reorganizing the marketing of the PRP resource. Western believes these proposed marketing changes
will benefit both the potential contractors and the Water Users.

b. Marketable Resource 



A contract among Reclamation, the Water Users, the Weber River Water Users Association, and PacifiCorp dated December
20, 1938 (1938 Contract), provides for diversion of water from the Weber River into the Provo River for storage in Deer
Creek Reservoir and for use by the Water Users. Because PacifiCorp operated generating units on the Weber River below
the point of diversion to the Provo River, PacifiCorp's ability to generate was reduced when water was diverted. The
1938 Contract provides that PacifiCorp is to receive all of the electrical generation of the PRP during the period
of time that water is diverted. This means that for up to 6 months, from October 15 to April 15 of each year, there may be
no marketable energy generated by the PRP. Historically however, marketable energy has averaged 23,000,000 kilowatthours
(kWh), with 15,000,000 kWh generated during summer months, and the remaining 8,000,000 kWh from winter surplus energy.
Typically, about 3,000,000 kWh are available in each of the 3 peak summer months of June, July, and August; approximately
1,000,000 kWh are available in April; 2,500,000 kWh in May; and another 2,500,000 kWh in September. ICPA and UMPA would
receive all of the marketable energy generated by the PRP each year in return for paying all of the PRP powerplant expenses.



c. Marketing Area 



Because of the size of the resource, Western proposes to limit the marketing of this resource to preference entities
within the drainage area of the Provo River. All eligible utilities are members of ICPA and UMPA, and are located in
Utah and Wasatch Counties. Members of ICPA are the cities of Heber City, Lehi, Payson, Springville, and the Strawberry
Electric Service District (Strawberry). Affected members of UMPA are the cities of Provo, Salem, and Spanish Fork.
It is anticipated that marketing of the PRP resource to these potential contractors would assure that each would receive
a beneficial amount of power. 


d. Class of Service 



PRP generation is dependent upon water releases that are dictated by minimum stream flow requirements and the Water
Users' needs. No load following ability exists. Since April 1, 1994, the PRP has been included in Western's Upper Colorado
Missouri Basin control area. With the PRP in Western's control area, Western is able to enhance the usability of the
product and to allow it to be scheduled, even though it has no control over PRP generation. Western provides control
area and regulating services for several other customers and has a developed methodology to share the expenses of
operating a control area and providing for regulating capacity. Under the revised proposal, the PRP would be required
to pay for its share of these services. These costs will be included in the PRS as an operating expense. 

Energy will be scheduled to the potential contractors in megawatts in accordance with anticipated generation levels
from the PRP. When variations occur, the hourly schedules will be adjusted to reflect actual operation. 

Western will maintain an energy deviation account between the PRP and the Integrated Projects. At the end of each year,
an accounting of scheduled and generated energy will be made. Differences between the two projects will be made up
by adding to or subtracting from the following year's schedules to the potential contractors. The potential contractors
will be responsible for reserves in accordance with Inland Power Pool requirements. 


e. Resource Allocation 



Western proposes to allocate PRP resources in proportion to the historical sales of each of the ICPA and UMPA members.
UMPA members serve approximately 70 percent of the load in the marketing area, and the city of Provo is by far the largest
member. ICPA members serve approximately 30 percent of the marketing area load. Proportional allocation of the PRP's
average annual output of 23,000,000 kWh would mean UMPA members could expect an average of 16,100,000 kWh and 3,500
kilowatts (kW) of contingent capacity, and ICPA members could expect an average of 6,900,000 kWh and 1,500 kW of contingent
capacity. Of ICPA members' 30 percent, Heber City would receive 6 percent, Lehi 2.7 percent, Springville 12.9 percent,
Payson 4.8 percent, and Strawberry 3.6 percent. Of UMPA members' 70 percent, Provo would receive 60.9 percent, Salem
1.4 percent, and Spanish Fork 7.7 percent. Western would develop firm power sales contracts with ICPA and UMPA on behalf
of their members which would specify the terms and conditions of receiving PRP power. The power sales contracts would
be structured such that if a member withdraws from either ICPA or UMPA, it would be able to retain its entitlement of
PRP power.

f. Contract Terms 


ICPA and UMPA would pay the PRP's total annual powerplant expenses in return for the total marketable PRP production.
Each would pay its proportional share of the operation, maintenance, and replacement expenses identified in the
PRS in 12 monthly installments. In addition, before January 1 of each year, ICPA would pay $30,685.71 and UMPA $71,600.00
to Reclamation to be applied toward the Water Users annual payment. 


g. Term of Contract 



The power sales contracts would become effective on October 1, 1994, and terminate on September 30, 2008. 


Process 



Western will accept comments on its proposed revised marketing plan until August 10, 1994. Following this comment
period, Western will prepare the appropriate contracts and other agreements that may be necessary to implement its
proposal. A notice in the 

Federal Register

 will announce Western's final decisions on marketing PRP power. The marketing plan will be effective 30 days following
publication of that notice. Western intends to begin initial service under these contracts on October 1, 1994. 



ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE: 

Western will comply with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 through preparation of an environmental assessment
(EA) on the impacts of the proposed marketing changes. 



Western has no operational control over the PRP. Deer Creek Dam is operated primarily for the benefit of water storage
and delivery. Power production is a secondary benefit and does not influence dam operations in any manner. Therefore,
the proposed PRP marketing changes will have no effect on dam operations. 



REGULATORY FLEXIBILITY ANALYSIS: 

Pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq.

), each agency, when publishing a proposed rule, is further required to prepare and make available for public comment
an initial regulatory flexibility analysis to describe the impact of the rule on small entities. Western has determined
that: (1) This rulemaking relates to services offered by Western and, therefore, is not a rule within the purview of
the Act, and (2) the impacts of an allocation from Western would not cause an adverse economic impact to such entities.

 

DETERMINATION UNDER EXECUTIVE ORDER 12866:

 DOE has determined this is not a significant regulatory action because it does not meet the criteria of Executive Order
12866, 58 FR 51735. Western has an exemption from centralized regulatory review under Executive Order 12866; accordingly,
no clearance of this notice by the Office of Management and Budget is required.

 

Issued in Golden, Colorado, June 22, 1994.

This method is available from Rupprecht & Patashnick Co., Inc. (R&P), 25 Corporate Circle, Albany, New York
12203. A notice of receipt of application for this method appeared in the 

Federal Register

, Volume 59, March 30, 1994, page 14853.
The hub unit of the Partisol

TM

 Model 2000 Air Sampler contains a filter holder assembly, the flow control system, the valves to direct the sample
flow through the hub or appropriate satellite unit, the sample pump, a microprocessor, keypad, information display,
and associated electronics. Each satellite unit contains only a filter holder assembly and is connected to the hub
unit through a single flow line. Each sampling station (hub or satellite) used for PM

10

 measurements must be equipped with an R&P PM

10

 inlet (other sampling stations may have other types of inlets). Only one sampling station may operate at a time.
The Model 2000 uses 47mm diameter filters mounted in cassettes. Filter media meeting the minimum requirements specified
in appendix J to 40 CFR part 50 (Reference Method for the Determination of Particulate Matter as PM

10

 in the Atmosphere) are available from R&P, or may be obtained from other sources, depending on individual user
needs. A 5-place analytical balance is required for weighing filters before and after sampling.
Test samplers representative of this method have been tested by the applicant, in accordance with the test procedures
specified in 40 CFR part 53. After reviewing the results of these tests and other information submitted by the applicant,
EPA has determined, in accordance with part 53, that this method should be designated as a reference method. The information
submitted by the applicant will be kept on file at EPA's Atmospheric Research and Exposure Assessment Laboratory,
Research Triangle Park, North Carolina 27711, and will be available for inspection to the extent consistent with
40 CFR part 2 (EPA's regulations implementing the Freedom of Information Act).
As a designated reference method, this method is acceptable for use by States and other air monitoring agencies under
requirements of 40 CFR part 58, Ambient Air Quality Surveillance. For such purposes, the method must be used in accordance
with the guidance in appendix J to 40 CFR part 50 and the specific procedures contained in the operation or instruction
manual associated with the method. Use of the method is also subject to any limitations specified in the applicable
designation (see description of the method above). Vendor modifications of a designated method used for purposes
of part 58 are permitted only with prior approval of EPA, as provided in part 53. Provisions concerning modification
of such methods by users are specified under section 2.8 of appendix C to 40 CFR part 58 (Modifications of Methods by
Users).
In general, this designation applies to any sampler which is identical to the sampler described in the designation.
Similar samplers manufactured and sold prior to the designation may be upgraded (e.g., by minor modification or by
substitution of a new operation or instruction manual) so as to be identical to the designated method and thus achieve
designation status at a modest cost. The manufacturer should be consulted to determine the feasibility of such upgrading.

Part 53 requires that sellers of designated methods comply with certain conditions. These conditions are given in
40 CFR 53.9 and are summarized below for PM

10

 methods:
(1) A copy of the approved operation or instruction manual must accompany the PM

10

 sampler when it is delivered to the ultimate purchaser.
(2) The PM

10

 sampler must not generate any unreasonable hazard to operators or to the environment.
(3) The PM

10

 sampler must function within the limits of the performance specifications given in table D-1 of part 53 for at
least one year after delivery when maintained and operated in accordance with the operation manual.

<DOCTITLE>State of Florida; Final Determination of Adequacy of State/Tribal Municipal Solid Waste Landfill Permit Program
</DOCTITLE>


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency.

 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of Final Determination of Full Program Adequacy for State of Florida's Municipal Solid Waste Landfill Permit
Program.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 Section 4005(c)(1)(B) of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), as amended by the Hazardous and Solid
Waste Amendments (HSWA) of 1984, requires States to develop and implement permit programs to ensure that municipal
solid waste landfills (MSWLFs) which may receive hazardous household waste or small quantity generator waste will
comply with the revised federal MSWLF criteria (40 CFR part 258). RCRA Section 4005(c)(1)(C) requires the Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) to determine whether States have adequate ``permit'' programs for MSWLFs, but does not mandate
issuance of a rule for such determinations. EPA has drafted and is in the process of proposing a State/Tribal Implementation
Rule (STIR) that will provide procedures by which EPA will approve, or partially approve, State/Tribal landfill
permit programs. The Agency intends to approve adequate State/Tribal MSWLF permit programs as applications are
submitted. Thus, these approvals are not dependent on final promulgation of the STIR. Prior to promulgation of the
STIR, adequacy determinations will be made based on the statutory authorities and requirements. In addition, States/Tribes
may use the draft STIR as an aid in interpreting these requirements. The Agency believes that early approvals have
an important benefit. Approved State/Tribal permit programs provide interaction between the State/Tribe and the
owner/operator regarding site-specific permit conditions. Only those owners/operators located in States/Tribes
with approved permit programs can use the site-specific flexibility provided by part 258 to the extent the State/Tribal
permit program allows such flexibility. 


Florida applied for a determination of adequacy under section 4005 of RCRA. EPA reviewed Florida's application and
proposed a determination that Florida's MSWLF permit program is adequate to ensure compliance with the revised MSWLF
criteria. After consideration of all comments received, EPA is today issuing a final determination that the State's
program is adequate.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
A. Background 


On October 9, 1991, EPA promulgated revised criteria for MSWLFs (40 CFR part 258). Subtitle D of RCRA, as amended by
the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 (HSWA), requires States to develop permitting programs to ensure
that facilities comply with the federal criteria under part 258. Subtitle D also requires in section 4005 that EPA
determine the adequacy of State municipal solid waste landfill permit programs to ensure that facilities comply
with the revised federal criteria. To fulfill this requirement, the Agency has drafted and is in the process of proposing
a State/Tribal Implementation Rule (STIR). The rule will specify the requirements which State/Tribal programs
must satisfy to be determined adequate. 
EPA intends to approve State/Tribal MSWLF permit programs prior to the promulgation of STIR. EPA interprets the requirements
for States or Tribes to develop ``adequate'' programs for permits or other forms of prior approval to impose several
minimum requirements. First, each State/Tribe must have enforceable standards for new and existing MSWLFs that
are technically comparable to EPA's revised MSWLF criteria. Next, the State/Tribe must have the authority to issue
a permit or other notice of prior approval to all new and existing MSWLFs in its jurisdiction. The State/Tribe also
must provide for public participation in permit issuance and enforcement as required in section 7004(b) of RCRA.
Finally, EPA believes that the State/Tribe must show that it has sufficient compliance monitoring and enforcement
authorities to take specific action against any owner or operator that fails to comply with an approved MSWLF program.

EPA Regions will determine whether a State/Tribe has submitted an ``adequate'' program based on the interpretation
outlined above. EPA plans to provide more specific criteria for this evaluation when it proposes the State/Tribal
Implementation Rule. EPA expects States/Tribes to meet all of these requirements for all elements of a MSWLF program
before it gives full approval to a MSWLF program. 


B. State of Florida 


On July 20, 1993, Florida submitted an application for adequacy determination for their municipal solid waste landfill
permit program. On March 2, 1994, EPA published a tentative determination of adequacy for all portions of Florida's
program. Further background on the tentative determination of adequacy appears at 59 FR 9980-9983 (March 2,
1994). 
Along with the tentative determination, EPA announced the availability of the application for public comment and
a public hearing which was held by EPA_Region IV on April 25, 1994, in Tallahassee, Florida. The public comment period,
which originally ended on April 25, 1994, was extended an additional seven (7) days because of public interest. Comments
were accepted on the tentative determination through close of business on May 2, 1994. 


C. Public Comment 


EPA Region IV received written and oral comments during the public comment period and public hearing on the tentative
determination of adequacy for Florida. In addition to comments supporting EPA's determination, several issues
and concerns were raised, which are outlined and responded to below. 
1. Liner design_Comments received during the public comment period presented the following issues regarding Florida's
liner designs for municipal solid waste landfills: (1) Florida fails to require adequate liner design criteria which
complies with minimum federal requirements and that would reduce leaks and improve leak detection capabilities,
(2) Florida's liner designs contemplate the allowance of a double geomembrane liner without a low permeable clay
component, (3) many of the assumptions that Florida made in their required MuitiMed modelling efforts were not actually
indicative of conditions in Florida or did not present actual ``worst-case'' conditions, as is required when states
submit alternative liner designs for EPA review, and (4) Florida's liner design demonstration was based on a point
of compliance nearly 500 feet from the landfill boundary (almost five (5) times the distance allowed by state law).

EPA was charged with reviewing state municipal solid waste landfill permitting programs to determine if they meet
the standards presently set forth in the federal criteria for municipal solid waste landfills, which are found at
parts 257 and 258 of Chapter 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (40 CFR 257 and 258). Florida's regulations incorporate
ten (10) liner designs to be used in landfills in the state. Nine (9) of the liner designs are single composite systems
which incorporate_from top to bottom_a leachate collection system, a flexible synthetic membrane and a layer of
compacted soil (the federal standard liner system is also a composite requiring the same components, in the same order).
The tenth of Florida's designs is a double liner system, which incorporates_from top to bottom_a leachate collection
system, a flexible synthetic membrane, a second leachate collection/detection system, a second flexible synthetic
membrane and a layer of compacted soil. The state of Florida has presented information to satisfactorily demonstrate
that each of the liner systems prescribed in their regulations will meet the federal performance standard. 
EPA performed an extensive review of Florida's liner requirements and found them to be comparable to the federal criteria
at 40 CFR part 258. In addition, EPA Region IV retained an independent contractor to evaluate Florida's liner systems
and conferred with an EPA landfill liner expert. After thorough review of all submitted information, the contractor
also found Florida's liner systems to be comparable to the federal criteria. 
EPA's expert was called upon in the matter of Florida's assumption of 1 cm2/acre defect density in the flexible membrane
portion(s) of their liner system. According to the EPA expert, with appropriate quality assurance/quality control
(QA/QC) during installation of the flexible membranes, the referenced defect density is achievable and has been
extensively documented. The federal criteria at 40 CFR part 258 contain no specific QA/QC provisions. It is assumed
that QA/QC will be ensured prior to disposal of wastes in landfill units. As Florida's QA/QC requirements are quite
extensive and as it is the state alternative liner designs and not QA/QC that is being evaluated for comparability,
it is appropriate to assume that Florida will ensure that QA/QC requirements are met during installation of municipal
solid waste landfill liner systems in their state. 
Regarding the distance that Florida used for the point of compliance in their modelling, states must demonstrate
to EPA that proposed alternatives meet federal performance standards. The federal performance standard for liner
designs is that maximum concentration limits (MCLs) for listed constituents not be exceeded in the uppermost aquifer
at the point of compliance, which must be on the landfill owner/operator's property and within 150 meters (approximately
500 feet of the landfill unit boundary). Although Florida requires that MCLs not be exceeded at a maximum distance
of 100 feet (which is more restrictive than the federal criteria), utilization of the 500 foot distance is appropriate
for Florida's demonstration that their requirements meet the federal performance standards. 
2. Authority for and implications of approving alternative liner designs in Florida_Comments were received during
the public comment period questioning whether EPA is authorized to allow statewide alternative liner designs and
stating that Region IV's decision on Florida's liner designs will have national implications based on the presumption
that any alternative liner design that EPA approves for Florida must likewise be approved in other states, ``given
Florida's extreme vulnerability to groundwater pollution.'' EPA Headquarters has addressed the issue of EPA's
authority to approve statewide alternative liner designs for municipal solid waste landfills. After review of 40
CFR part 258, the preamble to part 258 and EPA Headquarters training materials on the implementation of part 258, EPA
Headquarters prepared a memorandum which concluded that the flexibility afforded to an approved State/Tribe allows
the application of an alternative liner design on a State/Tribal-wide basis so long as that design meets the performance
standard in all locations throughout the State/Tribe. 
Regarding the presumption that alternatives approved for Florida will have to be approved for other states, the State/Tribal
adequacy review process requires EPA to evaluate each state's municipal solid waste landfill permit program based
on the specifics of individual state requirements. Proposed alternatives to any of the federal standards are only
to be accepted if the state demonstrates that the alternative(s) would meet federal performance standards. States
proposing alternative liner designs are required to present data from analysis via the MultiMed fate and transport
model, which requires information that can only be expressed based on particular state conditions (eg., precipitation,
hydrologic conditions, etc.). EPA's decision to approve or disapprove a state's alternative liner design weighs
heavily on the results of this state-specific modelling. Therefore, approval of an alternative liner design in one
state would not automatically make the same liner approvable in another state.

3. Groundwater/Drinking Water_Comments received during the public comment period presented the following concerns
regarding the effects of municipal solid waste landfills on groundwater and drinking water in the State of Florida:
(1) Florida's present municipal solid waste landfill permit program fails to adequately protect high quality groundwater
and the State should prohibit landfills from being located in sensitive areas, such as above underground sources
of drinking water, and (2) there is the possibility of leachate discharges from municipal solid waste landfills contaminating
drinking water wells. 
The federal criteria require that groundwater be monitored for constituents at a distance no more than 150 meters
(approximately 500 feet) from the landfill unit boundary or at the landfill facility property boundary, whichever
is less. The point at which groundwater is monitored is to be chosen considering several factors, one of which is whether
the groundwater is used for drinking water. Florida's program meets these standards. Florida has made revisions
to their requirements to include all of the contaminants for which the federal standards require monitoring. Florida
also requires periodic sampling of leachate generated by the landfill to determine which contaminants would be of
concern in the event of a release to the subsurface. This analysis is not required by the federal criteria. Further,
as previously mentioned, Florida requires monitoring of groundwater and corrective action if groundwater is found
to be contaminated at a distance not to exceed 100 feet from the landfill unit boundary or at the landfill facility property
boundary, whichever is less. Again, Florida's 100 foot distance is more stringent than the federal criteria. 
Regarding landfills being sited in the vicinity of drinking water intakes, the federal criteria for locating municipal
solid waste landfills are very general and include restrictions (but not necessarily prohibitions) to locating
municipal solid waste landfills in floodplains, wetlands, fault areas, seismic impact zones, unstable areas and
areas in close vicinity to airports. The State of Florida's regulations have been deemed adequate in that they meet
the minimum federal requirements. The federal criteria at 40 CFR part 258 do not address drinking water intakes with
respect to locating landfills. Further, EPA cannot 

require

 Florida to adopt more stringent requirements to receive approval of their program. 
4. Health/Risk Assessment_Comments were received during the public comment period presenting the concern that
Florida's municipal solid waste landfill permit program fails to adequately assess the adverse impact on human health
resulting from exposure to landfill leachate in drinking water. It was suggested that Florida be required to evaluate
human health effects from chronic exposure to contaminants released from municipal solid waste. Addressing this
issue was beyond the scope of EPA's review of Florida's municipal solid waste landfill permitting program. However,
the types of complex health studies that are referenced are generally conducted as research projects by organizations
and health scientists trained in this field. Such work is ongoing in federally-funded laboratories, universities
and other research organizations. On occasion, these studies are conducted in community populations that are known
to have been exposed to environmental contaminants over an extended period of time and that claim to have a high level
of health problems believed to be associated with the contamination. With the multiple stresses and health problems
that typically exist in a community, it is extremely difficult to prove a causal association with a specific environmental
exposure. Such health studies are complex, difficult to interpret and often inconclusive. Therefore, a requirement
for health evaluations are not typically included, per se, in regulatory permit programs but rather these programs
use toxicity and risk assessment information to develop the technical permit requirements that would be health protective.
Florida's municipal solid waste landfill program was developed in a manner which satisfactorily meets the above
requirements. 
5. Public Participation_Comments were received during the public comment period petitioning for ``corrective
action to redress inadequate public participation in development of Florida's Solid Waste Management Plan.'' 
Under EPA's rules for public participation, a state, in its development of rules for a Subtitle D program, has the option
of following the requirements of the state's administrative procedures act, if one exists. Florida does have an administrative
procedures act and the State complied with its requirements in the rulemaking process. Accordingly, Florida has
complied with EPA's rules for public participation. In addition, EPA has provided public participation opportunities
in its review of whether the Florida program is adequate when compared to the criteria of 40 CFR Part 258. 
6. Environmental Justice_Comments were received during the public comment period suggesting that there should
be an evaluation of the environmental justice implications of Florida's municipal solid waste landfill permitting
rules prior to approval of Florida's program. There is concern that (1) Florida's program was ``developed with grossly
inadequate provisions for participation by persons most threatened by toxic pollution of their water supplies''
and (2) Florida's present program fails to provide equal protection to people obtaining drinking water from private
wells (low-income communities were specifically referenced).

Review of Florida's practices with respect to environmental justice was beyond the scope of this adequacy determination.
In an effort to address questions of environmental justice, EPA_Region IV established the Office of Environmental
Justice in 1993. In March 1994, President Clinton issued an Executive Order that is designed to focus federal attention
on the environmental and human health conditions in minority communities. EPA's primary objectives with respect
to environmental justice are: (a) ensure that all EPA Region IV environmental programs do not adversely impact minority
populations and persons living at or below the poverty level, (b) address complaints from communities regarding
subjection to a disproportionate burden of the pollution generated by industry and municipalities and (c) provide
for outreach programs that will bring minority communities, environmental groups, and government together on relevant
environmental issues. Guidelines for implementing these objectives and the requirements of the Executive Order
within EPA programs are presently being developed at the Regional and Headquarters levels.
7. Mandated Recycling_Comments were received during the public comment period suggesting that Florida be required
to mandate separation of recyclables and toxic contaminants from municipal solid waste prior to disposal in landfills.
The federal operating criteria for municipal solid waste landfills include procedures for excluding the receipt
of regulated hazardous waste, which require implementation of ``a program at the facility for detecting and preventing
the disposal of regulated hazardous wastes and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) wastes''. The state's program must
incorporate, at a minimum: random inspections of incoming loads, records of inspections, training facility personnel
to recognize prohibited wastes and notification of the proper authorities if a regulated hazardous waste or PCB is
discovered at the facility. Florida's program meets the federal requirements for exclusion of regulated hazardous
substances in municipal solid waste landfills. However, there presently are no federal regulations which mandate
recycling. Therefore, requiring separation of recyclables from municipal solid waste streams prior to disposal
is a decision which must be made on the state and/or local level.
The State of Florida's rules for municipal solid waste landfills are not enforceable at municipal solid waste landfills
located on Indian Lands in the State of Florida.


D. Decision


After reviewing the public comments, I conclude that Florida's application for adequacy determination meets all
of the statutory and regulatory requirements established by RCRA. Accordingly, Florida is granted a determination
of adequacy for all portions of its municipal solid waste permit program.
Section 4005(a) of RCRA provides that citizens may use the citizen suit provisions of Section 7002 of RCRA to enforce
the federal MSWLF criteria in 40 CFR part 258 independent of any State/Tribal enforcement program. As EPA explained
in the preamble to the final MSWLF criteria, EPA expects that any owner or operator complying with provisions in a State/Tribal
program approved by EPA should be considered to be in compliance with the federal criteria. See 56 

FR

 50978, 50995 (October 9, 1991).
Today's action takes effect on the date of publication. EPA believes it has good cause under section 553(d) of the Administrative
Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 553(d), to put this action into effect less than 30 days after publication in the 

Federal Register

. All of the requirements and obligations in the State's/Tribe's program are already in effect as a matter of State/Tribal
law. EPA's action today does not impose any new requirements with which the regulated community must begin to comply.
Nor do these requirements become enforceable by EPA as federal law. Consequently, EPA finds that it does not need to
give notice prior to making its approval effective.


Compliance With Executive Order 12866


The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the requirements of Section 6 of Executive Order 12866.


Certification Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act


Pursuant to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 605(b), I hereby certify that this approval will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities. It does not impose any new burdens on small entities. This rule, therefore,
does not require a regulatory flexibility analysis.





Authority:

 This notice is issued under the authority of sections 2002, 4005 and 4010(c) of the Solid Waste Disposal Act as amended;
42 U.S.C. 6912, 6945, 6949a(c).

<DOCTITLE>Public Information Collection Requirement Submitted to Office of Management and Budget for Review </DOCTITLE>
 


July 5, 1994. 
 


The Federal Communications Commission has submitted the following information collection requirement to OMB for
review and clearance under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3507). 
 
Copies of this submission may be purchased from the Commission's copy contractor, International Transcription
Service, Inc., 2100 M Street, N.W., Suite 140, Washington, DC 20037, (202) 857-3800. For further information
on this submission contact Judy Boley, Federal Communications Commission, (202) 632-0276. Persons wishing
to comment on this information collection should contact Timothy Fain, Office of Management and Budget, Room 10236
NEOB, Washington, DC 20503, (202) 395-3561. 
 


 
 

OMB Number: 3060-0292 
 
Title: Part 69, Access Charges 
 
Action: Extension of a currently approved collection 
 
Respondents: State or local governments and businesses or other for-profit 
 
Frequency of Response: Monthly, semi-annually reporting requirements and one-time requirement 
 
Estimated Annual Burden: 5,832 responses; 5.8 hours average burden per response; 33,825 hours total annual burden

 
Needs and Uses: Part 69 of the Commission's rules and regulations establishes the rules for access charges for interstate
or foreign access provided by telephone companies on or after January 1, 1984. Part 69 essentially consists of rules
or the procedures for the computation of access charges which are not information collections as defined by 5 CFR 1320.
Any reporting or disclosure requirements occurs in connection with particular tariff filings with the FCC or other
state commissions or with records maintained in accordance to the Uniform Systems of Accounts (USOA). Section 69.3
requires the annual submission of access charge tariffs. Section 69.116(c) and 69.117(c) requires LECs to file information
with NECA semi-annually pertaining to the number of lines in their study areas and interexchange carriers to which
such lines are presubscribed. This information will be used by NECA to assess revenue requirements needed to fund
the Universal Service Fund and Lifeline Assistance Programs. Section 69.104(k)(1) requires that a state or local
telephone company wishing to implement an end user common line reduction or waiver for its subscribers file information
with the FCC demonstrating that its state lifeline assistance plan meets certain criteria. This is a one-time filing
requirement. Section 69.104(l) requires local telephone carriers to calculate for NECA their projected revenue
requirements for the lifeline assistance programs. Section 69.605 requires carriers who are participating in the
pool to report access revenues and cost data so that NECA may compute monthly pool revenues distributions. The information
is used by FCC staff to compute charges in tariffs for access service (or origination and termination) and to compute
revenue pool distributions. Neither process could be implemented without the information.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Part I_General Information 


A. Program Purpose 


Head Start is a national program providing comprehensive developmental services primarily to low-income preschool
children and their families. To help enrolled children achieve their full potential, Head Start programs provide
comprehensive health, nutritional, educational, social, and other services. In addition Head Start programs are
required to provide for the direct participation of the parents of enrolled children in the development, conduct,
and direction of local programs. Head Start currently serves approximately 713,000 children through a network of
approximately 1,395 grantees. 
While Head Start is targeted primarily toward children whose families have incomes at or below the poverty line or
who are eligible for public assistance, regulations permit up to 10 percent of the Head Start children in local programs
to be from families which do not meet these low-income criteria. Head Start regulations also require that a minimum
of 10 percent of enrollment opportunities in each program be made available to children with disabilities. Such children
are expected to be enrolled in the full range of Head Start services and activities in a mainstream setting with their
non-disabled peers, and to receive needed special education and related services. 


B. Background on Demonstration Project ``A Head Start on Science'' 


The report from the Advisory Committee on Head Start Quality and Expansion emphasizes that quality services to Head
Start families must be given priority attention by all Head Start programs. The report underscored the need for staff
development and training and supports initiatives designed to increase staff understanding of concepts and principles
which will help them become more effective in early childhood settings. 
This project is designed to link colleges and universities to Head Start programs for the purpose of teaching science
to Head Start staff. Highly intensive, hands-on instruction will provide teachers, assistants, and home visitors
with exposure to the principles of science and increase their insights and skills regarding how to take their college
campus experience and create classroom environments which invite child exploration and discovery. The staff will
also increase their understanding of the natural learning environment presented by the out-of-doors, and the child's
own home. We expect that ``A Head Start on Science'' model will be developed and documented in suitable printed and
visual materials to be used to transmit the concept and approaches to other institutions of higher learning and Head
Start communities. Project funds may also be used to present and distribute information at appropriate regional
and national Head Start events, and to members of the Head Start training and technical assistance network. Also,
it would be appropriate for the grantee to develop strategies and products which will assist other local Head Start
programs to negotiate with their local college or university for similar staff training. 
We believe that as a result of participating in ``A Head Start on Science'' demonstration project, Head Start teachers,
teacher assistants, and home visitors will be instrumental in creating a lifelong interest in science both for themselves
and for the children and families with whom they work. We believe that staff will be impacted by the knowledge that science
is found not only in a laboratory under a microscope, but in the everyday world in which they live. As a result of this
experience, teachers, assistants and home visitors' concepts of science and their own scientific abilities will
increase and in turn have a powerful effect on their ability to engage in discovery and establish environments in which
children and families may explore, discover and interpret scientific activities. 

This announcement is soliciting applications from four-year colleges or universities, i.e., institutions of higher
learning that grant degrees. Awards, on a competitive basis, will be for a one-year budget period, although projects
periods may be for two years. Applications for continuation grants funded under these awards beyond the one-year
budget period but within the two year project period will be entertained in subsequent years on a non-competitive
basis, subject to availability of funds, satisfactory progress of the grantee and a determination that continued
funding would be in the best interest of the Government. The Department of Health and Human Services will award one
grant under this announcement. Up to $550,000 will be available for a 24 month project period. 

In the first year of the grant, the grantee institution will use these funds to create, demonstrate and evaluate a summer
institute prototype on their campus during the summer of 1995 with follow-up assistance to Head Start staff graduates
as they implement their new skills at their local programs. Also in year one the grantee will recruit another college
or university in which to replicate the model in year two.

In the second year of this grant, the grantee institution will improve the prototype program based on year-one experiences,
and will offer the hands-on science program to a new group of Head Start staff during the summer 1996. Also during the
second year, the ``A Head Start on Science'' grantee will fund for one year, and mentor another college or university
to: (1) implement the prototype ``A Head Start on Science'' model in the summer of 1996 and; (2) provide follow-up assistance
to the Head Start staff as they plan to implement their new skills in their local programs. The addition of a second institution
will provide the opportunity to evaluate the effectiveness and transferability of the concept. 
Throughout the grant period, a third party evaluator must be secured by the grantee institution to assess the effectiveness
of the approach, content and transferability of the ``A Head Start on Science'' project. The third party evaluator
must not be involved in the conduct of the demonstration. The evaluation of the students in both institutes in the summer
of 1996 will be completed by the end of the project period. It should focus on the students' plans for the implementation
of the program and principles. 


C. Statutory Authority 


The Head Start Act, as amended, 42 U.S.C. 9801 et seq. 


D. Project Period and Funding 


A total of approximately $550,000 in ACF funds will be available to fund the demonstration project for a 24 month period.
Applicants must propose how much will be needed for each 12 month period of the project. 
The grantee must provide at least 20 percent of the total cost of the project. The total approved cost of the project
is the sum of the ACF share and the non-Federal share. The non-Federal share may be met by cash or in-kind contributions,
although applicants are encouraged to meet their match requirements through cash contributions. Therefore, a project
requesting $550,000 in Federal funds (based on an award of approximately $275,000 per budget period) must provide
 137,500 in cash or in-kind contributions (20% of total project costs of $687,500). 


E. Eligible Applicants 


Applicants must be either two year or four year institutions of higher learning which are colleges or universities
having the capability to create, demonstrate and evaluate a summer institute prototype. 


Part II_Special Requirements 



A. Colleges and universities are eligible to apply for these funds. The college or university must also be able to award
college credit to Head Start staff that successfully complete the summer program. 
B. The project should be directed toward Head Start teachers, teachers' assistants and/or home visitors. 
C. Funds may be used for university operating expenses and related costs. Related costs include such activities as
planning and development costs, administration, supplies, insurance, university staff salaries, training provided
at Head Start events and the third party evaluation. 
D. The university or college institute teaching team will be comprised of individuals with knowledge of science,
adult learning, and early childhood education. 


Part III_Specific Responsibilities of the Applicant 


When submitting an application under this announcement, applicants should include a maximum of 50 typed, doubled-spaced
pages. Applicants interested in submitting an application for the training prototype must: 

A. Describe the design of the project. Include a description of how the summer institutes will address the unique needs
of teachers, teacher assistants and/or home visitors.

B. Provide a sample curriculum for the summer institute participants based on content and approach which will help
increase participants' knowledge of science, increase their understanding and skills regarding how to create classroom
environments, and capitalize on the out-of-doors and family settings as areas of scientific exploration and learning.

C. List projected field experiences appropriate to the location of the college and Head Start programs. These may
include trips to the ocean, visiting a quarry, aquarium, desert, nature trail, or wild life reserve. Information
submitted should include the total number of hours of the institute program including a breakout of instruction vs.
field trip experiences. 
D. Describe a plan for how many participants will be included in each summer program and how these participants will
be recruited. 
E. Describe what provisions will be made for residential, intensive summer institutes for Head Start teachers, teacher
assistants, and/or home visitors. 

F. Describe provision of materials, lunch and snacks, stipend or reimbursement, transportation to field activities,
entry fees. 
G. Describe the college credit to be awarded for work completed during the summer institute and for implementing new
knowledge and practice back at local programs. 
H. Describe the plan for the extension of the summer 
institute into Head Start settings and the provision of on-site feedback and ongoing support for adults applying
their new skills. 
I. Explain the criteria and the approach to be used to recruit, fund, and mentor another teacher education college
for the second year of the project. 
J. Develop an evaluation of the project to determine the effectiveness of the project. Describe the research questions
to be addressed. Describe the evaluation that would be implemented, including the outcomes that would be measured,
the evaluation design to be employed, and how the data will be analyzed. The evaluation should also include an analysis
of the second summer institutes. The project and the evaluation will be completed by the end of the project period.

K. Provide a description of the qualifications of each key staff member including the third-party evaluator (the
evaluator cannot be a member of the demonstration project staff). Include copies of their curriculum vitae. 
L. Describe a plan to establish a self sustaining project, since this will be a prototype other colleges and universities
may want to adapt. It is expected that the applicant may pay for more activities and services during the first year;
however, attempts should be made to run a more self supporting program by year two. Outside resources or Head Start
grantees that see these services as a priority can support some of the cost of the training.

This program announcement does not contain information collection requirements beyond those approved for ACF grant
applications under OMB Control Number 0348-0043. 




G. Executive Order 12372_Notification Process 



This program is covered under Executive Order 12372, ``Intergovernmental Review of Federal Programs,'' and 45 CFR
Part 100, ``Intergovernmental Review of Department of Health and Human Services Programs and Activities.'' Under
Executive Order 12372, States may design their own processes for reviewing and commenting on proposed Federal assistance
under covered programs. 


All States and territories except Alabama, Alaska, Connecticut, Colorado, Hawaii, Idaho, Kansas, Louisiana, Minnesota,
Montana, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Virginia, Washington, American Samoa, and Palau
have elected to participate in the Executive Order process and have established Single Points of Contact (SPOCs).
Applicants from these 19 jurisdictions areas need not take action regarding Executive Order 12372. Applications
for projects to be administered by Federally-recognized Indian Tribes are exempt from the requirements of Executive
Order 12372. Otherwise, applicants should contact their SPOC as soon as possible to alert them to the prospective
application and to receive any necessary instructions. Applicants must submit any required material to the SPOC
as early as possible so that the program office can obtain and review SPOC comments as part of the award process. It is
imperative that the applicant submit all required materials, if any, to the SPOC and indicate the date of this submittal
(or date of contact if no submittal is required) on the SF 424, item 16a. 


SPOCs have 30 days from the application deadline date to comment on applications submitted under this announcement.
We are requesting a shortened period for SPOC review. SPOCs are encouraged to eliminate the submission of routine
endorsements as official recommendations. Additionally, SPOCs are requested to clearly differentiate between
mere advisory comments and those official State process recommendations which they intend to trigger the ``accommodate
or explain'' rule. 


When comments are submitted directly to ACF, they should be addressed to: Department of Health and Human Services,
Administration for Children and Families, Division of Discretionary Grants, 370 L'Enfant Promenade, S.W., 6th
floor, Aerospace Building, Washington, D.C. 20447. ACF will notify the State of any application received which has
no indication that the State process has had an opportunity for review. 

A list of SPOCs for each State and territory is included at Appendix A at the end of this announcement.

Instructions for the SF-424A



General Instructions



This form is designed so that application can be made for funds from one or more grant programs. In preparing the budget,
adhere to any existing Federal grantor agency guidelines which prescribe how and whether budgeted amounts should
be separately shown for different functions or activities within the program. For some programs, grantor agencies
may require budgets to be separately shown by function or activity. For other programs, grantor agencies may require
a breakdown by function or activity. Sections A, B, C, and D should include budget estimates for the whole project except
when applying for assistance which requires Federal authorization in annual or other funding period increments.
In the latter case, Sections A, B, C, and D should provide the budget for the first budget period (usually a year) and
Section E should present the need for Federal assistance in the subsequent budget periods. All applications should
contain a breakdown by the object class categories shown in Lines a-k of Section B.



Section A. Budget Summary

Lines 1-4, Columns (a) and (b)



For applications pertaining to a 

single 

Federal grant program (Federal Domestic Assistance Catalog number) and 

not requiring 

a functional or activity breakdown, enter on Line 1 under Column (a) the catalog program title and the catalog number
in Column (b).

For applications pertaining to a 

single 

program 

requiring

 budget amounts by multiple functions or activities, enter the name of each activity or function on each line in Column
(a), and enter the catalog number in Column (b). For applications pertaining to multiple programs where none of the
programs require a breakdown by function or activity, enter the catalog program title on each line in 

Column 

(a) and the respective catalog number on each line in Column (b).

For applications pertaining to 

multiple

 programs where one or more programs 

require

 a breakdown by function or activity, prepare a separate sheet for each program requiring the breakdown. Additional
sheets should be used when one form does not provide adequate space for all breakdown of data required. However, when
more than one sheet is used, the first page should provide the summary totals by programs.



Lines 1-4, Columns (c) through (g)



For 

new applications

, leave Columns (c) and (d) blank. For each line entry in Columns (a) and (b), enter in Columns (e), (f), and (g) the appropriate
amounts of funds needed to support the project for the first funding period (usually a year).



For continuing grant program applications

, submit these forms before the end of each funding period as required by the grantor agency. Enter in Columns (c) and
(d) the estimated amounts of funds which will remain unobligated at the end of the grant funding period only if the Federal
grantor agency instructions provide for this. Otherwise, leave these columns blank. Enter in columns (e) and (f)
the amounts of funds needed for the upcoming period. The amount(s) in Column (g) should be the sum of amounts in Columns
(e) and (f).



For supplemental grants and changes 

to existing grants, do not use Columns (c) and (d). Enter in Column (e) the amount of the increase or decrease of Federal
funds and enter in Column (f) the amount of the increase or decrease of non-Federal funds. In Column (g) enter the new
total budgeted amount (Federal and non-Federal) which includes the total previous authorized budgeted amounts
plus or minus, as appropriate, the amounts shown in Columns (e) and (f). The amount(s) in Column (g) should not equal
the sum of amounts in Columns (e) and (f).

Line 5_Show the totals for all columns used.



Section B. Budget Categories



In the column headings (1) through (4), enter the titles of the same programs, functions, and activities shown on Lines
1-4, Column (a), Section A. When additional sheets are prepared for Section A, provide similar column headings
on each sheet. For each program, function or activity, fill in the total requirements for funds (both Federal and non-Federal)
by object class categories.

Lines 6a-i_Show the totals of Lines 6a to 6h in each column.

Line 6j_Show the amount of indirect cost.

Line 6k_Enter the total of amounts on Lines 6i and 6j. For all applications for new grants and continuation grants the
total amount in column (5), Line 6k, should be the same as the total amount shown in Section A, Column (g), Line 5. For
supplemental grants and changes to grants, the total amount of the increase or decrease as shown in Columns (1)-(4),
Line 6k should be the same as the sum of the amounts in Section A, Columns (e) and (f) on Line 5.

Environmental Health Education Activities for Health Professionals and Communities Concerned With Human Exposure
to Hazardous Substances in the Environment 


Introduction 


The Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) announces the availability of fiscal year (FY) 1994
funds for a cooperative agreement program to conduct health education activities related to human exposures to hazardous
substances in the environment. The Public Health Service (PHS) is committed to achieving the health promotion and
disease prevention objectives of ``Healthy People 2000,'' a PHS-led national activity to reduce morbidity and mortality
and improve the quality of life. This announcement is related to the priority area of Environmental Health. (For ordering
a copy of ``Healthy People 2000,'' see the section 

Where to Obtain Additional Information

.) 


Authority 


This program is authorized under Sections 104(i) (14) and (15) of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation,
and Liability Act (CERCLA) of 1980, as amended by the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act (SARA) of 1986
[42 U.S.C. 9604(i) (14) and (15)]. 


Smoke-Free Workplace 


The Public Health Service strongly encourages all grant recipients to provide a smoke-free workplace and promote
the non-use of all tobacco products. This is consistent with the PHS mission to protect and advance the physical and
mental health of the American people. 


Eligible Applicants 


Eligible applicants are the official public health agencies of States or their bona fide agents or instrumentalities.
This includes the District of Columbia, American Samoa, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, the
Federated States of Micronesia, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the Republic
of Palau, and federally recognized Indian tribal governments. 


Availability of Funds 


Approximately $1,340,000 is available in FY 1994 to fund approximately 19 awards. It is expected that 10 noncompeting
continuation awards will be made for approximately $598,000. Approximately 9 new awards will be made for approximately
$742,000. The average new award will be $80,000 ranging from $75,000 to $85,000. It is expected that the awards will
begin on or about September 30, 1994, with a 12-month budget period within a project period of 3 years. Funding estimates
may vary and are subject to change. Continuation awards within the project period are made on the basis of satisfactory
progress and availability of funds. 


Purpose 


The overall purpose of the program is to work toward the ultimate goal of reducing exposures to hazardous substances
and mitigating potential adverse health effects from such exposures. Applications should describe how progress
toward this goal will be measured. This program will assist State health or environmental departments to identify,
develop, disseminate, and evaluate appropriate educational materials and programs on the potential health effects,
prevention, medical surveillance, screening, and methods of diagnosis and treatment of injury or disease related
to exposure to hazardous substances in the environment. Special emphasis will be placed on exposures found at or near
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Superfund sites, and other sites identified by ATSDR's Health Activities
Recommendation Panel (HARP). See Health Activities Recommendation Panel (HARP) below for a description of HARP.
(Superfund sites are defined as sites on, or proposed to be on, the EPA's National Priorities List (NPL)). HARP sites
include petitioned sites and consultation sites, in addition to NPL sites. A list of HARP-recommended sites will
be included with the application package. Following are definitions or descriptions of the activities to be performed:

Site-Specific Preventive Health Education_An activity designed to address health risks in a community where presenting
specific information or recommendations can assist the community in understanding, preventing, or mitigating
the health effects of hazardous substances exposure. Target audiences are community members and health professionals.
Preventive health education related to sites should be integral to the entire public health activities process and
not simply performed when all other activities are completed. Sites for health education should be selected based
on public health need. 
The following describes the two types of site-specific preventive health education activities. 





Community Health Education_

Any activity or activities directed toward the community near a site, designed to assist the community in understanding
their potential for exposure or assessing adverse health occurrence in their community and to prevent or mitigate
exposure to hazardous substances. Activities may include disseminating written materials, presenting coordinated
programs involving on-site actions and site-specific materials development (prevention oriented), or supporting
an on site health educator. It is assumed that in community health education, community members are involved in the
assessment, policy development, and assurance phases of site-specific preventive health education. 



Health Professional Education_

Any activity or activities directed toward educating public health professionals and the local medical community.
The purpose of these activities is to improve the knowledge, skill, and behavior of health professionals concerning
medical surveillance, screening, and methods of diagnosing, treating, and preventing injury or disease related
to exposure to hazardous substances. See 

Recipient Activities 

for a description of types of activities. 




General Environmental Health Education_Programs and materials for health professionals that may not be directly
related to a site, but contribute to the base of knowledge in environmental health and help equip health professionals
to more effectively address environmental health issues. A partial list of appropriate and inappropriate topics
to be addressed by these efforts follows: 






Sample of Appropriate Topics: 

Superfund site hazardous substances on the priority pollutant list (the ranked list of substances prioritized by
ATSDR and the EPA appears in 

Federal Register

 issue 56 FR 52166, October 17, 1991); environmental exposure histories; resources for environmental health information;
environmental toxicology; environmental epidemiology; and health risk communication. 



Sample of Inappropriate Topics: 

Occupational health/workplace exposures; radon; indoor air; sick building syndrome; secondhand smoke; ozone;
air pollution; carbon monoxide poisoning; childhood lead poisoning (unless site-related); greenhouse effect;
insect repellents; and household chemicals. 





Health Activities Recommendation Panel (HARP)_This is a multidisciplinary intra-Agency panel established to
evaluate the data and information contained in public health assessments, health consultations, public health
advisories and other documents developed by ATSDR to determine public health follow-up actions_including environmental
health education_needed for communities affected by exposures to hazardous substances present at hazardous waste
sites nationwide. States funded under the health education cooperative agreement may be asked to participate in
HARP review of selected sites, when appropriate. 


Program Requirements 



In conducting activities to achieve the purpose of this program, the recipient shall be responsible for the activities
under A., below, and ATSDR shall be responsible for conducting activities under B., below: 



A. Recipient Activities 



1. Site-Specific Preventive Health Education 



Site-specific preventive health education includes activities for health professionals, communities, and that
apply to both audiences. 

a. 

Health professionals. 

(1) Develop for health professionals site-related educational activities. Sites to be addressed include: sites
listed or proposed for the National Priorities List (NPL); HARP-recommended sites; sites that have had consultations
or petitions, and other sites where the State and ATSDR determine health education is needed. Activities relevant
to hazardous substances found at these sites are also appropriate. Activities include grand rounds, short courses,
and workshops. 

(2) Develop educational materials to improve the 
skills and knowledge of health professionals concerning potential exposure to hazardous substances at Superfund
(or HARP) sites. If non-printed materials are to be developed, the applicant must thoroughly describe the materials,
and justify their superiority over traditional educational materials. 

b. 

Communities. 

Develop and conduct community health education activities and materials related to potential exposure to hazardous
substances at sites as described above in 1.a. The recipient should give priority to HARP-recommended sites and those
sites where community members can take specific actions to reduce or eliminate exposure to hazardous substances.

for educational activities and materials.


2. 

General Environmental Health Education


Up to 20% of health education efforts can be devoted to developing for health professionals general educational materials
and programs that may not be directly related to a site, but expand the base of knowledge in the area of environmental
health. Types of activities could include grand rounds, short courses, workshops, or curriculum development. Topics,
for example, could include materials or programs on: improving the knowledge and skills of health care providers
in determining potential hazardous substance exposure as an integral part of their patient workup (i.e., taking
exposure histories); environmental toxicology; environmental epidemiology; and health risk communication.
General environmental education activities must also be evaluated.


B. ATSDR Activities

Public Health System Reporting Requirements 



This program is not subject to the Public Health System Reporting Requirements. 



Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance Number 



The Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance number is 93.200. 



Other Requirements 



A. Paperwork Reduction Act 



Projects that involve the collection of information from 10 or more individuals and funded by cooperative agreement
will be subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the Paperwork Reduction Act. 



B. Technical Review 



All protocols, studies, and results of research that ATSDR carries out or funds in whole or in part will be peer reviewed
to meet the requirements of CERCLA Section 104(i)(13), as amended by SARA. 



C. Cost Recovery 



CERCLA as amended by SARA, provides for the recovery of costs incurred for response actions at each Superfund site
from potentially responsible parties. The recipient would agree to maintain an accounting system that will keep
an accurate, complete, and current accounting of all financial transactions on a site-specific basis, i.e., individual
time, travel, and associated cost including indirect cost, as appropriate for the site. The recipient would also
maintain documentation that describes the site-specific response actions taken with respect to the site, e.g.,
contracts, work assignments, progress reports, and other documents that describe the work performed at a site. The
recipient will retain the documents and records to support these financial transactions and documentation of work
performed, for possible use in a cost recovery case, for a minimum of ten (10) years after submission of a final Financial
Status Report (FSR), unless there is litigation, claim, negotiation, audit or other action involving the specific
site, then the records will be maintained until resolution of all issues on the specific site. 



D. Third Party Agreements 



Project activities which are approved for contracting pursuant to the prior approval provisions shall be formalized
in a written agreement that clearly establishes the relationship between the recipient and the third party. 

The written agreement shall at a minimum: 

1. State or incorporate by reference all applicable requirements imposed on the contractors under the terms of the
grant and/or cooperative agreement, including requirements concerning technical review (ATSDR selected reviewers),
ownership of data, and the arrangement for copyright when publications, data, or other copyrightable works are developed

2. State that any copyrighted or copyrightable works shall be subject to a royalty-free, nonexclusive, and irrevocable
license to the government to reproduce, publish, or otherwise use them, and to authorize others to do so for Federal
government purposes. 

3. State that whenever any work subject to this copyright policy may be developed in the course of a grant by a contractor
under a grant, the written agreement (contract) must require the contractor to comply with these requirements and
can in no way diminish the government's right in that work.

4. State the activities to be performed, the time schedule for those activities, the policies and procedures to be
followed in carrying out the agreement, and the maximum amount of money for which the grantee may become liable to the
third party under the agreement. 

The written agreement required shall not relieve the recipient of any part of its responsibility or accountability
to PHS under the cooperative agreement. The agreement shall, therefore, retain sufficient rights and control to
the recipient to enable it to fulfill this responsibility and accountability.

Provisions of the Great Lakes Critical Programs Act of 1990 require the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), in
consultation with ATSDR and the Great Lakes States, to initiate a research program and submit a report to Congress
assessing the harmful human health effects of water pollutants in the Great Lakes basin. The ATSDR Great Lakes Human
Health Effects Research Program focuses on populations that have been identified as having a higher risk of long-term
adverse health effects from exposure to Great Lakes contaminants in fish. They include Native Americans, sport anglers,
urban poor, and fetuses and nursing infants of mothers who consume contaminated Great Lakes fish. 
In FY 1992, ATSDR awarded nine research grants designed to investigate and characterize the association between
the consumption of contaminated Great Lakes fish and potential long-term adverse health effects. The draft ATSDR
annual report for FY 1992 describes the Great Lakes Human Health Effects Research Program's strategy, and the research
activities and status of the nine awarded grants.

Purpose 


The purpose of this cooperative agreement is to enable State public health agencies to implement and evaluate priority
injury prevention and control 
activities. Specifically, State public health agencies may submit applications to develop programs in EACH OR ANY
of six areas: 
1. Prevention of bicycle-related head injuries through increased usage of bicycle helmets; 
2. Prevention of fire-related burns through increased installation and utilization of smoke detectors; 
3. Prevention of motor vehicle injuries through increased usage of occupant protection, including seat belts, child
safety seats, and air bags; 
4. Identification of firearm-related injuries; 
5. Identification and prevention of violence against women; and 
6. Identification and prevention of alcohol-related injuries. 
Programs in any of these six areas will develop, implement, and evaluate targeted activities designed to accurately
measure and reduce morbidity, mortality, severity, disability, and costs associated with injuries. This funding
will allow the applicant to establish or strengthen a lead capacity for prevention and control of the targeted injury
(e.g., bicycle-related head injuries). It is expected that any program developed will function as a component of
the public health agency's injury control program, will coordinate related activities both within the agency and
within the jurisdiction, and will mobilize, seek input from, and utilize broad coalitions.

as intended. The document is a revised version of previously published recommendations documents. This action is
part of FDA's commitment to help ensure the safety and effectiveness of medical devices.



</SUMMARY>

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:





 I. Background



FDA is committed to carrying out a program to help ensure the safety and effectiveness of medical devices. One aspect
of this program involves regulatory activities under the laws administered by the agency concerning the design,
manufacture, and distribution of medical devices. Patient safety, however, is dependent on more than properly functioning
devices. Although proper operation, maintenance, and periodic inspection of these devices by the user are matters
that cannot always be addressed effectively through regulatory action under the laws administered by the agency,
they are essential to minimize risks to patients. Consequently, as an important adjunct to its regulatory program,
FDA has initiated a variety of educational efforts to aid medical professionals in the safe use of medical devices.
These educational endeavors are conducted in cooperation with, and usually with the active participation of, the
relevant professional organizations and other groups within the private sector.

For example, to reduce unnecessary retakes in radiology and to improve image quality, FDA, in cooperation with the
American College of Radiology and other private sector organizations, developed voluntary recommendations for
radiology facilities concerning equipment quality assurance programs (``A Basic Quality Assurance Program for
Small Diagnostic Radiology Facilities,'' FDA 83-8218). In cooperation with the American College of Radiology
and numerous other medical professional societies, FDA also fostered the development of guides for clinicians on
the effective use of selected diagnostic imaging procedures (``The Selection of Patients for X-ray Examinations,''
FDA 80-8104; ``The Selection of Patients for X-ray Examinations: The Pelvimetry Examination,'' FDA 81-8174;
``The Selection of Patients for X-ray Examinations: Chest X-ray Screening and Examination,'' FDA 83-8204).
As an adjunct to the teaching of medical students and radiology residents, FDA funded the development of a basic teaching
system in radiology, ``The Radiological Health Sciences Learning File,'' which is now in use in radiology education
and is used in 118 medical schools in the United States and in several foreign medical schools as well. These examples
illustrate FDA's commitment to ensuring that users of medical devices are sufficiently educated and motivated to
use medical devices safely and effectively.



II. Scope of the 1993 Recommendations Document


The recommendations document that the agency is now making available a revised version of the draft document entitled
``Draft Anesthesia Apparatus Checkout Recommendations, 1992,'' that was announced in the 

Federal Register

 of October 6, 1992 (57 FR 46033), and that was based on the original document entitled ``Draft Anesthesia Apparatus
Checkout Recommendations,'' that was announced in the 

Federal Register

 of February 27, 1987 (52 FR 5583). FDA also intends to make this document available to anesthesia clinicians through
their professional organizations and to anesthesia equipment manufacturers so that they may include it in their
user education programs.

The recommendations in ``Anesthesia Apparatus Checkout Recommendations, 1993'' should be followed for anesthesia
systems that conform to current and relevant standards (such as ``Standard Specifications for Minimum Performance
and Safety Requirements for Components and Systems of Anesthesia Gas Machines,'' ASTM F-1161-88) and
that include an ascending bellows ventilator and at least the following monitors: Capnograph, pulse oximeter, oxygen
analyzer, respiratory volume monitor (spirometer) and breathing system pressure monitor with high and low pressure
alarms. However, the recommendations document offers guidance that users are encouraged to modify to accommodate
differences in equipment design and variations in local clinical practice. Such local modifications should have
appropriate peer review. The original recommendations document (52 FR 5583) should be followed for other anesthesia
systems. Users should refer to the operators manual for specific procedures and precautions.

In response to the draft document entitled ``Anesthesia Apparatus Checkout Recommendations, 1992'' (57 FR 46033),
eight comments were received and reviewed by the agency. Some minor refinements were made to the checkout recommendations
in response to the comments.

FDA believes that the pre-use inspection procedure provided in the checkout recommendations will aid medical professionals
in the safe use of anesthesia devices. FDA regards the pre-use inspection procedure to be a recommendation as defined
in  10.90(c) (21 CFR 10.90(c)). Therefore, the checklist is being made available under  10.90(c) of the
agency's administrative practices and procedures regulations. That regulation provides for FDA to formulate and
disseminate recommendations about matters that are authorized by, but do not involve direct regulatory action under,
the laws administered by the agency.

ACTION: 

Notice.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is announcing the revocation of the establishment license (U.S. License No.
314) and product license issued to the North Carolina Memorial Hospital, doing business as the Clinical Coagulation
Laboratory, for the manufacture of Source Plasma. In a letter to FDA dated February 10, 1993, the firm voluntarily
requested revocation of its establishment and product licenses and thereby waived an opportunity for a hearing.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

FDA has revoked the establishment license (U.S. License No. 314) and the product license issued to the North Carolina
Memorial Hospital, doing business as the Clinical Coagulation Laboratory, University of North Carolina School
of Medicine, Chapel Hill, NC 27514, for the manufacture of Source Plasma.


FDA conducted an inspection of the Clinical Coagulation Laboratory between July 30 and August 15, 1991. The inspection
documented serious deviations from the applicable Federal regulations and the biologics standards in the firm's
license. Deviations identified during the inspection included, but were not limited to, the following: (1) Failure
to adequately determine donor suitability, in that: (a) three donors who admitted to a history of hepatitis, liver
disease, or jaundice were regularly accepted for Source Plasma donation (21 CFR 640.63(c)(11)); (b) two donors who
previously tested repeatedly reactive for the hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) continued to be accepted for donation,
despite having never met the established criteria for donor reentry as described in the December 2, 1987, FDA HBsAg
protocol (21 CFR 610.41); (c) two donors who failed to donate for a period of 6 months were not processed as new donors
(21 CFR 640.65(b)(1)(iii)); and (d) five donors did not have serum protein electrophoresis testing performed every
4 months (21 CFR 640.65(b)(1)(i)); (2) failure to limit the frequency of Source Plasma donation to two times within
a 7-day period, in that at least two donors were allowed to donate three times in a 7-day period (21 CFR 640.65(b)(5));
(3) failure to observe, standardize, and calibrate equipment used in the collection, processing, and distribution
of blood components (21 CFR 606.60); (4) failure to maintain adequate and complete standard operating procedures
for all steps in the collection, processing, storage, and distribution of blood components (21 CFR 606.100(b));
and (5) failure to report important changes in responsible personnel or manufacturing methods to FDA's Center for
Biologics Evaluation and Research (21 CFR 601.12 (a) and (b)).
FDA determined that the deviations from Federal regulations were significant and constituted a danger to public
health, warranting a suspension pursuant to 21 CFR 601.6(a). In a letter to the North Carolina Memorial Hospital dated
September 3, 1991, FDA detailed the violations noted above and suspended the firm's establishment and product licenses
for the manufacture of Source Plasma. In a letter to the firm dated May 20, 1992, FDA indicated that the firm had responded
satisfactorily to FDA's September 3, 1991, suspension letter. In the same letter, FDA permitted the firm to resume
collecting and storing Source Plasma on a limited basis for the purpose of reinspection to determine compliance.
FDA conducted a followup inspection of the firm between July 27 and July 29, 1992. The inspection documented several
continuing deviations from Federal regulations. These deviations included, but were not limited to, the following:
(1) Inadequate facilities to provide for the storage of blood or blood components; (2) incomplete or incorrect disposition
records; and (3) incomplete or inadequate written procedures. FDA permitted the firm to continue to collect and store
Source Plasma on a limited basis, but FDA did not permit the firm to distribute the prepared plasma until otherwise
notified by FDA.
FDA attempted to conduct a reinspection of the firm on February 2, 1993, to, in part, determine the firm's status. During
this inspection, it was observed that the donor chair had been removed and that no plasma had been collected since the
inspection ending July 29, 1992. The inspection was terminated because a meaningful inspection could not be performed.
In a letter to FDA dated February 10, 1993, the firm requested voluntary revocation of its licenses and thereby waived
its opportunity for a hearing under 21 CFR 601.5(a). The agency granted the licensee's request by letter dated August
24, 1993, which revoked the establishment license (U.S. License No. 314) and the product license for the manufacture
of Source Plasma.
FDA has placed copies of the letters relevant to the license revocation on file under the docket number found in brackets
in the heading of this document with the Dockets Management Branch (HFA-305), Food and Drug Administration,
rm. 1-23, 12420 Parklawn Dr., Rockville, MD 20857. These documents include the following: FDA letters of September
3, 1991, May 20, 1992, and August 24, 1993; and the firm's letter of February 10, 1993. These documents are available
in the Dockets Management Branch (address above) between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m. Monday through Friday.
Accordingly, under section 351 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 262), 21 CFR 601.5, and under authority
delegated to the Commissioner of Food and Drugs (21 CFR 5.10) and redelegated to the Director, Center for Biologics
Evaluation and Research (21 CFR 5.68), the establishment license (U.S. License No. 314) and the product license issued
to the North Carolina Memorial Hospital, doing business as the Clinical Coagulation Laboratory, for the manufacture
of Source Plasma were revoked, effective August 24, 1993.
This notice is issued and published under 21 CFR 601.8 and the redelegation at 21 CFR 5.67.

 Notice of Social Security Ruling. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 In accordance with 20 CFR 422.406(b)(1), the Commissioner of Social Security gives notice of Social Security Ruling
94-4p. This Ruling states the Social Security Administration's longstanding policy of giving adequate written
notice of a determination of overpayment and the right to contest such determination and of providing the person from
whom we are seeking recovery with an opportunity for a face-to-face oral hearing before we deny that person's request
for waiver of recovery of the overpayment. This policy is based on the 1974 court decision in 

Buffington, et al. v. Weinberger, 

No. 734-73C2 (W.D. Wash. October 22, 1974), and Supreme Court decision in 

Califano v. Yamasaki, 

442 U.S. 682 (1979). 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Although we are not required to do so pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552 (a)(1) and (a)(2), we are publishing this Social Security
Ruling in accordance with 20 CFR 422.406(b)(1). 


Social Security Rulings make available to the public precedential decisions relating to the Federal old-age, survivors,
disability, supplemental security income, and black lung benefits programs. Social Security Rulings may be based
on case decisions made at all administrative levels of adjudication, Federal court decisions, Commissioner's decisions,
opinions of the Office of the General Counsel, and other policy interpretations of the law and regulations. 
Although Social Security Rulings do not have the force and effect of the law or regulations, they are binding on all
components of the Social Security Administration, in accordance with 20 CFR 422.406(b)(1), and are to be relied upon
as precedents in adjudicating other cases. 

 
If this Social Security Ruling is later superseded, modified, or rescinded, we will publish a notice in the 

Federal Register

 to that effect.

Policy Interpretation Ruling_Title II of the Social Security Act and Title IV of the Federal Mine Safety and Health
Act of 1977: Waiver of Recovery of Overpayments_Notice of Appeal and Waiver Rights_Right to a Pre-Recoupment Oral
Hearing Before Waiver Can be Denied 





Purpose: 

To state the longstanding Social Security Administration (SSA) policy of: 
 Giving adequate written notice of a determination of overpayment and the right to contest such determination
and request waiver of recovery of the overpayment; and 
 Providing the person from whom we are seeking recovery of an overpayment with the opportunity for a face-to-face
oral hearing before we deny a request for waiver of recovery of the overpayment. 
The policy is based on the court decisions and orders discussed below. 


Citations (Authority): 

Section 204(a) and (b) of the Social Security Act, as amended, and Title IV of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act
of 1977; 20 CFR 404.502a, 404.506, 404.904, 410.561, 410.561a, and 410.620. 


Pertinent History: 

On October 22, 1974, the U.S. District 
Court for the Western District of Washington in 

Buffington, et al. v. Weinberger, 

No. 734-73C2 (W.D. Wash. October 22, 1974) stopped SSA from recovering overpaid Social Security benefits without
giving each member of the plaintiff class adequate written notice of the overpayment determination, the right to
contest such determination and the right to a pre-recoupment hearing. Moreover, the court stopped SSA from taking
any action to recover the overpayments before affording the class member the opportunity for a hearing. 
The court ordered that the written notice must include: 
 A statement of the alleged overpayment, an explanation of the basis for the overpayment and SSA's proposed
action to recover the overpayment; 
 A statement of the individual's right to a pre-recoupment hearing; 
 Instructions and forms for requesting a pre-recoupment hearing; 
 An explanation that if the person did not request a pre-recoupment hearing within 30 days of the date of mailing
of the overpayment notice, it would be presumed that the person waived his/her right to the hearing and recovery of
the alleged overpayment would begin; 
 A statement of any other administrative relief available (i.e., reconsideration of the fact and/or amount
of overpayment and waiver of recovery of the overpayment); and 
 A statement that the local SSA office would help him/her to complete and submit forms for appeal. 
The court also ordered the following: 
1. SSA had to restore all benefits withheld from the named plaintiffs pending an opportunity for a pre-recoupment
hearing. The person had to be given the opportunity to examine his/her claims file at least 5 days prior to the date of
the hearing. 
2. The pre-recoupment hearing had to be conducted by an SSA employee who had no prior knowledge of the events leading
to the overpayment determination and the decision to recover the overpayment. At the hearing the person requesting
waiver had to be given the opportunity to: 
 Personally appear, testify, and cross-examine any witnesses;

 Be represented by an attorney or other representative; and 
 Submit documents for consideration at the hearing. 
The court, however, did not require that a transcript be made of the hearing. 
3. After the hearing, SSA had to issue a written decision to the individual (and his/her representative, if any) specifying
the findings of fact and conclusions in support of the decision to approve or deny waiver and advising of the individual's
right to appeal the decision. 
In accordance with the court order, SSA began to issue overpayment notices containing all of the aforementioned information
and to offer pre-recoupment hearings to all class members. 
On June 20, 1979, the Supreme Court held in 

Califano v. Yamasaki, 

442 U.S. 682 (1979), that individuals who filed a written request for waiver were entitled to the opportunity for a
pre-recoupment oral hearing, but those who requested only reconsideration were not so entitled. Thereafter, SSA
applied its revised overpayment notice and pre-recoupment hearing procedures to all individuals who are determined
to be overpaid under the title II or Black Lung programs. 
On July 31, 1981, the court in 

Buffington, et al. v. Schweiker, 

No 734-73C2 (W.D. Wash.) required SSA to automatically schedule pre-recoupment hearings for persons whose
request for waiver of overpayment recovery could not be approved after initial paper review. On February 10, 1983,
the court in 

Buffington, et al. v. Schweiker, 

No 734-73C2 (W.D. Wash.) approved procedures developed by SSA in response to the 1981 decree whereby pre-recoupment
hearings would be automatically scheduled provided that the scheduling would be in writing. The scheduling letter
had to contain all the necessary information about the date, time, and place of the hearing; the procedure for reviewing
the file prior to the hearing; the procedure for seeking a change in the scheduled date, time, or place; and all other
information necessary to fully inform the claimant about the pre-recoupment hearing. SSA began to automatically
schedule pre-recoupment hearings in writing in April 1983. 
In its order of October 19, 1987, the court in 

Buffington, et al. v. Bowen, 

No. 734-73C2 (W.D. Wash.) approved SSA's plan to transfer waiver decisionmaking authority from the processing
centers to the field offices for Retirement and Survivors Insurance overpayments. SSA implemented this change in
July 1988. 


Policy Interpretation 


Overpayment Notice 


In accordance with the court decisions, when an overpayment is discovered, the person is immediately notified. The
notice includes: 
 The overpayment amount and how and when it occurred; 
 A request for full, immediate refund, unless the overpayment can be withheld from the next month's benefit;

 The proposed adjustment of benefits if refund is not received within 30 days after the date of the notice and
adjustment of benefits is available; 
 An explanation of the availability of a different rate of withholding when full withholding is proposed, installment
payments when refund is requested and adjustment is not currently available, and/or cross-program recovery when
refund is requested and the person is receiving another type of benefit from SSA (cross-program recovery is not available
to residents of New York and Pennsylvania); 
 An explanation of the right to request waiver of recovery and the automatic scheduling of a folder review and
pre-recoupment hearing (commonly referred to as a personal conference) if a request for waiver cannot be approved
after initial paper review; 
 Instructions about the availability of forms for requesting reconsideration and waiver; 
 An explanation that if the person does not request waiver or reconsideration within 30 days of the date of the
overpayment notice, recovery of the overpayment will begin; 
 An explanation of the right to request reconsideration of the overpayment determination; 
 A statement that the local SSA office will help him/her to complete and submit forms for appeal; and 

 An explanation that the person receiving the notice should notify SSA promptly if reconsideration, waiver,
a lesser rate of withholding, repayment by installments, or cross-program adjustment is wanted. 


Form SSA-3105 


Form SSA-3105 (Important Information About Your Appeal and Waiver Rights) is included with each overpayment
notice. The SSA-3105 further explains the pre-recoupment review process and contains a tear-off form which
the person may complete and return to SSA if he/she wants reconsideration and/or waiver. 


Delaying Recovery of the Overpayment 


To ensure meaningful opportunity to contest the correctness of an overpayment determination and/or establish entitlement
to waiver, the date on which full refund is due and, if appropriate, the date on which adjustment will begin must be at
least 30 days after the date of the overpayment notice. If the individual responds within 30 days after the date of the
overpayment notice, SSA must take action to ensure that benefit payments are not interrupted. If the 30-day period
cannot be assured, SSA must postpone any proposed recoupment for a longer period. Anytime waiver is requested, SSA
stops recovery.

Requesting Waiver


When waiver is requested, the individual gives SSA information (usually on Form SSA-632-BK (Request
for Waiver of Overpayment Recovery or Change in Repayment Rate)) to support his/her contention that he/she is without
fault in causing the overpayment and that recovery would either cause financial hardship or be inequitable. That
information, along with supporting documentation, is reviewed to determine if waiver can be approved.


Reviewing Waiver Request


In Retirement and Survivors Insurance overpayments, the waiver request is reviewed in the field office; in Disability
Insurance overpayments, it is reviewed in the processing center. If waiver cannot be approved after review of the
claims folder, the person is notified in writing and given necessary information about the dates, times, and place
of the folder review and personal conference; the procedure for reviewing the claims folder prior to the personal
conference; the procedure for seeking a change in the scheduled dates, times, or place; and all other information
necessary to fully inform the person about the personal conference. The folder review is always scheduled at least
5 days before the personal conference.


Folder Review


At the folder review, the person and/or the person's representative has the right to review the claims folder and applicable
law and regulations with the decisionmaker or another SSA representative who is prepared to answer questions. The
individual can get copies of any requested material from the claims folder or pertinent sections of the law or regulations.


Personal Conference


At the personal conference, the person is given the opportunity to:
 Personally appear, testify, cross-examine any witnesses, and make arguments;
 Be represented by an attorney or other representative; and
 Submit documents for consideration by the decisionmaker.
The decisionmaker:
 Tells the person that the decisionmaker was not previously involved in the issue under review, that the waiver
decision is solely the decisionmaker's, and that the waiver decision is based only on the evidence or information
presented or reviewed at the conference;
 Ascertains the role and identity of everyone present;
 Indicates whether or not the person reviewed the claims file;
 Explains the provisions of law and regulations applicable to the issue;
 Briefly summarizes the evidence already in file which will be considered;
 Ascertains from the person whether the information presented is correct and whether he/she fully understands
it;
 Allows the person and the person's representative, if any, to present the person's case;
 Secures updated financial information, if necessary;
 Allows each witness to present information and allows the person and the person's representative, if any,
to question the witness;
 Ascertains whether there is any further evidence to be presented;
 Reminds the person of any evidence promised by the person which has not been presented;
 Lets the person and the person's representative, if any, present any final summary or closing statement;
 Explains that a decision will be made and the person will be notified in writing; and
 Explains further appeal rights in the event the decision is adverse to the person.


Personal Conference Decision


SSA issues a written decision to the individual (and his/her representative, if any) specifying the findings of fact
and conclusions in support of the decision to approve or deny waiver and advising of the individual's right to appeal
the decision.


Effective Date:

 This Ruling is effective July 11, 1994.

Availability of an Environmental Assessment/Habitat Conservation Plan and Receipt of an Application for an Incidental
Take Permit for the proposed Cedar Park Waterline in Travis County, Texas 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Fish and Wildlife Service, Interior.

 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice.

 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The City of Cedar Park (Applicant) has applied to the Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) for an incidental take permit
pursuant to section 10(a)(1)(B) of the Endangered Species Act (Act). The Applicant has been assigned permit number
PRT-788842. The requested permit, which is for a period not to exceed 30 years, would authorize the incidental
take of the endangered golden-cheeked warbler (

Dendroica chrysoparia

). The proposed take would occur as a result of the construction and operation of a water pipeline, in Travis County,
Texas. The proposed development will eliminate about 4.2 acres of occupied and/or potential endangered species
habitat. 


The Service has prepared an environmental assessment/habitat conservation plan (EA/HCP) for the incidental take
application. A determination of jeopardy to the species or a finding of no significant impact (FONSI) will not be made
before 30 days from the date of publication of this notice. This notice is provided pursuant to section 10(c) of the
Act and National Environmental Policy Act regulations (40 CFR 1506.6).

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Section 9 of the Act prohibits the ``Taking'' of any endangered species, including the golden-cheeked warbler. However,
the Service, under limited circumstances, may issue permits to take endangered wildlife species if such taking is
incidental to, and not the purpose of otherwise lawful activities. Regulations governing permits for endangered
species are at 50 CFR 17.22. 


The Applicant plans to construct a 20,193-foot long water supply pipeline from Lake Travis eastward to the Williamson
County line. An Environmental Assessment/Habitat Conservation Plan has been prepared for the project. As mitigation
for the incidental taking of the golden-cheeked warbler, the Applicant proposes to preserve documented perch trees
for the warbler along the route; limit clearing to 35 feet wide along the route and two 100 feet by 100 feet staging areas
in non-habitat; schedule work during the season when the warblers are absent from the area (August 1 through March
1); and the purchase and dedication of 33 acres of occupied warbler habitat to a conservation organization approved
by the Service. 
The Applicant considered four alternatives but rejected three because they were not economically viable.

Job Training Partnership Act; Title II-A, Title II-C, Title III, and Section 204(d) Performance Standards
for Program Years (PY) 1994 and 1995


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Employment and Training Administration, Labor.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of performance standards for PY 1994-95.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Department of Labor is announcing performance standards for Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA) Title II-A
(Adult Training), Title II-C (Youth Training), Title III (Dislocated Workers Training), and section 204 (Older
Workers Training) for Program Years (PY) 1994-95 (July 1, 1994-June 30, 1996). The proposed issuance
appended to this notice contains revised performance standards levels and implementation instructions to conform
the Title II performance management system with the Job Training Reform Amendments of 1992.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Under section 106 of the amended Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA), the Secretary of Labor is required to set performance
standards for programs serving: (1) adults and youth under Title II-A and Title II-C; (2) dislocated workers
under Title III; and (3) older workers under section 204(d). The Job Training Reform Amendments of 1992 (Amendments)
also introduced significant changes in the way job training programs are designed and operated at the local levels.
These statutory changes, combined with recent legislative and administrative initiatives to promote high-quality,
results-driven, customer-oriented services throughout the Federal Government, are not only reshaping the way
JTPA delivers its services, but also how to measure its effectiveness. 


National job training objectives have remained unchanged since 1990 and focus on enhancing the long-term employability
and economic self-sufficiency of those most at risk of becoming or remaining unemployed. Current measures of the
program's progress in achieving these objectives relate directly to near-term employment and earnings levels of
adult program completers and levels of employment and skill enhancements of youth program completers. These outcomes
do not, by themselves, measure the quality of the services received or the extent to which the program is able to improve
upon participants' prior employment, earnings and welfare dependency.
For this reason, the Department will be undertaking a comprehensive review of its performance standards over the
next year to examine alternative program measures and more cost efficient ways of assessing the program's long-term
effects on its graduates. Ongoing surveys of JTPA's customers will also provide invaluable feedback on how helpful
JTPA services are to its users, what other services are needed but not provided by the program, and the extent to which
good outcomes are related to levels of customer satisfaction. Finally, the Employment and Training Administration
will initiate a nationwide JTPA Report Card that will highlight programs showing the greatest returns on their human
resource investments in terms of obtaining high-quality employment for those participants most at-risk of failure.
Outcome measures for Title II-A and C will be retained until this performance standards review is completed.
Numerical levels for these core standards have been updated to reflect the most recent JTPA program experience.

The Department is also undertaking a comprehensive review of its Title III programs; therefore, changes in outcome
measures will be deferred until the results of this critical assessment are available. Governors will continue to
be required to set an entered employment rate standard for their Title III programs and are encouraged to establish
an average wage at placement goal. At the same time, the Department will be exploring ways to use performance standards
to improve the quality of services provided to dislocated workers, and to achieve higher levels of customer satisfaction.
Under section 204(d) of JTPA, older worker programs are now subject to performance standards. However, no incentive
awards or sanctions are associated with these standards. Outcomes for these programs focus on increasing employment
and earnings similar to those programs serving other disadvantaged adults. Because field evidence suggests that
older workers are much more likely to remain employed once they are placed in jobs, employment and wages will be measured
at program completion rather than at a later follow-up period. Together, these measures underscore the employment
focus of the program, particularly in jobs that are higher paying.
To comply with the legislative provisions, the Department considered adding specific outcome measures for hard-to-serve
participants and separate outcomes for in-school and out-of-school youth. In the interest of avoiding a proliferation
of performance measures and limiting local flexibility in programming, additional measures for these three separate
groups were not established. Rather, the requirement to promote services to hard-to-serve individuals will be addressed
from an incentive policy perspective and the issue of in-school and out-of-school standards will continue to be addressed
through the performance standards adjustment process. When judging service delivery area (SDA) performance and
awarding incentive funds, States will need to design incentive policies that will promote more effective services
to out-of-school youth and reward placements into jobs with employer-assisted benefits.
The policy of excluding cost measures from incentive awards will remain unchanged; however, States are reminded
of the integral role of financial oversight in program management. States are also encouraged to utilize available
administrative data to relate overall costs of job training to more direct measures of long-term employment, earnings
and reductions in welfare. The Office of the Inspector General will be collaborating with ETA in developing a mechanism
for measuring the program's return on its investments. The wider JTPA community will also be invited to participate
in this effort.


Discussion of Comments


On March 1, 1994, proposed revisions to the performance standards for JTPA Title II-A, Title II-C, Title
III, and newly instituted section 204(d) performance standards were published in the 

Federal Register

 at 59 FR 9910. Interested parties were invited to submit written comments through March 31, 1994.
The Department of Labor (DOL) received 96 written comments on the proposed performance standards issuance. Eighteen
of the letters explicitly endorsed the overall direction which the Department is taking in establishing performance
standards policy for Program Years 1994 and 1995. In general, the majority of comments requested clarifications
or raised issues about specific aspects of the proposed requirements. While the concept of imposing a hard-to-serve
``gate'' for incentive awards eligibility received support, its application to terminees rather than enrollments
drew considerable local and State criticism.
The following summarizes the major issues raised by the commenters and the Department's respective responses.


Use of Participants Rather Than Terminees as the Basis for Determining SDA Eligibility for Incentive Awards


The Department specifically sought comments on whether the hard-to-serve ``gate'' for incentive award eligibility
fully addresses the need to emphasize this population in the performance standards system, and whether compliance
with the gate should be measured against those enrolled in training or those completing the program. A majority of
those commenting on this issue agreed with the Department's approach of restricting eligibility for incentive awards
to those programs that enroll in training at least a minimum (65%) hard-to-serve adults as well as youth.
However, fully three-fourths of States and SDAs submitting comments specifically recommended that the basis for
the gate should be participants (all individuals served during the year, including those still enrolled at the end
of the program year) rather than terminees. Basing the 65% hard-to-serve level on program terminees was seen as pressuring
SDAs to ``manipulate'' their terminations. Local programs can manage the recruitment process to ensure that adequate
numbers of hard-to-serve are enrolled. Ensuring comparable numbers of hard-to-serve individuals will graduate
each year is more problematic because of the clients' varying training needs. Participants with multiple barriers
typically need to remain in programs longer than those with fewer barriers.
The Department concurs with the arguments made for changing the basis of the incentive award ``gate'' from terminations
to participants. Particularly compelling is the rationale that hard-to-serve participants need longer-term interventions
and the adverse effects that such a gate might create in prompting SDAs to terminate participants prematurely. Thus,
beginning in FY 1994 for SDAs to become eligible for incentives, at least 65 percent of 

both

 the SDAs' Title II-A 

and

 Title II-C (in-school and out-of-school combined) participants receiving training, and/or other services
beyond objective assessment, must be hard-to-serve. For the purpose of determining compliance with this requirement,
those individuals with SDA-defined barriers that have been approved by the Governor are to be included as well as participants
in school-wide projects under section 263(g) and participants in five percent-funded projects.
To further reinforce JTPA's focus on serving hard-to-serve participants, the Department encourages Governors
to design incentive policies that explicitly promote increased service to that group. For example, Governors may
wish to adjust themselves based on the degree to which SDAs exceed the incentive eligibility ``gate'' or on a sliding
scale of continuous improvement.


Improved Service to Out-of-School Youth and Employer-Assisted Benefits Incentive Award Criteria


About 30 percent of all commenters mentioned this issue. Most of the comments requested additional guidance and clarification
on how these two items could be incorporated into incentive award policies and asked whether Governors could ignore
or ``zero weight'' either one of them in the awarding of incentives. The Department is sensitive to concerns about
establishing incentive criteria without sufficient information on the program's prior experience in placing individuals
in jobs with employer-assisted benefits; or in the case of out-of-school youth, in the absence of effective program
models that have a positive impact on a youth's long-term earnings potential.

<PARENT> FR940711-2-00049 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

In response to the field comments several changes have been made to the incentive policy guidance as originally proposed.
First, Governors will be encouraged, but not required, to include these criteria in State incentive policy for PY
1994. States will be required to incorporate these criteria (i.e., they cannot be zero-weighted) beginning in PY
1995. In the interim States can use data from the Standardized Program Information Reports (SPIR) for PYs 1992 and
1993 to establish performance benchmarks for programs serving out-of-school youth and job placements providing
employer-assisted benefits. Therefore, the Department is giving Governors maximum flexibility in terms of how
these criteria may be applied. Suggested approaches for rewarding improved service to out-of-school youth and placements
in jobs providing employer-assisted benefits will be included in the Training and Employment Guidance Letter appended
to this Notice.

Several commenters noted that the intent of the incentive provisions is to encourage service to more out-of-school
youth; thus, SDAs should be rewarded solely on the extent to which they exceed the statutory minimum service levels.
The Department's position is that rewarding SDAs simply on the basis of increasing the numbers of out-of-school youth
does not go far enough in addressing the disappointing findings from the National JTPA study. Thus, while SDAs will
not be exempted from the statutory requirement to serve at least 50% out-of-school youth, ETA is encouraging States
to use incentive funds to pilot innovative youth models and to evaluate and replicate promising strategies.



20-Hour Requirement



Section 106(k) of JTPA requires for performance standards purposes that employment be for at least 20 or more hours
per week. This requirement applies to Title II-A (adults), Title II-C (youth), Section 204(d) (older
workers), and Title III (dislocated workers) programs. About 15 percent of the comments questioned the reasonableness
of this requirement for in-school youth, older workers, or disabled participants, and requested that the Department
waive it in these cases. Since this requirement is explicitly defined 

in the statute, 

it cannot be waived.

Several commenters also requested clarification about the reference period, i.e., whether a ``week'' means 5 or
7 days and whether follow-up is needed to verify that an individual actually worked for at least 20 hours. For determining
compliance with this provision, a ``week'' means a period of 7 consecutive days, and the 20 or more hours is to be understood
as a condition of employment. (See section 5 of the attached TEGL.) No formal verification is required, but the Department
encourages States to set up a system that would, at a minimum, provide for random checking to assess compliance by SDAs.

Definition of ``Failure to Meet Standards''



Section 106(j)(i)(A) of JTPA requires the Secretary to establish uniform criteria of determining whether a service
delivery area fails to meet performance standards. To comply with this provision, the Department specified the number
of failed standards which constitute overall failure. Commenters generally agreed with the concept of a uniform
definition of performance failure; however, there was minor opposition to defining overall failure as missing a
combination of any three standards or simply missing both youth standards. The Department was criticized for placing
too much weight on the youth standards. Given Congressional interest in improving the quality of service to youth,
as reflected in various provisions in the amended JTPA, and given the need to respond to the programmatic issues raised
by the National JTPA Study, the Department believes its emphasis on youth program performance is appropriate.

Several commenters requested clarification on whether SDAs had to fail the same standards two consecutive years
to trigger a reorganization. The sanction policy does not apply to the same standards over the two-year period. Thus,
for the purpose of identifying whether an SDA has failed to meet performance standards for two consecutive years,
overall failure means failing any three core standards or both youth standards for two consecutive years. Definitions
for meeting and failing 

individual

 standards will be established by Governors.



Performance Standards for Older Worker Programs Under Section 204(d)



The other major area of comment involved the performance standards for older worker programs under Section 204(d).
A total of 27 letters was received from advocates/service providers and State agencies on aging. These letters questioned
the methodology and data used for setting the performance standards levels. Many indicated that the proposed levels
were too high, particularly the level of the average wage at placement standard.

Since March 1, 1994, when the notice appeared in the 

Federal Register

, additional data became available from the PY 1992 SPIR. Reported information on the Section 204(d) Older Worker
program was analyzed and used to establish revised levels for the standards that are more closely related to actual
experience for that program. This has resulted in a lower entered employment rate standard, but the average wage at
placement standard remains unchanged. It should be remembered, however, that the Secretary's standards are merely


departure points

 which will be adjusted to account for local economic conditions and the characteristics of the terminees. The Department
will be providing States with a methodology for making these adjustments.



Performance Standards Levels 



A total of 9 comments was received about the overall performance levels for Titles II-A and II-C standards.
Comments were mixed with hard-to-serve advocates supporting both higher and lower levels. The majority of comments
advocating lower levels were from youth advocates who felt that the standard for youth employment was too high given
the recent decline in the rate of placing youth in jobs.

The numerical values of the standards are generally set so that if local programs continue to perform unchanged from
the prior program year, 75 percent of the system are expected to exceed their standards. The proposed numerical standards
for five of the six core measures (all but the YEER) and the Title III Entered Employment Rate measure are set in this
manner, using PY 1992 performance. Further adjustments were made to reflect the new 20 hour per week minimum requirement
for employment. To arbitrarily raise the level of all standards, as suggested by certain advocate groups, appeared
counterproductive when the Department was imposing new targeting requirements and employment caveats.

One exception is the numerical standard for the YEER which if similarly set, would lead to reduced standards for SDAs.
The recently published 30-month results from the National JTPA Study suggest that employment and earnings experienced
by out-of-school youth in JTPA fall short of acceptable levels. Therefore, to foster improved services to out-of-school
youth, the numerical standard for the YEER will remain at its current level of 41 percent.

The Secretary's standards for the new older worker performance measures were derived from an analysis of available
PY 1992 Section 204(d) data from the SPIR. The same general rules that were used for setting the levels for the Titles
II-A, II-C, and III programs, including the adjustment for 20-hour employment, were used for the Section
204(d) program. Again, it must be emphasized that these national standards are merely departure points and States
must make adjustments to account for local conditions.



Certifications



This issuance is procedural in character and gives directions to States and local service deliverers on the implementation
of performance standards under Title II-A, Title II-C, Section 204(d), and Title III of JTPA. Therefore,
it is not classified as ``major'' under Executive Order 12291 and no impact analysis is required. This issuance has
been assessed according to the Federalist policymaking criteria outlined in Executive Order 12612. The Department
believes that this issuance will not materially limit the policymaking discretion of the States. This issuance both
addresses Departmental policy objectives and permits States discretionary authority in the application of performance
standards. The procedural framework included in this issuance enables States to better assist localities in more
effective and efficient program design and management.




Signed at Washington, DC, this 5th day of July, 1994.

Appendix_Revisions to the Performance Management System, and Performance Standards for Program Years (PY's) 1994
and 1995



Training and Employment Guidance Letter

XXXX





Training and Employment Guidance Letter No. 

XXXX





From: Barbara Ann Farmer, Administrator for Regional Management 

Subject: Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA) Title II and Title III Performance Standards for PY's 1994-1995




1. 

Purpose.

 To transmit guidance on the Secretary's required performance measures and the Secretary's implementing instructions
for performance standards for Program Years (PY's) 1994 and 1995 (July 1, 1994-June 30, 1995; July 1, 1995-June
30, 1996). 

 2. 

Background.

 Sec. 106 of JTPA, as amended, directs the Secretary to establish performance standards for adult, youth, and dislocated
worker programs. These standards may be updated every two years based on the most recent JTPA program experience,
as well as program emphases and goals established by the Department of Labor. The Secretary also issues instructions
for implementing standards and parameter criteria for States to follow in adjusting the Secretary's standards for
service delivery areas (SDAs) and substate areas (SSAs). 

The Job Training Reform Amendments (JTRA) of 1992 mandated significant changes in the design and operation of local
job training programs, as well as the criteria used to assess their performance. Revised Section 106 requires that
performance standards for Title II-A, Title II-C, Section 204(d) and Title III programs measure the number
of job placements that provide a minimum of 20 hours of work per week, and that programs be rewarded based on high performance,
increased service to the ``hard-to-serve,'' and quality job placements that are both high-paying and offer employer-assisted
benefits. Incentive and sanction policies are to be structured around more explicit criteria, and performance standards
failure is now federally defined to ensure greater uniformity in assessing underperformance nationwide. As a result
of the JTPA amendments, section 204(d) now mandates performance measures for the older worker program. 

To assist the Department in responding to the substantive changes required in the section 106 amendments, a Technical
Workgroup was convened in Washington, DC, in mid-July 1993. The workgroup had representatives from State and local
JTPA programs; public interest groups, including the Partnership for Training and Employment Careers; the U.S.
Conference of Mayors; the National Association of Counties; the National Governors' Association; and the National
Council on the Aging; and staff from the Department of Labor (DOL) Office of the Inspector General. This Guidance Letter
incorporates, to a large extent, the workgroup's findings. 

3. 

Performance Management Goals for PY's 1994-1995.

 Departmental goals, initially established for PY 1990 in anticipation of the amendments, remain unchanged and are
as follows:

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940711-2-00116 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940711-2-00049 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

_Targeting services to a more at-risk population;
_Improving the quality and intensity of services that lead to skills acquisition, long-term employability and increased
earnings;
_Placing greater emphasis on basic skills acquisition to qualify for employment or advanced education or training;
and
_Promoting comprehensive, coordinated human resource programs to address the multiple needs of at-risk populations.
In addition, with the passage of the 1992 JTPA Amendments, the performance management system has been tasked, through
its performance incentive policies, to improve service to out-of-school youth and also to foster employment in better
quality jobs which offer high wages and employer-assisted benefits.
These goals are reflected in the Secretary's six Title II-A and Title II-C (core) measures, national numerical
standards for these measures, new incentive award criteria, and associated reporting requirements. Governors
still retain authority to establish additional standards which reflect State policy and to develop the specific
approach to determining incentive awards.
This issuance specifies the national standards for PY's 1994-1995 and introduces the new criteria which must
be a part of State incentive grant policies. Data to support additional non-cost measures will continue to be reported
and Governors may use these measures, or others in making State incentive award determinations. Data on costs together
with program performance will provide critical information for State monitoring, fiscal oversight, and assist
States in measuring returns on their human resource investments.
The Department has identified two additional goals for PY 1994-1995. These are:
_Establishing a strong customer focus and orientation toward improving the program's responsiveness in meeting
the individual needs of participants; and
_Seeking and using customer feedback to monitor the appropriateness of JTPA services and to promote continuous program
improvements.
States and SDAs are encouraged to survey customers on a regular basis as an integral part of their program oversight
to identify program weaknesses and to improve program services. Technical assistance will be made available on cost-effective
ways to gather and utilize such information.
4. 

Secretary's National Standards for PY's 1994-1995. 

The Secretary's performance measures and national standards for Title II-A, Title II-C, section 204(d),
and Title III (all of section 302(c)(1) State activities, and sections 302(c)(2) and 302(d) substate area activities)
are as follows:

5. 

Explanation of Performance Standards Levels

. The Title II-A and II-C numerical standards were derived from PY 1992 aggregate performance data reported
on the JTPA Annual Status Report (JASR) and are generally set at a minimally-acceptable level that approximately
75% of the SDA's can be expected to exceed. 

Revising the numerical standard for the Youth Entered Employment Rate (YEER) in the same way would lead to reduced
standards for SDAs. However, recent National JTPA Study results suggest that employment and earnings experienced
by out-of-school youth in JTPA fall short of acceptable levels. Therefore, to encourage improved services to out-of-school
youth, the numerical standard for the YEER will remain at its current level of 41 percent. 

Earnings standards have been adjusted to account for expected future inflation. Finally, an additional special
adjustment has been made to employment-related standards to account for the requirement in section 106(k) that permits
credit, for performance standards purposes, only for employment that is scheduled for 20 or more hours per week. 

Similar to the Title II-A and Title II-C standards, the Title III standard was derived from PY 1992 performance
data reported on the Worker Adjustment Program Annual Program Report (WAPR). This standard is set at a level that,
approximately, 75 percent of the substate areas can be expected to exceed. As with the employment measures for Titles
II-A and II-C, an adjustment has been made to take into account the 20-hour per week employment requirement.


Since discrete aggregate data were not available for PY 1992 Section 204(d) Older Worker program performance, available
SPIR data were used to assist in setting performance standards levels for that program. As with the employment measures
for Titles II-A, II-C, and III, an adjustment has been made to take into account the 20-hour per week employment
requirement. 

 




Note: 

Programs operated under section 204(d) are State programs even though they may be managed by various local entities.
Therefore, performance standards will be applied to the total older worker programs State-wide. Unlike the adult
and youth programs under Title II-A/C, however, no incentive awards or sanctions are associated with these
standards.

 


6. 

Implementing Provisions

. The following implementing requirements must be followed: 

A. 

Required Standards

. For Titles II-A and II-C, Governors are required to set, for each SDA, a numerical performance standard
for each of the six Secretary's measures; for the Older Worker program, Governors are required to set numerical Entered
Employment Rate and Average Wage at Placement standards for programs operated under section 204(d); for Title III,
Governors are required to set for each substate area a numerical performance standard for the Entered Employment
Rate and are encouraged to establish an Average Wage at Placement goal 

B. 

Setting the Standards

. Consistent with new legislative provisions, Governors are now 

required

 to adjust the Secretary's performance standards to reflect local area circumstances (section 106(d)). Such adjustments
apply to Title II-A, Title II-C, section 204(d) and Title III programs, and must conform to the Secretary's
parameters described below: 

 


1. Procedures must be: 



_Responsive to the intent of the Act, 

_Consistently applied among the SDA's/SSA's, 

_Objective and equitable throughout the State, 

_In conformance with widely accepted statistical criteria; 

 


2. Source data must be: 



_Of public use quality, 

_Available upon request; 

 


3. Results must be: 



_Documented, 

_Reproducible; and 

 


4. Adjustment factors must be limited to: 



_Economic factors, 

_Labor market conditions, 

_Geographic factors, 

_Characteristics of the population to be served, 

_Demonstrated difficulties in serving the population (this adjustment factor is new), and 

_Type of services to be provided. 

 


The Department offers Governors an adjustment methodology that conforms both to these parameters and to the requirement
in section 106(d). This methodology covers Title II-A, Title II-C Section 204(d), and Title III programs
and will be provided to States in a soon-to-be issued Training and Employment Information Notice. Should the Governor
choose to use an alternate methodology, or make adjustments not addressed by the Departmental model, it must conform
to the parameter criteria and be documented in the Governor's Coordination and Special Services Plan (GCSSP) prior
to the program year to which it applies. The State Job Training Coordinating Council and, where appropriate, the State
Human Resources Investment Council must have an opportunity to consider adjustments to the Secretary's standards
and to recommend variations. To determine whether an SDA has met or exceeded a performance standard, Governors must
use actual end-of-year program data to recalculate the performance standards. 

C. 

Performance Standards Definitions

. Governors must calculate the performance of their SDA's, SSA's, and section 204(d) programs according to the definitions
included in the Attachments. 

D. 

Titles II-A and II-C Incentive and Sanction Policies

. Performance standards are to be established for programs funded under Titles II and III of the Act. In applying the
Secretary's standards for Titles II-A and II-C, Governors 

must use

 the six core measures and also consider criteria relating to programs successfully serving out-of-school youth
and placement in jobs providing employer-assisted benefits. Governors are encouraged to begin using these criteria
in PY 1994 incentive policies; these criteria are required (i.e., they cannot be zero-weighted) to be incorporated
into State incentive policies beginning in PY 1995. Governors may select additional non-cost measures, such as increased
service to hard-to-serve participants, to form the basis of incentive policies as long as the following criteria
are met: 

1. As the basis for making incentive awards, the Governors must use 

all

 (i.e., cannot ``zero weight'' 

any

) of the six Secretary's core measures. Beginning in PY 1995, Governors will also be required to reward innovative
out-of-school youth program models either identified by the Department of Labor or recognized by the State as having
a demonstrated record of success, and placements in jobs providing employer-assisted benefits. Although successful
programs for out-of-school youth remain the cornerstone of out-of-school incentives, SDA's will still be expected
to exceed the 50 percent minimum service level to be rewarded under that criterion. Governors have considerable flexibility
in implementing the new incentive criteria. Suggested approaches to addressing these criteria are included as Attachments
3 and 4 to this TEGL. Decisions regarding the 

relative

 weight or emphasis of each core measure (e.g., the Youth Entered Employment Rate) and incentive criterion (e.g.,
placement in jobs with employer-assisted benefits) in a State's incentive award formula rest with the Governor.

<TEXT>
 

The core measures will be the basis for identifying SDA's that are candidates for technical assistance and for imposing
sanctions. At least 75 percent of the funds set aside for performance incentives must be related to these measures
and the out-of-school youth and employer-assisted benefits criteria, in accordance with section 106(b)(7)(E).

2. Cost standards cannot be used for incentive award purposes. However, States are reminded of the integral role of
financial reviews in program management. States are encouraged to explore ways of relating overall costs of job training
to more direct measures of long-term employment, earnings and reductions in welfare. 
3. Incentive policies may include adjustments to incentive award amounts based upon factors such as grant size, additional
services to the hard-to-serve, intensity of service, and expenditure level. 
4. A Secretary's standard for service to the hard-to-serve, as required by section 106(b)(7)(B) of JTPA, has been
established in the form of a stand-alone eligibility criterion (``gate'') for incentive awards. In order for an SDA
to be eligible to receive 

any

 incentive award, at least 65 percent of 

both

 the SDA's (a) Title II-A 

and

 (b) Title II-C (in-school and out-of-school youth combined) participants receiving training and/or other
service beyond objective assessment must be hard-to-serve. The definitions of hard-to-serve are to be consistent
with the definitions in sections 203(b), 263(b), and 263(d) of the Act. For the purpose of determining compliance
with this requirement, Governors are to include any SDA-defined barriers that have been approved by the Governor,
as well as the characteristics of participants in school-wide projects under section 263(g) and participants in
five percent-funded projects. 
5. For those SDA's that successfully ``pass through'' the gate, three criteria (in addition to any funds set aside
for Governors' standards) will determine the 

amount

 of the incentive award: (1) exceeding the Secretary's performance standards, (2) providing quality service to out-of-school
youth, and (3) placing participants in employment that provides employer-assisted benefits. 
_The definition of ``employer-assisted benefits'' is to be consistent with the SPIR definition (see Attachment
4). For the purposes of reporting and performance standards, fringe benefits count so long as they are an acknowledged
component of employment conditions, whether actually received at the time of placement or not. Thus, State incentive
policies will be structured to include benefit information for those participants who entered employment at termination,
and Governors will have considerable latitude in implementing this incentive policy requirement.

<TEXT>
 

6. Consistent with present DOL policy, SDA's that pass through the ``gate'' and exceed all six of the Secretary's Titles
II-A and II-C standards 

must 

receive an incentive award. 
7. Determination of an SDA's failure to meet these standards and the consequent imposition of technical assistance
and reorganization requirements under section 106(j) will be based only on the Secretary's Title II-A and Title
II-C core measures. 
_``Meeting Performance Standards'' overall is defined as meeting at least four of the six core standards, one of which
must be a youth standard. Conversely, overall ``Failure'' is defined as failing 

any 

three (3) or more of the core standards 

or 

failing both youth standards. Definitions for meeting and failing 

individual 

standards will be established by Governors. 
_Failure for the first year precludes an SDA from receiving 

any 

incentive awards and requires Governors to provide technical assistance to the underperforming SDA. 
_Failure in the second consecutive year precludes an SDA from receiving 

any 

incentive award and requires Governors to impose a reorganization plan. 
8. Section 106(j)(3) requires each State to report to the Secretary, not later than 90 days after the end of each program
year, the actual performance and performance standards for each SDA within that State. Within the same timeframe,
technical assistance plans developed by the State are required for each SDA ``failing'' for the first year. A 90-day
timeframe also applies to the imposition of a reorganization plan, which is mandatory when an SDA ``fails'' for a second
consecutive year. Specific procedures for the formal performance standards report and required State action will
be provided under separate cover. However, in addition to the formal annual process, there should be ongoing oversight
of SDA performance and continuous technical assistance and capacity-building aimed at addressing areas where program
performance can be improved. In addition, the Employment and Training Administration will initiate a national JTPA
Report Card that will highlight programs showing the greatest returns on their human resource investments in terms
of high-quality employment (type of job, wages and fringe benefits) for those participants most at-risk of failure.
Further information on the content and procedures for preparing the ``report card'' will be provided separately.

9. Governors must specify in the GCSSP their incentive award policy under section 202(c)(1)(B) and 202(c)(3)(A)
and imposition of sanctions policy under section 106(j). It is recognized that the timing of this issuance may preclude
some States from submitting complete incentive policies with their PY 1994-95 GCSSPs. States are to provide
as much information as possible in compliance with required due dates and submit a GCSSP amendment containing complete
information no later than August 31, 1994. 
10. In PY 1994 and 1995, Governors will continue to have the authority to exclude pilot projects serving ``hard-to-serve''
individuals funded from the 5 percent incentive fund set-aside in computing their standards and actual performance.
States and SDA's are encouraged to use such funds to develop or replicate model programs serving out-of-school youth,
particularly those based on contextual learning models.





Note: 

For those SDA's in which ``incentive projects'' are indistinguishable from those that provide general training,
these programs would 

not 

be considered exempt from performance standards.



7. 

State Action. 

States are to distribute this Guidance Letter to all officials within the State who need such information to implement
the new performance standards policies and requirements for PY 1994-95. It is especially critical that States,
State Councils, Private Industry Councils and SDA operational staff become thoroughly familiar with the new provisions
concerning incentive and sanctions policies. 
A copy of this Guidance Letter is also being sent to your State JTPA Liaison, the State Wagner-Peyser Administering
Agency, and the State Worker Adjustment Liaison.

Attachment 1_Definitions for Performance Standards



Those terminees who receive only objective assessment and/or supportive services (or only objective assessment
and/or supportive services and entered employment) are to be excluded from the calculation of performance outcomes
for Title II-A, Title II-C, and section 204(d) older worker programs. Participants in special 5-percent-funded
projects may, at the discretion of the Governor, also be excluded from the calculation of performance outcomes for
Title II-A and Title II-C.

The following defines the Title II-A performance standards:

1. 

Adult Follow-Up Employment Rate

_Total number of adult respondents who were employed (for at least 20 hours per week) during the 13th full calendar
week after termination, divided by the total number of adult respondents (i.e., terminees who completed follow-up
interviews).

2. 

Adult Follow-Up Weekly Earnings

_Total weekly earnings for all adult respondents who were employed (for at least 20 hours per week) during the 13th
full calendar week after termination, divided by the total number of adult respondents employed (for at least 20 hours
per week) at the time of follow-up.



Welfare



3. 

Welfare Follow-Up Employment Rate

_Total number of adult welfare respondents who were employed (for at least 20 hours per week) during the 13th full calendar
week after termination, divided by the total number of adult welfare respondents (i.e., terminees who completed
follow-up interviews).

4. 

Welfare Follow-Up Weekly Earnings

_Total weekly earnings for all adult welfare respondents employed (for at least 20 hours per week) during the 13th
full calendar week after termination, divided by the total number of adult welfare respondents employed (for at least
20 hours per week) at the time of follow-up.






Note: 

The Title II-A adult and welfare follow-up employment measures will continue to be based on individuals who
terminate during the first three quarters of the program year and the last quarter of the previous program year. If
the response rates for those employed at termination and those not employed at termination in an SDA differ by more
than 5 percentage points in either the adult or welfare samples, then the calculations of the follow-up outcomes for
that group must be modified to adjust for non-response bias. The following defines the Title II-C performance
standards:




5. 

Youth Entered Employment Rate (YEER)

_Total number of youth who entered employment at termination (for at least 20 hours per week), divided by the total
number of youth who terminated, excluding those potential dropouts who are reported (on the Standardized Program
Information Report [SPIR]) as remained-in-school and dropouts who are reported (on the SPIR) as returned-to-school.






Note: 

As in past practice, youth terminees who remain-in-school or return-to-school 

and 

who also enter employment will 

not 

be excluded from the termination pool reflected in the denominator of the Youth Entered Employment Rate. However,
only employment of at least 20 hours per week satisfies the requirement for ``employment.''




6. 

Youth Employability Enhancement Rate (YEEN)

_Total number of youth who attained one of the employability enhancements at termination, whether or not they also
obtained a job, divided by the total number of youth who terminated.




Youth Employability Enhancements include:



a. Attained (two or more) PIC-recognized Youth Employment Competencies.

b. Completed major level of education following participation of at least 90 calendar days or 200 hours in JTPA activity.

c. Entered and retained for at least 90 calendar days or 200 hours in non-Title II training or received a certification
of occupational skill attainment.






Note: 

It is expected that the 

ultimate 

result of this outcome will be the attainment of a job-specific skill competency on the part of the terminee.




d. Returned to and retained in full-time school (dropouts only) for one semester or at least 120 calendar days, attained
a basic or job-specific skill competency, and made satisfactory progress.






Note: 

For the purposes of this outcome, and the remained in school outcome described below, ``school'' 

includes alternative schools, 

defined as a specialized, structured curriculum offered inside or outside of the public school system which may provide
work/study and/or General Educational Development (GED) test preparation.




e. Remained in school for one semester or at least 120 calendar days (for youth at risk of dropping out of school), attained
a basic or job-specific skill competency, and made satisfactory progress.






Note: 

For youth aged 14 and 15, the acceptable competencies will be basic skills or pre-employment/work maturity.




The following defines Section 204(d) Older Worker program performance standards:

1. 

Entered Employment Rate

_Total number of individuals who entered employment of at least 20 hours per week at termination, divided by the number
of total terminations.

2. 

Average Wage at Placement

_Total hourly wage rate of all terminees who entered employment of at least 20 hours per week at termination, divided
by the number of terminees who entered employment of at least 20 hours per week at termination.

The following defines the Title III performance standard:

<PARENT> FR940711-2-00049 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 


1. 

Entered Employment Rate

_Total number of individuals who entered employment of at least 20 hours per week at termination, excluding those
who were recalled or retained by the original employer after receipt of a layoff notice, divided by the total terminations,
excluding those who were recalled or retained by the original employer after receipt of a layoff notice.






Note:

 As indicated in the definitions listed above, for performance standards purposes, the term ``employment'' means
employment for 20 or more hours per week. For determining compliance with this provision, a ``week'' means a period
of 7 consecutive days, and the 20 or more hours is to be understood as a condition of the employment. No formal verification
is required, but the Department encourages States to set up a system that would, at a minimum, provide for random checking
to assess compliance by SDA's.



Attachment 2_Youth Employability Enhancement Definitions




``Youth Employability Enhancement'' means an outcome for youth, other than entered unsubsidized employment, which
is recognized as enhancing long-term employability and contributing to the potential for a long-term increase in
earnings and employment. Outcomes which meet this requirement shall be restricted to the following:


(1) Attained PIC-Recognized Youth Employment Competencies (two or more reported from SPIR items 36a, 36d, and 36e);


(2) Returned to Full-Time School;


(3) Remained in School;


(4) Completed Major Level of Education; or


(5) Entered Non-Title II Training.


1. 

Attained PIC-Recognized Youth Employment Competencies_

The total number of youth who demonstrated proficiency, as defined by the PIC in 

two or more

 of the following three skill areas 

in which the terminee was deficient at enrollment:

 (1) pre-employment/work maturity (SPIR item 36a); (2) basic education (SPIR item 36d); or (3) job-specific skills
(SPIR item 36e). Competency gains must be achieved through program participation and be tracked through sufficiently
developed systems that must include: quantifiable learning objectives, related curricula/training modules,
pre and post-assessment, employability planning, documentation, and certification. 


The completely detailed definition for Youth Employment Competency systems is located in the Standardized Program
Information Reporting System (SPIR) instructions.


2. 

Returned to Full-Time School

_The total number of youth who: (1) had returned to full-time secondary school (e.g., junior high school, middle school
and high school) including an alternative school if, at the time of intake, the participant was not attending school
(exclusive of summer school) and had not obtained a high school diploma or equivalent; and (2) prior to termination,
had been retained in school for one semester or at least 120 calendar days.




Alternative School

_A specialized, structured curriculum offered inside or outside of the public school system which may provide work/study
and/or GED preparation.








Note:

 To obtain credit for 

Returned to Full-Time School

 and 

Remained in School

 (described below), SDA's must be prepared to demonstrate that retention results from continuing, active participation
in JTPA activities and the youth 

must:

 (1) be making satisfactory progress in school; and (2) (for youth aged 16-21) attain a PIC-approved Youth Employment
Competency in Basic Skills or Job-Specific Skills; or (3) (for youth aged 14-15) attain a PIC-approved Youth
Employment Competency in Pre-employment/Work Maturity or Basic Skills.









Satisfactory Progress in School

_An SDA, in cooperation with the local school system, must develop a written policy that defines an individual standard
of progress for each participant that he or she is required to meet. Such a standard should, at a minimum, include both
a qualitative element of a participant's progress (e.g., performance on a criterion-referenced test or a grade point
average) and a quantitative element (e.g., a time limit for completion of the program or course of study). This policy
may provide for exceptional situations in which students who do not meet the standard of progress are nonetheless
making satisfactory progress during a probationary period because of mitigating circumstances.


3. 

Remained in School

_The total number of youth who, prior to termination, had been retained in full-time secondary school, including
alternative school, for one semester or at least 120 calendar days. A youth may be reported as Remained-in-School
only if he/she was attending school at the time of intake, had not received a high school diploma or its equivalent,
and was considered ``at risk of dropping out of school,'' as defined by the Governor in consultation with the State
Education Agency.


4. 

Completed Major Level of Education

_The total number of adults/youth who, prior to termination, had completed, during enrollment in the program, a level
of educational achievement which had not been reached at entry. Levels of educational achievement are secondary
and post-secondary. Completion standards shall be governed by State standards and shall include a high school diploma,
GED Certificate or equivalent at the secondary level, and shall require a diploma or other written certification
of completion at the post-secondary level.

Note:

 To obtain credit, completion of a major level of education must result primarily from active JTPA program participation
of at least 90 calendar days 

or

 200 hours, usually prior to the completion of the major level of education.



5. 

Entered Non-Title II Training

_The total number of adults/youth who, prior to termination, had entered an occupational skills employment/training
program not funded under Title II of the JTPA, that builds upon and 

does not duplicate

 training received under Title II.





Note:

 To obtain credit, the participant must have been retained in that program for at least 90 calendar days OR 200 hours


or 

must have received a certification of occupational skill attainment. During the period the participant is in non-Title
II training, he/she may or may not have received JTPA services. It is expected that the 

ultimate

 result of this outcome will be the attainment of a job-specific skill competency on the part of the terminee.


Attachment 3_Rewarding Model Programs for Out-of-School Youth


One of the Department of Labor's high priorities is to improve the effectiveness of JTPA programs for out-of-school
youth. Results from the National JTPA Study show that outcomes achieved by out-of-school youth 30 months after entering
the program are disappointing. To implement section 107(b)(7)(C) of the amended JTPA, the Department encourages
in PY 1994, and 

will require

 in PY 1995, that Governors reward out-of-school youth programs that are identified by the Department or recognized
by the State as having a demonstrated record of success. States need to develop ways to identify such programs. Possible
approaches include:
_Using outcomes achieved to identify successful programs. Outcomes could include both the two youth performance
measures and measures such as learning gains and earnings/retention in full-time employment.
_Alternatively, States could offer SDA's ``seed money'' from incentive funds to plan/operate programs that provide
innovative or high-quality training to out-of-school youth based on criteria established by the Governor. Examples
of such criteria include training that integrates occupational and basic skills training, and training that emphasizes
acquiring job skills in demand in the emerging workplace.





Note:

 Whatever method is used to reward successful out-of-school youth programs, access to such incentives must be limited
to those SDA's that serve in excess of 50 percent out-of-school youth in their overall Title II-C program.

Attachment 4_Rewarding Placements in Jobs Providing Employer-Assisted Benefits


PY 1994 is the first year Governors are asked to reward SDA's for placements in jobs with employer-assisted benefits,
including health benefits. (Governors will be 

required

 to do so beginning in PY 1995.) Rewarding such placements is intended to increase the focus on overall job quality.
To include placements in jobs with employer-assisted benefits in their incentive policies, States will need to:

1. Specify how the criterion will be measured. The definition must be consistent with that for SPIR Item 35c (i.e.,
consisting of, at a minimum, health insurance benefits and coverage under Social Security or an equivalent pension
plan). Note that it is not necessary for an individual to actually receive benefits when employment begins as long
as they are an acknowledged component of employment conditions. For example, health benefits available after a waiting-period
and benefits that are refused because of availability from another source both count as employer-assisted benefits.
Examples of measures of jobs with benefits, using data from SPIR Item 35c are:
_among terminees who enter employment, the percent who are in jobs providing employer-assisted benefits; and
_among 

all

 terminees, the percent who enter employment and are in jobs providing employer-assisted benefits.
2. Determine how to reward placement in jobs with employer-assisted benefits. One possible approach would require
the State to determine a departure point or benchmark to use in setting rewards levels for benefits. This departure
point would serve the same function served by the numerical national standards for the Secretary's core measures.
It would be the level that, before any adjustment for local factors, identifies rewardable performance. Under this
approach, a State would also decide whether and how the departure point should be adjusted for local clientele and
economic conditions when setting reward levels for each SDA.
Rather than setting reward levels for employer-assisted benefits using a process akin to setting standards for the
Secretary's core measures, States may choose a simpler approach. Because there are no sanctions based on this criterion,
it is not absolutely necessary to set a minimally acceptable performance level. It is possible to reward SDA's at all
levels of performance on employer-assisted benefits. One way to do this would be to set aside a portion of incentive
funds to reward such placements. This reward pool could be divided among SDA's based on their proportionate share
of all placements in jobs with employer-assisted benefits. This procedure is equivalent to giving a fixed amount
for each placement (i.e., the amount is the value of the pool divided by the total number of placements into jobs with
benefits in the State.
Because this approach may be viewed as favoring SDA's in areas where benefits are widely prevalent, it should be viewed
as interim until better data on employer-assisted benefits are available.

<USDEPT>NATIONAL ARCHIVES AND RECORDS ADMINISTRATION</USDEPT>



<DOCTITLE>Notice of Transfer of Function to NTIS </DOCTITLE>



In the spirit of the National Performance Review, the U.S. Department of Commerce, National Technical Information
Service (NTIS) and the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) will team up to demonstrate how government
can operate more effectively. 

The National Audiovisual Center at NARA will be transferred to NTIS under an agreement which will consolidate much
of the Federal government's capability for audio, visual, and multimedia materials production and dissemination.


At a time when NARA has developed a strategic vision of its future calling for a sharpening of its focus on the archival
aspects of its programs, the need for service support for audiovisual and multimedia across government is rapidly
increasing. Merging the complimentary strengths of the NARA National Audiovisual Center with the existing NTIS
which has been congressionally mandated to collect and disseminate scientific and technical information will result
in better services to agencies and the public. 

The new National Audiovisual Center at NTIS will be ideally positioned to serve as a hub for access to Federally developed
media and training materials. By combining resources with the NARA center, NTIS will now be able to provide Federal
training technology transfer services to both the public and private sectors. 

The transfer of the National Audiovisual Center from NARA to NTIS will be effective October 1, 1994. 

Written questions regarding this functional transfer may be sent to Charles W. Bender, Deputy Assistant Archivist
for Public Programs (NE), National Archives, 7th & Pennsylvania Avenue NW., Washington, DC 20408.

<DOCTITLE>Commonwealth Edison Co.; Consideration of Issuance of Amendment to Facility Operating License, Proposed No Significant
Hazards Consideration Determination, and Opportunity for a Hearing</DOCTITLE>


The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an amendment to Facility Operating
License No. NPF-72 issued to Commonwealth Edison Company (CECo, the licensee) for operation of the Braidwood
Station, Unit 1, located in Will County, Illinois.
The proposed amendment would revise the Braidwood, Unit 1, Technical Specifications (TSs) to remove the condition
limiting operation of the facility to 100 days during the present fuel cycle when T

hot

 is greater than 500
 F and to restore the reactor coolant dose equivalent Iodine-131 limit to 1 microcurie per gram of coolant from
the present value of 0.35. Both the limit on permissible operational time and the reduction in the permissible level
of Iodine-131 were incorporated into the TSs by Amendment No. 50 issued to Facility Operating License No. NPF-72
for Braidwood Station, Unit 1, on May 7, 1994.
Before issuance of the proposed license amendment, the Commission will have made findings required by the Atomic
Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act) and the Commission's regulations.
The Commission has made a proposed determination that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.
Under the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facility in accordance with the
proposed amendment would not (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee
has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below:
1. The proposed change does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated.
Braidwood Unit 1 TS Amendment 50 imposed a 100 calendar days with T

hot

 greater than 500
 F operating limit on Unit 1. This limitation was a consequence of the amount of main steam line break (MSLB) leakage
predicted in Braidwood Station's April 30, 1994, submittal. These predictions were made using the Log-Logistic
method of draft NUREG 1477, ``Voltage Based Interim Plugging for Steam Generator Tubes_Task Group Report,'' with
the Dose Equivalent Iodine-131 limit of Specification 3.4.8 reduced from 1.0 microcurie per gram ( u Ci/gm) to
0.35  u Ci/gm. However, WCAP 14046; ``Braidwood Unit 1 Technical Support for Cycle 5 Steam Generator Interim Plugging
Criteria'' (WCAP-14046), docketed June 10, 1994, as required by Braidwood Station's April 25, 1994, submittal,
has shown using the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) Leakrate Correlation that projected End Of Cycle (EOC)-5
MSLB leakage is 3.1 gallons per minute (gpm) which is less than the allowable limit of 9.1 gpm for Braidwood Unit 1. This
analysis is discussed in detail in WCAP-14046.
Thus the Unit 1 100-day operating limit and reactor coolant dose equivalent iodine restriction imposed by Amendment
50 on the basis of MSLB leakage is no longer required.
In addition to the 100-day, leakage based limit, the Nuclear Regulatory Commissions (NRC) Safety Evaluation Report
(SER), issued May 7, 1994, in support of Braidwood Station's Unit 1 TS Amendment 50 discusses a 4.6 month (138 day) limit
derived from a deterministic assessment of SG tube burst probability. To address the issue of tube burst for full cycle
operation Braidwood Station's April 25, 1994, submittal provided a probabilistic risk assessment which is restated
below.
As part of ComEd's evaluation of the operability of Braidwood Unit 1 Cycle 5, a risk evaluation was completed. The objective
of this evaluation was to compare core damage frequency, with containment bypass, with and without the interim plugging
criteria applied at Braidwood 1.
ComEd has evaluated the impact of operation using the proposed interim plugging criteria against the results of insights
from the draft Braidwood Individual Plant Examination (IPE). Braidwood Station is scheduled to docket its IPE June
30, 1994. Byron Station's IPE was docketed April 20, 1994. The SG sections of these documents are identical.
While the Braidwood IPE is not in its final form, it is believed that the quantification in hand is sufficiently robust
to allow a validation assessment of the impact of such operation. The ComEd evaluation parallels that described in
the NRC Staff's SER for Palo Verde Unit 2 dated August 19, 1993.
The values calculated in WCAP-14046, for Beginning of Cycle (BOC) 5 and EOC 5 using 0.6 Probability Of Detection
(POD) were used to develop a cycle average burst probability. Another BOC 5 burst probability assuming a POD of 0.6
for indications less than 3 volts and 1.0 for indications greater than 3 volts was used to evaluate the impact of POD
on core damage frequency.
The total Braidwood core damage frequency is estimated to be 2.74E-5 per reactor year with a total contribution
from containment bypass sequences of 2.9E-8 per reactor year in the current IPE. Operation with the alternate
repair criteria with a variable POD is expected to increase the MSLB with containment bypass sequence frequency contribution
by a factor of only 10%. An upper bound increase of a factor of two is derived when the fixed POD of 0.6 is employed in the
calculation. Neither increase is significant from a risk perspective.
The reason for a reduced core damage frequency with a higher POD is that large voltage indications have a high assurance
of being identified and removed from service during inspection. Therefore, the calculation of burst probability
during MSLB changes because of differences in the assumed distribution of indications left in service at BOC. The
EOC burst probability also changes because the growth distribution is added to the new BOC distribution of indications.
The result of this change is a significant reduction in burst probability during MSLB.
Therefore, the operation of Braidwood Unit 1 Cycle 5 for a complete 18 month fuel cycle with the application of the one
volt IPC does not significantly increase the core damage frequency even with the conservative assumption of a POD
of 0.6 and application of the full growth rate distribution observed during Cycle 4.

To further address SG tube burst probability, the following qualitative discussion of limited tube support plate
(TSP) displacement is provided. As part of ComEd's technical support for the implementation of IPC at Braidwood Unit
1, numerous quantitative analyses were completed to assure the structural integrity of the SG tubing. These quantitative
determinations were provided as part of WCAP-14046. These analyses focused on the quantifiable elements of
the IPC to evaluate the impact of crack length on steam generator tube leakage and burst, and were completed consistent
with the guidance provided in draft RG 1.121, ``Bases for Plugging Degraded SG Tubes.'' 
The bases for these calculations are the analyses completed by the utility industry and reported to the NRC in the EPRI
Draft Report TR-100407, ``PWR Steam Generator Tube Repair Limits_Technical Support Document for Outside
Diameter Stress Corrosion Cracking at Tube Support Plates'', Revision 1, August 1993. As explained in this document,
the analyses have been completed to assure that the general design criteria and the requirements of RG 1.121 are met
during plant operation.
In the preparation of these industry documents and the Braidwood Unit 1 specific WCAP-14046, all analyses for
leakage and burst potential were completed using the extremely conservative assumption that all Outside Diameter
Stress Corrosion Cracking (ODSCC) indications occur on the tubing freespan. In fact, as indicated in both WCAP-14046
and EPRI Draft Report TR-100407, ODSCC degradation is confined to the region of the tube/TSP intersection.
The burst capability of a section of tube containing ODSCC indications and located within the tube/TSP intersection
substantially exceeds the burst capability of a freespan tube section without ODSCC indications. Therefore, tubing
left in service by Braidwood's Unit 1 IPC amendment will not burst when confined by the tube support plates. 
In fact, it is highly unlikely that a section of tubing within the tube support plate will leak, even with through wall
cracks. 
To assure structural integrity of the tubing, even during a MSLB accident, ComEd undertook extensive analyses, presented
as part of WCAP-14046, to show analytically that the TSP's do not move far enough during a MSLB to allow degraded
tubes to uncover, and subsequently, result in increased leakage. 
A Generic Model D-4 SG Limited Support Plate Motion Analysis is also being conducted and should be submitted
to the NRC by the end of August, 1994. 
This analysis is being performed using the following assumptions:
1. The TSP crevices are clean,
2. The TSPs are free to move, depending on applied loads, along the length of the SG tube, and 
3. Movement of the TSPs along the length of the tube is not restricted by bending or distortion of the SG tube hole. 
Each of these base assumptions is extremely conservative in its own right:
1. For assumption 1, visual inspections of the secondary side of the tube bundles of Braidwood Unit 1 SGs show some quality
of deposits in the tube to TSP crevice, and along the length of the tube. Since these deposits are considered to be a possible
factor in causing ODSCC, it is likely that any tube having ODSCC indications has deposits in the tube/TSP intersection.
These deposits would tend to close the tube to TSP crevice, restricting by friction the ability of the TSP to move along
the tubes as loads are applied to the TSP during a MSLB. 
2. With regards to assumptions 2 and 3, the TSPs tend to flex and in some locations, are constrained by tie-rods and wedges
attached to the tube bundle shroud. These constraints tend to cause the TSPs to ripple under the applied loads as indicated
in WCAP-14046. This effect tends to distort the shape of the tube holes, which are fitted to a tight tolerance
around the tubes. Therefore, any distortion of these tube holes caused by motion of the TSP will tend to cause the TSP
to bind against the outside diameter of the tube, further constraining its movement away from the degraded area of
the tubing.
The impact of these facts will lessen the ability of the TSP to move, thereby significantly reducing the possibility
that a degraded section of tubing would become uncovered during a MSLB. 
Thus, this proposed license amendment request does not result in any increase in the probability or consequences
of an accident previously evaluated within the Braidwood Updated Final Safety Analysis Report (UFSAR).

2. The proposed change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated. 

Approval of this proposed change does not introduce any significant changes to the plant design basis. Removal of
the Amendment 50 and SER operating limits for Unit 1 does not provide a mechanism which could result in a new or different
kind of accident. Neither a single or multiple tube rupture event would be expected in a SG in which the IPC has been applied.


ComEd has implemented a maximum leakage rate limit of 150 gallons per day (gpd) through any one SG to help preclude the
potential for excessive leakage during all plant conditions. The RG 1.121 criterion for establishing operational
leakage rate limits that require plant shutdown are based upon leak-before-break considerations to detect a free
span crack before potential tube rupture during faulted plant conditions. The 150 gpd limit will provide for leakage
detection and plant shutdown in the event of the occurrence of an unexpected single crack resulting in leakage that
is associated with the longest permissible free span crack length. Since tube burst is precluded during normal operation
due to the proximity of the TSP to the tube and the potential exists for the crevice to become uncovered during MSLB conditions,
the leakage from the maximum permissible crack must preclude tube burst at MSLB conditions. Thus, the 105 gpd limit
provides for plant shutdown prior to reaching critical crack lengths for MSLB conditions. 

As SG tube integrity will continue to be maintained upon approval of this amendment request through inservice inspection
and primary-to-secondary leakage monitoring, the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously
evaluated is not created. 

3. The proposed change does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. 

Braidwood Unit 1 TS Amendment 50 imposed a 100 calendar days with T

hot

 greater than 500
 F operating limit on Unit 1. This limitation was a consequence of the amount of MSLB leakage predicted in Braidwood
Station's April 30, 1994, submittal. These predictions were made using the Log-Logistic method of draft NUREG 1477,
with the Dose Equivalent Iodine-131 limit of Specification 3.4.8 reduced from 1.0  u Ci/gm to 0.35  u Ci/gm. However,
WCAP 14046, docketed June 10, 1994, as required by Braidwood Station's April 25, 1994, submittal, has shown using
the EPRI Leakrate Correlation that projected EOC-5 MSLB leakage is 3.1 gpm which is less than the allowable limit
of 9.1 gpm for Braidwood Unit 1. This analysis is discussed in detail in WCAP-14046. 

Thus the Unit 1 operating limit imposed by Amendment 50 on the basis of MSLB leakage is no longer required. 

In addition to the 100 day, leakage based limit, the Nuclear Regulatory Commissions (NRC) Safety Evaluation Report
(SER), issued May 7, 1994, in support of Braidwood Station's Unit 1 TS Amendment 50 discusses a 4.6 month (138 day) limit
derived from a deterministic assessment of SG tube burst probability. To address the issue of tube burst for full cycle
operation Braidwood Station's April 25, 1994, submittal provided a probabilistic risk assessment which is restated
below. 

As part of ComEd's evaluation of the operability of Braidwood Unit 1 Cycle 5, a risk evaluation was completed. The objective
of this evaluation was to compare core damage frequency, with containment bypass, with and without the interim plugging
criteria applied at Braidwood 1. 

ComEd has evaluated the impact of operation using the proposed interim plugging criteria against the results of insights
from the draft Braidwood IPE. Braidwood Station is scheduled to docket its IPE June 30, 1994. Byron Station's IPE was
docketed April 20, 1994. The SG sections of these documents are identical. While the Braidwood IPE is not in its final
form, it is believed that the quantification in hand is sufficiently robust to allow a validation assessment of the
impact of such operation. The ComEd evaluation parallels that described in the NRC Staff's SER for Palo Verde Unit
2 dated August 19, 1993. 

The values calculated in WCAP-14046, for BOC 5 and EOC 5 using 0.6 POD were used to develop a cycle average burst
probability. Another BOC 5 burst probability assuming a POD of 0.6 for indications less than 3 volts and 1.0 for indications
greater than 3 volts was used to evaluate the impact of POD on core damage frequency. 

The total Braidwood core damage frequency is estimated to be 2.74E-5 per reactor year with a total contribution
from containment bypass sequences of 2.9E-8 per reactor year in the current IPE. Operation with the alternate
repair criteria with a variable POD is expected to increase the MSLB with containment bypass sequence frequency contribution
by a factor of only 10%. An upper bound increase of a factor of two is derived when the fixed POD of 0.6 is employed in the
calculation. Neither increase is significant from a risk perspective. 

The reason for a reduced core damage frequency with a higher POD is that large voltage indications have a high assurance
of being identified and removed from service during inspection. Therefore, the calculation of burst probability
during MSLB changes because of differences in the assumed distribution of indications left in service at BOC. The
EOC burst probability also changes because the growth distribution is added to the new BOC distribution of indications.
The result of this change is a significant reduction in burst probability during MSLB. 

Therefore, the operation of Braidwood Unit 1 Cycle 5 for a complete 18 month fuel cycle with the application of the one
volt IPC does not significantly increase the core damage frequency even with the conservative assumption of a POD
of 0.6 and application of the full growth rate distribution observed during Cycle 4.

These deposits would tend to close the tube to TSP crevice, restricting by friction the ability of the TSP to move along
the tubes as loads are applied to the TSP during a MSLB.
2. With regards to assumptions 2 and 3, the TSPs tend to flex and in some locations, are constrained by tie-rods and wedges
attached to the tube bundle shroud. These constraints tend to cause the TSPs to ripple under the applied loads as indicated
in WCAP-14046. This effect tends to distort the shape of the tube holes, which are fitted to a tight tolerance
around the tubes. Therefore, any distortion of these tube holes caused by motion of the TSP will tend to cause the TSP
to bind against the outside diameter of the tube, further constraining its movement away from the degraded area of
the tubing.
The impact of these facts will lessen the ability of the TSP to move, thereby significantly reducing the possibility
that a degraded section of tubing would become uncovered during a MSLB.
This evidence, in conjunction with the probability of occurrence of a MSLB, and the probabilistic assessment of the
consequences of a MSLB, results in the substantially increased assurance that the consequences of a MSLB will be significantly
less severe than those assessed in WCAP-14046 and the generic Model D-4 SG Limited Support Plate Motion
Analyses.
Thus, this proposed change does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.

The NRC staff has reviewed the pertinent portions of the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears
that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. This staff finding is partially based on the licensee's
usage of a constant value for the Probability of Detection (POD) of 0.6 as recommended in draft NUREG-1447. This
is consistent with the staff's position in the Safety Evaluation (SE) it issued in support of Amendment No. 50 to the
Braidwood, Unit 1, operating license. While the licensee also discussed in its analysis the usage of a higher value
for the POD, the staff did not rely on this. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request
involves no significant hazards consideration.

The Commission is seeking public comments on this proposed determination. Any comments received within 30 days after
the date of publication of this notice will be considered in making any final determination.

Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendment until the expiration of the 30-day notice period. However,
should circumstances change during the notice period such that failure to act in a timely way would result, for example,
in derating or shutdown of the facility, the Commission may issue the license amendment before the expiration of the
30-day notice period, provided that its final determination is that the amendment involves no significant hazards
consideration. The final determination will consider all public and State comments received. Should the Commission
take this action, it will publish in the 

Federal Register

 a notice of issuance and provide for opportunity for a hearing after issuance. The Commission expects that the need
to take this action will occur very infrequently. 

Written comments may be submitted by mail to the Rules Review and Directives Branch, Division of Freedom of Information
and Publications Services, Office of Administration, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555,
and should cite the publication date and page number of this 

Federal Register

 notice. Written comments may also be delivered to Room 6D22, Two White Flint North, 11545 Rockville Pike, Rockville,
Maryland, from 7:30 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. Federal workdays. Copies of written comments received may be examined at the
NRC Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555.

The filing of requests for hearing and petitions for leave to intervene is discussed below.

By August 10, 1994, the licensee may file a request for a hearing with respect to issuance of the amendment to the subject
facility operating license and any person whose interest may be affected by this proceeding and who wishes to participate
as a party in the proceeding must file a written request for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene. Requests
for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's ``Rules of Practice
for Domestic Licensing Proceedings'' in 10 CFR Part 2. Interested persons should consult a current copy of 10 CFR 2.714
which is available at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington,
DC 20555 and at the local public document room located at Wilmington Township Public Library, 201 S. Kankakee Street,
Wilmington, Illinois 60481. If a request for a hearing or petition for leave to intervene is filed by the above date,
the Commission or an Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, designated by the Commission or by the Chairman of the Atomic
Safety and Licensing Board Panel, will rule on the request and/or petition; and the Secretary or the designated Atomic
Safety and Licensing Board will issue a notice of hearing or an appropriate order. 

As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall set forth with particularity the interest of the
petitioner in the proceeding, and how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding. The petition
should specifically explain the reasons why intervention should be permitted with particular reference to the following
factors: (1) the nature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made party to the proceeding; (2) the nature and
extent of the petitioner's property, financial, or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect
of any order which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest. The petition should also identify
the specific aspect(s) of the subject matter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Any person
who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has been admitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting
leave of the Board up to 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended
petition must satisfy the specificity requirements described above.

Not later than 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file
a supplement to the petition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions which are sought to be litigated
in the matter. Each contention must consist of a specific statement of the issue of law or fact to be raised or controverted.
In addition, the petitioner shall provide a brief explanation of the bases of the contention and a concise statement
of the alleged facts or expert opinion which support the contention and on which the petitioner intends to rely in proving
the contention at the hearing. The petitioner must also provide references to those specific sources and documents
of which the petitioner is aware and on which the petitioner intends to rely to establish those facts or expert opinion.
Petitioner must provide sufficient information to show that a genuine dispute exists with the applicant on a material
issue of law or fact. Contentions shall be limited to matters within the scope of the amendment under consideration.
The contention must be one which, if proven, would entitle the petitioner to relief. A petitioner who fails to file
such a supplement which satisfies these requirements with respect to at least one contention will not be permitted
to participate as a party.

Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subject to any limitations in the order granting leave
to intervene, and have the opportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, including the opportunity
to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses.

If a hearing is requested, the Commission will make a final determination on the issue of no significant hazards consideration.
The final determination will serve to decide when the hearing is held. 

If the final determination is that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration, the Commission
may issue the amendment and make it immediately effective, notwithstanding the request for a hearing. Any hearing
held would take place after issuance of the amendment.

If the final determination is that the amendment request involves a significant hazards consideration, any hearing
held would take place before the issuance of any amendment.
A request for a hearing or a petition for leave to intervene must be filed with the Secretary of the Commission, U.S.
Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Docketing and Services Branch, or may be delivered
to the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555, by the above
date. Where petitions are filed during the last 10 days of the notice period, it is requested that the petitioner promptly
so inform the Commission by a toll-free telephone call to Western Union at 1-(800) 248-5100 (in Missouri
1-(800) 342-6700). The Western Union operator should be given Datagram Identification Number N1023
and the following message addressed to Robert A. Capra: petitioner's name and telephone number, date petition was
mailed, plant name, and publication date and page number of this 

Federal Register

 notice. A copy of the petition should also be sent to the Office of the General Counsel, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,
Washington, DC 20555, and to Michael I. Miller, Esquire; Sidley and Austin, One First National Plaza, Chicago, Illinois
60690, attorney for the licensee.
Nontimely filings of petitions for leave to intervene, amended petitions, supplemental petitions and/or requests
for hearing will not be entertained absent a determination by the Commission, the presiding officer or the presiding
Atomic Safety and Licensing Board that the petition and/or request should be granted based upon a balancing of the
factors specified in 10 CFR 2.714(a)(1) (i)-(v) and 2.714(d).
For further details with respect to this action, see the application for amendment dated June 20, 1994, which is available
for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington,
DC 20555 and at the local public document room located at Wilmington Township Public Library, 201 S. Kankakee Street,

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

In accordance with  21A(b)(4)(C) of the Federal Home Loan Bank Act, 12 U.S.C. 1441a(b)(4)(C), the Resolution
Trust Corporation (RTC) announces the establishment of a procedure for non-defaulting commercial borrowers to
appeal decisions by the RTC, when acting as conservator of an insured depository institution, which have the effect
of terminating or otherwise adversely affecting credit agreements.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Introduction and Authority



Section 3(b) of the Resolution Trust Corporation Completion Act (RTC Completion Act), Public Law No. 93-204,
enacted on December 17, 1993, added a new subparagraph (C) to  21A(b)(4) of the Federal Home Loan Bank Act, 12
U.S.C. 1441a(b)(4), which requires the RTC to implement and maintain a program, in a manner acceptable to the Thrift
Depositor Protection Oversight Board (Oversight Board), to provide an appeals process for business and commercial
borrowers to appeal decisions by the RTC, when acting as conservator of an insured depository institution, which
would have the effect of terminating or otherwise adversely affecting credit or loan agreements, lines of credit,
and similar arrangements with such borrowers who have not defaulted on their obligations to the institution in conservatorship.

The RTC submitted this Policy on Procedures for Non-defaulting Commercial Borrowers to Appeal Adverse Credit Decisions
of the RTC Acting as Conservator to the Oversight Board for consideration at its June 16, 1994 meeting. The Oversight
Board adopted a resolution approving the policy at that meeting. In that resolution the Oversight Board suggested
that the RTC make the public aware of the new policy through publication in the 

Federal Register

. 

The RTC is rapidly resolving the remaining institutions it operates in conservatorships. Inasmuch as the policy
affects only the operation of those institutions in conservatorship, there is a critical need to make the public aware
of this new policy quickly. 

In light of the request of the Oversight Board and the need to publicize the policy quickly, the RTC has concluded that
publication in the 

Federal Register

 would be the best means of disseminating the new policy to members of the public with an interest in the subject matter.




Policy on Procedures for Non-Defaulting Commercial Borrowers to Appeal Adverse Credit Decisions of the RTC Acting
as Conservator 



The RTC is issuing procedures which provide a process for non-defaulting business and commercial borrowers to appeal
the RTC's decisions (when acting as a conservator) which terminate or otherwise adversely affect credit or loan agreements,
lines of credit or other similar arrangements. 



I. Scope



The appeals process outlined herein pertains to adverse credit decisions affecting a non-defaulting commercial
borrower made by the RTC as conservator for an insured depository institution for which the RTC was acting as conservator
on or after December 17, 1993. These procedures shall only apply to adverse credit decisions affecting a non-defaulting
commercial borrower made on or after December 17, 1993 by the RTC as conservator for an insured depository institution
and only during the period for which the RTC acts as conservator for such insured depository institution. The appeals
process is not intended to deny borrowers any rights otherwise provided under law. 

The appeals process described in this policy does not limit or affect the exercise by the RTC, as conservator or receiver,
of its authority to repudiate contracts pursuant to 12 U.S.C.  1821(e).



II. Background



Generally, a predecessor institution retains the obligation to fund unfunded or partially funded loan commitments,
and such obligations are not transferred to or assumed by the new savings association which the RTC operates in conservatorship.
However, it has also been the RTC's policy for the conservator to consider funding partially funded loan commitments,
as generally outlined in the Asset Management and Disposition Manual, Circular 10100.1, Change-One, Section F(3),
and as further detailed with respect to the handling of construction loans in Circular 10100.32, Subject: ``Funding
of ADC Loan Commitments,'' which can be obtained upon request to one of the above listed contacts or from one of the public
reading rooms of the RTC. These practices will continue. Pursuant to Section 21A(b)(4)(C) of the Federal Home Loan
Bank Act, as added by Section 3(b) of the RTC Completion Act, effective December 17, 1993, whenever the RTC acting as
conservator decides to deny an extension of credit to a non-defaulting commercial borrower, the borrower shall have
an opportunity to appeal the decision to the next level of authority above the initial decision maker, as described
below.

III. Definitions


The following definitions shall apply for purposes of this policy:
A. 

Adverse Credit Decision_

a decision, made by the RTC as conservator of an insured depository institution, to deny funds or a request for a new
extension of credit for commercial or business purposes to a non-defaulting commercial borrower. 
B. 

Credit Agreement_

a construction loan agreement, commercial mortgage agreement, commercial business loan agreement, line of credit
agreement or other commercial credit agreement for commercial or business purposes. 
C. 

Non-defaulting Commercial Borrower_

a person or entity, 
(1) who entered into a credit agreement with either: 
(a) the predecessor institution prior to the appointment of the RTC as receiver of the predecessor institution, or

(b) the depository institution in conservatorship prior to the appointment of the RTC as conservator, where there
is no predecessor institution, and 
(2) who is not in default of any obligations owed to the predecessor institution or the institution in conservatorship.

D. 

Predecessor Institution_

the insured depository institution in receivership from which the assets, deposits and certain other liabilities
were transferred to the depository institution in conservatorship which made the adverse credit decision. 


IV. General Policies


A. Right of Appeal


A non-defaulting commercial borrower shall have the right to appeal an adverse credit decision made by a Managing
Agent or other person or entity authorized to act on behalf of the RTC as conservator of an insured depository institution.



B. Notice to Non-Defaulting Commercial Borrower 


A Managing Agent or other person or entity authorized to act on behalf of the RTC as conservator shall give notice to
a non-defaulting commercial borrower of (1) any adverse credit decision within the scope of this directive as outlined
in the Paragraph I above, and (2) the right to appeal such decision. The notice should be sent via certified/registered
mail-return receipt requested to document receipt by the borrower. (Two sample forms of such notice are included
as Appendices A and B.) This notice is in addition to any notice by the conservator terminating a line of credit, or other
credit agreement, or notice by the receiver of the predecessor institution repudiating a loan commitment or other
credit agreement. 


C. Procedure for the Appeal


(1) The Senior Credit Review Committee of the field office with jurisdiction over the conservatorship shall normally
decide the appeal of the non-defaulting commercial borrower. However, if the adverse credit decision under appeal
was made by a field office's Senior Review Committee, or by a person or entity at a level of authority above the field
office Senior Credit Review Committee, then the person or entity at the next level of authority above the initial decision
maker, as determined by the RTC's delegations of authority, shall decide the appeal of the non-defaulting borrower.
(The person or entity deciding the appeal is hereafter referred to as the ``hearer of the appeal.'')
(2) A non-defaulting commercial borrower must file an appeal, in writing, with the hearer of the appeal within 60 calendar
days of receipt of the notice described in subparagraph IV.B above. 
(3) A non-defaulting commercial borrower must state the grounds for the appeal. The non-defaulting commercial borrower
may submit only documentary evidence in support of the appeal. 
(4) The hearer of the appeal shall make a good faith effort to decide the appeal within 30 calendar days of receipt of
the appeal and all documentation necessary to act on the appeal. 
(5) (a) The record of an appeal shall consist of the written appeal and documentary evidence submitted by the non-defaulting
commercial borrower and any other evidence and information within the possession or control of the RTC that relates
to the appeal. 
(b) The non-defaulting commercial borrower shall have the right to review any documentation submitted by such borrower,
along with the appeal or prior to the filing of the appeal, for purposes of determining the accuracy of the RTC's records.
The hearer of the appeal may extend the period for deciding the appeal of such reasonable time as may be necessary to
permit any such review of the documentation submitted by the borrower. 
(6) The hearer of the appeal may reverse an adverse credit decision if the hearer determines that (a) the extension
of credit is likely to reduce a conservatorship's overall losses, or (b) the extension of credit would not be likely
to increase the conservatorship's overall losses.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940711-2-00135 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940711-2-00054 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(7) As a condition to reversing the adverse credit decision, the hearer of the appeal may require the non-defaulting
commercial borrower to release any related claim against the receiver for a predecessor institution, in whole or
in part.
(8) The hearer of the appeal shall provide written notice of the decision, including an explanation of any negative
ruling, to the relevant Managing Agent, Field Office Claims Department, and to the non-defaulting commercial borrower.
The RTC will make a good faith effort to provide such notice within 30 calendar days of receiving the Appeal Letter and
all other information necessary to act on the appeal.


D. Appeal Log


A log should be maintained in each conservatorship to track each appeal under this procedure. Entries in the log, to
be initiated upon receipt of the borrower's appeal, shall include the following items: borrower's name, date of credit
application, date of adverse credit decision, decision by whom, date borrower's appeal received, hearer the of appeal,
date of hearer's decision, date borrower notified of decision, and remarks.


E. Appointment of Receiver



Upon the appointment of a receiver for the depository institution operated in conservatorship by the RTC, with respect
to such institution, the right of all non-defaulting commercial borrowers to appeal (and any pending appeal) under
this process terminates. Thereafter, any rights of the non-defaulting commercial borrowers, with respect to such
depository institution, are governed by 12 U.S.C.  1821(d).


F. No Further Appeal



A non-defaulting commercial borrower shall have no right to appeal the decision of the hearer of the appeal within
the RTC or to any court.


G. No Effect on RTC's Rights as Receiver or Conservator



Nothing contained in this policy shall be construed to waive or alter the rights of the RTC as conservator or receiver
with respect to any commercial borrower or any insured depository institution. Such rights include, by way of illustration
only, the rights to repudiate contracts, to leave obligations and liabilities with the receiver of the predecessor
institution and to require non-defaulting commercial borrowers to adhere to the receivership claims procedures
of the RTC.
The filing of an appeal with the hearer of the appeal in accordance with the appeal procedures outlined in subparagraph
IV.C above does not preserve, and does not substitute for, the requirement that a claim be filed and the claims process
be pursued with respect to any claim against: (1) the receiver for any predecessor institution, or (2) the receiver
for the depository institution operated in conservatorship if a receiver is appointed for such institution.


V. Responsibility


RTC Field Office Vice Presidents are responsible for ensuring that all conservatorships, SAMDA contractors, commercial
loan servicers, other commercial loan managers, and appropriate RTC staff are aware of and comply with this policy.




By Order of John E. Ryan, Deputy and Acting Chief Executive Officer.




Dated at Washington, D.C., this 5th day of July, 1994.

Appendix A_Notice of Adverse Decision and Right To Appeal


[For Use Where Conservator Does Not Assume Obligation To Fund and/or Where the Receiver of Predecessor Institution
Repudiates]
[date]


[Name of Borrower]
[Address of Borrower]
Dear 

XXXXXXXX

:


Effective [date], the Office of Thrift Supervision appointed the Resolution Trust Corporation as Receiver for [Predecessor
Institution]. Concurrently with such appointment, a new federal mutual association was formed, [name of de novo
institution], and the Resolution Trust Corporation was appointed Conservator of the [name of de novo institution]
(the ``Conservator''). Most of the assets of [Predecessor Institution] were acquired by the Conservator in consideration
of the assumption by the Conservator of some, but not all, of the liabilities of the [Predecessor Institution]. The
Conservator DID NOT, however, assume the obligation to continue to fund your loan

{

, and as you were informed in another letter the Receiver for [Predecessor Institution] has repudiated the loan agreement
and terminated any obligation to continue to fund your loan

}

.
 You may have a claim against the Receiver of [Predecessor Institution] for the unfunded loan amount. You must follow
any instructions from the receiver regarding the filing of such claim.




Notwithstanding that the Conservator has no obligation to continue to fund your loan, the Conservator has the discretion
to provide funds to you through a new extension of credit, when the Conservator determines, in its sole discretion,
that it is in the best interest of the Conservator to provide those funds. However, the Conservator has decided not
to provide funds to you.
Because you are a non-defaulting commercial borrower of [name of the predecessor institution], section 21A(b)(4)(C)
of the Federal Home Loan Bank Act provides you with an opportunity to appeal this adverse credit decision of the Conservator.
You must submit your appeal in writing to the hearer of the appeal, set forth below, within 60 days of receipt of this
notice, stating the grounds for your appeal. In support of your appeal, you may submit documentary evidence, which
must be submitted at the same time as your letter of appeal. The hearer of the appeal will conduct no evidentiary hearing.
A copy of the RTC's policy on borrower appeals is attached for your information.
You should know that the hearer of the appeal may only reverse the adverse credit decision if the hearer determines
that to do so would reduce, or would not increase, the overall losses to the RTC as Conservator.
Your appeal should be submitted to:



[Name of Hearer of the Appeal

]


 [Address of Hearer]
Attention: 

XXXXXX





The filing of an appeal with the hearer of the appeal does not preserve your claim with the receiver of [Predecessor
Institution] or affect in any way the right of the Receiver to repudiate your credit agreement.



Sincerely,



[Managing Agent or other official]

Dear 

XXXXXX

: 

The Resolution Trust Corporation acting as Conservator of [name of de novo] (the ``Conservator'') has [reviewed

Loan Bank Act provides you with an opportunity to appeal this adverse credit decision of the Conservator. You must
submit your appeal in writing to the hearer of the appeal, set forth below, within 60 days of receipt of this notice,
stating the grounds for your appeal. In support of your appeal, you may submit documentary evidence, which must be
submitted at the same time as your letter of appeal. The hearer of the appeal will conduct no evidentiary hearing. A
copy of the RTC's policy on borrower appeals is attached for your information. 

You should know that the hearer of the appeal may only reverse the adverse credit decision if the hearer determines
that to do so would reduce, or would not increase, the overall losses to the RTC as Conservator. 

 


Your appeal should be submitted to:

<USDEPT>SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION</USDEPT>






Self-Regulatory Organizations; The American Stock Exchange, Inc.; Filng and Order Granting Approval on an Accelerated
Basis of a Proposed Rule Change Relating to Trade-Day Comparison


July 1, 1994.



Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''),
 notice is hereby given that the American Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Amex'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission
(``Commission'') on May 6, 1994, the proposed rule change (File No. SR-Amex-94-13) as described
in Items I and II below. The Commission is publishing this notice and order to solicit comments from interested persons
and to grant accelerated approval of the proposed rule change.




I. Self-Regulatory Organizations' Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change



The proposed rule change will allow Amex to implement a program, in conjunction with the New York Stock Exchange, Inc.
(``NYSE'') and the National Securities Clearing Corportion (``NSCC''), to compare all Amex equity trades on trade
date. Amex will phase-in the program commencing June 30, 1994, with full implementation scheduled for June 30, 1995.



II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change


In its filings with the Commission, Amex included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed
rule changes and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be
examined at the places specified in Item IV below. Amex has prepared summaries, set forth in sections A, B, and C below,
of the most significant aspects of such statements.


A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change


Since 1988, Amex has sought to improve its clearing operations and to reduce exposure to loss through market volatility
by reducing the comparison cycle in stocks and in options. The Amex has reduced the comparison times first from five
business days to three business days and then to one business day after the trade date. For the past five years, the Amex,
in conjunction with the NYSE, has been working with the member firm community and the NSCC to establish operational
parameters, systems, and rules for shortening trade comparison time frames. In 1989, the Amex adopted Rule 719, which
requires next-day comparison (``T+1'') of exchange transactions, and developed its Intra-Day Comparison (``IDC'')
System, which is an electronic system designed to match trade sides and to resolve uncompared trades known as ``don't
knows'' or ``DKs.''
 The IDC System is used by Amex for both equities and options.




The Amex now proposes to implement, again in conjunction with NYSE and NSCC, trade-date comparison of Amex equity
transactions. Trade-date comparison will be implemented in phases with a final target date of June 30, 1995. The first
phase of this program is scheduled to be implemented by the end of June 1994. When the first phase has been implemented,
the Amex will require all member firms to input equity trade data into the IDC System every two hours on the date of the
trade rather than once daily. Input times will be 12:00 noon, 2:00 p.m., 4:00 p.m., and 6:00 p.m. Amex member firms already
are submitting option trade data into the IDC System on trade-date on an hourly basis. The IDC System will continue
to be the main processor of the comparison data. The Amex will transmit the compared trades to a registered clearing
agency in order to complete the process.

The Amex is not proposing any written changes to its rules at this time. Amex Rule 719(a), which currently requires
each transaction effected on the Amex to be compared or closed out no later than close-of-business on T+1, will remain
in effect for the present time. The Amex believes that its Rule 719(c), which requires members to submit trade data
as may be required by the Amex, provides it with sufficient authority to require clearing members to submit trade data
in listed stocks and options for comparison by such times as Amex may prescribe. However, as the final implementation
date of June 30, 1995, approaches, Amex will file any other rule changes with the Commission pursuant to Section 19(b)
of the Act
 and Rule 19b-4 thereunder
 as are necessary or appropraite to implement the trade-date comparison program. As indicated above, any such Amex
rule changes will be developed in conjunction with the NYSE and NSCC, and Amex will work with the NYSE and NSCC to achieve
uniformity and to monitor the implementation of each phase of this program.





The Amex states that it believes the proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6(b) of the Act
 in general and with Section 6(b)(5)
 in particular because it will help prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, will promote just and
equitable principles of trade, and will foster cooperation and coordination with persons engaged in regulating,
clearing, settling, processing information with respect to, and facilitating transactions in securities.





B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition


Amex believes that the proposed rule changes will impose no burden on competition.

C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Changes Received From Members, Participants
or Others


Amex has neither solicited nor received any comments from its members, participants, or others.


III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action


For the reasons discussed below, the Commission believes the proposal is consistent with Section 6(b) of the Act.
Section 6(b)(5) of the Act
 states that exchange rules should be designed to foster cooperation and coordination with persons engaged in regulating,
clearing, settling, and processing information with respect to securities transactions and to protect investors
and the public interest.





The risks posed by uncompared trades and by the long span of time between trade execution and trade comparison (as long
as five business days for equity transactions until 1990) came under intense scrutiny after the Market Break of October
1987. The leading studies of the Market Break of 1987 identified uncompared trades as a major stress point in post-trade
processing which, together with the unprecedented trading volume and the unprecedented price volatility during
the Market Break, posed an unacceptable threat to the marketplace.
 The Commission, in its recommendations to Congress in February of 1988, proposed that markets accelerate their efforts
to compare all trades on trade date.







Since 1988, the Amex, among others, has sought to improve clearing operations and to reduce exposure to losses associated
with market volatility occurring during the period between execution and settlement. The Amex reduced its comparison
cycle in stocks first from T+5 to T+3 and then to T+1 in 1990.






As stated above, the Commission believes that the proposed rule change which shortens the Amex comparison cycle from
T+1 to trade date will make Amex's comparison process safer in terms of the risks resulting from market price volatility
and more efficient in terms of the time and expense involved in post-trade processing. The Commission believes that
the proposal will offer additional protection to investors, brokers, and other persons that safeguard investors'
funds and facilitate investors' transactions. In the Commission's view, this proposal will provide fundamental
and important improvements to the marketplace.
The Amex has requested that the Commission find good cause for approving the proposed rule changes prior to the thirtieth
day after the date of publication of notice of the filings in the 

Federal Register

. Trade-date comparison is to be phased-in by both Amex and NYSE on a parallel schedule, and the NYSE has begun some aspects
of its phase-in program.
 Accelerated approval of this proposal will permit Amex, as well as the NYSE and NSCC, to provide their clearing members
with a more coordinated implementation of trade-date comparison. Furthermore, because neither the Commission
nor NYSE received any written comments on the NYSE's proposal, which was very similar to the Amex's proposal, and because
the Amex did not receive any comments from its members in response to its Information Circular,
 the Commission does not expect to receive any comments on this proposal. Therefore, the Commission believes there
is good cause for approving the proposed rule changes prior to the thirtieth day after the date of publication of notice
of the filing.






IV. Solicitation of Comments


Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views, and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submissions, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying in the Commission's
Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies also will be available for inspection
and copying at the principal office of the Amex. All submissions should refer to File No. SR-Amex-94-13
and should be submitted by August 1, 1994.
It is therefore ordered, pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act
 that the above-mentioned proposed rule changes (File No. SR-Amex-94-13) be, and hereby is, approved.






For the Commission by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Filing of Proposed Rule Change by the National Association of Securities Dealers,
Inc. Relating to Security Application Fee for The PORTAL Market</DOCTITLE>


July 1, 1994.



Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Exchange Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice
is hereby given that on June 22, 1994, the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (``NASD'' or ``Association''),
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described
in Items I, II, and III below, which Items have been prepared by the NASD. The Commission is publishing this notice to
solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons.


I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change


The NASD is proposing to amend The PORTAL Market Rules, Schedule I to the NASD By-Laws (``PORTAL Rules''), to add a security
application fee with respect to securities submitted for designation in The PORTAL Market. Below is the text of the
proposed rule change. Proposed new language is in italics. 


The PORTAL Market
Schedule I to the NASD By-Laws


* * * * *


PART VI
PORTAL MARKET TRANSACTIONS


* * * * *


Sec. 4 PORTAL Fees


PORTAL participants shall pay to the Association a fee for PORTAL transactions or such other fees as determined by
the Association, 

which are set forth in Part IX of the PORTAL Rules.

 The Board of Governors shall have the power to impose, alter, or amend such fees from time to time pursuant to Article
VI, Section 1 of the By-Laws.


* * * * *


PART IX
PORTAL FEES
Sec. 1 Entry Fee




When a PORTAL participant submits an application for designation of any class of securities as a PORTAL security,
it shall pay to the Corporation a filing fee of $2,000 per class of security covered by the security application submitted
plus $200 per assigned security symbol that is in addition to the first symbol assigned.


II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change


In its filing with the Commission, the NASD included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed
rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be
examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The NASD has prepared summaries, set forth in Sections (A), (B),
and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.


(A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change


(a) Purpose 


The PORTAL Market is the market operated by The Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc., for the quotation of securities that are
restricted securities, as defined in Rule 144(a)(3) under the Securities Act of 1933 (``Securities Act''), or are
securities that are treated as if restricted.
 In order to qualify for inclusion in The PORTAL Market, a security that is restricted or treated as if restricted must
be eligible to be sold pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act, 
 be in negotiable form, and be assigned a CUSIP or other security identification number that is different from any identification
number assigned to any unrestricted securities of the same class.








The PORTAL Market has processed over one thousand applications for designation as a PORTAL security. Designation
of a security as a PORTAL security permits the security to be assigned a CUSIP number by Standard & Poor's Corporation
and be cleared and settled through the Depository Trust Company. Section 2 of the PORTAL Rules permits any PORTAL participant
to submit an application for security designation, rather than the issuer of the security. ``PORTAL participants''
include PORTAL dealers, PORTAL brokers, and PORTAL investors. The first two categories of PORTAL participants are
required to be brokers and dealers registered with the Commission under Section 15 of the Exchange Act and members
of the NASD. The third category of PORTAL participants are institutional investors that are not members of the NASD
that meet the definition of ``qualified institutional buyer'' under Rule 144A.

The NASD has operated The PORTAL Market since it initiated operations in June 1990 without the imposition of any fees
on users. The NASD is proposing to adopt a filing fee of $2,000 per security application submitted plus $200 for each
security identification symbol assigned after the first symbol. Many private offerings of securities are of securities
that are sold in multiple tranches, each of which is treated as a separate security, even though part of a single private
offering, and assigned a separate identification symbol by The PORTAL Market.

The NASD believes that the imposition of a PORTAL filing fee will assist The Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc. to cover continuing
costs associated with the operation of the PORTAL Market, including significant costs associated with the processing
of security applications. The processing of security applications for The PORTAL Market requires an immediate review
of all applications, as private placements are usually on a very short time schedule. Such review must ensure that
the security meets all of the requirements in Part II of the PORTAL Rules, as set forth above.

Applications are generally submitted the day prior to commencing the private placement or the day prior to conducting
a ``road show,'' if such a road show is used, and approval is necessary within one or two days at the most.
 In addition, because of a continuing lack of knowledge regarding the procedures for obtaining approval for PORTAL
designation, Depository Trust Company book-entry approval, and the issuance of a CUSIP number from Standard &
Poor's, The Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc. staff must work closely with the applicant to complete the process. Further,
private offerings that rely on Rule 144A for redistribution of the securities to qualified institutional buyers
are many times unique in their structure, as well as frequently involving issues related to SEC Regulation S and compliance
with the CUSIP identification number requirement when an offshore offering occurs simultaneously with a U.S. private
placement. Finally, there are many issues with multiple tranches, each of which must be assigned a separate security
symbol. Given the efforts required by The Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc. staff, the NASD belies that the fees as proposed
are appropriate.





(b) Statutory Basis



The NASD believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with the provisions of Section 15A(b)(5) of the Exchange
Act,
 which requires that the rules of the Association provide for the equitable allocation of reasonable dues, fees and
other charges among members and issuers and other persons using any facility or system which the Association operates
or controls in that the proposed rule change equitably applies a filing fee to all applications submitted by PORTAL
dealers, PORTAL brokers, and PORTAL qualified investors for the designation of securities in The PORTAL Market.

(B) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition



The NASD does not believe that the proposed rule change will result in any burden on competition that is not necessary
or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Exchange Act, as amended.



(C) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received from Members, Participants,
or Others



Written comments were neither solicited nor received.



III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action



Within 35 days of the date of publication of this notice in the 

Federal Register

 or within such longer period (i) as the Commission may designate up to 90 days of such date if it finds such longer period
to be appropriate and publishes its reasons for so finding or (ii) as to which the self-regulatory organization consents,
the Commission will:


A. by order approve such proposed rule change, or

B. institute proceedings to determine whether the proposed rule change should be disapproved.



IV. Solicitation of Comments 



Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views, and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying in the Commission's
Public Reference Room. Copies of such filing will also be available for inspection and copying at the principal office
of the NASD. All submissions should refer to the file number in the caption above and should be submitted by August 1,
1994.




For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority, 17 CFR 200.30-3(a)(12).

Connecticut Light and Power Company (70-7320)



Connecticut Light and Power Company (``CL&P''), Selden Street, Berlin, Connecticut 06037, an electric public-utility
subsidiary company of Northwest Utilities, a registered holding company, has filed a post-effective amendment
under Sections 6(a) and 7 of the Act and rule 54 thereunder to its declaration previously filed under Sections 6(a)
and 5 of the Act and rule 50(a)(5) thereunder.

By order dated December 16, 1986 (HCAR No. 24263), the Commission authorized CL&P, among other things, to issue
a promissory note up to an aggregate principal amount of $25 million to the Industrial Development Authority of the
State of New Hampshire (``IDA''). The note evidenced IDA's loan to CL&P of the proceeds from pollution control
revenue bonds (``Bonds'') issued by IDA to finance the cost of acquiring, constructing and installing certain pollution
control facilities and/or sewage or solid waste disposal facilities at the Seabrook Nuclear Power Station, Unit
No. 1 in Seabrook, New Hampshire.

In an effort to improve the credit ratings of the Bonds, CL&P obtained a letter of credit (``LOC'') from the Long-Term
Credit Bank of Japan Limited (``Credit Bank''). Subsequent to the issuance of the Bonds, Credit Bank's rating in the
financial markets deteriorated. CL&P has been informed that many institutional investors that otherwise would
be interested in purchasing the bonds will not purchase securities secured by letters of credit issued by the Credit
Bank, and investors that are still willing to purchase the Bonds are demanding an interest rate premium that is causing
CL&P's effective interest cost to be higher than it would have otherwise been using a bank with a higher rating.

CL&P now seeks authority to: (1) replace Credit Bank LOC and the Bank Reimbursement Agreement with a new Letter
of Credit and Reimbursement Agreement (``Substitute Agreement''); (2) replace the LOC with a new letter of Credit
(``New LOC''); and subsequently thereto (3) extend, modify, or replace the Substitute Agreement and the New LOC from
time to time during the term of the bonds supported thereby. The terms of any such extensions, modifications or replacements,
including the New LOC and the Substitute Agreement, shall provide that (a) the total amount available to be drawn under
any such extended, modified or replacement letter of credit does not exceed $16.2 million, representing principal
in the amount of $15.4 million and interest in the amount of $800,000 calculated at the maximum rate of 15% for 123 days,
(b) the annual letter of credit costs applicable to any such extension, modification, or replacement do not exceed
1% per annum of the total amount available to be drawn under the extended, modified or replacement letter of credit,
and (c) the reimbursement agreement applicable to any such extension, modification or replacement shall provide
(or shall afford CL&P the option to elect) that tender advances tear interest until paid at a rate not to exceed
the higher of the prime rate plus 2% or the federal funds rate plus 2%, (d) such extension, modification or replacement
is otherwise on terms that are substantially similar in all material respects to those applicable to the New LOC and
Substitute Agreement (or previous extensions or modifications thereof or replacements therefore proposed to be
entered into in connection with the replacement of Credit Bank, and (e) CL&P shall have obtained all necessary
State Commission approvals applicable to such extension, modification or replacement.

Consolidated Natural Gas Company (70-8167)


Consolidated Natural Gas Company (``CNG''), CNG Tower, 625 Liberty Avenue, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15222, a registered
holding company, has filed a post-effective amendment under Sections 6 and 7 of the Act and Rule 54 thereunder to its
declaration previously filed under Sections 6 and 7 of the Act and Rule 50(a)(5) thereunder.
By order dated April 21, 1993 (HCAR No. 25800) (``April Order''), the Commission authorized CNG to issue and sell on
or before June 30, 1995 up to $400 million principal amount of debentures (``Debentures'') in one or more series at
a price, exclusive of accrued interest, which would be not less than 98% nor more than 101% of the principal amount and
at an interest rate which would be a multiple of 1/8, 1/10, or 1/20 of 1%. The Debentures would mature in not more than
thirty years and would be issued in accordance with the indenture between CNG and Chemical Bank (successor by merger
to Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company), as Trustee, dated May 1, 1971 (``Indenture''). CNG has sold $300 million
of Debentures under the April Order, thus $100 million of Debentures remains authorized for issue and sale. 
CNG now proposes to change its Indenture by adding section 4.02 so that it may reserve the right, without the consent
of the holders of future debenture issues sold under the April Order, to amend sections 6.06 and 6.07 of the Indenture.
New section 4.02 provides:




The Company reserves the right, subject to appropriate corporate action, but without consent, approval or other
action by holders of debentures of any series created after May 1, 1994, to make such amendments to the Indenture, as
heretofore supplemented and amended, as shall be necessary in order to amend Sections 6.06 and 6.07 thereof so as to
modify or eliminate the provisions or requirements of such Sections, or any part thereof and the definition of any
term used in either of such Sections or related thereto, as the Company may determine in its sole discretion.





Section 6.06 provides that funded debt (as defined) cannot be incurred and subsidiary preferred stock cannot be issued
unless: (1) The consolidated income available for interest and subsidiary preferred stock dividends of CNG and its
subsidiaries for any 12 consecutive months within 15 months immediately preceding the date additional funded debt
is incurred is not less than 21/2 times the sum of the total annual interest charges and the total subsidiary preferred
stock dividends, assuming the incurrence of such additional funded debt or issuance of such preferred stock, as the
case may be; and (2) after giving effect to the incurring of the additional funded debt and issuance of preferred stock,
the sum of the outstanding consolidated debt of CNG and its subsidiaries and the amount of outstanding subsidiary
preferred stock shall not be more than 60% of the consolidated net tangible assets of CNG and its subsidiaries. Section
6.07 provides that a subsidiary of CNG cannot incur funded debt or issue preferred stock to a third party unless funded
debt and preferred stock of the subsidiary will not exceed 60% of the total capitalization of the subsidiary, and the
principal amount of funded debt and amount of preferred stock of all subsidiaries of CNG shall not exceed 15% of consolidated
net tangible assets.

CNG also requests authorization to extend the expiration date for the issuance and sale of the remaining $100 million
principal amount of Debentures under the April Order from June 30, 1995 to June 30, 1996.


The Columbia Gas System, Inc., et al. (70-8219)


The Columbia Gas System, Inc. (``Columbia''), 20 Montchanin Road, Wilmington, Delaware 19807, a registered holding
company; Columbia's public utility subsidiary companies, Columbia Gas of Pennsylvania, Inc., Columbia Gas of Ohio,
Inc. (``Ohio''), Columbia Gas of Maryland, Inc., Columbia Gas of Kentucky, Inc., and Commonwealth Gas Services,
Inc., each located at 200 Civic Center Drive, Columbus, Ohio 43215; and Columbia's nonutility subsidiary companies,
Columbia Gas System Service Corporation, Columbia LNG Corporation, Columbia Atlantic Trading Corporation, TriStar
Ventures Corporation, TriStar Capital Corporation, each located at 20 Montchanin Road, Wilmington, Delaware 19807;
Columbia Natural Resources, Inc., Columbia Coal Gasification Corporation, both located at 900 Pennsylvania Avenue,
Charleston, West Virginia 25302; Columbia Energy Services Corporation, 2581 Washington Road, Upper Saint Clair,
Pennsylvania 15241; Columbia Gulf Transmission Company, 1700 MacCorkle Avenue, S.E., Charleston, West Virginia
25314; Columbia Gas Development Corporation, 5847 San Felipe, Houston, Texas 77057; Commonwealth Propane, Inc.,
and Columbia Propane Corporation, located at 800 Moorefield Park Drive, Richmond, Virginia 23236 (collectively,
``Applicants''), have filed a post-effective amendment to their application-declaration under Sections 6(a),
7, 9(a), 10, 12(b), and 12(f) of the Act and Rules 43 and 45 thereunder.
By order dated September 29, 1993 (HCAR No. 25896) (``September Order''), the Commission authorized Applicants,
among other things, to engage in financing from September 30, 1993 through December 31, 1994 of up to $629.9 million.
At that time, the Commission authorized Ohio to engage in long-term financing of up to $73.1 million and short-term
financing of up to $162 million, and authorized Columbia to provide $398.7 million in short-term financing to its
subsidiaries.

Columbia now proposes to increase the amount of short-term financing for Ohio $40 million. These short-term borrowings
will have the same terms and conditions as those authorized by the September Order. Thus, Ohio proposes to borrow the
funds directly from Columbia and/or from certain other subsidiaries of Columbia through Columbia's intrasystem
money pool (``Money Pool''), and Columbia requests authority to loan to its subsidiaries an additional $40 million
for short-term borrowings.

The Money Pool provides a vehicle by which Columbia and its subsidiary companies loan their excess cash to their associate
companies. Funds would be advanced, repaid, and reborrowed as required through December 31, 1994, with all such advances
to be fully repaid by April 30, 1995. All short-term borrowings from Columbia and/or the Money Pool will be evidenced
by a promissory note (``Short-Term Note'' and ``Money Pool Note'', respectively). A default rate of 2% per annum above
the pre-default rate on unpaid principal or interest amounts will be assessed if any interest or principal payment
becomes past due.

The interest rate charged on all Short-Term Notes and Money Pool Notes, and the investment rate earned on moneys invested
in the Money Pool, will be the interest rate per annum equal to the composite weighted average effective rate on short-term
transactions of Columbia and/or the Money Pool short-term investment rate. During any month, this composite rate
may be based on one or any combination of: (1) The cost of Columbia's borrowings under its bank facility; (2) the interest
rate earned by Columbia on invested excess cash; and/or (3) the interest rate earned by subsidiaries on investments
of excess Money Pool funds.



The Southern Company (70-8421)



The Southern Company (``Southern''), 64 Perimeter Center East, Atlanta, Georgia 30346, a registered holding company,
has filed an application-declaration under Sections 6(a), 7, 9(a), 10 and 12(b) of the Act and Rules 45 and 50(a)(5)
thereunder.

Southern proposes to acquire the securities of one or more companies (``Project Parents'') engaged directly or indirectly,
and exclusively, in the business of owning and holding the securities of ``foreign utility companies'' (``FUCOs''),
as defined in Section 33(a) of the Act, and ``exempt wholesale generators'' (``EWGs''), as defined in Section 32(a)
of the Act. Southern requests that the authorization for its proposals remain effective until the earlier of: (i)
December 31, 1996; and (ii) the effective date of any rule of general applicability adopted by the Commission that
would exempt the acquisition of any securities of any Project Parent from the requirements of Sections 9(a) and 10
of the Act.

Southern states that a Project Parent may be organized at the time of, and in order to facilitate: the making of bids
or proposals to acquire an interest in any EWG or FUCO (``Exempt Subsidiaries''); after the award of a bid proposal,
in order to facilitate closing on the purchase or financing of any such Exempt Subsidiary; or at any time subsequent
to the consummation of an acquisition of an interest in an Exempt Subsidiary. A Project Parent would be formed after
the acquisition of an Exempt Subsidiary in order to: effect an adjustment in the respective ownership interests in
any Exempt Subsidiary held by Southern and unaffiliated co-investors; facilitate a partial sale of an interest in
any such Exempt Subsidiary; comply with applicable laws of foreign jurisdictions limiting or otherwise relating
to the ownership of domestic companies by foreign nationals; or, to limit Southern's exposure to U.S. and foreign
taxes as part of tax planning.

Southern requests authority to make direct or indirect investments in Project Parents in an aggregate amount at any
one time outstanding not to exceed $400 million. Any such direct or indirect investment by Southern in any Project
Parent would be consummated only if, at the time thereof, and giving effect thereto, Southern's ``aggregate investment,''
determined in accordance with Rule 53(a)(1)(i), in all FUCOs, EWGs and Project Parents would not exceed 50% of Southern's
``consolidated retained earnings,'' as defined in Rule 53(a)(1)(ii). In addition, any such investment in any particular
Project Parent would be limited to an amount no greater than the amount reasonably required in connection with making
the underlying investment in any Exempt Subsidiary (or Exempt Subsidiaries) with respect to which such Project Parent
was organized or formed, taking into account development expenditures, working capital needs, and cash reserves
required to be maintained in accordance with financing documents. Southern states that it will also comply with all
other applicable rules under the Act, including, without limitation, such rules as may be promulgated in the future
pursuant to Sections 32 and 33.
It is proposed that investments by Southern in any Project Parents may take the form of any combination of the following:
(i) Ppurchases of capital shares, partnership interests, trust certificates, or the equivalent of any of the foregoing
under the laws of foreign jurisdictions, if applicable; (ii) cash capital contributions or open account advances;
(iii) loans evidenced by promissory notes; and (iv) guaranties by Southern of the principal of or interest on any promissory
notes or other evidences of indebtedness of any Project Parent issued to lenders other than Southern.
Southern proposes that any investment in the capital shares or other equity securities of a Project Parent that have
a stated par value will be in an amount equal to or greater than such par value, and that any open account advance made
by Southern to a Project Parent be non-interest bearing and repayable within one year of the date of the advance. Southern
also proposes that any promissory note issued by a Project Parent to Southern, and any promissory note or similar evidence
of indebtedness with respect to which Southern may issue a guaranty, would mature not later than 30 years after the
date of insurance, and would bear interest at a rate: (a) Not greater than the prime rate at a bank to be designated by
Southern in the case of any promissory note issued to Southern, and (b) not greater than 3% over such prime rate in the
case of any note or similar evidence of indebtedness guarantied by Southern.
Any promissory note issued to Southern by any Project Parent may, at Southern's option, be converted to a capital contribution
to such Project Parent through Southern's forgiveness of the indebtedness evidenced thereby.
Funds for any direct or indirect investment by Southern in any Project Parent (including the guaranty of any securities
of any Project Parent) will be derived from: (i) The sale of common stock or the issuance of guarantees (within the limitations
of HCAR No. 25980 (January 25, 1994), or in any future authorization obtained from the Commission); (ii) bank borrowings
or commercial paper sales (within the limitations of HCAR No. 26004 (March 15, 1994), or any future authorization
obtained from the Commission); and, (iii) available cash. Southern is not requesting the authority to issue any additional
securities for the purpose of financing investments in any Project Parents.
Southern states that it is currently investigating potential opportunities to acquire or construct electric generation,
transmission or distribution facilities in Europe, Asia, Australia and South America. Southern believes that,
in almost all cases, such facilities will qualify as facilities that a FUCO may own or operate.
 Southern states that it has been Southern's experience, in connection with its foreign project development activities
to date, including the preparation and submission of bid proposals in foreign government privatization programs,
that the formation and acquisition of one or more Project Parents (usually, but not always, foreign corporations
or the equivalent thereof) is necessary or desirable to facilitate the acquisition and ownership of a FUCO. For example,
laws of some foreign countries may require that the bidder in a privatization program be a domestic company. In such
cases, it would be necessary for Southern to form a foreign subsidiary as the entity submitting the bid or other proposal.

Southern states that there would typically be other business reasons for creating Project Parents. Southern states
that, for example, the interposition of one or more wholly-owned Project Parents may be necessary to minimize U.S.
income taxes (e.g., by deferring repatriation of foreign source income, or in order to take full advantage of favorable
tax treaties among foreign countries). Further, Project Parents are useful in cases in which Southern may bid as a
part of a consortium of companies, since each member of the consortium will typically want to have at least one consolidated
subsidiary in the final FUCO ownership structure for tax and accounting purposes. Finally, Project Parents serve
to isolate business risks and facilitate subsequent adjustments to or sales of interests among or by the members of
the ownership group.
Southern proposes herein that a Project Parent may also acquire and hold direct or indirect interests in both FUCOs
and EWGs.
 The ability to combine ownership of both FUCOs and EWGs under a single company will enable Southern to minimize the
number of separate intermediate subsidiaries needed in connection with its investments in EWGs and FUCOs.






Southern states that, within 45 days after Southern determines that the purposes for owning any Project Parent no
longer exists, it shall liquidate or dissolve such Project Parent, unless, within that time, Southern determines
that such Project Parent may be used in conjunction with a proposal or plan to acquire an interest in a different Exempt
Subsidiary. Southern requests authority to liquidate or dissolve any Project Parent under such circumstances.

Southern also requests approval for any Project Parent to issue equity securities and debt securities to persons
other than Southern (and with respect to which there is no recourse to Southern), including banks, insurance companies,
and other financial institutions, exclusively for the purpose of financing (including any refinancing of) investments
in Exempt Subsidiaries. Such securities may be issued in one or more transactions from time to time through the earlier
to occur of (i) December 31, 1996, and (ii) the effective date of any rule of general applicability adopted by the Commission
exempting such transaction from the application requirements under the Act. It is proposed that the aggregate principal
amount of non-recourse debt securities issued by Project Parents to persons other than Southern will not exceed $800
million at any one time outstanding. No more than $200 million principal amount of such non-recourse debt securities
at any time outstanding may be denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars. In any case in which Southern directly
or indirectly owns less than all of the equity interests of a Project Parent, only that portion of the non-recourse
indebtedness of such Project Parent equal to Southern's equity ownership percentage shall be included for purposes
of the foregoing limitations.
Equity securities issued by any Project Parent to any party other than Southern may include capital shares, partnership
interests, trust certificiates, or the equivalent of any of the foregoing under applicable foreign law. Non-recourse
debt securities issued to parties other than Southern may include secured and unsecured promissory notes, subordinated
notes, bonds, or other evidence of indebtedness. Securities issued by Project Parents may be denominated in either
U.S. dollars or foreign currencies.
Southern states that the amount and type of such securities, and the terms thereof, including interest rate, maturity,
prepayment or redemption privileges, and the terms of any collateral security granted with respect thereto, would
be negotiated on a case by case basis, taking into account differences from project to project in optimum debt-equity
ratios, projections of earnings and cash flow, depreciation lives, and other similar financial and performance
characteristics of each project. Accordingly, Southern requests the authority to negotiate the terms and conditions
of such securities without further approval by the Commission.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Southern states that no equity security having a stated par value would be issued
or sold by a Project Parent for a consideration that is less than such par value. Southern also states that no note, bond
or other evidence of indebtedness issued or sold by any Project Parent will mature later than 30 years from the date
of issuance thereof, and will bear interest at a rate exceeding the following: (i) if such note, bond or other indebtedness
is U.S. dollar denominated, at a fixed rate not to exceed 6.5% over the yield to maturity on an actively traded, non-callable,
U.S. Treasury note having a maturity equal to the average life of such note, bond or other indebtedness (``Applicable
Treasury Rate''),
 or at a floating rate not to exceed 6.5% over the then applicable prime rate at a U.S. money center bank to be designated
by Southern (``Applicable Prime Rate''); and (ii) if such note, bond or other indebtedness is denominated in the currency
of a country other than the United States, at a fixed or floating rate which, when adjusted (i.e., reduced) for the prevailing
rate of inflation in such country, as reported in official indices published by such country, would be equivalent
to a rate on a U.S. dollar denominated borrowing of identical average life that does not exceed 10% over the Applicable
Treasury Rate or Applicable Prime Rate, as the case may be. 
 




In connection with the issuance of any non-recourse debt securities by any Project Parent, it is anticipated that
such Project Parent may grant security in its assets. Such security interest may take the form of a pledge of the shares
or other equity securities of an Exempt Subsidiary that it owns, including a security interest in any distributions
from any such Exempt Subsidiary, or a collateral assignment of its rights under and interests in other property, including
rights under contracts. It is also anticipated that fees in the form of placement or commitment fees, or other similar
fees, would be paid to lenders, placement agents, or others in connection with the issuance of any such non-recourse
debt securities. Southern requests authority for any Project Parent to agree in any case to pay placement or commitment
fees, and other similar fees, in connection with any borrowing, provided that the effective annual interest charge
on any indebtedness evidencing such borrowing is not greater than 115% of the stated interest rate thereon. 
 
In connection with investments in Exempt Subsidiaries, Southern states that it is typical that a portion of the capital
requirements of any such Exempt Subsidiary would be obtained through non-recourse financing involving borrowings
from banks and other financial institutions. Southern also states that, in some cases, however, it may be necessary
or desirable to structure an investment in an Exempt Subsidiary such that the obligations created are not those of
the Exempt Subsidiary, but instead those of its parent companies. For example, in a consortium of non-affiliated
companies bidding to purchase the securities or assets of an EWG or FUCO, each of the consortium members would be obligated
to fund its respective share of the proposed purchase price. If external sources of funds are needed for this purpose,
a participant in the consortium may choose to engage in non-recourse financing through one or more single-purpose
subsidiaries that would then utilize the proceeds of the financing to acquire an ownership interest in the Exempt
Subsidiary.

Life-Cycle Cost Analysis


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), DOT.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Interim policy statement; request for comments.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This FHWA policy statement on life-cycle cost analysis (LCCA) helps fulfill Federal management responsibilities
for analyzing life-cycle cost aspects of infrastructure investment decisions under Executive Order 12893, ``Principles
of Federal Infrastructure Investment.'' The policy statement establishes LCCA principles to be applied by FHWA
in infrastructure investment analyses, and in evaluating the adequacy of State highway agency procedures used in
conducting required LCCA for investments funded through the Federal-aid highway program. States and local agencies
are expected to apply these principles in evaluating program and project level investment decisions involving Federal-aid
highway funds as required under applicable FHWA regulations. Comments are solicited on potential problems in implementing
provisions of this policy statement and specific needs for training and technical assistance in LCCA.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:


Background


There is an increasing recognition that total life-cycle costs of highway and transportation investments must be
given greater consideration in all phases of highway programs. Executive Order 12893, ``Principles of Federal Infrastructure
Investment,'' requires that benefits and costs of infrastructure investment be measured and appropriately discounted
over the full life cycle of each project. Sections 1024 and 1025 of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency
Act of 1991 (ISTEA) (Pub. L. 102-240, 105 Stat. 1914, 1977) also require consideration of ``the use of life-cycle
cost in the design and engineering of bridges, tunnels, or pavement.'' Subpart B of the interim final rule on implementation
of ISTEA management systems (23 CFR 500.207) requires use of LCCA for pavement management systems (PMS) and Subpart
C (23 CFR 500.307) requires use of LCCA or comparable techniques for bridge management systems (BMS).
Life-cycle cost analysis is an economic evaluation of all current and future costs associated with investment alternatives.
It is a valuable economic analysis technique for evaluating highway and other transportation programs and projects
that require long-term capital and maintenance expenditures over the extended lives of facilities. Future costs
are discounted using an appropriate discount rate to compare costs incurred at different points in time.
Life-cycle cost analysis principles and techniques are used in many types of economic analysis to compare benefits
and costs arising at different points in time. Benefit-cost analysis and cost effectiveness analysis, for instance,
use life-cycle cost analysis principles to discount future benefits and costs of investment alternatives over the
lives of alternatives being evaluated.
Life-cycle cost analysis is used to evaluate programs of pavement and bridge improvements as well as individual projects.
It is an important input to estimates of future funding requirements and to the development of improvement programs,
especially when there are budget constraints.
The use of value engineering is receiving increased attention as a technique for analyzing the functions of a program,
project, system, product, or service to identify opportunities to significantly lower costs while still achieving
the essential functions. Life-cycle costs are often analyzed to ensure that unnecessary costs are avoided by considering
future operations, maintenance, and reconstruction requirements.

Total life-cycle costs of specific facilities may be many times the initial construction costs when user costs are
considered. It is essential that a long term perspective be taken in programming improvements, selecting among alternative
maintenance, rehabilitation, and reconstruction strategies, and designing pavements, structures, and other
highway elements. Longer design lives may have to be considered, and traditional strategies for programming maintenance
and rehabilitation activities may have to be reevaluated to determine whether they adequately consider future costs,
including user delay-related costs. 
Increasing congestion on important highways in urban areas and some rural areas makes it critical to fully consider
life-cycle costs of investment decisions. Safety concerns and auxiliary construction costs to maintain, rehabilitate,
or reconstruct congested highways and bridges under traffic are very high. User costs and delays around work zones
in congested areas may be even higher and represent significant inefficiencies that may adversely affect economic
productivity, especially on the National Highway System (NHS). These delays can erode productivity gains realized
by the growing number of industries using just-in-time and other advanced logistics strategies that depend on efficient
and predictable transportation. 

Regardless of whether user costs are included in a formal LCCA, most States already implicitly consider user costs
when they choose to pay premiums to maintain traffic through work zones or design more durable pavements in congested
urban areas. Including user costs in LCCA makes these implicit considerations explicit, and may help identify other
opportunities to reduce overall agency and user costs. 

Recognition of the high future costs to maintain and rehabilitate highways, bridges and tunnels, and their associated
traffic control, safety, environmental, and hydraulic components has led to increased interest in the potential
for LCCA to improve investment productivity and reduce public and private costs of highway and other transportation
programs. The FHWA and the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) jointly
sponsored a symposium in December 1993 to learn more about LCCA practices among the States and to identify research,
training, technical assistance, and policy-related needs to improve LCCA application. An important input to that
symposium was an AASHTO survey of State LCCA practices. 

Many specific LCCA issues and research needs were identified at the symposium. Key technical issues included how
to establish the appropriate analysis period, how to value and properly consider user costs, and how to choose the
appropriate discount rate. Participants also identified important research and data needed to predict pavement
and bridge performance and forecast future traffic. 

An important policy issue raised at the symposium was the recognition that results of LCCA may favor selection of improvements
with higher initial costs in order to achieve significant long term savings in overall investment requirements.
It may indicate, for instance, that more projects warrant reconstruction rather than rehabilitation strategies,
that early intervention with preventive maintenance is cost effective, or that somewhat higher designs or levels
of service may be appropriate for some facilities. The FHWA recognizes that LCCA, thus, may result in proposals for
greater expenditures up front. At the same time virtually all transportation agencies will continue to face budgetary
limitations at least over the short term. Life-cycle cost analysis will help agencies identify and explain the real
costs borne by transportation users of inadequate infrastructure funding. Furthermore, LCCA can assist agencies
that face fiscal constraints in making the best use of available funds. Several States already use LCCA in developing
network improvement programs as part of their pavement and bridge management systems. Eventually it is desirable
for all States to have such capabilities.

The following paragraphs highlight key principles of good LCCA practice. Applying these principles generally will
allow States and local agencies to identify investment alternatives that will minimize total life-cycle costs.
While their use is not mandatory in all instances, States are strongly encouraged to apply these principles in conducting
life-cycle cost analyses unless there are unique characteristics of particular programs or projects that require
principles to be modified. Life-cycle cost analysis, of course, is only one consideration in many investment decisions,
but it certainly is one of the most important for NHS routes and other high volume roads in light of the costs and lost
productivity associated with future maintenance and rehabilitation actions. 

In general there are no hard and fast rules concerning the appropriate length of the analysis period. The analysis
period will vary depending on the type of improvement (bridge, versus tunnel, versus pavement), the location (urban
versus rural), the highway system (NHS versus other), and the design lives of all appropriate alternatives. In general,
longer design lives should be considered for improvements on the NHS and other high volume urban roadways because
future agency and user costs associated with maintenance and rehabilitation activities may be so high. For pavement
improvements on the NHS, design lives of 50 years may be reasonable while bridge and tunnel improvements may have design
lives of 100 or more years. The consideration of longer design lives will require longer analysis periods in LCCA.
Analysis periods for projects involving other modes generally should be long enough to cover the full life-expectancy
of the investment_the time until facilities would have to be reconstructed if initially constructed to an optimum
design. These lives would vary according to the modal alternative being examined. Analysis periods for all project
alternatives should be the same length. 

The inclusion of user costs in LCCA is particularly controversial among some States. Part of the controversy over
user costs is the fact that they often are many times higher than agency costs and can critically influence decisions.
While all motorists do not value costs of delays as highly as do commercial travelers, the costs and lost productivity
to businesses of delays around work zones are simply too high to ignore. In fact, such delays arguably have a greater
impact on business than delays associated with inadequate capacity because businesses factor normal congestion
costs into their plans, but delays around work zones generally cannot be foreseen and thus are more disruptive. Technical
advisories to be developed on estimating user operating and delay costs will address this issue in greater detail.


In addition to increased delay and vehicle operating costs, rehabilitation and maintenance activities may result
in increased accident costs around work zones. Technical advisories will be developed to assist in estimating increases
in accident rates associated with different types of rehabilitation and maintenance activities. The most comprehensive
information on the costs of motor vehicle accidents is contained in the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's
publication, ``The Economic Cost of Motor Vehicle Crashes, 1990.'' A copy of this document is available in the public
docket for this notice. 

The proper use of the discount rate has been an issue for LCCA, cost-benefit analysis and other types of economic analysis
as well. Among the issues are the relationship between the discount rate and inflation, factors that affect the choice
of rates, and how to establish rates over a long analysis period. Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-94,
``Guidelines and Discount Rate for Benefit-Cost Analysis of Federal Programs,'' provides guidance on selecting
appropriate discount rates for economic analyses. Since the choice of discount rate can affect relative life-cycle
costs, sensitivity analysis may be appropriate if two or more alternatives are close in cost, if streams of costs and
benefits among alternatives vary significantly over time, or if the discount rate is outside the range of discount
rates recommended by OMB. 

The FHWA will develop training and technical assistance materials to address issues in LCCA. These materials should
supplement guidance on economic analysis techniques contained in AASHTO's 1977 publication, ``A Manual on User
Benefit Analysis of Highway and Bus-Transit Improvements,''

1

 the ``Red Book,'' in the forthcoming update to that publication which was developed under National Cooperative Highway
Research Program Project 7-12, and in other guidance on LCCA issues. While additional materials are being developed,
this interim policy statement provides guidance on LCCA principles applicable to highway and structure design.

The FHWA is reviewing its policy on alternative bridge designs (53 FR 21637, June 9, 1988) for consistency with this
interim life-cycle cost analysis policy as well as with Executive Order 12893. 



Policy 



The following is FHWA's LCCA policy for infrastructure investment analyses. It represents good practice that should
be followed by States and local transportation agencies in making program and project investment decisions: 

1. Life-cycle costs are an important consideration in all highway investment decisions. 

2. The level of detail in LCCA should be commensurate with the level of investment involved and the types of alternatives
being analyzed. Investments on the NHS generally warrant more detailed analysis than investments on non-NHS routes.
Similarly, evaluation of decisions whether to reconstruct or rehabilitate a facility warrants more detailed analysis
than consideration of alternative maintenance strategies. 

3. Typical life-cycle cost analysis profiles may be developed and used as the basis for evaluating alternatives for
general types of improvements, such as, consideration of alternative pavement designs or different types of bridges
on various functional class highways. Major programs and projects, however, often will require consideration of
a broad range of alternative rehabilitation and reconstruction options and more detailed analysis of potential
alternatives. The potential applicability and use of LCCA profiles will be discussed in greater detail in future
technical advisories. 

4. Other factors, including budgetary, environmental, and safety considerations, legitimately influence highway
investment decisions and should be considered along with the results of LCCA in evaluating investment alternatives.
Life-cycle cost analysis principles should be used in conjunction with other appropriate economic analysis techniques
in pavement and bridge management systems. Systemwide or network objectives as well as project level concerns should
be considered in decisionmaking, and both levels of analysis should consider life-cycle costs. 

5. Analysis periods should be for the life of the facility or system of facilities being evaluated and should account
for costs of foreseeable future actions. Analysis periods should not be less than 75 years for major bridge, tunnel,
or hydraulic system investments, and not less than 35 years for pavement investments. Longer design lives may be appropriate
for the NHS or other major routes or corridors. 

6. All appropriate agency costs anticipated during the analysis period should be considered in the analysis, including
traffic control costs during maintenance and rehabilitation, costs of special construction procedures required
to maintain traffic, and agency operating costs for such things as tunnel lighting and ventilation. In those cases
where the agency required to operate a facility is not the one making the investment decision, it is important for the
funding agency to include operating costs borne by other organizations responsible for operating the facilities.


7. User costs including increased vehicle operating costs, accident costs, and delay-related costs incurred throughout
the analysis period should be considered in LCCA. Increased costs due to deteriorated riding surfaces, circuitous
routings, and accidents and delays around and through maintenance and construction work zones are all important.


8. Future agency and user costs should be discounted to net present value or converted to equivalent uniform annual
costs using appropriate discount rates. Discount rates selected should be consistent with guidance provided in
OMB Circular A-94. 

Technical advisories on these and other technical issues in the application of LCCA will be issued by FHWA in the future.

National Competitive Research Initiative Grants Program (Competitive Research Grants Program) Fiscal Year 1994:
Supplementary Solicitation for Applications; Solar Ultraviolet Radiation Monitoring 



Applications are invited for competitive grant awards in agricultural, forest, and related environmental sciences
under the National Competitive Research Initiative Grants Program (NCRIGP) administered by the Office of Grants
and Program Systems, Cooperative State Research Service (CSRS), for fiscal year 1994. This solicitation is supplementary
to those previously released in the 

Federal Register 

on September 7, 1993 (58 FR 47184) and on October 8, 1993 (58 FR 52570). 



Authority 



The authority for this program is contained in section 2(b) of the Act of August 4, 1965, as amended (7 U.S.C. 450i(b)).
Under this program, subject to the availability of funds, the Secretary may award competitive research grants, for
periods not to exceed five years, for the support of research projects to further the programs of the Department of
Agriculture (USDA). Proposals may be submitted by any State agricultural experiment station, college, university,
other research institution or organization, Federal agency, private organization, corporation, or individual.
Proposals from scientists at non-United States organizations will not be considered for support. 

Pursuant to Section 719 of Public Law No. 103-111, (the Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration,
and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1994), funds available in Fiscal Year 1994 to pay indirect costs on research
grants awarded competitively by CSRS may not exceed 14 per centum of the total Federal funds provided under each award.


In addition, pursuant to Section 727 (b) of Public Law No. 103-111, in case any equipment or products may be authorized
to be purchased with funds provided under this program, entities receiving such funds are encouraged to use such funds
to purchase only American-made equipment or products. 



Applicable Regulations and Statutory Guidance 



Regulations applicable to this program include, but are not limited to, the following: (a) the regulations governing
the NCRIGP, 7 CFR Part 3200, which set forth procedures to be followed when submitting grant proposals, rules governing
the evaluation of proposals and the awarding of grants, and regulations relating to the post-award administration
of grant projects; (b) the USDA Uniform Federal Assistance Regulations, 7 CFR Part 3015; (c) the USDA Uniform Administrative
Requirements for Grants and Cooperative Agreements to State and Local Governments, 7 CFR Part 3016; (d) Section 1402
of the National Agricultural Research, Extension, and Teaching Policy Act of 1977, as amended (7 U.S.C. 3101), which
sets forth purposes that research supported by the NCRIGP should address; and (e) Section 1404 of the National Agricultural
Research, Extension, and Teaching Policy Act of 1977, as amended (7 U.S.C. 3103), which defines ``sustainable agriculture.''


RESEARCH PROGRAM TO BE SUPPORTED (Supplementary to those published in the September 7, 1993 

Federal Register

 (58 FR 47184) and in the October 8, 1993 

Federal Register

 (58 FR 52570)): 

CSRS is soliciting proposals, subject to the availability of funds, for support of high priority research of importance
to agriculture, forestry, and related environmental sciences, in the following Research Program: 



Solar Ultraviolet Radiation Monitoring

<TEXT>
 

The total amount available in fiscal year 1994 for grant awards in the research program area of Solar Ultraviolet Radiation
Monitoring is approximately $800,000.

The National Research Initiative Competitive Grants Program, in addition to providing support for research on biological
response to predicted effects of stratospheric ozone depletion, invited applications in 1991 for development of
instrumentation for a solar ultraviolet radiation monitoring network. Based on the results now available from that
earlier activity, the Department desires to support continued development of high quality spectroradiometers
for measurements of ultraviolet-B radiation and utilization of the spectroradiometers in research to accurately
determine ultraviolet-B radiation at ground level. Such information will more accurately document levels of UV
radiation reaching the Earth's surface. Such knowledge is needed in order to develop an understanding of the response
of living systems to current conditions, to forecast future effects, and to develop response strategies for mitigating
effects resulting from any future increases in UV radiation. The following specific program area and guidelines
are provided as a base from which proposals may be developed. 

Proposals developed for the Solar Ultraviolet Radiation Monitoring program should include field instrumentation
for high quality spectral irradiance measurements and a research plan for data collection, analysis, and use. Emphasis
should be placed on the following instrumentation specifications and operating protocols:



General: 

The instrument should measure the global horizontal terrestrial solar UV-B spectral irradiance over the spectral
wavelength region from 280-400 nm. Overall network radiometric uncertainty should be no more than 10% (3 sigma)
at 295 nm decreasing to less than 5% (3 sigma) at 340 nm. These and following specifications are applicable over the
ambient range of temperature, humidity, and pressure found in northern temperate latitudes.

Wavelength range: 

280-400 nm.


Dynamic range: 

Spectral irradiance measurements are to be made over a maximum solar signal of 1.0 W/m

2

 nm at 400 nm decreasing to less than 10

^6

#

0.02 nm;
b. Repeatability: 

#

0.02 nm;
c. Accuracy: 

#

0.02 nm;
d. Bandpass: <=0.3 nm;
e. Straylight: < 10

 nm.
Finally, instrument calibration and characterization with regard to the criteria specified herein, and standardization
among the several instruments, is considered critical. The research plan should give consideration to data collection,
storage, retrieval, processing, and statistical analysis. It is expected that these data will be handled in a manner
appropriate for use by the U.S. and international scientific communities; for support of atmospheric science research;
model development and validation; and documentation of UV-B climatology.
In accordance with Section 2(b)(7) of the Act of August 4, 1965, as amended (7 U.S.C. 450i(b)), funds will not be awarded
for the planning, repair, rehabilitation or acquisition, or construction of a building or facility or purchase or
installation of fixed equipment.
Proposals are invited from investigator(s) at a single or multiple institutions with the proper competence and facilities
to accomplish the objectives.
Investigators are encouraged to contact the Program Director at 202-401-4871 prior to developing a proposal
for this program.

NOFA for the Rental Voucher Program and Rental Certificate Program 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Office of the Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing, HUD. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of fund availability for FY 1994 and procedures for allocating funds and approving housing agency applications.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The purpose of the Rental Voucher and the Rental Certificate Programs is to assist eligible families to pay the rent
for decent, safe, and sanitary housing. This notice states the fund allocation available for award of ``fair share''
rental vouchers and rental certificates. The notice identifies the amount of housing assistance budget authority
available for each allocation area and HUD State or Area Office jurisdiction during Fiscal Year 1994. 


This notice also: 
(1) Invites Public Housing Agencies (PHAs) and Indian Housing Authorities (IHAs), herein referred to as housing
agencies (HAs), to submit applications for housing assistance funds; 
(2) Provides instructions to HAs governing the submission of applications; and 
(3) Describes procedures for rating, ranking, and approving HA applications. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Paperwork Reduction Act Statement 


The information collection requirements contained in this notice have been approved by the Office of Management
and Budget (OMB), under section 3504(h) of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501-3520), and have
been assigned OMB control number 2577-0169. 


I. Purpose and Substantive Description 


A. Authority 


The regulations governing the Rental Certificate and the Rental Voucher Programs are published at 24 CFR parts 882
and 887, respectively. The regulations for allocating housing assistance budget authority under section 213(d)
of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 are published at 24 CFR part 791, subpart D. 


B. Allocation Amounts 


(1) Housing Needs Formula 


In this fiscal year, approximately $975 million of budget authority for the rental voucher and certificate programs
is available for fair share formula allocation. (This amount may be reduced by up to $100 million (or some other amount)
to increase the level of funding for litigation or desegregation.) This funding will support additional units for
HA rental voucher and rental certificate programs. Of this amount, approximately $624 million is for rental vouchers
and approximately $351 million is for rental certificates. This budget authority is being allocated to HUD State
or Area Office and allocation areas under this NOFA, using the housing needs factors established in accordance with
24 CFR 791.402. For purposes of this NOFA, the Department is using the metropolitan area designations that were in
effect prior to December 31, 1992, since detailed census data tabulations for the new metropolitan area designations
are not available, yet. In addition, $51.3 million is retained in a Headquarters Reserve which will not be allocated
by formula. 


(2) Metropolitan/Non-Metropolitan Mix 


Separate housing needs factors were developed for the metropolitan and non-metropolitan allocation areas within
each HUD State or Area Office jurisdiction. On a nationwide basis, approximately 90 percent of the Fiscal Year 1994
``fair share'' budget authority for the Rental Voucher Program and Rental Certificate Program is designated for
metropolitan areas. The metropolitan housing needs factors were applied to the housing assistance budget authority
available for use in metropolitan areas and the non-metropolitan housing needs factors were applied to the housing
assistance budget authority available for use in non-metropolitan areas.

The allocation areas were established by the HUD field offices to ensure sufficient competition among HAs (including
State and regional or multi-county HAs) operating housing programs within the HUD-established allocation areas.


(3) Program Type 


This notice announces the fair share allocation of housing assistance budget authority (See Attachment 1) for the
Rental Voucher Program and for the Rental Certificate Program to each HUD State or Area Office for designated allocation
areas, based on the housing needs factors. The allocation of housing assistance budget authority to each allocation
area, however, is the total for both programs. The allocations have been structured to give HUD State or Area Offices
flexibility in approving HA applications for the rental voucher program or the rental certificate program. It is
not necessary that each allocation area within a HUD State or Area Office jurisdiction be provided both rental vouchers
and rental certificates. This notice also provides, for each allocation area, an estimate of the total number of rental
vouchers and rental certificates that could be funded from the housing assistance available in the allocation area.
These estimates are based on the average fair market rents for two-bedroom units in the HUD State or Area Office's jurisdiction.
The actual number of units assisted will vary from these estimates in the actual bedroom size mix that is funded in a
given area. 


(4) Potential Additional Funding 


If additional rental voucher or rental certificate funding becomes available for incremental use during Fiscal
Year 1994, the Department plans to distribute any additional funding to HUD State or Area Offices using the same percentage
distribution as reflected in Attachment 1 to this NOFA. Any additional funding will be used under the competitive
requirements of this NOFA to fund HA applications which were approvable but not funded, or approved and funded at less
than 100 percent of the requested amount. 


C. Family Self-Sufficiency Program 


Unless specifically exempted by HUD, any rental voucher or rental certificate funding reserved in FY 94 (except funding
for renewals or amendments) will be used to establish the minimum size of a PHA's FSS program. 


D. HA Eligibility 


All HAs are invited by this notice to submit applications for the incremental funding for the Rental Voucher Program
(24 CFR part 887) and the Rental Certificate Program (24 CFR part 882). 


II. Application Process 


A. Application Requirements 


All the items in Section III of this NOFA must be included in the application submitted to the HUD State or Area Office/Native
American Programs Office. The application may include an explanation of how the application meets, or will meet,
the selection criteria listed in this NOFA. The maximum point total available under the selection criteria in this
NOFA is 95. 


B. Selection Criteria/Rating Factors 


(1) Selection Criterion 1 


HA Administrative Capability (40 points). 


(a) Description:

 Overall HA administrative capability in the Rental Voucher, Rental Certificate, and Moderate Rehabilitation Programs
is either excellent or good. Administrative Capability is evidenced by factors such as leasing rates and correct
administration of housing quality standards (HQS), compliance with the portability requirements for rental vouchers
and rental certificates, compliance with Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity program requirements, assistance
payment computation, timely submission of budgets and financial statements, and rent reasonableness requirements.
For purposes of this NOFA, an HA administering a Rental Voucher, Rental Certificate, or Moderate Rehabilitation
Program will not be rated on the administration of its Public or Indian Housing Program. If an HA is not administering
a Rental Voucher, Rental Certificate, or Moderate Rehabilitation Program, HUD will rate HA administration of the
Public or Indian Housing Program. If an HA is not administering a Rental Voucher, Rental Certificate, Moderate Rehabilitation,
Public Housing or Indian Housing Program, HUD will assess the administrative capability of the HA based on such factors
as experience of staff, support of the HA by the local government, and the HA's administrative experience with non-HUD
housing programs. 


(b) Rating and Assessment: 
(i) HUD review of HA Operations: 
 8 Points_Assign 8 points if HA has no review findings outstanding, or all review findings have been corrected,
for HUD HA management reviews, Fair Housing & Equal Opportunity reviews, or Inspector General audits as of the
deadline date for submission of applications under this NOFA. 
 5 Points_Assign 5 points if HA has less than five review findings outstanding and all findings are being addressed.

 2 Points_Assign 2 points if HA has five or more review findings outstanding and all findings are being addressed.

 0 Points_Assign 0 points if HA has any review findings outstanding and the findings are not being addressed.

actions taken by the HA to improve the number of units that pass 
HQS inspections to 80% or more. 

 0 Points_Assign 0 points if HA had 80% or less of its units 
pass HQS inspections by HUD at the last review and HUD is not 
aware of actions taken by the HA to improve the number of units 
that pass HQS inspections to 80% or more. 

(iv) Percentage of Units Leased as of September 30, 1993. HUD staff 
should use the percentage of units under ACC for a period of one year 
for the tenant-based rental assistance programs administered by an HA. 
HUD may use a report on leasing for another period if the September 30, 
1993, report is not reflective of HA performance. 

 8 Points_Assign 8 points if HA had 98% or more of its rental 
certificates and rental vouchers under lease. 

 6 Points_Assign 6 points if HA had 96% or more of its rental 
certificates and rental vouchers under lease. 

 4 Points_Assign 4 points if HA had 94% or more of its rental

 8 Points_Assign 8 points if the HA submitted both its most 
recent fiscal year Section 8 budget at least 30 days prior to the 
start of the HA fiscal year and its year-end Section 8 annual 
financial statements within the required 45 days of the end of the 
HA's fiscal year. 

 4 Points_Assign 4 points if the HA submitted either its most 
recent fiscal year budget at least 30 days prior to the start of 
the HA's fiscal year or its year-end Section 8 annual financial 
statements within the required 45 days of the end of the HA fiscal 
year. 

 0 Points_Assign 0 points if the HA is unable to document the 
timely submission of the budget and financial statements. 

(2) Selection Criterion 2: Underfunding of Housing Needs (45 points). 

(a) Description: 

The degree to which the housing needs of the primary area specified in the HA's application from which the HA draws families
to assist (primary area) have previously been underfunded, relative to the needs of other localities within the same
allocation area, taking into account such factors as the number of assisted housing units and the number of very low-income
renter households with housing problems, eligible for such assistance. The HUD State or Area Office/Native American
Programs Office will, wherever practicable, consider needs being met by all Federally assisted rental housing programs,
including the FmHA Section 515 Rural Rental Housing program, but will, as a minimum, consider assistance provided
under the Rental Voucher Program, the Rental Certificate Program, other Section 8 Programs, and the Public or Indian
Housing Program. 

In accordance with Notice PIH 91-45 (HUD), the HUD State or Area Office/Native American Programs Office will
notify FmHA of applications it receives and ask that FmHA provide advisory comments concerning the market for additional
assisted housing or the possible impact the proposed units may have on FmHA projects. Applications for which FmHA
has provided comments expressing concerns about market need or the continued stability of existing FmHA projects,
with which HUD agrees, will receive zero points for this criterion. 



(b) Rating and Assessment: 

To receive points under this criterion, an application must propose funding in an area which has been previously 
underfunded or proportionately funded relative to the need for housing in the 
same allocation area. 

The assignment of points is based on the degree to which the needs in 
the primary area specified in the application have been underfunded, taking 
into account the number of assisted housing units and the number of very low-income renter households with housing
problems. The determination of point 
values will be based on a comparison of the percentage of housing need served 
in the primary area specified in the application to the percentage of need 
served in the allocation area since the 1990 census. The percentages for the 
allocation areas and the primary areas are to be rounded to the nearest whole 
number.

<TEXT>
 

The HUD State or Area Office/Native American Programs Office will 
evaluate whether housing need in the primary area specified in the application 
has been underfunded and will assign one of the three point-values, as 
follows: 

 45 Points. Housing need in the primary area specified in the 
application has been severely underfunded. A primary area with a 
percentage of need served that is equal to or less than one-third the 
allocation area's percentage will be determined to be severely 
underfunded. 

 30 Points. Housing need in the primary area specified in the 
application has been moderately underfunded. An application with a 
percentage of need served that is greater than one-third the allocation 
area's percentage but equal to or less than two-thirds of the allocation 
area percentage will be determined to be moderately underfunded. 

 15 Points. Housing need in the primary area specified in the 
application has been proportionately funded. An application with a 
percentage of need served that is greater than two-thirds the allocation 
area's percentage but equal to or less than the allocation area 
percentage will be determined to be proportionately funded. 

 0 Points. Housing need in the primary area specified in the 
application has been overfunded. A primary area with a percentage of 
need served that is greater than the allocation area percentage will be 
determined to have been overfunded. 

(3) Selection Criterion 3: Local Initiatives (5 points). 



(a) Description. 

The application must describe the extent to which HAs demonstrate locally initiated efforts in support of their Rental
Voucher and Rental Certificate Programs or comparable tenant-based rental assistance 
programs. Evaluation of a locality's contribution is measured competitively by the extent to which a locality is
able to provide services or cash contributions or demonstrate its intention to provide this kind of support in the
future, as compared to services or contributions provided by other localities of like program size.



(b) Rating and Assessment.

 The HUD State or Area Office/Native 
American Programs Office will assign one of two point-values, as follows: 

 5 points: The State or locality provides significant local support 
(e.g., financial, manpower for inspection services) to its Rental Voucher or 
Rental Certificate Program. 

 2 points: The State or locality provides minimal local support to 
its Rental Voucher or Rental Certificate Program. 

 0 points: The State or locality does not provide support to the HA's 
Rental Voucher or Rental Certificate Program. 

(4) Selection Criterion 4: Efforts of HAs to Establish a Family Self-Sufficiency Program (10 points Deduction).




(a) Description: 

The application must describe the efforts undertaken by the PHA to establish a Section 8 Family Self-Sufficiency
(FSS) program including (1) submission to HUD of an Action Plan, and (2) creation of a Program Coordinating Committee.
If a PHA is not administering a Rental 
Voucher or Rental Certificate Program, the HUD State or Area Office will rate 
HA administration of the Public Housing FSS program, if applicable. All 
activities rated under this criterion must have been completed prior to the 
submission of an application under this NOFA. The score of the PHA 
application must be reduced if the PHA received an FSS Incentive award of 
Section 8 funding in FY 1992 and the PHA has failed to complete the required 
implementation steps as described below. Also, the score of a PHA application 
must be reduced if the PHA received funding in FY 1993 (unless the HUD State 
or Area Office granted a total exception to the FSS program requirement) and 
the PHA has failed to complete the required implementation steps as described 
below. 



(b) Rating and Assessment: 

The HUD State or Area Office must deduct 
point values as shown below: 

 10 point Deduction_Deduct 10 points if (1) the HA has failed to 
establish a Program Coordinating Committee and provide the names, duties 
and experience of all members (24 CFR 984.202(a) & (b)) to HUD, and (2) 
the HA has failed to submit an Action Plan to HUD within 90 days of 
notification by HUD of approval of the PHA's application for units under 
the FY 91/92 FSS incentive award competition or HUD approval of the HA's 
first application, commencing in FY 93, for rental certificates or 
rental vouchers (24 CFR 984.201(c)(1)). 

 5 point Deduction_Deduct 5 points if (1) the HA has failed to 
establish a Program Coordinating Committee and provide the names, duties 
and experience of all members or (2) the HA has failed to submit an 
Action Plan in accordance with 24 CFR 984.201(c)(1). 

(5) Selection Criterion 5: Efforts of HA to Provide Area-Wide Housing 
Opportunities for Families (5 points). 



(a) Description: 

Many HAs have undertaken voluntary efforts to provide area-wide housing opportunities for families. HAs in metropolitan
and non-metropolitan areas are eligible for points under this criterion. These HAs 
have established cooperative agreements with other HAs or created a consortium 
of HAs in order to facilitate the transfer of families and their rental 
assistance between HAs. In addition, HAs have established relationships with 
non-profit groups to provide families with additional counseling to increase 
the likelihood of a successful move by the families to low-poverty areas.



(b) Rating and Assessment: 

The HUD State or Area Office/Native 
American Programs Office will assign point values as shown below: 

 5 points_Assign 5 points if the HA documents that it has taken 
steps to increase area-wide housing opportunities for families such as 
being a member of an established consortium of HAs including at least 50 
percent of the HAs in its housing market, providing extra counseling to 
families, establishing a relationship with other groups including non-profit agencies, or participating in other
activities that facilitate 
area-wide housing opportunities for families. 

 0 Points_Assign 0 points if the HA is unable to document area-wide 
efforts as shown in this criterion.

C. Unacceptable Applications



(1) After the 14-calendar day technical deficiency correction period 
(refer to Section IV, Corrections to Deficient Applications, of this NOFA), 
the HUD State or Area Office/Native American Programs Office will disapprove 
HA applications that it determines are not acceptable for processing (refer to 
Section III(F), Checklist of Technical Requirements, of this NOFA). The HUD 
State or Area Office/Native American Programs Office notification of rejection 
letter must state the basis for the decision. 

(2) Applications that fall into any of the following categories will 
not be processed: 

(a) The Department of Justice has brought a civil rights suit against 
the applicant HA, and the suit is pending. 

(b) There has been an adjudication of a civil rights violation in a 
civil action brought against the HA by a private individual, unless the HA is 
operating in compliance with a court order, or implementing a HUD approved 
resident selection and assignment plan or compliance agreement designed to 
correct the areas of noncompliance. 

(c) There are outstanding findings of noncompliance with civil rights 
statutes, Executive Orders, or regulations, as a result of formal 
administrative proceedings, or the Secretary has issued a charge against the 
applicant under the Fair Housing Act, unless the applicant is operating under 
a conciliation or compliance agreement designed to correct the areas of non- 
compliance. 

(d) HUD has denied application processing under Title VI of the Civil 
Rights Act of 1964, the Attorney General's Guidelines (28 CFR 50.3), and the 
HUD Title VI regulations (24 CFR 1.8) and procedures (HUD Handbook 8040.1), or 
under section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and HUD regulations (24 
CFR 8.57). 

(e) The HA has serious unaddressed, outstanding Inspector General audit 
findings, fair housing and equal opportunity monitoring review findings, or 
HUD State or Area Office/Native American Programs Office management review 
findings for one or more of its Rental Voucher, Rental Certificate, or 
Moderate Rehabilitation Programs, or, in the case of an HA that is not 
currently administering a Rental Voucher, Rental Certificate, or Moderate 
Rehabilitation Program, for its Public Housing Program or Indian Housing 
Program. 

(f) The leasing rate for rental vouchers and rental certificates under 
ACC for at least one year is less than 85 percent, or, in the case of an HA 
not currently administering a Rental Voucher or Rental Certificate Program, 
the leasing rate for all units available for occupancy in the Public or Indian 
Housing Program is less than 85 percent. (For a State or regional HA, the HUD 
State or Area Office/Native American Programs Office shall determine the HA's 
combined leasing rate for metropolitan and non-metropolitan areas, and shall 
use the combined rate in determining whether to accept the application under 
this paragraph.) 

(g) The HA is involved in litigation and HUD determines that the 
litigation may seriously impede the ability of the HA to administer an 
additional increment of rental vouchers or rental certificates. 



D. Local Government Comments



Section 213 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 
requires that HUD independently determine that there is a need for the housing 
assistance requested in applications, and solicit and consider comments 
relevant to this determination from the chief executive officer of the unit of 
general local government. The HUD State or Area Office/Native American 
Programs Office will obtain Section 213 comments from the unit of general 
local government in accordance with 24 CFR part 791, subpart C, Applications 
for Housing Assistance in Areas Without Housing Assistance Plans. Comments 
submitted by the unit of general local government must be considered before an 
application can be approved. 

For purposes of expediting the application process, the HA should 
encourage the chief executive officer of the unit of general local government 
to submit a letter with the HA application commenting on the HA application in 
accordance with Section 213. Since HUD cannot approve an application until 
the 30-day comment period is closed, the Section 213 letter should not only 
comment on the application, but also state that HUD may consider the letter to 
be the final comments and that no additional comments will be forthcoming from 
the local unit of government. 



E. Funding Applications



(1) 

Maximum Funding Allowed. 

The HUD State or Area Office/Native 
American Programs Office may not approve funding for an HA under this NOFA for 
more than the greater of 10 percent of the HA rental vouchers and rental 
certificates under reservation or 50 units. 

(2) 

Minimum Funding Allowed. 

The HUD State or Area Office/Native 
American Programs Office may not approve funding for an HA under this NOFA for 
less than 25 units, unless: 

(a) The HA requests fewer than 25 units; or 

(b) The residual budget authority in using the rank order funding 
process after funding higher ranked applications is insufficient to fund at 
least 25 units; or 

(c) The total budget authority available to the allocation area will 
fund less than 25 units. 

(3) 

Funding Procedure. 

The HUD State or Area Office must develop a 
procedure for approval of applications (including applications rated by the 
Native American Programs Office) for each allocation area in rank order until 
all the housing assistance budget authority is used. Where a HUD State or 
Area Office funds applications according to rank order for each allocation 
area, only to find it has some number of units left, but not enough to fund 
the next fundable application in its entirety or for the minimum of 25 units, 
that application can be funded to the extent of the number of units available. 

The HUD State or Area Office may elect to approve 100 percent of the 
units requested in all applications that score above a HUD State or Area 
Office-determined funding cut-off, up to the maximum number of units allowed.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940711-2-00176 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940711-2-00073 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The HUD State or Area Office may elect to approve less than 100 percent 
of the units requested in all applications for each allocation area that score 
above a HUD State or Area Office-determined funding cut-off, up to the maximum 
number of units allowed. 

If applications are to be funded at less than 100 percent of the units 
requested in the applications, the HUD State or Area Office must either (i) 
approve the same percentage of the number of units requested in each 
application or (ii) divide approvable applications into two or more 
categories, for example, those scoring over 80 points, and those scoring 
between 50 and 80 points. 

If the HUD State or Area Office elects to divide applications into two 
categories, the HUD State or Area Office may choose to approve a different 
percentage for applications in each of the two ranking categories so that a 
higher percentage of units requested would be approved for all applications in 
the higher category and a lower percentage of units requested would be 
approved for all applications in the lower category. The HUD State or Area 
Office must approve the same percentage of each application within each of the 
two ranking categories unless there are insufficient funds to approve the 
minimum 25 units. If the HUD State or Area Office is unable to fund all the 
applications for the minimum funding allowed in either of the two categories, 
the HUD State or Area Office must reduce the applicable percentage factor in 
the category in order to fund all applications for the minimum 25 units 
(unless the HA requested less than 25 units or the total budget authority 
available to the allocation area will fund less than 25 units). 

If an HA applies for a specific program (i.e., rental vouchers or rental 
certificates) and funding for the specified program is not available in the 
metropolitan area or non-metropolitan allocation area, the HUD State or Area 
Office will award the available form of assistance, even though not 
specifically requested by the applicant. 

The HUD State or Area Office must promptly notify the applicable Native 
American Programs Office for each allocation area as to the status of any 
applications from IHAs and, if applicable, the amount of budget authority to 
be made available for IHA applications that were rated high enough to receive 
funding. 



F. Reallocations of Funds 



Each HUD State or Area Office must make every reasonable effort to use 
all available funds. It may be necessary, however, to reallocate funds from 
one HUD State or Area Office to another when the funds are not likely to be 
used in the HUD State or Area Office to which they were initially assigned. 
In such cases, the following procedures shall be followed: 

(1) 

Reallocations Within the Same State. 

If the allocation of funds to a HUD State or Area Office cannot be awarded within the office jurisdiction 
during Fiscal Year 1994, Headquarters will reallocate those funds to another 
HUD State or Area Office in the same State where they can be used during 
Fiscal Year 1994. 

(2) 

Reallocations Between States. 

If a HUD State or Area Office cannot 
use funds within the same State, Headquarters will reallocate those funds to 
another HUD State or Area Office for use in a State where they can be used 
during Fiscal Year 1994. 

(3) 

Reallocations Between Metropolitan and Non-metropolitan Areas. 

The 
HUD State or Area Office must follow the original fund assignments for 
metropolitan and non-metropolitan areas when it reallocates unused budget 
authority among allocation areas. If there are not enough approvable 
applications for the designated metropolitan or non-metropolitan budget 
authority, the HUD State or Area Office may switch the budget authority 
between a metropolitan and a non-metropolitan area within the same State, 
provided that an offsetting switch can be made in another State within the HUD 
State or Area Office. If an offsetting switch cannot be made and the 
metropolitan or non-metropolitan amounts require changes to the fund 
assignments, the HUD State or Area Office must obtain the approval of the 
Budget Division, Office of Management and Policy, Office of Public and Indian 
Housing, before switching budget authority between a metropolitan and a non-
metropolitan area. 

(4) A request for Headquarters approval of a reallocation within or 
between States must explain the reasons that funds cannot be used in the 
original State, the amount being withdrawn from the original State, the 
program type, and the metropolitan/non-metropolitan mix, and the amount to be 
reallocated. These requests must be submitted to Headquarters (ATTENTION: 
Budget Division, Office of Management and Policy, Office of Public and Indian 
Housing) for approval. 



G. Notification of Funds Awarded 



(1) After the HUD State or Area Offices have reviewed, rated, and 
ranked applications, and the HUD State or Area Offices and Native American 
Programs Offices have approved the applications, each HUD State or Area Office 
and each Native American Programs Office must submit to Headquarters a list of 
all approved applications. The application approval list is due in 
Headquarters (ATTENTION: Rental Assistance Division, Office of Public and 
Indian Housing) on the tenth working day following the date set by 
Headquarters for completion of application ranking and selections. 

(2) The Offices must provide the following information for each 
application approved: 

(a) The name and address of the HA; 

(b) The project number, and the number of rental vouchers and the 
number of rental certificates, as applicable, approved for the HA; and 

(c) The amount of contract authority and budget authority, stated 
separately for rental vouchers and rental certificates.

H. Administrative Fees 



(1) The administrative fees for incremental units in the Fiscal Year 1994 appropriations are specified as follows:

(a) 

FY 1994 Incremental (Fees Provided by FY 1994 Appropriation): 





(b) FY 1994 Opt-outs/Public Housing Demolition (Replacements and Relocation) Section 23 Conversions: 






(c) Renewal of Rental Vouchers and Rental Certificates: 





(2) For budget preparation, submission of requisitions, and approving 
year-end operating statements, HAs should use the March 2, 1994, Notice PIH 
94-9, Administrative Fee Requirements for the Section 8 Rental Voucher and 
Rental Certificate Programs, to determine the blended rate for all rental 
voucher or rental certificate increments for a given HA. 



I. Headquarters Reserve 



The Department is retaining in a Headquarters Reserve approximately 
$51.3 million of the $1.0 billion of budget authority available for allocation 
by formula for rental vouchers and rental certificates. Funds in the 
Headquarters Reserve will not be allocated by formula because these funds will 
be used in connection with natural disasters, litigation, desegregation, and 
other housing emergencies, consistent with 24 CFR 791.407. Headquarters will 
notify HAs when they are eligible to receive assistance from the Headquarters 
Reserve and may invite the HAs to submit applications. 



J. Other Allocations 



In addition to the budget authority for ``fair share'' rental vouchers and rental certificates, additional budget
authority (including carryover budget authority) is available for allocation in Fiscal Year 1994 for rental vouchers
and rental certificates for the following purposes: 



(1) Relocation, Demolition and Disposition (HOPE I, II, Section 5(h), 
Section 18 and Urban Revitalization) 



Headquarters will allocate funds directly to the HUD State or Area Offices to assist families living in public housing
projects that are being demolished or disposed with HUD approval; to provide replacement housing in connection with
Section 18, Urban Revitalization, HOPE I or Section 5(h) activities; or relocation assistance to families affected
by HOPE I, HOPE II, and Section 5(h) activities; or assistance to non-purchasing families affected by HOPE II activities.
HUD State or Area Office/Native American Programs Office requests for funding under this category will be approved
on a first-come, first-served basis after notification by HUD that an application for public housing demolition
or disposition, Section 18, Urban Revitalization, HOPE I, HOPE II, or Section 5(h) was approved. HUD State or Area
Office/Native American Programs Office requests should include all data pertinent to determining the eligibility
of the request for funding under the appropriate program and the amount of funds required. Replacement housing assistance
will be provided in the form of 5-year rental voucher or rental certificate funding. (Approximately 2,988 units and
$99.852 million in budget authority.)

<TEXT>
 

(2) Rental Voucher and Rental Certificate Renewals 



Headquarters will allocate funds directly to the HUD State or Area Offices/Native American Programs Offices for
the renewal of rental voucher and rental certificate funding increments expiring in Fiscal Year 1994. Renewal funding
will be provided in-kind (i.e., rental voucher funding for expiring rental voucher increments, and rental certificate
funding for expiring rental certificate increments). (Approximately 177,000 units and $4.7 billion in budget authority.)




(3) Section 23 Conversions 



Headquarters will allocate rental certificate funds directly to the HUD State or Area Offices for tenant-based rental
assistance to residents of Section 23 leased housing for which leases are expiring. HUD State or Area Office requests
for funding under this category will be approved on a first-come, first-served basis. HUD State or Area Offices must
include all data necessary to determine the amount of funds required. (Approximately 374 units and $7.4 million in
budget authority.)

III. Checklist of Application Submission Requirements 



A. Obtaining Application Materials 



An Application Kit, which includes Form HUD-52515, Application for 
Existing Housing, may be obtained from the local HUD State or Area 
Office/Native American Programs Office. (Except as provided for Indian 
Housing Authorities in Section III(B), Submitting Applications, of this NOFA, 
only an original application and one copy should be submitted; it is not 
necessary to submit additional copies of the application.) In addition, the 
basic application and other required submissions are available from the HUD 
State or Area Office, as follows: Form HUD-52515; Certification for a Drug- 
Free Workplace; Text for the Certification Regarding Lobbying; and Standard 
Form LLL, Disclosure of Lobbying Activities. 



B. Submitting Applications 



HA applications must be received in the HUD State or Area Office/Native 
American Programs Office by 3:00 p.m. local time (i.e., the time at the office 
where the application is to be submitted) on August 25, 1994.

The Native American Programs Office is the place of official receipt for 
IHA applications. An IHA also must submit, at the same time, a copy of its 
application to the HUD State or Area Office that has jurisdiction over the 
portion of the State in which the IHA is located. HUD State or Area 
Offices/Native American Programs Offices will be responsible for notifying 
their HAs of the exact address and room number where applications are to be 
submitted. Copies transmitted via facsimile (FAX) transmission will not be 
accepted for processing. 



C. General



(1) Applications must be submitted to the local HUD State or Area 
Office/Native American Programs Office on Form HUD-52515 in accordance with 
the applicable program regulations. 

(2) The application should include a narrative description of how the 
application meets, or will meet, the application selection criteria. Failure 
to submit a narrative description is not cause for application rejection; 
however, the HUD State or Area Office/Native American Programs Office can only 
rate and rank the application based on information the Office has on-hand. 

(3) Attachment 1 at the end of this notice lists the HUD State or Area 
Offices and the number of units and budget authority available for each 
allocation area. HAs should limit their applications for the ``fair share'' 
program to a reasonable number of rental vouchers and rental certificates, 
based on the capacity of the HA to lease all the units within 12 months of ACC 
execution. The number of units on the HA application may not exceed the 
greater of: (a) Ten percent (10%) of the total rental vouchers and rental 
certificates under reservation for the HA; or (b) 50 units.

(4) HAs shall submit only one application (Form HUD-52515) for an 
allocation area. If both rental vouchers and rental certificates are 
requested on the same application, then the application will be given two 
project numbers, one for the Rental Voucher Program and one for the Rental 
Certificate Program. The total number of units applied for may not exceed the 
ten percent or 50-unit limitation. 
(5) Regional and State-wide HAs may submit one application for each 
allocation area, and each application will be considered separately. Each 
regional or State-wide HA application may request up to ten percent (10%) of 
the total rental vouchers and rental certificates the HA has under reservation 
for each allocation area as applicable, or 50 units, whichever is greater. 
(6) The HUD State or Area Office/Native American Programs Office will 
reduce the number of units requested in any application that exceeds the ten 
percent or 50-unit limit to the greater of ten percent (10%) of the total 
number of rental vouchers and rental certificates identified on the latest 
HUD-approved budget for the HA. 


D. Certification Regarding Drug-Free Workplace 


The Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988 requires grantees of Federal 
agencies to certify that they will provide a drug-free workplace. Thus, each 
HA must certify (even though it has done so previously) that it will comply 
with the drug-free workplace requirements in accordance with 24 CFR part 24, 
subpart F. 


E. Certification Regarding Lobbying 


Section 319 of the Department of the Interior Appropriations Act, Public Law 101-121, approved October 23,
1989, (31 U.S.C. 1352) (the Byrd Amendment) 
generally prohibits recipients of Federal contracts, grants, and loans from 
using appropriated funds for lobbying the Executive or Legislative Branches of 
the Federal Government in connection with a specific contract, grant, or loan. 
The Department's regulations on these restrictions on lobbying are codified at 
24 CFR part 87. To comply with 24 CFR 87.110, any HA (other than an IHA that 
meets the definition of ``person'' in 24 CFR 87.105) submitting an application 
under this NOFA for more than $100,000 of budget authority assistance must 
submit a certification and, if warranted, a Disclosure of Lobbying Activities. 
To assist HAs, the texts for the Certification Regarding Lobbying and Standard 
Form LLL, Disclosure Form to Report Lobbying are available from the HUD State 
or Area Office. 


F. Checklist for Technical Requirements 


The following checklist specifies the required information that must be 
submitted in the HA's application. It is recommended, but not required, that 
the application contain a narrative explaining how the application meets the 
selection criteria.

IV. Corrections to Deficient Applications


To be eligible for processing, an application must be received by the 
appropriate HUD State or Area Office/Native American Programs Office no later 
than the date and time specified in Section II of this NOFA. The HUD State or 
Area Office/Native American Programs Office will initially screen all 
applications and notify HAs of technical deficiencies by letter. 
If an application has technical deficiencies, the HA will have 14 
calendar days from the date of the issuance of written notification to submit 
the missing or corrected information to the HUD State or Area Office and/or 
Native American Programs Office. Curable technical deficiencies relate only 
to items that do not improve the substantive quality of the application 
relative to the rating factors. 
All HAs must submit corrections within 14 calendar days from the date of 
HUD's letter notifying the applicant of any such deficiency. Information 
received after 3 p.m. local time (i.e., the time in the appropriate HUD State 
or Area Office/Native American Programs Office), of the fourteenth calendar 
day of the correction period will not be accepted and the application will be 
rejected as incomplete. All HAs are encouraged to review the initial 
screening checklist provided in Section III of this notice. The checklist 
identifies all technical requirements needed for application processing. An 
HA application that does not comply with the requirements of 24 CFR 882.204(a) 
or 887.55(b) and this notice, including the drug-free workplace certification 
and the anti-lobbying certification/disclosure requirements, after the 
expiration of the 14-day cure period will be rejected from processing. 


V. Other Matters


A. Environmental Impact


A Finding of No Significant Impact with respect to the environment has 
been made in accordance with the Department's regulations at 24 CFR Part 50, 
which implement section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 
1969 (42 U.S.C. 4332). The Finding is available for public inspection between 
7:30 a.m. and 5:30 p.m. weekdays in the Office of the Rules Docket Clerk, 
Office of General Counsel, Department of Housing and Urban Development, room 
10276, 451 Seventh Street, SW, Washington, D.C. 20410. 


B. Federalism Impact


The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under section 6(a) of 
Executive Order 12612, Federalism, has determined that the policies contained 
in this notice will not have substantial direct effects on states or their 
political subdivisions, or the relationship between the federal government and 
the states, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the 
various levels of government. As a result, the notice is not subject to 
review under the Order. This notice is a funding notice and does not 
substantially alter the established roles of the Department, the States, and 
local governments, including HAs. 


C. Impact on the Family


The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under Executive Order 
12606, 

The Family, 

has determined that this notice does not have potential for 
significant impact on family formation, maintenance, and general well-being 
within the meaning of the Executive Order and, thus, is not subject to review 
under the Order. This is a funding notice and does not alter program 
requirements concerning family eligibility. 


D. Section 102 of the HUD Reform Act: Documentation and Public Access Requirements. 


HUD Responsibilities


HUD will ensure that documentation and other 
information regarding each application submitted pursuant to this NOFA are 
sufficient to indicate the basis upon which assistance was provided or denied. 
This material, including any letters of support, will be made available for 
public inspection for a five-year period beginning not less than 30 days after 
the award of the assistance. Material will be made available in accordance 
with the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) and HUD's implementing 
regulations at 24 CFR part 15. In addition, HUD will include the recipients of 
assistance pursuant to this NOFA in its quarterly 

Federal Register

 notice of all recipients of HUD assistance awarded on a competitive basis. (See 24 CFR 12.14(a) and 12.16(b), and the
notice published in the 

Federal Register

 on January 16, 1992 (57 FR 1942), for further information on these requirements.) 


E. Section 103 of the HUD Reform Act


HUD's regulation implementing section 103 of the Department of Housing 
and Urban Development Reform Act of 1989 (42 U.S.C. 3537a) (Reform Act) was 
published on May 13, 1991 (56 FR 22088), and became effective on June 12, 
1991. That regulation, codified as 24 CFR part 4, applies to the funding 
competition announced today. The requirements of the rule continue to apply 
until the announcement of the selection of successful applicants. 
HUD employees involved in the review of applications and in the making 
of funding decisions are restrained by part 4 from providing advance 
information to any person (other than an authorized employee of HUD) 
concerning funding decisions, or from otherwise giving any applicant an unfair 
competitive advantage. Persons who apply for assistance in this competition 
should confine their inquiries to the subject areas permitted under 24 CFR 
part 4. 
Applicants who have questions should contact the HUD Office of Ethics 
(202) 708-3815 (TDD/Voice). (This is not a toll-free number.) The Office of 
Ethics can provide information of a general nature to HUD employees, as well. 
However, a HUD employee who has specific program questions, such as whether 
particular subject matter can be discussed with persons outside the 
Department, should contact his or her HUD State or Area Office Counsel, or 
Headquarters counsel for the program to which the question pertains. 


F. Prohibition Against Lobbying Activities


The use of funds awarded under this NOFA is subject to the disclosure 
requirements and prohibitions of section 319 of the Department of Interior and 
Related Agencies Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 1990 (31 U.S.C. 1352) 
(the ``Byrd Amendment'') and the implementing regulations at 24 CFR part 87. 
These authorities prohibit recipients of Federal contracts, grants, or loans 
from using appropriated funds for lobbying the Executive or Legislative 
Branches of the Federal Government in connection with specific contract, 
grant, or loan. The prohibition also covers the awarding of contracts, 
grants, cooperative agreements, or loans unless the recipient has made an 
acceptable certification regarding lobbying. Under 24 CFR part 87, 
applicants, recipients, and subrecipients of assistance exceeding $100,000 
must certify that no Federal funds have been or will be spent on lobbying 
activities in connection with the assistance. IHAs established by an Indian 
tribe as a result of the exercise of
