FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE CORPORATION 









Supplemental Standards of Ethical Conduct for Employees of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC or Corporation). 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, with the concurrence of the Office of Government Ethics (OGE), proposes
to issue regulations for the employees of the Corporation which would supplement the Standards of Ethical Conduct
for Employees of the Executive Branch (Executive Branch-wide Standards) issued by OGE. The proposed rule is a necessary
supplement to the Executive Branch-wide Standards and has been designed to address the specialized functions and
operations of the Corporation. The proposed rule would establish: prohibitions on borrowing and extensions of credit;
prohibitions on the ownership of certain financial interests; prohibitions on the purchase of property controlled
by the Corporation or the Resolution Trust Corporation (RTC); limitations on official dealings with former employers
and clients; disqualification requirements relating to employment of family members outside the Corporation;
and limitations on outside employment activities. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
I. Background 


On August 7, 1992, the Office of Government Ethics published the Standards of Ethical Conduct For Employees of the
Executive Branch. See 57 FR 35006-35067, as corrected at 57 FR 48557 and 57 FR 52583, with an additional grace
period extension at 59 FR 4779-4780. The Executive Branch-wide Standards, now codified at 5 CFR part 2635 and
effective February 3, 1993, establish uniform standards of ethical conduct for executive branch employees. 
With the concurrence of the OGE, 5 CFR 2635.105 and the Resolution Trust Corporation Completion Act (P.L. 103-204)
authorize the Corporation to publish agency-specific supplemental regulations necessary to implement its ethics
programs. The Corporation and OGE have determined that the following supplemental regulations contained in the
proposed rule are necessary to successfully continue the Corporation's ethics program in light of the Corporation's
unique programs and operations. The proposed supplemental rule addresses issues relevant to the Corporation's
specialized roles as the insurer, conservator, receiver, liquidator, organizer of bridge banks, and regulator
or back-up enforcement agency for FDIC-insured depository institutions. Upon finalization of the supplemental
regulation, the Corporation will, as proposed, delete those portions of 12 CFR part 336 that are superseded by the
Executive Branch-wide Standards and the supplemental regulations. 


II. Analysis of Regulation 


The following regulations are proposed to appear in new part 3201 of 5 CFR chapter XXII. 


Section 3201.101 General 


(a) 

Purpose.

 Proposed  3201.101(a) explains that the regulations would apply to all Corporation employees and would supplement
the Executive Branch-wide Standards. Because they are covered under rules applicable to the Department of the Treasury,
two members of the Board of Directors, the Comptroller of the Currency and the Director of the Office of Thrift Supervision,
would be covered only by those provisions of the supplemental regulation specifically made applicable to them in
connection with their activities as members of the Corporation's Board of Directors. 
(b) 

Corporation ethics officials.

 Proposed  3201.101(b) explains that the Designated Agency Ethics Official would be the Executive Secretary
and that the Alternate Agency Ethics Official would be the Assistant Executive Secretary (Ethics) of the FDIC. This
provision would delegate authority to the Executive Secretary and the Assistant Executive Secretary (Ethics) to
act in such capacities as contemplated under 5 CFR part 2638. The provision would continue the designations currently
found at 12 CFR part 336, as updated to accommodate organizational changes. 
(c) 

Agency designees.

 Proposed  3201.101(c) specifies those employees who would hold the authority to act as agency designees under
the Executive Branch-wide Standards and the supplemental regulation. It also explains that only the Ethics Counselor
or Alternate Ethics Counselor would be able to delegate authority to act as agency designees and that such delegation
would have to be in writing and could not be re-delegated. 
(d) 

Definitions.

 Proposed  3201.101(d) would include as an 

affiliate

 those companies which control, are controlled by, or are under common control with, an FDIC-insured depository institution.
The definition for 

affiliate

 was taken from the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 and is intended to be broadly interpreted and include any holding
companies, subsidiaries, or other affiliated companies of an FDIC-insured depository institution. 
The term 

appropriate director

 would include the heads of offices and divisions in the Washington office, the highest ranking officials in each division
in the regional offices, and the Ethics Counselor. 
The term 

covered employee

 would include all employees of the Corporation required to file confidential or public financial disclosure reports
under 5 CFR part 2634 or 5 CFR part 3202.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940712-1-00003 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940712-1-00001 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Under the proposed regulation, the term 

employee

 would include all persons, other than special Government employees, employed by the Corporation. Pursuant to the
Resolution Trust Corporation Completion Act (P.L. 103-204), the Corporation is also required to consider
the employees of contractors as employees of the Corporation for certain purposes. Therefore, the term 

employee

 would include, for purposes of 5 CFR part 2635 and   3201.103 and 3201.104 of this part, any individual
who, pursuant to a contract or any other arrangement, performs functions or activities of the Corporation, under
the direct supervision of an officer or employee of the Corporation. The term 

employee

 would not include independent contractors who are not deemed to be employees under 12 U.S.C. 1822(f)(1)(B). In the
case of members of the Board of Directors, it would include only the three members appointed by the President under
12 U.S.C. 1812(a)(1)(C). 
The proposed regulation provides a broad definition of the term 

security

 which includes an interest in debt or equity instruments such as, for example, stocks, bonds, and commercial paper.
However, the term 

security

 would not include a deposit account. 
The term 

State nonmember bank

 is a statutory term taken from 12 U.S.C. 1813 and would include all State banks that are not members of the Federal Reserve
System. 
The definition of 

subsidiary

 was taken from section 3(w) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, codified to 12 U.S.C. 1813(w), and would include
all companies owned or controlled directly or indirectly by another company. 


Section 3201.102 Extensions of Credit From FDIC-Insured Depository Institutions 


The proposed rules on extensions of credit from FDIC-insured depository institutions provide the conditions under
which certain specified categories of Corporation employees can obtain credit from depository institutions insured
by the Corporation. Restrictions on the availability of credit to Corporation employees are necessary for several
reasons. First, 5 CFR 2635.403(a) permits the Corporation to prohibit or restrict the acquisition or holding of a
financial interest or class of financial interests by Corporation employees, and the spouses and minor children
of those employees, when the Corporation has made the determination that the acquisition or holding of such financial
interests would cause a reasonable person to question the impartiality and objectivity with which Corporation programs
are administered, and 5 CFR 2635.403(c) specifically provides that the term 

financial interest

 may include an indebtedness relationship. For purposes of the extensions of credit covered by  3201.102 (a)
through (d), the Corporation has made such a determination. These prohibitions and restrictions on employees entering
into financial arrangements with institutions over which the Corporation has regulatory and resolution authority
are necessary to prevent loss of public confidence in the integrity of the Corporation. In addition, the borrowing
prohibition would incorporate the substance of the statutory prohibition at 18 U.S.C. 213 on bank examiners accepting
certain loans. Finally, limitations on borrowing from FDIC-insured depository institutions would avoid a high
number of employee disqualifications that would have a detrimental effect on the Corporation's administration
of its multifaceted responsibilities. 
Under proposed  3201.102(a), a current or contingent financial obligation of an employee is considered a financial
obligation for purposes of the prohibition, disqualification, and retention provisions of proposed  3201.102.
A current or contingent financial obligation of a spouse or minor child is attributed to the employee for purposes
of this section since the Corporation has determined, pursuant to 5 CFR 2635.403(a), that there is a direct and appropriate
nexus between the efficiency of the service and the prohibitions and restrictions in  3201.102 as applied to
the spouses and minor children of Corporation employees. 
Under proposed  3201.102(b), members of the Board of Directors and other Corporation officials who are in top
management positions would be prohibited from incurring financial obligations with an institution over which the
Corporation has primary Federal supervisory authority or a subsidiary of such an institution. A deputy or an assistant
to the Board of Directors or to an individual board member, a covered employee who is an assistant to such deputy or assistant,
the director of a Washington office or division (other than the Division of Supervision), and a covered employee immediately
subordinate to such a director would be included in the restricted class. The prohibition would not apply to credit
extended through an ordinary credit card relationship due to the standardized handling and low credit amounts customary
in such relationship. 
Under  3201.102(c), depository institutions examination staff, including all covered employees assigned
to the Division of Supervision, would be prohibited from obtaining credit from an FDIC-insured State nonmember bank,
the class of FDIC-insured depository institutions for which the FDIC has primary supervisory responsibility, any
subsidiary of such bank, or any person employed by such bank. An exception would be carved out for an ordinary credit
card relationship but, for those employees assigned to regional or field offices, the exception would be limited
to credit cards offered by FDIC-insured State nonmember banks located outside the employee's region of assignment.
The rule, which is substantially the same as 12 CFR 336.16(a), is consistent with 18 U.S.C. 213 which prohibits examiners
from accepting credit from institutions which they have examined. Under the proposed rule, an employee would be required
to file a report upon obtaining a credit card from a State nonmember bank located outside the employee's region of assignment.

Proposed  3201.102(d) would impose a two-year prohibition on an employee in the Division of Finance, the Division
of Depositor and Asset Services, the Division of Resolutions, or the Legal Division, or who is a member of a standing
committee of the Board of Directors obtaining credit from an FDIC-insured depository institution or its subsidiary
when the employee has participated personally and substantially in certain matters affecting the institution,
its predecessor or successor, or an affiliate of such institution. This prohibition would be applicable to the universe
of FDIC-insured depository institutions and would be limited to those Corporation employees who perform functions
associated with the audit, resolution, liquidation, supervision, or agency deliberation affecting a specific
FDIC-insured depository institution. The two-year prohibition has been designed to eliminate concerns over potential
benefits that an employee holding a sensitive non-examiner position could derive through a financial relationship
with an institution that has close business ties to the Corporation. An exception has been made for an ordinary credit
card relationship. The definition of 

personally and substantially

 can be found at 5 CFR 2635.402(b)(4) of the Executive Branch-wide Standards. 
Proposed  3201.102(e)(1) would prohibit a member of the depository institution's examination staff, including
senior level staff, from participating in the supervisory review of any institution with which they hold an extension
of credit. No exceptions to this rule have been provided due to the sensitive nature of the duties involved. 
Under proposed  3201.102(e)(2)-(4), a covered employee and the Comptroller of the Currency and the Director
of the Office of Thrift Supervision would be prohibited from participating in matters affecting persons with whom
the employee has an outstanding extension of credit. Exceptions have been provided for ordinary credit card relationships
or when the agency designee, with the concurrence of the appropriate director, determines that participation by
the employee would be appropriate under the standard outlined under 5 CFR 2635.502(d). 
Proposed  3201.102(f) would clarify that an employee may retain certain extensions of credit that he or she
would be prohibited from obtaining anew. For example, an employee who had obtained an extension of credit prior to
employment with the Corporation would not be required to refinance the credit. Any extension of credit retained under
this section would be required to be reported to an agency designee. An employee would not be allowed to renew or renegotiate
the credit without the consent of the agency designee and appropriate director or, in the case of certain higher-level
officials, without the consent of the Ethics Counselor. This provision is substantially the same as current 12 CFR
336.16(d), and extensions of credit which were permissibly held under such provision could be retained under the
new provision. 


Section 3201.103 Prohibitions on Ownership of Securities of 
FDIC-Insured Depository Institutions 


The Corporation has determined that, in light of its sensitive and diverse mission involving the institutions that
it insures, restrictions on employee ownership of securities in such institutions are necessary in order to maintain
public confidence in the impartiality and objectivity with which the Corporation executes its various functions;
eliminate concerns by private entities that sensitive information provided to the Corporation might be used for
private gain; and avoid the widespread disqualification of employees from their duties which could result in the
Corporation having difficulty in performing its mission. Under proposed  3201.103(a), an employee would
be prohibited from having a direct or indirect ownership interest in a security of an FDIC-insured depository institution
or an affiliate of such institution. 
As proposed, the exceptions in  3201.103(b) would allow an employee to acquire, own or control certain direct
and indirect ownership interests in an FDIC-insured depository institution. For example, an employee would be permitted
to retain an interest which had been acquired prior to employment with the Corporation or involuntarily acquired
by the employee such as by gift, stock split, or through a merger of a company. An employee could also acquire, own or
control an interest in an FDIC-insured depository institution through the investment vehicle of a publicly traded
or available diversified investment fund when the fund does not have an objective or practice of concentrating its
investments in securities of the financial services sector. An employee who owned securities of an FDIC-insured
depository institution under one of the exceptions in proposed  3201.103(b) would be disqualified under 5
CFR 2635.402 from participating in any particular matter that, by reason of his or her ownership of those securities,
affects his or her financial interests or those of his or her spouse or minor child. 
Under proposed  3201.103(c), the Ethics Counselor could require an employee, or the spouse or minor child of
an employee, to divest an ownership interest that would otherwise be allowed to be retained under  3201.103(b)
using the standard set forth in 5 CFR 2635.403(b).

Section 3201.104 Restrictions Concerning the Purchase of Property Held by the Corporation or the RTC as Conservator,
Receiver, or Liquidator of the Assets of an Insured Depository Institution, or by a Bridge Bank Organized by the Corporation



In order to avoid any self-dealing, appearance of self-dealing, adversarial relationship with the Corporation,
or diminution of public confidence in the Corporation's ability to accomplish its mission, an employee, or the spouse
or minor child of an employee, would be prohibited under  3201.104(a) from purchasing assets held by the Corporation
or the Resolution Trust Corporation (RTC) as conservator, receiver, or liquidator or held by a bridge bank organized
by the Corporation. In such roles, the Corporation and the RTC generally act as a fiduciary to the creditors of failed
depository institutions. Property held by the RTC has been included in the proposed prohibition because of the RTC's
significant ties with the Corporation. 
As proposed,  3201.104(b) would disqualify an employee involved in the disposition of the assets of a failed
insured depository institution from participation in the disposition of such assets when the employee knows that
a person with whom he or she holds a covered relationship intends to purchase such assets. Written notification of
the disqualification would be required to be made by the employee to his or her immediate supervisor and the agency
designee. 


Section 3201.105 Prohibition on Dealings With Former Employers, Associates, and Clients 


In order to avoid the appearance of favoritism and maintain the integrity of the Corporation's regulatory oversight,
insurance assessments, and resolution and liquidation transactions, proposed  3201.105(a) would prohibit
an employee, for a period of one year after entering on duty with the Corporation, from participating in official Corporation
matters involving an employer with whom the employee worked during the year preceding the employee's entry on duty
with the Corporation. Proposed  3201.105(b) would include within the definition of the term employer a broad
range of persons, as defined in 5 CFR 2635.502, with whom the employee has a covered relationship. In an individual
case,  3201.105(c) would give the agency designee discretion to extend the prohibition beyond the one year
period that would automatically apply to all new Corporation employees. 


Section 3201.106 Employment of Family Members Outside the Corporation 


As proposed,  3201.106 would continue the Corporation's requirement at 12 CFR 336.21 that an employee be disqualified
from participation in particular matters involving employers of family members or members of the employee's household.
It would also require the employee to report the employment of family members or members of the employee's household
by FDIC-insured depository institutions or companies that have business, or are seeking to do business, with the
Corporation. This requirement eliminates the potential for any appearance of preferential treatment in those instances
where employment of a family member or a member of the employee's household would be likely to raise questions regarding
the appropriateness of actions taken by the employee or the Corporation. 


Section 3201.107 Outside Employment and Other Activities 


Proposed  3201.107(a) would prohibit an employee from providing services, for compensation, to an FDIC-insured
depository institution or to a person employed by such institution. The prohibition is based, in part, on 18 U.S.C.
1909, which prohibits an examiner from performing any service for compensation for any FDIC-insured depository
institution or for any person connected therewith. 
Similarly, proposed  3201.107(b) would restrict an employee from using certain professional licenses in
compensated outside activities when the employee's duties to the Corporation involve those activities. The areas
involved in the prohibition have been limited to areas identified as especially sensitive and critical to corporate
operations. 
Proposed  3201.107(c) would make it the responsibility of the employee to consult with an agency designee concerning
outside employment or activities that could result in disqualification of the employee from his or her official duties.



Section 3201.108 Related Statutory and Regulatory Authorities 


This section sets forth additional statutory and regulatory authorities with which an employee should be familiar.



Section 3201.109 Provisions of 5 CFR Part 2635 Not Applicable to Corporation Employees 


Certain provisions of the Standards of Ethical Conduct have been determined by the Corporation to be inapplicable
to its employees based on the Corporation's status as a mixed-ownership Corporation. To avoid confusion, the authorities
which are not applicable to the Corporation and its employees would be listed in  3201.109 (b) through (e). Proposed
 3201.109(a) would caution examiners that they may not use the gift exceptions in 5 CFR 2635.204 to accept a gift
that would violate the criminal prohibitions in 18 U.S.C. 213 against examiners accepting gifts or gratuities from
the institutions they examine. 


III. Removal of FDIC Employees Responsibilities and Conduct Regulations and Related Modifications 


On the effective date of the final rule, the Employee Responsibilities and Conduct regulation, 12 CFR part 336, will
be amended to remove and reserve subparts A, B, C, E, and F,   336.1-336.23 and 336.29-336.37,
and remove the appendix to part 336. As proposed, a new  336.1 will be added to provide a cross-reference to the
Corporation's supplemental ethical conduct regulation, to be codified at 5 CFR part 3201, the Corporation's supplemental
financial disclosure regulation at 5 CFR part 3202, and to the Executive Branch-wide financial disclosure and standards
of ethical conduct regulations at 5 CFR parts 2634 and 2635. 12 CFR part 336, subpart D,   336.24 through
336.28, was removed and reserved by action of the Board of Directors of the Corporation dated November 24, 1992, 57
FR 39628.

(d) 

Two-year prohibition on acceptance of credit from FDIC-insured depository institutions. 

(1) An employee described in paragraph (d)(2) of this section shall not, directly or indirectly, accept or become
obligated on an extension of credit from an FDIC-insured depository institution or its subsidiary for a period of
two years from the date of the employee's last personal and substantial participation in an audit, resolution, liquidation,
supervisory proceeding, or internal agency deliberation affecting that particular institution, its predecessor
or successor, or any subsidiary of such institution. This prohibition does not apply to credit obtained through the
use of a credit card under the same terms and conditions as are offered to the general public. 
(2) The prohibition in paragraph (d)(1) of this section applies to an employee in the Division of Finance, Division
of Depositor and Asset Services, Division of Resolutions, Legal Division, or who is a member of a standing committee
of the Board of Directors whose official duties include: 
(i) Audit of insured depository institutions for deposit insurance assessment purposes; 
(ii) Resolution or liquidation of failed or failing insured depository institutions; 
(iii) Participation in the supervision of insured depository institutions or enforcement proceedings under the
Federal Deposit Insurance Act; or 
(iv) Internal agency deliberations affecting a particular insured depository institution, its predecessor or
successor, or a subsidiary of such institution. 
(e) 

Employee disqualification. 

(1) An employee described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section shall not participate in an examination, audit, visitation,
review, or investigation, or other particular matter involving an FDIC-insured depository institution or other
person with whom the employee has an outstanding extension of credit. 
(2) A covered employee, other than an employee who is described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, shall not participate
in any particular matter involving an FDIC-insured depository institution or other person with whom the employee
has an outstanding extension of credit. 
(3) Disqualification is not required under paragraph (e)(2) of this section: 
(i) If the credit was extended through the use of a credit card on the same terms and conditions as are offered to the general
public; or 
(ii) When the agency designee, with the concurrence of the appropriate director, has authorized the employee to participate
in the matter using the standard set forth in 5 CFR 2635.502(d). 
(4) The Comptroller of the Currency and the Director of the Office of Thrift Supervision shall be disqualified from
matters pending before the Board of Directors to the same extent as a covered employee subject to paragraph (e)(2)
of this section. 
(f) 

Retention and renegotiation of pre-existing extensions of credit. 

(1) Nothing in this section prohibits the retention of a pre-existing extension of credit that an employee would be
prohibited from accepting by  3201.102 (b) or (c) if the extension of credit was permitted to be retained under
12 CFR part 336 prior to the adoption of this regulation or if the employee's acceptance of the extension of credit was
proper at the time the obligation was incurred, as in the case of an extension of credit incurred prior to commencement
of employment or reassignment to another division or location. Subsequent action affecting the status of the creditor,
such as merger, acquisition, or transaction under 12 U.S.C. 1823, does not change the character of an extension of
credit that was proper when incurred. An employee who retains a pre-existing extension that he or she would be prohibited
from accepting by  3201.102 (b) or (c) shall report the pre-existing extension of credit to the appropriate
director or agency designee within 30 days from the following event, as appropriate: 
(i) Adoption of this part; 
(ii) Commencement of employment; 
(iii) Assignment to another division or location; or 
(iv) Action affecting the status of the creditor. 
(2) Any renegotiation of a pre-existing extension of credit shall be treated as a new extension of credit that is subject
to the prohibitions contained in  3201.102 (b) through (d). An employee may request that an exception be made
to the prohibitions to permit renegotiation of a pre-existing extension of credit. Any such request shall be made
in writing to the appropriate director and agency designee, or in the case of an employee described in paragraph (b)(2)
(i) and (ii) of this section, to the Ethics Counselor, stating: 
(i) The purpose of the renegotiation; 
(ii) The terms and conditions of the original extension of credit; 
(iii) The terms and conditions now available to the general public; 
(iv) The terms and conditions now offered to the employee; 
(v) The action the employee has taken to move the loan to an institution from which an employee would not be prohibited
from accepting an extension of credit; and 
(vi) The financial hardship, if any, denial of the request will cause. 
(3) After submission of the request, the appropriate director and agency designee, or the Ethics Counselor, may grant
the employee's request based upon a written determination that the request is not inconsistent with 5 CFR part 2635
or otherwise prohibited by law and that, under the particular circumstances, application of the prohibition is not
necessary to avoid the appearance of the misuse of position or loss of impartiality, or otherwise to ensure confidence
in the impartiality and objectivity with which agency programs are administered.

(a) 

Prohibition on ownership. 

Except as permitted by this section, an employee or the spouse or minor child of an employee, shall not acquire, own,
or control, directly or indirectly, a security of an FDIC-insured depository institution, or an affiliate of an FDIC-insured
depository institution. 
(b) 

Exception to prohibition for certain interests. 

Nothing in this section prohibits an employee, or the spouse or minor child of an employee, from: 
(1) Acquiring, owning or controlling the securities of certain publicly traded bank holding companies or their nonbank
subsidiaries where the bank holding company is not primarily engaged in banking and either the bank holding company
or the bank it holds is exempt under the provisions of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 and which are identified as
such by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (a list of exempt institutions can be obtained from the
Corporation's Ethics Section); 
(2) Acquiring, owning, or controlling the securities of certain nonfinancial savings association holding companies
whose principal business is unrelated to the financial services industry and which are identified as such by the Office
of Thrift Supervision pursuant to 5 CFR 3101.109(b)(3)(ii) (a list of such institutions can be obtained from the Corporation's
Ethics Section); 
(3) Retaining a security of an FDIC-insured depository institution or an affiliate of an FDIC-insured depository
institution if the security was permitted to be retained by the employee under 12 CFR part 336 prior to the adoption
of this regulation, was obtained prior to commencement of employment with the Corporation, or was acquired by a spouse
prior to marriage to the employee; 
(4) Acquiring, owning, or controlling a security of an FDIC-insured depository institution or the affiliate of an
FDIC-insured depository institution where the security was acquired by inheritance, gift, stock split, involuntary
stock dividend, merger, acquisition, or other change in corporate ownership, exercise of preemptive right, or otherwise
without specific intent to acquire the security. This provision permits the retention of any such interest only where:

(i) The employee makes full, written disclosure on FDIC form 2410/07 to the Ethics Counselor within 30 days of commencing
employment or acquiring the interest; and 
(ii) The employee is disqualified in accordance with 5 CFR part 2635, subpart D, from participating in any particular
matter that affects his or her financial interests, or that of his or her spouse or minor child; 
(5) Acquiring, owning, or controlling an interest in a publicly traded or publicly available investment fund which,
in its prospectus, does not indicate the objective or practice of concentrating its investments in the financial
services sector and the employee neither exercises control nor has the ability to exercise control over the financial
interests held in the fund; or 
(6) Using an FDIC-insured depository institution or an affiliate of an FDIC-insured depository institution as custodian
or trustee of accounts containing tax-deferred retirement funds. 
(c) 

Divestiture. 

Based upon a determination of substantial conflict under 5 CFR 2635.403(b), the Ethics Counselor may require an employee,
or the spouse or minor child of an employee, to divest a security he or she is otherwise authorized to retain under paragraph
(b) of this section. 


 3201.104 


Restrictions concerning the purchase of property held by the Corporation or the RTC as conservator, receiver, or
liquidator of the assets of an insured depository institution, or by a bridge bank organized by the Corporation. 


(a) 

Prohibition on purchase of property. 

An employee, and an employee's spouse or minor child shall not, directly or indirectly, purchase or acquire any property
held or managed by the Corporation or the Resolution Trust Corporation (RTC) as conservator, receiver, or liquidator
of the assets of an insured depository institution, or by a bridge bank organized by the Corporation, regardless of
the method of disposition of the property. 
(b) 

Disqualification. 

An employee who is involved in the disposition of assets held by the Corporation or the RTC as conservator, receiver,
or liquidator of the assets of an insured depository institution, or by a bridge bank organized by the Corporation
shall not participate in the disposition of assets held in such capacities when the employee knows that any party with
whom the employee has a covered relationship, as defined in 5 CFR 2635.502(b)(1), is or will be attempting to acquire
such assets. The employee shall provide written notification of the disqualification to his or her immediate supervisor
and the agency designee. 


 3201.105 


Prohibition on dealings with former employers, associates, and clients. 


(a) An employee is prohibited for one year from the date of entry on duty with the Corporation from participating in
a particular matter when an employer, or the successor to the employer, for whom the employee worked at any time during
the one year preceding the employee's entrance on duty is a party or represents a party to the matter. 
(b) For purposes of this section, the term 

employer 

means a person with whom the employee served as officer, director, trustee, general partner, agent, attorney, accountant,
consultant, contractor, or employee. 
(c) The one-year period of disqualification imposed by paragraph (a) of this section may be extended in an individual
case based on a written determination by the agency designee that, under the particular circumstances, the employee's
participation in the particular matter would cause a reasonable person with knowledge of the facts to question his
or her impartiality.

 3201.106

Employment of family members outside the Corporation. 


(a) 

Disqualification of employees. 

An employee shall not participate in an examination, audit, investigation, application, contract, or other particular
matter if the employer of the employee's spouse, child, parent, brother, sister, or a member of the employee's household
is a party or represents a party to the matter, unless an agency designee authorizes the employee to participate using
the standard in 5 CFR 2635.502(d). 
(b)

spouse, child, parent, brother, sister, or a member of the employee's household by: 
(1) An FDIC-insured depository institution or its affiliate; 
(2) A firm or business with which, to the employee's knowledge, the Corporation has a contractual or other business
or financial relationship; or 
(3) A firm or business which, to the employee's knowledge, is seeking a business or contractual relationship with
the Corporation. 


 3201.107 

Outside employment and other activities. 


(a) 

Prohibition on employment with FDIC-insured depository institutions. 

An employee shall not provide service for compensation, in any capacity, to an FDIC-insured depository institution
or an employee or person employed by or connected with such institution. 
(b) 

Use of professional licenses. 

A covered employee who holds a license related to real estate, appraisals, securities, or insurance and whose official
duties with the Corporation require personal and substantial involvement in matters related to, respectively,
real estate, appraisal, securities, or insurance is prohibited from using such license, other than in the performance
of his or her official duties, for the production of income. The appropriate director, in consultation with an agency
designee, may grant exceptions to this prohibition based on a finding that the specific transactions which require
use of the license will not create an appearance of loss of impartiality or use of public office for private gain. 
(c) 

Responsibility to consult with agency designee. 

An employee who engages in, or intends to engage in, any outside employment or other activity that may require disqualification
from the employee's official duties shall consult with an agency designee prior to engaging in or continuing to engage
in the activity. 


 3201.108

Regulations (Other Than Rules of Practice) Under the Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act, 1930 (PACA)


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Agricultural Marketing Service (USDA).


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Proposed rule.

 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This proposed rule would invite comments extending PACA coverage to include fresh and frozen fruits and vegetables
that are oil-blanched, including frozen french fried potato products. Under previous regulations, suppliers of
these commodities suffered considerable financial losses because oil-blanched products were excluded from the
PACA. This proposed rule would grant dealers in frozen oil-blanched products the same rights afforded dealers whose
frozen product is water blanched.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The Department of Agriculture is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866.


This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. It is not intended to have retroactive
effect. This rule will not preempt any State or local laws, regulation, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable
conflict with this rule.
The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under Section
1650 of the Act, a person subject to the Plan may file a petition with the Secretary stating that the Plan or any provision
of the Plan, or any obligation imposed in connection with the Plan, is not in accordance with law and requesting a modification
of the Plan or an exemption from the Plan. The petitioner is afforded the opportunity for a hearing on the petition.
After such hearing, the Secretary will make a ruling on the petition. The Act provides that the district courts of the
United States in any district in which a person who is a petitioner resides or carries on business are vested with jurisdiction
to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, if a complaint for that purpose is filed within 20 days after the date
of the entry of the ruling.
Pursuant to requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural
Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this rule on small entities.
The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small
businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened.
The proposed rule would extend PACA coverage to include frozen fruits and vegetables that are oil-blanched, especially
frozen french fried potato products. Under previous regulations, suppliers of these commodities suffered considerable
financial losses because oil-blanched products were excluded from the PACA. This proposed rule would grant dealers
in frozen oil-blanched products the same rights afforded dealers whose frozen product is water blanched.
The PACA establishes a code of fair trading by prohibiting certain unfair practices in the marketing of fresh or frozen
fruits and vegetables. The law requires that parties fulfill their contractual obligations, and provides a forum
wherein persons who suffer damages can recover their losses.
The PACA also impresses a statutory trust, for the benefit of unpaid sellers or suppliers, on all perishable agricultural
commodities received by a commission merchant, dealer or broker and all inventories of food or other products derived
from the sale of such commodities or products. Sellers who preserve their eligibility are entitled to payment ahead
of other creditors, from trust assets of money owed on past due accounts.
As indicated in documents submitted to this Agency by the Frozen Potato Products Institute, frozen potato products
represent the largest single frozen commodity shipped in the United States. These documents further state that potatoes
cannot be economically frozen and shipped long distances unless they first undergo oil blanching. To exclude such
a substantial portion of the frozen food industry is inconsistent with the intent of the PACA to protect dealers in
fresh or frozen fruits and vegetables.


List of Subjects in 7 CFR Part 46 


Agricultural commodities, Brokers, Penalties, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.



For the reasons set forth in the preamble, 7 CFR Part 46 of the Code of Federal Regulations is proposed to be amended as
follows:

Authority: 

Sec. 15, 46 Stat. 537; 7 U.S.C. 499o.



2. Section 46.2, paragraph (u) is revised to read as follows:


 46.2

Definitions. 


* * * * *


(u) 

Fresh fruits and fresh vegetables 

include all produce in fresh form generally considered as perishable fruits and vegetables, whether or not packed
in ice or held in common or cold storage, but do not include those perishable fruits and vegetables which have been manufactured
into articles of food of a different kind or character. The effects of the following operations shall not be considered
as changing a commodity into a food of a different kind or character: Water, steam, or oil blanching, chopping, color
adding, curing, cutting, dicing, drying for the removal of surface moisture; fumigating, gassing, heating for insect
control, ripening and coloring; removal of seeds, pits, stems, calyx, husk, pods, rind, skin, peel, et cetera; polishing,
precooling, refrigerating, shredding, slicing, trimming, washing with or without chemicals; waxing, adding of

Airworthiness Directives; Airbus Industrie Model A300-600 Series Airplanes



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Federal Aviation Administration, DOT.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM).




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain Airbus Industrie
Model A300-600 series airplanes. This proposal would require inspections to detect cracks in certain bolt
holes where certain parts of the main landing gear (MLG) are attached to the rear spar, and repair, if necessary. This
proposal is prompted by a report that cracks emanating from certain bolt holes in the rear spar were found during full
scale fatigue testing. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent unnecessary degradation
of the structural integrity of the airframe due to cracks in the rear spar.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:



Comments Invited



Interested persons are invited to participate in the making of the proposed rule by submitting such written data,
views, or arguments as they may desire. Communications shall identify the Rules Docket number and be submitted in
triplicate to the address specified above. All communications received on or before the closing date for comments,
specified above, will be considered before taking action on the proposed rule. The proposals contained in this notice
may be changed in light of the comments received.

Comments are specifically invited on the overall regulatory, economic, environmental, and energy aspects of the
proposed rule. All comments submitted will be available, both before and after the closing date for comments, in the
Rules Docket for examination by interested persons. A report summarizing each FAA-public contact concerned with
the substance of this proposal will be filed in the Rules Docket.

Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments submitted in response to this notice must submit
a self-addressed, stamped postcard on which the following statement is made: ``Comments to Docket Number 94-NM-56-AD.''
The postcard will be date stamped and returned to the commenter.



Availability of NPRMs



Any person may obtain a copy of this NPRM by submitting a request to the FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate, ANM-103,
Attention: Rules Docket No. 94-NM-56-AD, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington 98055-4056.



Discussion



The Direction G&eacute;n&eacute;rale de l'Aviation Civile (DGAC), which is the airworthiness authority for France,
recently notified the FAA that an unsafe condition may exist on certain Airbus Industrie Model A300-600 series
airplanes. The DGAC advised that, during full-scale fatigue testing, cracks were discovered in the rear spar emanating
from certain bolt holes where the main landing gear (MLG) forward pick-up fitting and the MLG rib 5 aft are attached
to the rear spar on Model A300-600 series airplanes. This condition, if not corrected, could result in degradation
of the structural integrity of the airframe.

Airbus Industrie has issued Service Bulletin A300-57-6017, dated November 22, 1993, that describes
procedures for repetitive high frequency eddy current (HFEC) rototest inspections to detect cracks in certain bolt
holes where the MLG forward pick-up fitting and the MLG rib 5 aft are attached to the rear spar. This service bulletin
also references Airbus Industrie Service Bulletin A300-57-6020, dated November 22, 1993, as an additional
source of service information for accomplishment of certain repair and inspection procedures. The DGAC has classified
Airbus Service Bulletin A300-57-6017 as mandatory and has issued French airworthiness directive 94-031-155(B),
dated February 2, 1994, in order to assure the continued airworthiness of these airplanes in France.

This airplane model is manufactured in France and is type certificated for operation in the United States under the
provisions of section 21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.29) and the applicable bilateral airworthiness
agreement. Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, the DGAC has kept the FAA informed of the situation
described above. The FAA has examined the findings of the DGAC, reviewed all available information, and determined
that AD action is necessary for products of this type design that are certificated for operation in the United States.

Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes of the same type
design registered in the United States, the proposed AD would require repetitive HFEC rototest inspections to detect
cracks in certain bolt holes where the MLG forward pick-up fitting and the MLG rib 5 aft are attached to the rear spar,
and repair, if necessary. The inspections would be required to be accomplished in accordance with Airbus Industrie
Service Bulletin A300-57-6017.

The FAA estimates that 25 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD, that it would take approximately
240 work hours per airplane to accomplish the proposed actions (including time to gain access and close up), and that
the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators
is estimated to be $330,000, or $13,200 per airplane.

The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the
proposed requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this
AD were not adopted. The FAA recognizes that the proposed inspections and repair would require a large number of work
hours to accomplish. However, the compliance times in this proposed AD should allow ample time for the inspection
and repair to be accomplished coincidentally with scheduled major airplane inspection and maintenance activities,
thereby minimizing the costs associated with special airplane scheduling.

The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.

For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) Is not a ``significant regulatory action''
under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document proposes to supersede two 
existing AD's that require repetitively inspecting the 
universal joints and universal rivets on British 
Aerospace (BAe), Regional Aircraft Limited, HP 137 Mk1, 
Jetstream Models 200, 3101, and 3201 airplanes, and 
replacing any damaged part, and limiting the in-service 
life of the torque tube shaft assembly. Jetstream 
Aircraft Limited has introduced an improved flap torque 
shaft assembly that includes universal joints that are 
not life limited. The Federal Aviation 
Administration's policy on aging 
commuter-class aircraft is to eliminate or, in certain 
instances, reduce the number of certain repetitive 
short-interval inspections when improved parts or 
modifications are available. The proposed action would 
require installing this improved flap torque shaft 
assembly in place of the repetitive inspection and life 
limit requirements of the two existing AD's. The 
actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to 
prevent failure of the flap torque shaft assembly, 
which could result in asymmetric flap deployment and 
loss of control of the airplane.

Discussion


The FAA has determined that reliance on critical repetitive inspections on aging commuter-class airplanes carries
an unnecessary safety risk when a design change exists that could eliminate or, in certain instances, reduce the number
of those critical inspections. In determining what inspections are critical, the FAA considers (1) the safety consequences
of the airplane if the known problem is not detected by the inspection; (2) the reliability of the inspection such as
the probability of not detecting the known problem; (3) whether the inspection area is difficult to access; and (4)
the possibility of damage to an adjacent structure as a result of the problem.
These factors have led the FAA to establish an aging commuter-class aircraft policy that requires incorporating
a known design change when it could eliminate, or, in certain instances, reduce the number of critical repetitive
inspections.
In 1991, the FAA issued a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations
(14 CFR part 39) with an airworthiness directive (AD) that would apply to BAe, Regional Aircraft Limited, HP 137 Mk1,
Jetstream Models 200, 3101, and 3201 airplanes. This NPRM (56 FR 11976, March 21, 1991) proposed inspecting the flap
torque shaft to identify all Type ``F'' universal joints, and replacing these universal joints with Type ``M'' or
part number A16123 universal joints.
Since issuance of the notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM), Jetstream Aircraft Limited has introduced an improved
flap torque shaft assembly that includes universal joints that are not life limited, and that incorporates the actions
proposed in the referenced NPRM and required by the following AD's:
 AD 87-04-04, Amendment 39-5529, which requires limiting the in-service life of the torque
tube shaft assembly on BAe HP 137 Mk1, Jetstream Models 200, 3101, and 3201 airplanes; and
 AD 89-16-02, Amendment 39-6273, which requires repetitively inspecting the universal
joints and universal joint rivets on BAe HP 137 Mk1, Jetstream Models 200, 3101, and 3201 airplanes, and replacing
any damaged part.
Jetstream Aircraft Limited has issued Service Bulletin (SB) No. 27-JA 920340, which incorporates the following
pages:






This service information specifies procedures for installing the improved flap torque shaft assembly.


Based on its aging commuter-class aircraft policy and after reviewing all available information, the FAA has determined
that (1) installing the new improved flap torque shaft assemblies incorporates the actions proposed in the previously
referenced NPRM and AD 87-04-04 and AD 89-16-02, and replaces critical repetitive inspections
with a design modification; and (2) AD action should be taken to prevent failure of the flap torque shaft assembly,
which could result in asymmetric flap deployment and loss of control of the airplane. With this in mind, the FAA issued
a document, withdrawing the previously referenced NPRM, on February 14, 1994 (59 FR 8878, February 24, 1994).
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop in other BAe, Regional Aircraft Limited,
HP 137 Mk1, Jetstream Models 200, 3101, and 3201 airplanes of the same type design, the proposed AD would supersede
both AD 87-04-04 and AD 89-16-02 with a new AD that would require installing this improved flap
torque shaft assembly in place of the repetitive inspection and life limit requirements of the two existing AD's.
The proposed actions would be accomplished in accordance with Jetstream Aircraft Limited SB No. 27-JA 920340.
The subsequent final rule action (if promulgated) would have an effective date of 12 months after publication in the


Federal Register

 and a compliance time of 50 hours time-in-service after the effective date. This would allow operators time to schedule
the flap torque shaft assembly replacement. The requirements of AD 87-04-04 and AD 89-16-02
would remain in effect until this date.
The FAA estimates that 245 airplanes in the U.S. registry would be affected by the proposed AD, that it would take approximately
31 workhours per airplane to accomplish the proposed action, and that the average labor rate is approximately $55
an hour. Parts cost approximately $1010 per airplane. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed
AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $665,175. This figure is based on the assumption that none of the affected airplane
operators have accomplished the proposed actions. In addition, this action would eliminate the repetitive inspections
required by AD 87-04-04 and AD 89-16-02. The FAA has no way of determining the operation levels
of each individual operator of the affected airplanes, and subsequently cannot determine the repetitive inspections
costs that would be eliminated by the proposed action. The FAA estimates these costs to be substantial over the long-term.
The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive
Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February
26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial
number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft regulatory evaluation
prepared for this action has been placed in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting the Rules Docket
at the location provided under the caption

this NPRM. Persons interested in being placed on a mailing list for future NPRM's should also request a copy of Advisory
Circular No. 11-2A, which describes the application procedure.



The Proposal




The FAA is considering an amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to establish Class
E airspace at Muskegon County Airport, Muskegon, MI. Currently, this airspace is designated as Class D when the associated
control tower is in operation. Nevertheless, controlled airspace to the surface is needed for IFR operations at Muskegon
County Airport, Muskegon, MI, when the control tower is closed.




The intended affect of this action is to provide adequate Class E airspace for IFR operations at this airport when the
control tower is closed. 




The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Class E airspace areas designated as
surface areas for airports are published in Paragraph 6002 of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective
September 16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993). The Class E airspace
designation listed in this document would be published subsequently in the Order.

The FAA has determined that this proposed regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations
for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) is
not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT
Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory
evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic
procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule, when promulgated, will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

ACTION:

 Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM); request for comments.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The FHWA is requesting comments on proposed revisions to its regulation which establishes general requirements
for quality assurance procedures for construction on Federal-aid highway projects. The proposed revisions will
clarify existing policy and procedures and provide additional guidance on the use of contractor- supplied test results
in acceptance plans and qualifications of laboratories and testing personnel.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

Background 




The current regulations on sampling and testing of materials and construction appear in 23 CFR Part 637 (1993), Construction
Inspection and Approval. These regulations were last revised in January of 1987. The regulations were written around
the traditional approach of the State performing all the sampling and testing. The regulations do not address the
use of contractor testing. As a result, a number of questions arose in those States and Federal Highway Administration
(FHWA) Federal Lands Highway offices which were using contractor testing in their quality control/quality assurance
(QC/QA) programs. 

Since the existing regulations do not recognize the use of contractor testing results in the acceptance program,
which is the process of accepting materials and construction, an internal committee was established in 1992 to study
the ramifications of using contractor-performed sampling and testing results. The committee released the results
of its study in a report, ``Limits of Use of Contractor Performed Sampling and Testing,'' dated July 1, 1993. (A copy
of the report is available in the docket for inspection and copying.) One of the report's recommendations indicates
that contractor sampling and testing can be used in acceptance programs provided that adequate checks and balances
are in place to protect the public investment. The revisions that are proposed in this NPRM would implement the committee's
recommendations. 

The NPRM, if promulgated, would replace the existing acceptance and independent assurance sampling and testing
programs with a comprehensive system of checks and balances. Acceptance of materials and construction would not
be based solely on any one set of data and would specifically require the State to monitor and inspect the contractors'
quality control program. The State's verification sampling and testing would be used to ensure the quality of the
product. In addition, the system would provide for using results from the contractors' quality control sampling
and testing program in the acceptance program if those results are validated by the State's verification sampling
and testing system. The verification sampling and testing would be performed on independent samples obtained by
the State to verify the contractors' quality control data. If the results from the contractors' quality control program
and the State's verification sampling and testing program do not agree a dispute resolution system will be used to
determine payment to the contractor. 

The requirement for an independent assurance (IA) program would remain in place. The IA program would use witnessing,
split samples, proficiency samples and equipment calibration as an independent check of the field sampling and testing
procedures and equipment to assure the testing is being performed properly by both the State and the contractor personnel.


The major changes in the regulation would be as follows: 

1. The use of contractor testing results in the overall acceptance program would be allowed, provided certain checks
and balances are in place. 

2. The traditional type of acceptance program with the State performing all of the testing would be allowed. 

3. The IA program could be performed either on a system basis or on a project by project basis. In a system approach, all
equipment and testing personnel would be assessed on a time frequency, regardless of the specific project on which
the testing occurs. The system approach would allow the State to assess testing equipment and testing personnel regardless
of project location. This approach would ensure that the testing on small projects is assessed and would also ensure
that all testing personnel are reviewed.

4. If the system approach to the IA program is used, an annual report on the IA program would be required instead of a statement
in the project materials certificate concerning the IA program. 
5. Qualified, designated agents of the State would be permitted to perform the IA testing. 
6. All testing personnel and laboratories would be required to be qualified using State procedures. It is anticipated
this provision will have an effective date two years after the publication of the final rule. 
7. The State Highway Agency's (SHA) central laboratory would be required to become accredited by the American Association
of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) Accreditation Program. It is also anticipated this provision
will have an effective date two years after the publication of the final rule. 


Rulemaking Analyses and Notices 


All comments received before the close of business on the comment closing date indicated above will be considered
and will be available for examination in the docket at the above address. Comments received after the comment closing
date will be filed in the docket and will be considered to the extent practicable, but the FHWA may issue a final rule
at any time after the close of the comment period. In addition to late comments, the FHWA will also continue to file relevant
information in the docket as it becomes available after the comment closing date, and interested persons should continue
to examine the docket for new material. 


Executive Order 12866 (Regulatory Planning and Review) and DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures 


The FHWA has determined that this action is not a significant regulatory action within the meaning of Executive Order
12866 or significant within the meaning of Department of Transportation regulatory policies and procedures. The
FHWA, at 23 CFR 637, currently has regulations covering sampling and testing. The proposed revisions would merely
update these regulations to accommodate contractor-performed sampling and testing and reinforce existing policy.
Therefore, it is anticipated that the economic impact of this rulemaking will be minimal and a full regulatory evaluation
is not required. 


Regulatory Flexibility Act 


In compliance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (U.S.C. 601-612), the FHWA has evaluated the effects of this
proposal on small entities. The FHWA concluded that this action would in fact provide some small testing firms with
an opportunity to perform more work than was allowed by the previous regulations. Although the regulation would have
a positive impact on these testing firms, the number of firms affected would be small and the amount of additional work
would be insignificant. Therefore, the FHWA hereby certifies that this rulemaking would not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities. 


Executive Order 12612 (Federalism Assessment) 


This action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612,
and it has been determined that this action would not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation
of a federalism assessment. 


Executive Order 12372 (Intergovernmental Review) 


Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance Program Number 20.205, Highway Planning and Construction. The regulations
implementing Executive Order 12372 regarding intergovernmental consultation on Federal programs and activities
apply to this program. 


Paperwork Reduction Act 


This action does not contain a collection of information requirement for purposes of the Paperwork Reduction Act
of 1980, 44 U.S.C. 3501-3520. 


National Environmental Policy Act 


This rulemaking does not have any effect on the environment. It does not constitute a major action having a significant
effect on the environment, and therefore does not require the preparation of an environmental impact statement pursuant
to the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 

et seq

.) 


Regulation Identification Number 


A regulation identification number (RIN) is assigned to each regulatory action listed in the Unified Agenda of Federal
Regulations. The Regulatory Information Service Center publishes the Unified Agenda in April and October of each
year. The RIN contained in the heading of this document can be used to cross reference this action with the Unified Agenda.

Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants: Notice of Finding on a Petition to Emergency List the Rocky Mountain
Capshell as an Endangered Species Throughout Its Range


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Fish and Wildlife Service, Interior.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of 12-Month Petition Finding.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) announces a 12-month finding for a petition to amend the List of Endangered
and Threatened Wildlife and Plants. The Service finds that listing the Rocky Mountain capshell (

Acroloxus coloradensis

) as endangered is not warranted.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
Background


Section 4(b)(3)(B) of the Endangered Species Act (Act) of 1973, as amended (16 U.S.C. 1531 

et seq.

), requires that for any petition to revise the Lists of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants that contains
substantial scientific and commercial information a finding be made within 12 months of the date of receipt of the
petition on whether the petitioned action is (i) not warranted, (ii) warranted, or (iii) warranted but precluded
by other efforts to revise the lists, and expeditious progress is being made in listing and delisting species. Notice
of the finding is to be published promptly in the 

Federal Register

. This notice meets the latter requirement for the 12-month finding made earlier for the petition discussed below.
Information contained in this notice is a summary of the information in the 12-month finding, which is the Service's
decision document. 
A petition dated September 30, 1992, was received from the Biodiversity Legal Foundation and Dr. Shi-Kuei Wu of the
University of Colorado on October 5, 1992. The petitioners requested the Service to emergency list the Rocky Mountain
capshell (

Acroloxus coloradensis

) as endangered and to designate critical habitat concurrently with the listing. The petitioners submitted biological,
distributional, historical, and other information and scientific references in support of the petition. The notice
of a 90-day finding was published in the 

Federal Register

 on May 14, 1993 (58 FR 28543), indicating that the petitioners provided substantial information to warrant the requested
action. Concurrent with publishing the notice, the Service initiated a status review. 
When the 90-day finding was completed, the Rocky Mountain capshell was thought to be restricted to only two populations
in the United States and five in Canada. In the United States, one population existed at Peterson Lake, Boulder County,
Colorado, and the other at Glacier National Park in Montana. In Canada, the Rocky Mountain capshell was known to occur
in three lakes in Quebec and two ponds in Ontario. The species was presumed extirpated from two lakes in Jasper National
Park, Alberta (Clarke 1992a). 
During the summer of 1993, an extensive survey effort in Colorado increased the number of known Rocky Mountain capshell
populations in Colorado from one to five, with four of these populations apparently in ``good health'' and occurring
on National Park Service or U.S. Forest Service lands (Pioneer Environmental Services 1993, Riebesell and Kovalak
1993). The fifth population is located on privately owned land and appears to be the only Colorado population that
is in peril. 
A status survey conducted at Lost Lake, Montana in September 1992 found that Rocky Mountain capshell population to
be stable. This population is estimated to contain between 20,000 and 40,000 individuals, based on the number of snails
found per square meter and the amount of available habitat (A.H. Clark, Ecosearch Inc., 

in litt

., 1992).

<PARENT> FR940712-1-00007 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

New information provided by Jasper National Park personnel in Canada indicates at least one Rocky Mountain capshell
population still exists within the Park and there is the likelihood a second population (N. Manners, Jasper National
Park, 

in litt.,

 1993). A few specimens were also found under a bridge in another area outside the Park in 1991 (Paul and Clifford, 1991).
Thus, Alberta appears to harbor at least two, and possibly three, Rocky Mountain capshell populations. 

A previously unreported Rocky Mountain capshell population appears to occur at Purden Lake, British Columbia (Clarke
1992b). However, the Service has been unable to obtain any information on its population status. The three populations
previously reported to occur in Quebec and the two in Ontario apparently still exist, but the status of each population
is not known. 

With the discovery of 4 new populations in Colorado, 1 in Alberta, and 1 in British Columbia, and the possibility of
1 or 2 populations still existing in Jasper National Park, the number of reported Rocky Mountain capshell populations
has increased from 7 to at least 14 in less than 1 year. 



Summary of Factors Affecting the Species 



The following information is a summary and discussion of the five factors or listing criteria as set forth in section
4(a)(1) of the Act and regulations (50 CFR part 424) promulgated to implement the listing provisions of the Act and
their applicability to the current status of the Rocky Mountain capshell. 



A. The Present or Threatened Destruction, Modification, or Curtailment of Its Habitat or Range 



The Peterson Lake, Colorado, population may be nearly extirpated and a survey in June found only three live specimens
and one empty shell after 12 hours of intensive searching (Clarke 1992a). Subsequent surveys found a few more individuals,
some were at deeper depths than found previously (Pioneer Environmental Services 1993; G. Hopkins, Pioneer Environmental
Services, 

in litt.,

 1993). 

Activities which might have caused the decline of the population in Peterson Lake include road maintenance (salting/sanding
and grading), ski resort activities (water depletion and treated waste water discharge into the lake), landscaping,
mining, lake drawdowns, and dam raising which resulted in the subsequent flooding of the enlarged lake basin. Since
the present management of Eldora Mountain Resort took over operation of the ski area in 1991, the water quality of the
lake has improved. Present information indicates that the species may again be increasing due to an improvement in
the water quality of the lake. Future surveys will be necessary to verify this. 
 
Aside from the population at Peterson Lake, none of the other 13 remaining populations are thought to be significantly
impacted by the present or threatened destruction, modification, or curtailment of habitat. 



B. Overutilization for Commercial, Recreational, Scientific, or Educational Purposes 



Some of the lakes inhabited by the Rocky Mountain capshell receive fishing, camping, and swimming activities, but
this factor is not thought to be a threat to the continued existence of the Rocky Mountain capshell. 



C. Disease or Predation 



The introduction of trout may have been one of the factors that contributed to the decline of the Rocky Mountain capshell
in Peterson Lake. Aside from this population, disease or predation is presently not a threat to any of the other 13 Rocky
Mountain capshell populations.

<TEXT>
 

D. The Inadequacy of Existing Regulatory Mechanisms


The Service believes that the four newly discovered populations in Colorado are safe from human impacts since they
occur on National Park Service and U.S. Forest Service lands.
The population in Glacier National Park is protected by Park Service regulations. With the exception of the one or
two populations within Jasper National Park, the Canadian populations apparently do not have any regulatory protection.
The lack of regulatory mechanisms is not known to be a threat at this time, but could change at some point in the future.


E. Other Natural or Manmade Factors Affecting Its Continued Existence


At Peterson Lake, severe drought coupled with the winter water drawdown form the lake by Eldora Ski Resort, has on occasion
lowered the water level dramatically. These events have exposed the Rocky Mountain capshell to dehydration and freezing
conditions. In 1979, the existing access road adjacent to Peterson Lake was paved. This expedited runoff, thus increased
the natural sedimentation process plus adding an influx of possible salt and sand contaminants into the lake.
When the 90-day finding was made, the Service believed that the two populations in Jasper National Park had been extirpated
due to the lakes they inhabited being poisoned. However, new information has shown that neither lake was poisoned.
The Rocky Mountain capshell population in Peterson Lake may be threatened by natural or manmade factors, but none
of the other 13 known populations are thought to be threatened by any of these factors.


Finding


Emergency listing is allowed under the Act whenever immediate protection is needed to prevent extirpation of a species.
For an invertebrate species, endangerment must be considered throughout the range of the species rather than for
a single population.
Considering information previously discussed in this notice, only the Peterson Lake population of the 14 known Rocky
Mountain capshell populations is thought to be subject to possible endangerment or extinction in the foreseeable
future. Also, in less than one year's time, the number of reported populations increased from 7 to 14. Since little
is known about the biology, ecology, and distribution of the Rocky Mountain capshell, and since recently discovered
populations in Colorado, Alberta, and British Columbia point to a wider geographical distribution than previously
thought, the Service believes that additional populations exist in suitable habitat in the United States and in Canada.
After reviewing the petition, accompanying documentation, references cited therein, and research findings, the
Service concludes that the petition requesting that the Rocky Mountain capshell be listed as an endangered species
on an emergency basis throughout its range is not warranted. The petitioners also requested that critical habitat
be designated. In the future, if a warranted finding is made for the species, then designation of critical habitat
would be addressed in the subsequent proposed rule. After arriving at the not warranted finding, the Service changed
the species' candidate status from category 2 to category 3C.
The Service's 12-month finding contains more detailed information regarding the above decisions. A copy may be obtained
from the Service's Golden office (see

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Fish and Wildlife Service (hereinafter the Service) is proposing to establish the 1994-95 early-season
hunting regulations for certain migratory game birds. The Service annually prescribes frameworks, or outer limits,
for dates and times when hunting may occur and the maximum number of birds that may be taken and possessed in early seasons.
These frameworks are necessary to allow State selections of final seasons and limits and to allow recreational harvest
at levels compatible with population status and habitat conditions.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 



Regulations Schedule for 1994



On April 7, 1994, the Service published for public comment in the 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 16762) a proposal to amend 50 CFR part 20, with comment periods ending as noted earlier. On June 8, 1994, the Service
published for public comment a second document (59 FR 29700) which provided supplemental proposals for early- and
late-season migratory bird hunting regulations frameworks.

On June 23, 1994, a public hearing was held in Washington, DC, as announced in the April 7 and June 8 

Federal Registers

 to review the status of migratory shore and upland game birds. Proposed hunting regulations were discussed for these
species and for other early seasons.

This document is the third in a series of proposed, supplemental, and final rulemaking documents for migratory bird
hunting regulations and deals specifically with proposed frameworks for early-season regulations. It will lead
to final frameworks from which States may select season dates, shooting hours, and daily bag and possession limits
for the 1994-95 season. All pertinent comments received through June 23, 1994, have been considered in developing
this document. In addition, new proposals for certain early-season regulations are provided for public comment.
Comment periods are specified above under 

DATES

. Final regulatory frameworks for early seasons are scheduled for publication in the 

Federal Register

 on or about August 16, 1994.

This supplemental proposed rulemaking consolidates further changes in the original framework proposals published
in the April 7 

Federal Register

. The regulations for early waterfowl hunting seasons proposed in this document are based on the most current information
available about the status of waterfowl populations and habitat conditions on the breeding grounds.



Presentations at Public Hearing



Four Service employees presented reports on the status of various migratory bird species for which early hunting
seasons are being proposed. These reports are briefly reviewed as a matter of public information. 

Dr. John Bruggink, Woodcock Specialist, reported on the 1994 status of American woodcock. Age-ratio information
from harvested woodcock indicated that the 1993 recruitment index (ratio of immatures to adult females) was 23.5
percent below the long-term average in the Eastern Region and 11.8 percent lower than the long-term average in the
Central Region. Daily hunting success in the Eastern Region decreased from 2.0 woodcock bagged per hunter in 1992
to 1.9 woodcock bagged per hunter in 1993 (-5 percent). The seasonal-hunting-success index decreased from
9.7 to 7.0 woodcock per hunter (-27.8 percent). In the Central Region, the daily-success index decreased from
2.4 birds per hunter in 1992 to 2.3 birds per hunter in 1993 (-4.2 percent), and the seasonal success index decreased
from 11.7 to 11.0 woodcock bagged per hunter (-6 percent). Analysis of data from the Singing-ground Survey indicated
that the number of woodcock declined between 1993 and 1994 in the Eastern and Central Regions. Ten-year (1985-94)
trends from the Singing-ground Survey also indicated declining populations. Since 1968, breeding population indices
declined 1.9 percent per year in the Eastern Region and 1.1 percent per year in the Central Region. 

Mr. David Dolton, Dove Specialist, presented the status of mourning doves in 1994. The report summarized call-count
information gathered over the past 29 years. Trends were calculated for the most recent 10-year interval and
for the entire 29-year period. Between 1993 and 1994, the average number of doves heard per route did not significantly
change in any of the 3 management units. No significant trend was found in doves heard in the Eastern or Central Units
for either the 10- or 29-year time frames. In the Western Unit, no trend was evident over the most recent
10 years, but there has been a significant decline over the past 29 years. Trends for doves seen at the unit level over
the 10- and 29-year periods agreed with trends for doves heard.

Mr. Dolton also presented the status of western white-winged doves in Arizona. Whitewing populations declined rapidly
in the 1970's, and have since remained relatively stable at a reduced level. In 1993, the Arizona whitewing harvest
of 91,000 birds declined 3.7 percent from the harvest in 1992 and was 30 percent below the 1980-89 mean. The 1994
whitewing call-count survey indicated an 18 percent decrease from 1993.

Mr. Dolton then reported on the status of eastern white-winged doves and white-tipped doves in Texas. Results of the
1994 whitewing call-count survey indicated that 615,000 birds were nesting in the Lower Rio Grande Valley in Starr,
Hidalgo, Cameron, and Willacy Counties. This estimate represents a 40 percent increase from 1993 and is 22 percent
above the 33-year average of 501,000. In upper south Texas, more than 577,000 whitewings were nesting throughout
a 19-county area. This is a 20 percent increase over last year's population and marks the sixth year of a population
expansion in this portion of the State. West Texas supports a small population of whitewings. The 1994 estimate of
17,000 birds was 10 percent below the 1993 estimate. For white-tipped doves, an average of 0.78 birds were heard per
stop in both brush and citrus locations in 1994. This is 30 percent below the 1993 level. 
 
Finally, Mr. Dolton presented population and harvest information for band-tailed pigeons. This species is managed
as two separate populations: the Coastal Population (California, Nevada, Oregon, and Washington) and the Four-Corners
or Interior Population (Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico and Utah). For the Coastal Population, the Breeding Bird Survey
(BBS) indicated a significant decline between 1968 and 1993. However, the population apparently has stabilized
in the 9 years from 1985 to 1993. Mineral-spring counts conducted in Oregon suggest that bandtails experienced a precipitous
decline in 1973 and again in 1985. Since 1985, these counts indicate that the population has been increasing gradually,
but it remains at a lower level than during the 1970's. The 1993 count decreased 1.6 percent from 1992. Washington's
call-count survey yielded a 1993 index 44 percent above that of 1992, although this change was not statistically significant.
Two indirect population estimates in 1992 suggested that the population ranged between 2.4 and 3.1 million birds.
The estimated harvest in 1993 was 6,000 birds in California and 3,200 in Oregon. Washington did not have a bandtail
season in 1993.

In the Four-Corners area, BBS data indicated a stable population between 1968 and 1993. The combined harvest for all
four States in 1993 was 828 birds. This was a decrease of 60 percent from more than 2,000 bandtails harvested in 1992.

Dr. Jim Dubovsky, Waterfowl Specialist, presented information on 1994 habitat conditions for waterfowl and preliminary
estimates of blue-winged teal abundance and harvests. A video was shown depicting wetland and upland conditions
in the Dakotas and the Prairie Provinces of Canada. Generally, nesting conditions were favorable throughout most
of the survey area, with abundant wetlands and improved upland cover. Biologists in several regions stated that conditions
were the best they have observed since the 1970's. There were approximately 6 million ponds in Prairie Canada and the
northcentral U.S. This estimate is significantly greater than the estimate for 1993 and the long-term average.

The 1994 May breeding population survey yielded an estimate of 4.6 million blue-winged teal, 45 percent higher than
the 1993 estimate of 3.2 million. The 1994 estimate was also 14 percent above the long-term average. The estimated
harvest of blue-winged teal during the 1993 September teal season was approximately 134,000 birds, 30 percent below
the outcome of the 1992 teal season. The combined September and regular-season harvest of all teal was approximately
1.03 million, 42 percent below the 1985-87 average. Harvest rates of blue-winged teal remained low during 1993-94
and were not different from those of last year or the 1985-87 period.

Mr. David Sharp, Central Flyway Representative, reported on the status and harvests of sandhill cranes. The Mid-Continent
Population appears to have stabilized following dramatic increases in the early 1980's. The preliminary 1994 spring
index for the Central Platte River Valley, uncorrected for visibility, was about 384,850. This index is 52 percent
larger than the 1993 index of 253,800. The photo-corrected 3-year average for the 1991-93 period was 375,300,
which is within the established population-objective range of 343,000-465,000 cranes. All Central Flyway
States, except Nebraska, elected to allow crane hunting in portions of their respective States in 1993-94;
about 19,000 permits were issued and approximately 7,200 permittees hunted one or more times. Compared to the previous
year's seasons, the number of permittees increased about 10 percent and active hunters increased 35 percent. About
19,000 cranes were harvested in 1993-94, a 53 percent increase from the 12,433 harvested in 1992-93. In
Canada, the retrieved harvest fell (51%) from 5,600 in the 1992-93 seasons to 2,800 in the 1993-94 seasons.
Also, Mid-Continent cranes are hunted in Alaska and Mexico. Data for these areas are not yet available, but the combined
harvest should not exceed 3,500 during the 1993-94 seasons. The total North American sport harvest was estimated
to be about 30,200 cranes, which is near (-5%) the record high reported in the 1990-91 seasons (31,700),
and only the second time the total has exceeded the 30,000 level.

Annual surveys of the Rocky Mountain Population, which migrates through the San Luis Valley of Colorado in March,
suggest that the population has been relatively stable since 1984. The 1994 index of 17,214 cranes (uncorrected for
visibility bias) was near the established objective range of 18,000-22,000. Limited special seasons were
held during 1993 in portions of Arizona, Montana, New Mexico, Utah, and Wyoming, and resulted in an estimated harvest
of 704 cranes. 






Comments Received at Public Hearing



Mr. Charles D. Kelley, representing the Southeastern Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies, reiterated the
request made by a majority of States in the Southeast to prohibit dove hunting over top-sown wheat and urged the Service
to include this prohibition in its final revision of the Code of Federal Regulations (50 CFR). He also expressed opposition
to the proposed inclusion of wounded birds in the daily bag limit. 

Mr. Ron Stromstad, representing the Central Flyway Council and the North Dakota Game and Fish Department, stated
that he appreciated the work of the Service Regulations Committee in developing this year's annual hunting-season
proposals. He indicated that the Central Flyway Council looked forward to working with the recently established
Mid-Continent Population Sandhill Crane Working Group to revise the harvest strategy for this population. He supported
the Central Flyway Council's recommendations regarding the conduct of September teal seasons and emphasized that
evaluation of any proposed changes to these seasons should be undertaken on a flyway basis. He supported the Texas
request for dove hunting during 3 time periods in the Central and Southern Zones. He appreciated the proposed change
in the aggregate bag limit for white-winged doves from 2 to 6 in the Lower Rio Grande Valley. He noted that over the past
3 years, whitewings have expanded their range and populations have grown significantly. In the Rio Grande Valley,
numbers are now well above average. With regard to the proposed revision of 50 CFR, he encouraged the Service to proceed
slowly in the development of the proposed rule and suggested that the Service continue to work closely with the States.
He supported the recommendations from the other Flyway Councils, with the exception of the proposed changes in the
woodcock season in Tennessee. He emphasized that the record should clearly indicate that the Conservation Reserve
Program, administered by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, is providing secure nesting habitats for grassland-nesting
migratory birds. Improved water conditions on the prairies, coupled with the millions of acres of secure nesting
cover, will undoubtedly have a significant beneficial effect on this year's recruitment of nesting birds in the northcentral
States.






Written Comments Received



The preliminary proposed rulemaking, which appeared in the April 7 

Federal Register

, opened the public comment period for migratory game bird hunting regulations. As of June 23, 1994, the Service had
received 22 comments; 6 of these specifically addressed early-season issues. These early-season comments are summarized
below and numbered in the order used in the April 7 

Federal Register

. Only the numbered items pertaining to early seasons for which written comments were received are included. The Service
received recommendations from all four Flyway Councils. Some recommendations supported continuation of last year's
frameworks. Due to the comprehensive nature of the annual review of the frameworks performed by the Councils, support
for continuation of last year's frameworks is also assumed for items for which no recommendations were received.
Council recommendations for changes in the frameworks are summarized below.






General





Written Comments:

 An individual from Minnesota expressed concern that the Service is de-emphasizing waterfowl in terms of habitat,
predator control, enforcement of regulations, and support for the North American Waterfowl Management Plan. He
noted that waterfowl hunters help pay for management programs through purchase of ``duck stamps,'' excise taxes,
and donations to private conservation organizations.







1. Ducks 
 


The categories used to discuss issues related to duck harvest management are as follows: (A) General Harvest Strategy,
(B) Framework Dates, (C) Season Length, (D) Closed Seasons, (E) Bag Limits, (F) Zones and Split Seasons, and (G) Special
Seasons/Species Management. Only those categories containing substantial recommendations are included below.



G. Special Seasons/Species Management



i. September Teal Seasons



In the April 9, 1993, 

Federal Register

 (58 FR 37830), the Service reiterated that, consistent with the strategy for the use of shooting hours developed by
the Service in 1990, shooting hours will begin at sunrise unless States can demonstrate that the impact of presunrise
shooting hours on nontarget duck species is negligible. States will be allowed to continue presunrise shooting hours
during their September seasons under the condition that they conduct studies or provide information that demonstrates
a negligible impact on nontarget duck species during the one-half hour period prior to sunrise. Three States in the
Mississippi Flyway (Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana) and five in the Central Flyway (Colorado, Oklahoma, Texas,
Kansas, and New Mexico) conducted hunter observations during the 1993 September teal season that demonstrated that
the attempted harvest of non-target species was no different between pre- and post-sunrise periods.



Council Recommendations:

 The Central Flyway Council recommended that September teal season shooting hours begin one-half hour before sunrise
to sunset without further evaluation for all non-production Central Flyway States.

The Central Flyway Council recommended that the Service review the guidelines for establishing a September teal
season for any new requests for seasons.

The Upper-Region and Lower-Region Regulations Committees of the Mississippi Flyway Council recommended that Michigan
be permitted to hold an experimental September teal season in southeastern portions of the State.

The Lower-Region Regulations Committee of the Mississippi Flyway Council requested that September teal season
shooting hours beginning one-half hour before sunrise be made operational and that no further evaluation of shooting
hours be required.



Written Comments:

 An individual representing a group of duck hunters from Wisconsin expressed concern that some States with a September
teal season are allowed shooting hours that begin one-half hour before sunrise. He believes that hunters are unable
to identify ducks and that most crippling loss occurs prior to sunrise.
 
The Michigan Department of Natural Resources requested that Michigan be allowed to conduct a teal season in areas
where teal concentrate. They proposed limiting the season to no more than 2,000 hunters and believed that hunters'
skills at identifying waterfowl are better now than they were during initial evaluations of teal seasons in the 1960's.
Four individuals from Michigan supported the proposed September teal season for portions of Michigan.



ii. September Duck Seasons



A cooperative Wood Duck Initiative undertaken by the Service and the Atlantic and Mississippi Flyway Councils in
1991 is designed to improve banding programs and evaluate techniques for obtaining estimates of breeding population
size and production. The Service does not propose to discontinue the September wood duck/teal seasons in Kentucky,
Tennessee, and Florida or expand seasons elsewhere until this initiative has been completed. Furthermore, the Service
requests an updated report on these seasons for Kentucky, Tennessee, and Florida, by February 1, 1995. These reports
should contain wood duck recovery and survival rates, harvest, and the derivation of banded birds harvested during
these seasons. 

The Service has published a strategy concerning shooting hours which indicates that during species-specific duck
seasons, shooting hours will begin at sunrise unless States can demonstrate that the impact of presunrise shooting
hours on nontarget duck species is negligible. The Service received information from Kentucky, Tennessee, and Florida
regarding the effect of presunrise shooting hours. This information was deemed sufficient to demonstrate a negligible
impact of presunrise shooting hours on nontarget duck species during seasons directed at both teal and wood ducks.
Therefore, Florida, Kentucky, and Tennessee will be allowed to continue presunrise shooting hours during their
September seasons without further evaluation.



Council Recommendations:

 The Upper-Region and Lower-Region Regulations Committees of the Mississippi Flyway Council recommended that Iowa
be permitted to hold a portion of their regular duck season in September to increase harvest opportunity on blue-winged
teal.



Written Comments:

 One individual and a petition with 467 signatures requested nine additional days of duck hunting in Wisconsin. The
request notes that the efforts of duck hunters, the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources, Ducks Unlimited,
and various sportsmen's organizations have resulted in record levels of duck production. The additional nine days
of duck hunting would make Wisconsin's season equal in length to certain other States in the Mississippi Flyway that
are permitted a September teal season.




 

3. Sea Ducks



Since 1992, the Service has expressed its concern about the status of sea ducks and the potential impact that increased
hunting activity could have on these species. In 1993, the Service reduced bag limits on scoters from 7 to 4 within an
overall 7-bird sea duck limit. Although data needed to monitor these species remain less than satisfactory,
the Service reiterates its request that the Flyway Councils continue to review the status of sea ducks and complete
management plans. States are asked to participate in improving population surveys, harvest estimates, and production
indices. 



4. Canada Geese



A. Special Seasons





Council Recommendations:

 The Atlantic Flyway Council recommended that West Virginia be permitted to initiate a 3-year experimental resident
Canada goose season during September 1-15.

The Atlantic Flyway Council recommended modifications to hunt zones for September seasons on resident Canada geese
in Maryland, North Carolina, Pennsylvania (Northwestern and Southeastern Zones), and Virginia. These proposed
changes would be experimental.

The Upper-Region Regulations Committee of the Mississippi Flyway Council made the following recommendations pertaining
to special Canada goose seasons:

In Indiana, expand the September season hunting area to Statewide with a September 1-15 framework. The proposed
changes would not be experimental.

In Michigan, extend the seasons in the northern Lower Peninsula and Upper Peninsula for 2 additional years and expand
the zone in the Upper Peninsula to approximately the eastern half of the Peninsula; change the season length in the
southern part of the Lower Peninsula from 10 to 15 days (September 1-15) for 3 years and include the southern portions
of Tuscola and Huron Counties. The proposed changes would be experimental.

In Minnesota, expand the Fergus Falls/Alexandria Zone and extend the framework for the 10-day season to September
1-16 for 3 years. The proposed changes would be experimental.

In Ohio, expand the September-season hunting area to Statewide with a September 1-15 framework. The proposed
changes would not be experimental.

In Wisconsin, enlarge the size of the Southeastern Wisconsin Zone and continue as a special season with a September
1-13 framework. The proposed changes would not be experimental.
 
The Lower-Region Regulations Committee of the Mississippi Flyway Council requested that the Service closely monitor
all Canada goose seasons and fully analyze data from existing special or experimental seasons before expanding seasons
that cumulatively might increase harvest of the Southern James Bay Population. Also, current special seasons should
adhere to present criteria designed by the Service.

The Lower-Region Regulations Committee of the Mississippi Flyway Council also requested that a 3-year experimental,
10-day September Canada goose season be permitted in the eastern portion of Tennessee.



B. Regular Seasons 





Council Recommendations:

 The Upper-Region Regulations Committee of the Mississippi Flyway Council recommended that the early-season frameworks
provide for the opening of regular goose seasons in Wisconsin and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan as early as September
24.

The Lower-Region Regulations Committee of the Mississippi Flyway Council requested that the Service closely monitor
all Canada goose seasons and fully analyze data from existing special or experimental seasons before expanding seasons
that cumulatively might increase harvest of the Southern James Bay Population of Canada geese.

The Pacific Flyway Council seeks a limited resumption of cackling Canada goose hunting throughout their range and
recommends that the Service provide an expedited review of their recommended changes in cackling Canada goose regulations
for impacts on Aleutian Canada geese under the Section 7 consultation process.



Written Comments:

 The Michigan Department of Natural Resources believes that regular goose seasons should be allowed to open as early
as September 24 in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. They noted that significant numbers of migrant geese begin arriving
in the Upper Peninsula during September 20-24 in most years. They anticipate that harvest in this region would
remain small compared to the rest of the State. They also believe that nearly all Canada geese harvested in this region
are of the giant subspecies or the Mississippi Valley Population. Finally, they noted that allowing a September 24
opening would provide equitable hunting opportunity compared to other areas because most geese leave this region
by early November.

The Association of Village Council Presidents, representing Native American interests in the Yukon-Kuskokwim
Delta area, supported modest liberalizations of white-fronted goose seasons in Alaska and Washington. However,
they did not support further liberlizations in Oregon or California, noting that liberalizations occurred during
each of the preceding years and that it was difficult to measure the effects of these incremental changes. 





9. Sandhill Cranes



In 1993, the Central and Pacific Flyways completed a revision of the Cooperative Management Plan for the Mid-Continent
Population of sandhill cranes. This revision established a goal of a stable population at levels observed during
the 1982-92 period and removed the harvest threshold (25,000) that had been in place since 1981. The Service
believes that future management actions for Mid-Continent cranes should be based on the recognition of biologically
discrete subpopulations, which would necessitate the development of data collection efforts at the subspecies
level. In the April 9, 1993, 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 16765), the Service reiterated its concern that overall harvest levels should not be increased and that there
should be no increase or shift in harvest toward the Gulf Coast Subpopulation or to the greater sandhill crane component.



Council Recommendations:

 The Central Flyway Council recommended no changes in the Federal frameworks for the hunting of Mid-Continent cranes
during the 1994-95 seasons.



Written Comments:

 The Texas Parks and Wildlife Department responded to statements in the April 7, 1994, 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 16765) that indicated that there should be no increase or shift in crane harvest toward the Gulf Coast Subpopulation
of Mid-Continent Sandhill Cranes and especially the greater sandhill crane component. They noted that the Central
Flyway Council did not propose any framework changes for the 1994-95 seasons and asked for clarification of
the reasons for this concern, especially since the population remains stable. In this regard, they suggested that
the Service provide a harvest objective, rationale and method of evaluation of any harvest reduction proposed. Furthermore,
the appropriate level of management should be clearly identified, i.e. population, subpopulation, or subspecies
level. Biologists working in Texas support management at the population or subpopulation level. They indicated
that zoning for the hunting of cranes could not be attempted until these issues had been resolved.






14. Woodcock



The Service is concerned about the gradual long-term declines in woodcock populations in both the Eastern and Central
Management Regions. Although habitat changes appear to be the primary factor in the declines, adjustment of harvest
opportunities may be appropriate in light of current population trends. The Service and Flyway Councils should review
the status of woodcock and cooperatively develop a harvest-management strategy.



Council Recommendations:

 The Lower-Region Regulations Committee of the Mississippi Flyway Council requested that Tennessee be allowed to
divide the State into 2 zones (East and West) for woodcock hunting.






16. Mourning Doves





Council Recommendations:

 The Central Flyway Council recommended that Texas be allowed an increase in the number of segments from 2 to 3 in 2 of
the 3 mourning dove hunting zones now offered to Texas.






17. White-winged and White-tipped doves



In the August 23, 1993, Federal Register (58 FR 44581), the Service stated that with continued improvement in the whitewing
population in the Lower Rio Grande Valley of Texas, serious consideration would be given to a request to increase the
number of whitewings in the aggregate bag limit in the special white-winged dove area in 1994 from 2 to 6 during the regular
mourning dove season.



Council Recommendations:

 The Central Flyway Council recommended that the number of white-winged doves allowed in the 12-bird aggregate bag
limit during the mourning dove season be increased from 2 to 6 in the Texas Counties of Cameron, Hidalgo, Starr, and
Willacy.






18. Alaska



The Service proposed in the April 9, 1993, 

Federal Register

 (58 FR 19008-19012) to manage the harvest of canvasbacks based on a single, continental breeding population. The
Service does not envision that full-season bag limits of 2 canvasbacks per day could be offered nationwide in the foreseeable
future. Therefore, the Service proposes to reduce the bag limit in Alaska from 2 to 1 canvasback per day.



Council Recommendations:

 The Pacific Flyway Council recommended that Alaska be allowed no more than 1 Canada goose in the daily bag for Unit 9E
and the western portions of Unit 18. 

The Pacific Flyway Council recommended that the Statewide closure on cackling Canada geese be removed.

The Pacific Flyway Council recommended removal of restrictive bag limits for white-fronted geese in Units 1-9
and 14-18 in Alaska. The goose limit will be 6 daily and 12 in possession, of which no more than 4 daily and 8 in possession
could be any combination of Canada or white-fronted geese.



Written Comments:

 The Association of Village Council Presidents, representing Native American interests in the Yukon-Kuskokwim
Delta area, supported modest liberalizations of white-fronted goose seasons in Alaska and Washington.



Public Comment Invited 



Based on the results of migratory game bird studies now in progress and having due consideration for any data or views
submitted by interested parties, the possible amendments resulting from this supplemental rulemaking will specify
open seasons, shooting hours, and bag and possession limits for designated migratory game birds in the United States.

The Service intends that adopted final rules be as responsive as possible to all concerned interests, and therefore
solicits the comments and suggestions of the public, other concerned governmental agencies, and private interests
on these proposals. Such comments, and any additional information received, may lead to final regulations that differ
from these proposals.

Special circumstances are involved in the establishment of these regulations which limit the amount of time that
the Service can allow for public comment. Specifically, two considerations compress the time in which the rulemaking
process must operate: (1) the need to establish final rules at a point early enough in the summer to allow affected State
agencies to appropriately adjust their licensing and regulatory mechanisms; and (2) the unavailability before
mid-June of specific, reliable data on this year's status of some waterfowl and migratory shore and upland game bird
populations. Therefore, the Service believes that to allow comment periods past the dates specified is contrary
to the public interest.



Comment Procedure



It is the policy of the Department of the Interior, whenever practical, to afford the public an opportunity to participate
in the rulemaking process. Accordingly, interested persons may participate by submitting written comments to the
Chief, Office of Migratory Bird Management, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, room 634, Arlington Square, Washington,
DC 20240. Comments received will be available for public inspection during normal business hours at the Service's
office in room 634, Arlington Square Building, 4401 N. Fairfax Drive, Arlington, Virginia. All relevant comments
received during the comment period will be considered. The Service will attempt to acknowledge comments received,
but substantive responses to individual comments may not be provided.



NEPA Consideration



NEPA considerations are covered by the programmatic document, ``Final Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement:
Issuance of Annual Regulations Permitting the Sport Hunting of Migratory Birds'' (FSES 88-14), filed with EPA on
June 9, 1988. Notice of Availability was published in the 

Federal Register

 on June 16, 1988 (53 FR 22582). The Service's Record of Decision was published on August 18, 1988 (53 FR 31341). Copies
of these documents are available from the Service at the address indicated under the caption 

ADDRESSES.





Endangered Species Act Consideration



The Division of Endangered Species is completing a biological opinion on the proposed action. As in the past, hunting
regulations this year will be designed, among other things, to remove or alleviate chances of conflict between seasons
for migratory game birds and the protection and conservation of endangered and threatened species. The Service's
biological opinions resulting from consultations under Section 7 are considered public documents and are available
for inspection in the Division of Endangered Species (room 432) and the Office of Migratory Bird Management (room
634), Arlington Square Building, 4401 N. Fairfax Drive, Arlington, Virginia.






Regulatory Flexibility Act; Executive Order (E.O.) 12866 and the Paperwork Reduction Act



In the 

Federal Register

 dated April 7, 1994 (59 FR 16762), the Service reported measures it had undertaken to comply with requirements of the
Regulatory Flexibility Act and the Executive Order. These included preparing an Analysis of Regulatory Effects
and an updated Final Regulatory Impact Analysis, under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq), and publication
of a summary of the latter. This information is included in the present document by reference. This action was not subject
to review by the Office of Management and Budget under E.O. 12866. This rule does not contain any information collection
requiring approval by the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3504.

Proposed Regulations Frameworks for 1994-95 Early Hunting Seasons on Certain Migratory Game Birds



Pursuant to the Migratory Bird Treaty Act and delegated authorities, the Director approved the following proposed
frameworks which prescribe season lengths, bag limits, shooting hours, and outside dates within which States may
select seasons for certain migratory game birds between September 1, 1994, and March 10, 1995.






General





Dates:

 All outside dates noted below are inclusive.



Shooting and Hawking (taking by falconry) Hours:

 Unless otherwise specified, from one-half hour before sunrise to sunset daily.



Possession Limits:

 Unless otherwise specified, possession limits are twice the daily bag limit.



Area, Zone, and Unit Descriptions:

 Geographic descriptions that differ from those published in the August 23, 1993, 

Federal Register

 (58 FR 44576) are contained in a later portion of this document.




 

Special September Teal Season





Outside Dates:

 Between September 1 and September 30, an open season on all species of teal may be selected by Alabama, Arkansas, Colorado
(Central Flyway portion only), Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, New Mexico
(Central Flyway portion only), Ohio, Oklahoma, Tennessee, and Texas in areas delineated by State regulations.



Hunting Seasons and Daily Bag Limits:

 Not to exceed 9 consecutive days, with a daily bag limit of 4 teal.



Shooting Hours:

 One-half hour before sunrise to sunset, except in Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Missouri, and Ohio, where the hours
are from sunrise to sunset.






Special September Duck Seasons



Florida: An experimental 5-consecutive-day season may be selected in September. The daily bag limit may not exceed
4 teal and wood ducks in the aggregate.

Kentucky and Tennessee: In lieu of a special September teal season, an experimental 5-consecutive-day season may
be selected in September. The daily bag limit may not exceed 4 teal and wood ducks in the aggregate, of which no more than
2 may be wood ducks.

Iowa: Iowa may hold up to 5 days of its regular duck hunting season in September. All ducks which are legal during the
regular duck season may be taken during the September segment of the season. The September season segment may commence
no earlier than the Saturday nearest September 20 (September 17, 1994), with daily bag and possession limits being
the same as those in effect during the 1994 regular duck season. The remainder of the regular duck season may not begin
before October 15.






Scoter, Eider, and Oldsquaw Ducks (Atlantic Flyway) 





Outside Dates:

 Between September 15 and January 20.



Hunting Seasons and Daily Bag Limits:

 Not to exceed 107 days, with a daily bag limit of 7, singly or in the aggregate of the listed sea-duck species, of which
no more than 4 may be scoters.



Daily Bag Limits During the Regular Duck Season:

 Within the special sea duck areas, during the regular duck season in the Atlantic Flyway, States may choose to allow
the above sea duck limits in addition to the limits applying to other ducks during the regular duck season. In all other
areas, sea ducks may be taken only during the regular open season for ducks and must be included in the regular duck season
daily bag and possession limits.



Areas:

 In all coastal waters and all waters of rivers and streams seaward from the first upstream bridge in Maine, New Hampshire,
Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, and New York; in any waters of the Atlantic Ocean and in any tidal waters
of any bay which are separated by at least 1 mile of open water from any shore, island, and emergent vegetation in New
Jersey, South Carolina, and Georgia; and in any waters of the Atlantic Ocean and in any tidal waters of any bay which
are separated by at least 800 yards of open water from any shore, island, and emergent vegetation in Delaware, Maryland,
North Carolina and Virginia; and provided that any such areas have been described, delineated, and designated as
special sea-duck hunting areas under the hunting regulations adopted by the respective States.






Special Early Canada Goose Seasons



Atlantic Flyway





Hunting Seasons:

 Experimental Canada goose seasons may be selected by Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina,
Pennsylvania, Virginia, and West Virginia. Areas open to the hunting of Canada geese must be described, delineated,

Sale of Lumber and Other Forest Products Produced by Indian Enterprises From the Forests on Indian Reservations


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Bureau of Indian Affairs, Interior.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) is proposing to delete regulations which govern the terms and conditions under
which forest products produced by Indian tribal forest enterprises from the forests of Indian Reservations may be
sold. The BIA is proposing to delete these regulations because the ``General Forest Regulations,'' prescribe a similar
policy for sales of Indian forest products in the section, ``Indian Tribal Forest Enterprise Operations.'' Therefore,
the proposed deletion is necessary to eliminate redundancy and potential confusion in forestry program regulations.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 This action, deleting 25 CFR part 164, results from the BIA's need to eliminate the redundancy and potential confusion
arising from having two regulations governing the same operation in the 25 CFR Indian forestry program regulations.
The BIA recognizes that provisions in  163.13 of the revision of 25 CFR part 163, ``General Forest Regulations,''
are adequate to govern the sale of Indian forest products and, as a result, that 25 CFR part 164 is no longer needed.

The policy of the Department of the Interior is, whenever practical, to afford the public an opportunity to participate
in the rulemaking process. Accordingly, interested persons may submit written comments regarding the proposed
rule to the locations identified in the addresses section of this document.
This rule is not considered a significant regulatory action under the criteria of Executive Order 12866. Therefore,
review by the Office of Management and Budget is not required prior to publication in the 

Federal Register

.
This rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the Regulatory
Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.) because the sale of lumber and forest products produced by Indian enterprises
will be conducted as in the past.
The Department of the Interior has determined that this proposed rule does not constitute a major Federal action significantly
affecting the quality of the human environment and that no detailed statement is required pursuant to the National
Environmental Policy Act of 1969.
The Department has certified to the Office of Management and Budget that these proposed regulations meet the applicable
standards provided in Sections 2(a) and 2(b)(2) of Executive Order 12778.

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) is proposing to delete regulations which govern the terms and conditions under
which forest products produced by the Red Lake Indian Mills may be sold. The BIA is proposing to delete these regulations
because the Red Lake Indian Mills no longer exists and the revision of the ``General Forest Regulations,'' prescribes
policy for the sale of forest products produced by other Indian forest product enterprises on the Red Lake Indian Reservation.
Therefore, this proposed deletion is necessary to eliminate redundancy and potential confusion in forestry program
regulations.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Deletion of 25 CFR part 165 will eliminate potential confusion because the Red Lake Indian Mills, which are the subject
of the regulation, no longer exist. This deletion also will eliminate a perceived redundancy because provisions
in  163.13 of the revision of 25 CFR part 163, ``General Forest Regulations,'' are adequate to govern the sale
of Indian forest products by Indian forest enterprises on the Red Lake Indian Reservation.


The policy of the Department of the Interior is, whenever practical, to afford the public an opportunity to participate

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The bald eagle (

Haliaeetus leucocephalus

) is listed as endangered under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (Act) in the lower 48 States, except Washington,
Oregon, Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan, where it is listed as threatened. The bald eagle also occurs in Alaska
and Canada, where it is not at risk and is not protected under the Act, and exists in small numbers in northern Mexico.
The Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) proposes to reclassify the bald eagle from endangered to threatened in the
lower 48 States except in certain portions of the American Southwest and to classify those eagles in adjacent Mexico
as endangered. The bald eagle would remain threatened in the five States where it is currently listed as threatened.
The special rule for threatened bald eagles would be revised. This action would not alter those conservation measures
already in force to protect the species and its habitats. The Service seeks comments from the public on this proposed
reclassification.

Background 



Literally translated, 

Haliaeetus leucocephalus

 means white-headed sea eagle. This large, powerful brown bird with a white head and tail is well known as our Nation's
symbol. Young bald eagles are mostly dark brown until they reach 4 to 6 years in age and may be confused with the golden
eagle (

Aquila chrysaetos

). The bald eagle is the only sea eagle regularly occurring on the North American continent (American Ornithologists'
Union 1983). Its range extends from central Alaska and Canada to northern Mexico. 

The bald eagle is a bird of aquatic ecosystems (Marshall and Nickerson 1976). It frequents estuaries, large lakes,
reservoirs, major rivers, and some seacoast habitats. However, such areas must have an adequate food base, perching
areas, and nesting sites meeting certain requirements to support bald eagles. In winter, bald eagles often congregate
at specific wintering sites that are generally close to open water and that offer good perch trees and night roosts.
Bald eagle habitats encompass both public and private lands. 

The bald eagle was first described in 1766 as 

Falco leucocephalus

 by Linnaeus. This South Carolina bird was later renamed as the southern bald eagle, subspecies 

Haliaeetus leucocephalus leucocephalus

 (Linnaeus), when, in 1897, Townsend identified the northern bald eagle as 

Haliaeetus leucocephalus alascanus

 (American Ornithologists' Union 1957). These two subspecific names were in use when the southern bald eagle (arbitrarily
declared to occur south of the 40th parallel) was listed (March 11, 1967; 32 FR 4001) as endangered under the Endangered
Species Protection Act of 1966 (16 U.S.C. 668aa-668cc). By the time the bald eagle was listed (February 14, 1978;
43 FR 6233) for the entire lower 48 States, the subspecies were no longer recognized by ornithologists. 

The bald eagle historically ranged throughout North America except extreme northern Alaska and Canada and central
and southern Mexico. Bald eagles nest on both coasts from Florida to Baja California, in the south, and from Labrador
to the western Aleutian Islands, Alaska, in the north (formerly to the Commander Islands, western Bering Sea). In
many of these areas they were abundant. 

Gerrard and Bortolotti (1988) describe early population trends. When Europeans first arrived on the North American
continent, there were an estimated quarter- to a half-million bald eagles. The first major decline in the bald eagle
population probably began in the mid to late 1800's. It coincided with declines in numbers of waterfowl and shorebirds
and other major prey species. Direct eagle killing was also prevalent, and, coupled with loss of nesting habitat,
these factors reduced bald eagle numbers until the 1940's. 

In 1940, the Bald Eagle Protection Act (16 U.S.C. 668) was passed. This law prohibits the take, possession, sale, purchase,
barter, offer to sell, purchase or barter, transport, export or import, of any bald eagle, alive or dead, including
any part, nest, or egg, unless allowed by permit; ``take'' includes pursue, shoot, shoot at, poison, wound, kill,
capture, trap, collect, or molest or disturb. 

The Bald Eagle Protection Act and increased public awareness of the bald eagle resulted in a partial recovery or a slower
decline of the species in most areas of the country. However, persecution continued, notably in Alaska, which was
exempted from the Bald Eagle Protection Act and maintained a bounty on bald eagles. In 1952, after lengthy studies
demonstrated that bald eagles were not affecting salmon numbers, Alaska was no longer exempted. 

Shortly after World War II, the use of dichloro-diphenyl-trichloroethane (DDT) and other organochlorine compounds
became widespread. Initially, DDT was sprayed extensively along coastal and other wetland areas to control mosquitos
(Carson 1962). Later it was used as a general insecticide. As DDT accumulated in individual bald eagles from ingesting
contaminated food, the species' reproduction plummeted. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, it was determined that
dichlorophenyl-dichloroethylene (DDE), the principal metabolite of DDT, accumulated in the fatty tissues of the
adult females and impaired calcium release for egg shell formation, thus inducing thin shells and reproductive failure.

In response to the decline following World War II, on March 11, 1967 (32 FR 4001), the Secretary of the Interior listed
bald eagles south of the 40th parallel as endangered under the Endangered Species Preservation Act of 1966. The northern
bald eagle was not included in that action primarily because the Alaskan and Canadian populations were not considered
endangered in 1967. On December 31, 1972, DDT was banned from use in the United States. 

In 1973, the Endangered Species Act (16 U.S.C. 1531 

et seq.

) was passed. Among other provisions, it allowed the listing of distinct populations of animal species and the addition
of a new category, ``threatened.'' The Act defines an endangered species as a species that is in danger of extinction
throughout all or a significant portion of its range. A threatened species is defined as any species that is likely
to become an endangered species (but is not in danger of extinction) throughout all or a significant portion of its
range. 

A nationwide bald eagle survey by the Service and a number of other agencies and conservation groups in 1974 revealed
that, in parts of the northern half of the lower 48 States, bald eagle populations and reproductive success were lower
than in certain southern areas. Thus, in 1978, the Service listed the bald eagle, 

Haliaeetus leucocephalus

 (no subspecies referenced) throughout the lower 48 States as endangered except in Michigan, Minnesota, Wisconsin,
Washington, and Oregon, where it was designated as threatened (February 14, 1978; 43 FR 6233). 

Restoring endangered and threatened animals and plants to the point where they are again viable, self-sustaining
members of their ecosystems is the main goal of the Endangered Species Act. Thus, the Act contains recovery as well
as listing and protection provisions. To effect recovery, section 4(f) of the Act provides for the development and
implementation of recovery plans for listed species. According to the Act, a recovery plan is a plan for the conservation
and survival of the species. It identifies, describes, and schedules the actions necessary to restore endangered
and threatened species to a more secure biological condition. 

In establishing a recovery program for the species in the mid-1970s, the Service divided the bald eagles of the lower
48 States into five recovery populations, based on geographic location, termed Recovery Regions. A recovery plan
was prepared for each population by separate recovery teams composed of species experts in each geographic area.
The teams set forth goals for recovery and identified tasks to achieve those goals. Coordination meetings were held
regularly among the five teams to exchange data and other information. The five recovery regions and the dates of their
approved recovery plans are as follows: Chesapeake Bay (1982, revised 1990); Pacific (1986); Southeastern (1984,
revised 1989); Northern States (1983); and Southwestern (1982). The last two plans are under active revision and
expected to be available for public review within the next 12 months. Many of the tasks described within these recovery
plans have been funded and carried out by the Service and other Federal, State, and private organizations. Annual
expenditures for the recovery and protection of the bald eagle by public and private agencies have exceeded $1 million
each year for the past decade (Service files). 

In the 16 years since it was listed throughout the conterminous 48 States, the bald eagle population has clearly improved.
The improvement is a direct result of the banning of DDT and other persistent organochlorines and from recovery efforts.
In 1963, a National Audubon Society survey reported only 417 active nests in the lower 48 States, with an average of
0.59 young produced per active nest. In 1993, about 4,000 occupied breeding areas were reported by the States with
an estimated average young per occupied territory of 0.93. Compared to 1974, for example, the number of occupied breeding
areas in the lower 48 States has increased by 408 percent, and since 1990, there has been a 32 percent increase. The species
is doubling its breeding population every 6-7 years since the late 1970s.

The Act requires periodic review of the status of listed species. The Service has reviewed the status of the bald eagle
and is proposing reclassification in all or portions of four Recovery Regions. The review recognized the achievement
of specific recovery plan reclassification goals. The biological basis for the recovery goals is described in each
recovery plan.

The recovery plans were first approved in the early 1980's. The five Recovery Regions are illustrated on the following
map:

A summary follows of each Recovery Region's reclassification and delisting goals, an estimation of progress to date
in achieving those goals, and proposed Service action. The terms ``occupied breeding areas'' and ``occupied territories''
are used interchangeably. Either term indicates that a pair of bald eagles has established a breeding territory and
a nest site but was not necessarily successful in producing young. All numbers are based upon known eagle nests and
not estimates; surveys, particularly those before the late 1970s, miss some pairs, so all counts are considered minimums.



Chesapeake Recovery Region



Threatened Goals: Sustaining 175-250 breeding pairs with a productivity level of 1.1 young per active nest,
concurrent with sustained progress in habitat protection measures.

Delisting Goals: Sustaining 300-400 pairs with an average productivity of 1.1 young per active nest over 5 years
with permanent protection of sufficient habitat to support this nesting population and enough roosting and foraging
habitat to support population levels commensurate with increases throughout the Atlantic coastal area.

Progress to Date: 329 reported occupied breeding areas and 1.12 young per occupied area in 1993. Progress in habitat
protection has been sustained and additional habitat is being protected. There have been in excess of 175 known occupied
breeding areas since 1988; 1992 was the first year in which there were more than 300. Threatened goals have been met,
delisting goals have not.

Service Proposal: Reclassify to threatened.



Northern Recovery Region



Threatened Goals: No goal for reclassification to threatened status in present plan.

Delisting Goals: 1,200 occupied breeding areas over a minimum of 16 States with an average annual productivity of
at least 1.0 young per occupied nest.

Progress to Date: In 1993, there were 1602 known occupied breeding areas distributed over 21 States with 0.95 young
per occupied breeding area. Productivity was 1.00 in 1990, 0.97 in 1991, and 1.01 in 1992. (Productivity estimates
exclude nest data from Minnesota and Wisconsin in 1992, and from Wisconsin in 1990 and 1991, because there were no productivity
surveys done in these States during those years.) Delisting goals have been met for occupied breeding areas and are
close to being met for productivity.

Service Proposal: Reclassify to threatened; the species would remain threatened where it now has that status. The
recovery plan describes the delisting goals as initial and tentative. The Northern States Bald Eagle Recovery Team
has reconvened for the purpose of reviewing the plan and revising the goals, if necessary.



Pacific Recovery Region



Threatened Goals: Nesting populations continue to increase annually for the 5 years beginning with 1986 nesting
season.

Delisting Goals: A minimum of 800 nesting pairs with an average reproductive rate of 1.0 fledged young per pair with
an average success rate per occupied site of not less than 65% over a 5-year period. Attainment of breeding population
goals should be met in at least 80% of management zones. Wintering populations should be stable or increasing.

Progress to Date: In 1993, 1066 occupied breeding areas were reported with 0.86 young per occupied breeding area.
The number of occupied breeding areas has consistently increased since 1986 and exceeded 800 for 4 of the 5 years beginning
in 1990 when 861 were reported. Productivity has averaged about 1.0 since 1990. Threatened goals have been met. Should
this trend continue, the delisting goals for number of nesting pairs and productivity may be met in the near future.
At present, less than 80 percent of the 37 specified management zones have met their delisting goals. In 1993, 20 of
those zones had met or exceeded their recovery goals, and four other zones in addition to the original 37 had nesting
eagles that are not part of the recovery goals for this region.

Threatened goals have been met. Delisting goals are close to being met for all criteria except attainment of breeding
population goals for 80 percent of the management zones. About 10 more zones need to meet their goals to fulfill this
criterion.

Service Proposal: Reclassify to threatened in California (except the 10-mile strip along the Colorado River), Idaho,
Montana, Nevada, and Wyoming; the species would remain threatened where it now has that status.



Southeastern Recovery Region



Threatened Goals: 600 occupied breeding areas distributed over at least 75 percent of the historic range contingent
upon greater than 0.9 young per occupied nest, greater than 1.5 young per successful nest, and at least 50 percent of
the nests successful in raising at least one young; based on a 3-year average and documentation of population vigor
and adequate support habitat. Individual State goals are given.

Delisting Goals: Delisting may be considered if the recovery trend continues for 5 years after reclassification
goals are met. The criteria for delisting will be developed when the species is reclassified from endangered to threatened.

Progress to Date: 982 occupied breeding areas were reported with an average of 1.02 young per occupied territory in
1993. Nesting is distributed over all 11 Southeastern States. The number of occupied breeding areas reached 601 in
1991 and has exceeded 600 for three successive years. Reproductive success for the years 1990-1993 averaged
1.53 young per successful nest (or 1.04 young per occupied territory), and 68 percent of the nests were successful
in raising at least one young. Seven of eleven individual State goals have been met but these are considered guidelines
rather than requirements. Existing habitat is deemed to be adequate to support and exceed overall recovery plan goals.
Threatened goals have been met and delisting goals will be met in 5 years if the trend continues.
Service Proposal: Reclassify to threatened.


Southwestern Recovery Region


Threatened Goals: 10-12 young per year over a 5-year period; population range has to expand to include one or
more river drainages in addition to the Salt and Verde Systems.
Delisting Goals: None given.
Progress to Date: 29 occupied breeding areas were reported for 1993 with 27 young produced. Since 1988, the number
of occupied breeding areas has increased by about 26 percent (six occupied territories) in the Southwestern Region.
Nationwide, occupied breeding areas have increased by 62 percent (1540 occupied territories) in the same time period.
Some of the increase in the Southwestern Region is due to finding previously unrecorded nest sites. Ten or more young
have been produced every year since 1981. Productivity has increased 10-20 percent through the assistance
of the Arizona Nest Watch program (Hunt et al. 1992).
Information to date indicates that breeding has expanded beyond the Salt and Verde River systems. Eagles are now nesting
in the Gila and Bill Williams river systems in Arizona and the Rio Grande in New Mexico. Thus, the threatened criteria
have been fully met.
The population remains small, localized, with variable productivity, and low adult survival. This population faces
numerous and increasing impacts from a rapidly growing human population. These impacts include continued loss and
modification of riparian habitat, disturbance at nest sites, entanglement of nestlings in fish line, and other human-caused
influences.
The Southwestern Recovery Plan is undergoing revision to incorporate new information gained from recent investigations
by Hunt et al. (1992). This research indicates that birds dispersing into west Texas and Oklahoma are more likely to
be bald eagles of the Southeastern Region population than those of the Southwestern Region. Thus, the revised recovery
plan may propose the elimination of west Texas and the western panhandle of Oklahoma from the Southwestern Recovery
Region. The plan revision will also consider the addition of southern Utah and Mexico.
For the purposes of this reclassification proposal, however, the boundaries for the Southwestern Recovery Region
will remain as stated in the recovery plan (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 1982). That is, the Southwestern Region
includes Arizona, New Mexico, and those portions of Texas and Oklahoma west of the 100th meridian, and southeast California
within 10 miles of the Colorado River or its mainstem reservoirs.
Service Action: Retain as endangered. Despite attaining all recovery plan goals, current information indicates
that the population is at risk and remains in danger of extinction due to excessively low survival rates and the need
for intensive management, particularly at nest sites.


Mexico


There are a small number of eagles nesting in Baja California and Sonora, Mexico. In January 1994, a minimum of eight
active pairs were known with additional adults reported that may represent more active pairs with undetected nests
(Henny et al. 1993, Service files). Productivity has been relatively high with more than 1.0 young per nest for those
years that data have been collected (Henny et al. 1993, Service files). Although this population appears to be relatively
stable, such low numbers are clearly not sufficient to prevent any sudden adverse environmental change to cause the
extirpation of these few pairs. These birds are presumed to be associated with the Southwestern population and are
considered in danger of extinction. Threats to these birds include loss of habitat and disturbance from human encroachment
with the increasing population (particularly tourists and recreational housing development) and potential for
inbreeding from such low numbers of breeding birds.
In summary, the Service is proposing to reclassify the bald eagle from endangered to threatened in the Chesapeake
and Southeastern Recovery Regions and those portions of the Northern States and Pacific Recovery Regions where it
is currently classified as endangered. No changes are proposed for the Southwestern Recovery Region, where the bald
eagle will remain classified as endangered. The Service is not proposing to delist the bald eagle anywhere in the lower
48 States at this time. The Service is also proposing to list those bald eagles in Mexico as endangered.
On February 7, 1990, the Service published (55 FR 4209) an Advance Notice of a Proposed Rule (ANPR) to announce that
consideration was being given to the possible reclassification or delisting of the bald eagle in all or part of its
range in the lower 48 States.

Summary of Comments and Recommendations Resulting From Advance Notice


The responses received to the ANPR generally reflected the Service's announcement that delisting, as well as reclassification,
was under consideration for the entire lower 48-State area. Not all responses specifically addressed delisting
or reclassification. Nevertheless, the responses were useful in the formulation of the present reclassification
proposal.
Many responses reflected the writers' strong personal feelings and concerns for bald eagles. Many respondents related
the importance and value of their personal bald eagle experiences. Further, they expressed their desire that bald
eagles be properly cared for and that the opportunity to view wild eagles not be lost. The bald eagle's position as our
national bird was frequently mentioned.
In response to the ANPR, the Service received 4 responses from other Federal government offices, 22 responses from
State conservation agencies, 23 responses from citizen groups, and 140 responses from individuals.
Based on reclassification goals contained in the five regional Bald Eagle Recovery Plans, one Federal agency favored
reclassification to threatened only in Florida and the development of State-by-State recovery plans/criteria,
with subsequent State-by-State reclassification and delisting decisions.
Another Federal agency recommended reclassification to threatened in selected areas based on circumstances in
the individual recovery regions, rather than for the nation as a whole, and recommended against delisting.
A third Federal agency recommended reclassification of the bald eagle to threatened in Arizona based on achievement
of the Southwestern Recovery Plan reclassification goals and on protection and management measures presently in
place.
The last Federal agency favored reclassification to threatened in those recovery regions where the recovery plans'
reclassification goals have been met.
The Service received responses to the 1990 ANPR from 22 State natural resource agencies. Seven State agencies concurred
with reclassification to or retention as threatened, including Michigan, Minnesota, and Wisconsin, the three Northern
Region States where the bald eagle is presently designated as threatened. The remaining 15 responding States recommended
against delisting and/or reclassification in their States.

Of the 140 individual responses (some signed by more than one individual), 135 opposed reclassification or delisting
in some or all areas of the lower 48 States; of the 23 citizen group responses, 19 opposed reclassification or delisting
in some or all areas of the lower 48 States. 

Individuals and citizen groups suggested that it would be inappropriate to delist or reclassify the bald eagle to
threatened while direct and indirect impacts such as contaminants and development on non-Federal lands remain a
threat. The Service recognizes that habitat loss is a major challenge to the recovery of the bald eagle. The Service
also recognizes that non-Federal, as well as Federal, habitat must be protected from contaminants, disturbance,
and development or the secure population size will be diminished. However, reclassification to threatened would
not reduce present Federal legal protection on non-Federal land nor would it allow habitat loss that could not otherwise
occur. 

A concern expressed by 62 individuals and 11 citizen groups was that bald eagle populations were below the higher levels
of America's pre-settlement days or other former era, or that populations did not meet the abundance, distribution,
or productivity goals for delisting or reclassification contained in the bald eagle recovery plans. The Act's designations
of endangered and threatened are based on the present or foreseeable threat of extinction of the species, not historical
levels. Recovery plan goals for reclassification have been met at this time. 

One individual suggested that the Service conduct a population viability analysis (PVA) of the bald eagle, including
a determination of the minimum viable population (MVP). The Service recognizes PVA and MVP as analytical tools and
has funded and participated in the production of PVA's for several endangered species. For the present reclassification
decision, however, it is unnecessary because the bald eagles of the Chesapeake, Northern, Southeastern, and Pacific
Recovery Regions have reached the recovery plans' reclassification goals. Those goals are conservative and meet
the Act's definition of threatened. 

The appearance of a lowered level of Federal legal protection was a concern in 26 individual responses and in one citizen
group response. The prohibitions of section 9 of the Act are the same for threatened and endangered species, with the
exception that with reclassification to threatened, the Service could issue permits for limited exhibition and
educational purposes, for selected research work not directly related to the conservation of the species, and for
other special purposes consistent with the Act (50 CFR 17.32, 17.41). All requirements of the Act under section 7 still
apply. No changes in other protective provisions of the Act would result, nor would any other Federal law protecting
bald eagles be affected. 

Thirteen of the 135 individuals and 2 of the 19 citizen groups recommending against reclassification or delisting
were concerned that the Service's own efforts for bald eagle recovery, habitat management, habitat protection,
and law enforcement might be diminished. The Service's obligations to protect bald eagles under the Endangered Species
Act, the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, the Bald Eagle Protection Act, and all other applicable laws will remain undiminished
by the proposed reclassification. 

Seven individuals and one citizen group recommending against reclassification or delisting suggested that the
Service might be either collaborating with or yielding to economic interests who want development restrictions
relaxed in areas presently used by bald eagles. The proposed reclassification eases no restrictions on the development
of bald eagle habitat because the Act and regulations adopted under it make no distinction in the protection given
to habitats of threatened and endangered species. 

Seven individual and two citizen group respondents suggested that the Service might be delisting or reclassifying
the bald eagle to enhance its reputation or for other self-serving purposes. This proposal to reclassify the bald
eagle from endangered to threatened is undertaken in fulfillment of section 4(c) of the Act, which requires the Service
to periodically review each listed species and to change classifications when appropriate, to maintain the integrity
of the Act's endangered and threatened categories. Since the bald eagle has met its recovery plan goals, the Service
is now taking this action.

One individual and two citizen groups, in addition to the Maine and New Hampshire State conservation agencies, suggested
that the northeastern part of the Northern States Recovery Region be separated and considered distinct. The Northern
States Recovery Team, which has representation from the Northeast, has also considered this question and does not
recommend separating the northeastern States from the present Northern States Recovery Region. The Service concurs
with the Northern States Recovery Team. 



Summary of Factors Affecting the Species 



Section 4(a)(1) of the Endangered Species Act (16 U.S.C. 1531 

et seq.

) and regulations (50 CFR Part 424) promulgated to implement the listing provisions of the Act set forth the procedures
for reclassifying species on the Federal lists. A species may be listed or reclassified as threatened or endangered
due to one or more of the five factors described in section 4(a)(1). These five factors and their application to the
bald eagle are as follows. 



A. The Present or Threatened Destruction, Modification, or Curtailment of Its Habitat or Range



The bald eagle is associated with aquatic ecosystems throughout most of its range. Nesting almost never occurs farther
than 3 km (2 miles) from water (Gerrard and Bortolotti 1988). Fish predominate in the typical diet of eagles. Many other
types of prey are also taken, including waterfowl and small mammals depending on location, time of year, and population
cycles of prey species. Dead animals or carrion, especially in the wintering areas, are also taken when readily available
(Lincer et al. 1979). 

Nest sites are usually in large trees along shorelines in relatively remote areas. The trees must be sturdy and open
to support a nest that is often 2-3 m (6-9 ft) across and more than a meter (3 ft) thick (Bent 1938). Bald eagles
also select cliffs or rock outcrops for nest sites where large trees are not available. This dependence upon very large
trees associated with water makes the eagle vulnerable to water-associated development pressures. 

One of the two major threats to the bald eagle at present and for the foreseeable future is destruction and degradation
of its habitat (the other major threat is environmental contaminants_see Factor E below). This occurs through direct
cutting of trees for shoreline development, human disturbance associated with recreational use of shorelines and
waterways, and contamination of waterways from point and non-point sources of pollution. Contamination enters
bald eagles through the food chain and may impair individual birds' reproductive success and health. It may also reduce
the abundance of preferred prey. 

Steps to reduce these threats are underway at all levels of government and public organizations nationwide. Increased
protection of nesting habitat and winter roost sites have occurred in many areas throughout the country. Guidelines
to minimize human disturbance around nesting and winter roost sites have been developed in all parts of the country.
Areas of contamination continue to be identified and reduced. Rehabilitation, captive propagation reintroduction,
and transplanting programs have all worked toward increasing the viability of the U.S. bald eagle population. 

Current threats to the bald eagle's habitat and range in the United States by Recovery Region are as follows: 

Chesapeake Bay Region: Buehler et al. (1991) reported that the bald eagle feeding and resting use of Chesapeake Bay
shoreline was directly related to the distance of development from the shoreline. Eagles tended to avoid shorelines
with nearby pedestrian or boat traffic. With human activity and development increasing, preferred bald eagle habitat
is diminishing. Associated land clearing reduces bald eagle nesting and perching sites. 

To offset these impacts, the Service has expanded its National Wildlife Refuge System around the Chesapeake Bay area
to protect bald eagle habitat. For example, the Service acquired 3,500 acres of nesting and roosting habitat in the
James River area of Chesapeake Bay in 1991 to be protected and managed for bald eagles. Acquisition of an additional
600 acres is planned. The Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge, which provides important eagle habitat on Chesapeake
Bay, is also proposing to acquire more land. Nickerson (1989) estimates that enough suitable unoccupied nesting
habitat remains that, if unaltered, it could sustain continued growth of the bald eagle population through the remainder
of the 20th century. 

Northern States Recovery Region: Development, particularly near urban areas, remain as a primary threat. In spite
of these localized problems, bald eagle nesting activity in the Northern States Recovery Region has more than doubled
in the past 10 years from fewer than 700 to over 1600 territories known to be occupied. There also is ample unoccupied
habitat still available throughout this region. 

In the Great Plains States, loss of wintering habitat is a major concern. Wintering areas have been lost through development
of riparian areas for recreational, agricultural, and urban uses. Loss of wintering habitat also occurs due to lack
of cottonwood regeneration. This results from changes in floodplain hydrology from construction of reservoirs
and dam operations. Grazing also inhibits regeneration. A threat to some wintering populations of eagles in the Great
Plains States is the destruction of prairie dog colonies and other important foraging areas (U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service 1992).

However, management measures, reforestation, improved water quality, and a reduction in pesticide contamination
(see factor E below) have enabled the Northern States populations to increase substantially overall. Much eagle
nesting and wintering habitat is on publicly owned lands. Many of these lands are protected by habitat management
plans and strict eagle nest protection and management guidelines. 

Pacific Recovery Region: Development-related habitat loss continues to be the single greatest factor limiting
the abundance and distribution of the species in the Pacific Recovery Region (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 1986).
Habitat conservation efforts, including laws and management practices by Federal and State agencies and efforts
by private organizations, have helped to facilitate bald eagle population increases in the Pacific Recovery Region
since the 1960's. For example, interagency working teams in six of the seven Pacific Recovery Region States have developed
implementation plans to address local issues more specifically than the recovery plan. Bald eagle habitat guidelines
have also been incorporated into development covenants and land use. California and Washington have rules relating
to bald eagles on private lands to encourage landowners to maintain nesting territory habitat. 

Southeastern Recovery Region: The accelerated pace of development activities within eagle habitat and the extensive
area involved are the most significant limiting factors in the Southeastern Region. The cumulative effects of many
water development projects impinge on the ability to maintain current nesting populations and ultimately may limit
the extent to which recovery may occur. 

To reduce these threats, habitat management guidelines are used to minimize development disturbance in and around
nests. Several counties and municipalities have adopted the guidelines in their land use and zoning policies. In
addition, a significant amount of new habitat has been created in the form of manmade reservoirs. Reservoirs primarily
provide wintering and non-nesting habitat, but are used by nesting eagles as well (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service
1984, 1989). 

In addition, many of the States have or have had active hacking/reintroduction programs. Rehabilitation and release
of injured eagles occurs throughout the Southeastern Region (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 1984, 1989). As a result
of these and other efforts, the bald eagle nesting population in the Southeastern Region has more than doubled in the
past 10 years. 

Southwestern Recovery Region: In addition to threats common with other Recovery Regions, such as human disturbance
and availability of adequate nesting and feeding habitat, the bald eagles of the Southwestern Recovery Region are
subjected to a high adult rate of mortality, isolation, heat stress, and nest parasites. The Arizona Bald Eagle Nestwatch
Program has significantly increased survival of young by minimizing human disturbance during important incubation
periods, and by removing harmful material such as parasites and fishing line debris from nests. However, the high
death rate of adults and nestlings and the lack of gene exchange with any adjacent nesting populations, which may cause
inbreeding to adversely affect the population's long-term survival, remain limiting; this population continues
to require intensive management, particularly around each nest site. 

Hunt et al. (1992) estimate a minimum annual mortality rate of 16 to 22 percent of adult breeding birds and believe it
to be much higher. Bald eagles commonly live 20 years in the wild and up to 50 years in captivity (Stalmaster 1987). In
the Southwestern Region, adult life expectancy may not exceed 10-12 years (Hunt et al. 1992). 

Historically, the bald eagle in Arizona was more widely distributed but probably was never abundant (Hunt et al. 1992).
Prior to 1970, records can be found for 19 pairs of nesting bald eagles in Arizona (Hunt et al. 1992). In 1993, 27 occupied
territories were reported for Arizona and 2 for New Mexico totalling 29 for the Southwestern Recovery Region. 

Research to date indicates there has been no immigration to this population of bald eagles. According to Hunt et al.,
this small population is isolated and thus is subject to the genetic, demographic, and environmental threats known
to be associated with small populations. For these reasons, the population is in continued need of strict protection
and intensive management. 



B. Overutilization for Commercial, Recreational, Scientific, or Educational Purposes



There is no legal commercial or recreational use of bald eagles. The Service considers present legal and enforcement
measures sufficient to prevent bald eagle extinction or a need to reclassify as endangered. The Service exercises
very strict control over scientific, educational, and Native American religious activities involving bald eagles
or their parts. With reclassification to threatened, the Service could issue permits for limited exhibition and
educational purposes, for selected research work not directly related to the conservation of the species, and for
other special purposes consistent with the Act (50 CFR 17.32 and 17.41(a)).

C. Disease or Predation



Predation is not a significant problem for bald eagle populations. Incidents of mortality due to territory disputes
between bald eagles have been reported. Diseases such as avian cholera, avian pox, aspergillosis, tuberculosis,
and botulism may affect individual eagles, but are not considered to be a significant threat to the population. In
the Southwestern population, the Mexican chicken bug, when abundant, is known to occasionally kill young. According
to the National Wildlife Health Research Center, National Biological Survey, Wisconsin, only 2.7 percent of bald
eagles submitted to the Center between 1985 and 1990 died from infectious disease. 



D. The Inadequacy of Existing Regulatory Mechanisms



The bald eagle is protected by the following Federal wildlife laws in the U.S.: 

* Sections 7 and 9 of the Endangered Species Act (16 U.S.C. 1531 

et seq.

) protect individual bald eagles (threatened or endangered) and their active nests on public and private land. 

* The Bald Eagle Protection Act (16 U.S.C. 668) prohibits without specific authorization the possession,
transport, or take of any bald or golden eagle, their parts, nests or eggs. 

* The Migratory Bird Treaty Act (16 U.S.C. 703) prohibits without specific authorization the possession,
transport, or take of any migratory bird (including bald eagles), their parts, nests or eggs. 

* The Lacey Act (16 U.S.C. 3372 and 18 U.S.C. 42-44) among other provisions, makes it unlawful to export,
import, transport, sell, receive, acquire, or purchase any bald eagle, (1) taken or possessed in violation of any
law, treaty, or regulation of the United States or in violation of any Indian tribal law or (2) to be taken, sold, or transported
in interstate or foreign commerce, in violation of any law or regulation of any state or in violation of any foreign
law. 

This species is afforded uncommonly comprehensive statutory and regulatory protection under Federal and State
authorities. 



E. Other Natural or Manmade Factors Affecting Its Continued Existence



Contaminants may affect the survival as well as the reproductive success and health of the bald eagle. The abundance,
and potentially more important, the quality of prey may be seriously affected by environmental contamination. Although
many of the compounds implicated in reduced reproductive rates and direct mortality are no longer used, contaminants
continue to be a major problem. Pesticides in recent times have not impacted the bald eagle on a population level; however,
individual poisonings still occur. 

Carcasses baited with poison may attract bald eagles as well as target animals such as coyotes. Poisonings may occur
secondarily when predatory animals are poisoned and subsequently eaten by eagles. Crop insecticides may be taken
up by prey animals and may also result in eagle mortality. Organophosphates and carbamates are sometimes used illegally
for animal poison. The National Wildlife Health Research Center has diagnosed over 100 cases of pesticide poisonings
in bald eagles in the past 15 years. 

The western plains and Rocky Mountain States are reported to have 300-600 bald eagle deaths each year in the past
decade on western rangelands due, in part, to illegal use of pesticides such as famphur, phorate, and carbofuran,
and highly restricted chemicals, such as strychnine, Compound 1080 and others (Tom Jackson, Fish and Wildlife Service,
Denver, pers. comm.). This mortality on western rangelands corresponds with the primary wintering areas for most
western bald eagles (other than Pacific coast birds). Some illegal uses of pesticides are targeted at bald and golden
eagles. Cases of suspected intentional mortality through baiting of carcasses with pesticides has occurred in all
western States and may occur in other States. Reducing this level of illegal mortality is important for the complete
recovery of the species. 

Chronic long-term exposure to contaminants is a much more extensive problem than direct mortality. Lifetime exposure
to contaminants may limit the eagles' reproductive capabilities, alter their behavior and foraging abilities,
and increase their susceptibility to diseases. (Organochlorines, such as DDT, are no longer legally used in the United
States. Their presence in bald eagles is generally a consequence of their long persistence in the environment. Consequently,
residues of such compounds from historic uses can still contaminate prey animals and be passed to eagles). Exposure
to these compounds is also occurring at an early age. For example, approximately 90% of the eaglets sampled in Maine
in 1992 had detectable levels of DDE in their blood.

In the Chesapeake Bay Region, Delaware Bay and the James River below Richmond continue to be a source of organochlorine
and heavy metal contaminants that may impact eagle reproduction (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 1990). However,
DDE concentrations in addled bald eagle eggs in Chesapeake Bay have declined significantly from 1969-84 (Wiemeyer
et al. 1993). 
In parts of the Northern States Region, contamination is depressing bald eagle productivity. This occurs notably
in the coastal areas of the Great Lakes, those rivers accessible by anadromous fishes of the Great Lakes, and in parts
of Maine. Research on bald eagle productivity in the vicinity of Great Lakes shorelines indicates significantly
lower productivity than for inland breeding birds. The reduced productivity is correlated with concentrations
of PCB's, DDE, dieldrin, and other organochlorine compounds in addled eggs (Best et al. in press). 
Bald eagles of the Pacific Recovery Region nesting near the Columbia River estuary and Hood Canal, which is adjacent
to Puget Sound, repeatedly have low reproductive success. DDE and PCB's have had a deleterious effect on the reproduction
of bald eagles in the Columbia River estuary (Anthony et al. 1993). Wiemeyer et al. (1993) found addled bald eagle eggs
collected from Oregon ranked second (behind Maine) in DDE concentrations among the fifteen States sampled. However,
concentrations of other contaminants in the Oregon eggs were low. In spite of localized reproductive impairment,
the Pacific Recovery Region population has increased by about 68 percent in the past 10 years. Contaminants are not
known to be a significant problem for eagles in the Southwestern Recovery Region or Mexico. 
Lead poisoning has also contributed to bald eagle mortality. The National Wildlife Health Research Center has diagnosed
lead poisoning in more than 225 bald eagles during the last 15 years. Lead can poison bald eagles when they ingest prey
items that contain lead shot or lead fragments or where the prey has assimilated lead into its own tissues. In winter,
eagles frequently feed on waterfowl that are dead or dying from lead poisoning or upon waterfowl crippled in the hunting
season. Lead poisoning of eagles was a primary reason the Service required the nationwide use of non-toxic shot for
waterfowl hunting. The requirement for use of non-toxic shot was phased in over a period of 5 years, and its use became
mandatory for all waterfowl hunting in 1991. Use of lead shot is still permitted in many parts of Canada. 
Of particular concern for bald eagles in the Southeastern Region and in Maine are the toxic effects of mercury (Wiemeyer
et al. 1993, C. Facmire, pers. comm.). High levels of mercury affect eagles with a variety of neurological problems,
where flight and other motor skills can be significantly altered, and with reduced hatching rates of eggs. Mercury
has entered the waterways as air emissions from solid waste incineration sites and other point and non-point sources.
Impacts from mercury to bald eagles are currently under investigation in the Southeastern Region. 
Illegal shooting still poses threats to individual birds. Improved law enforcement and public awareness has reduced
shooting impacts from a cause of large scale mortality in the first half of this century to the deaths of occasional
individuals at present. From 1985 to 1990, the National Wildlife Health Research Center has diagnosed over 150 bald
eagle deaths due to gunshot. Hunter education courses routinely include bald eagle identification material to educate
hunters about bald eagles and the protections that the species is afforded. 
Electrocutions occur on power poles and lines that are not yet configured for the protection of raptors. Much research
has been done in this area, and generally new poles and lines are configured to reduce raptor electrocutions. 
Human disturbance also remains a long-term threat. Significant declines in eagle use of the Skagit River, Washington,
were noted in response to recreational activity (Stalmaster 1989). Human disturbance can be harmful during egg incubation
and young brooding periods because disturbance can flush adults from nests. 
Land management practices can reduce or eliminate these disturbance problems. Management of bald eagle nesting
sites has progressed in some areas to include zones of protection extending up to 2.5 miles (U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service 1986). In the Bear Valley National Wildlife Refuge, Oregon, for example, public access is restricted from
November 1 through March 30 to prevent human disturbance to wintering bald eagles. 
Despite these various threats to the bald eagle in the area proposed for reclassification, none are of sufficient
magnitude, individually or collectively, to place the species at risk of extinction. Over most of the 48 States, the
population is doubling every 6 or 7 years. 
The Service has carefully assessed the best scientific and commercial information available regarding the past,
present, and future threats faced by this species in determining to propose this rule. Based on this evaluation, the
preferred action is to reclassify the bald eagle from endangered to threatened in the lower 48 States except the southwestern
population in Arizona, New Mexico, the southeast corner of California within 10 miles of the Colorado River or the
river's mainstem reservoirs, and those portions of Texas and the panhandle of Oklahoma that are west of the 100th meridian.
The latter population appears to be isolated, to suffer from lower survival rates, and to require intensive management
to ensure nesting success. The bald eagle would remain threatened in the five States where it is currently listed as
threatened and be listed as endangered in Mexico under this proposal.

Recognition of Distinct Population of the Southwestern Recovery Region 


In 1978, the Service recognized distinct population segments of this species on the basis of State boundaries, with
bald eagles in five northern States listed as threatened, and those in the remainder of the lower 48 States listed as
endangered. The distinctness of these population segments is questionable, given the dispersal capabilities of
the species across State lines. 
In this proposal, the recognition of the southwest bald eagle population as distinct from eagles elsewhere in the
lower 48 States is based on evidence that it appears to be reproductively isolated. Thus, for purposes of this proposed
rule, the Service still recognizes two populations of bald eagles in the lower 48 States. Should this proposed rule
become final, the southwest population segment would remain endangered, the adjacent Mexico population segment
would be included in the Southwestern population as endangered, and the remaining population segment in the lower
48 States would be reclassified to threatened. 


Special Rule 


The Act allows special rules to be adopted for threatened species as needed for the species' conservation; such special
rules are typically provided to reduce those protections afforded to endangered species under the Act. Section 17.41(a)
is a special rule adopted at the time of the 1978 reclassification of the bald eagle. The original intent was to reduce
the number of permits required for researchers working on threatened eagles (i.e., Oregon, Washington, Minnesota,
Wisconsin, and Michigan) under both  17.32 and 50 CFR parts 21 and 22 (bird banding and eagle permits). The present
special rule at  17.41(a) reads as follows: 



(a) Bald eagles (

Haliaeetus leucocephalus

) found in Washington, Oregon, Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan. 
(1) 

Applicable provisions.

 The provisions of   17.31 and 17.32 shall apply to bald eagles specified in paragraph (a) of this section
to the extent such provisions are consistent with the Bald Eagle Act (16 U.S.C. 668-668d), the Migratory Bird
Treaty Act (16 U.S.C. 703-711), and the regulations issued thereunder.

 

The Service proposes to clarify the language of this special rule for threatened bald eagles. If the proposed special
rule is adopted, only a permit issued under the authority of 50 CFR 21.22 or 50 CFR part 22 (subpart C) would be needed
for such purposes as banding ( 21.22); scientific study or exhibition ( 22.21), which includes taking,
possession, rehabilitation, and transport; native American religious ( 22.22); and depredation ( 22.23).
A permit under  17.32 would only be required when a permit under parts 21 and 22 do not provide for an otherwise
lawful activity. The issuance of all such permits would remain subject to section 7 of the Act and part 402 of this title.



Effects of This Rule 


As a result of the proposed reclassification, prohibitions outlined under 50 CFR 17.41(a) would apply to bald eagles
of the population reclassified as threatened. Prohibitions under   17.21 and 17.22 would continue to
apply to the endangered population. The Service could issue permits for exhibition and educational purposes, for
selected research work (including banding and marking) not directly related to the conservation of the species,
and for other special purposes. In allowing for a single permit, the Service seeks to foster further research and other
uses of bald eagles consistent with the Act and the purposes of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act and the Bald Eagle Act (50
CFR 17.32, 17.41(a), 21.22, 22.21-22.23). 
Requirements of the Act under section 7 still apply to all Federal agencies. There are no distinctions made in the Act
or supporting regulations (part 402) between endangered and threatened species. The consultation and other requirements
under section 7 apply equally to species with either classification. 


Public Comments Solicited 


The Service intends that the proposed reclassification correctly reflect the bald eagle's status according to the
Act's definition of endangered and threatened and based upon the reclassification guidelines for each bald eagle
recovery region. Therefore, information from the public, other concerned governmental agencies, the scientific
community, industry, or any other interested party concerning this proposed rule are hereby solicited. Comments
are sought concerning: 



(1) biological, commercial trade, or other relevant data concerning any threat (or lack thereof) to this species;

(2) the location of any additional nests or roosting sites of this species, especially in the Southwestern Recovery

Action: 

Proposed rule. 





<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) requests comments on proposed amendments of right-of-way regulations containing
procedures for setting fair market rent for communication uses located on public lands. The proposed rule would establish
rental schedules and procedures for 11 categories of communication service for which fair market value is required
for the use of public lands. The proposed schedule has been developed in cooperation with the Forest Service (FS).




The proposed schedule is an attempt to improve the processing of right-of-way authorizations for communications
use of public lands and reduce agency appraisal costs associated with setting and updating rental payments on approximately
1,500 authorized communications uses for which rent is currently required.

<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The proposed rental schedule is applicable to commercial and private communication uses authorized by a BLM right-of-way
authorization. The uses include television broadcast, FM radio broadcast, rebroadcast devices, cable television,
commercial mobile radio service, private mobile communication, cellular telephone, common carrier microwave,
private microwave, facility manager, and miscellaneous uses. The proposed rule also would require payment of a percentage
of the sublease rent collected by the holder from its tenants. Rental payments are waived for applicants or holders
who provide public telecommunication services and are licensed by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC)
as a noncommercial, educational radio or television station. 


The following objectives have been adopted to guide development of the rental schedule and implementation of procedures
to balance carefully the public's interest in obtaining fair market rent: (1) Allow the continued growth of communication
markets and services, especially in rural areas; (2) design a process that is cost effective, sets rental payments
that are predictable and can be easily updated; (3) provide incentive for improved management of communication sites.

The proposed rule takes into consideration recommendations of the Radio and Television Broadcast Use Fee Advisory
Committee, information provided by users, industry groups, private appraisers, and comments received by the FS
in response to their proposed policy published in the 

Federal Register

 on July 13, 1993. 

Comparative information provided by BLM and private appraisers was screened carefully only to include examples
of land rent. The rent paid does not include any payment for services such as power, access, building and/or tower space,
or maintenance. Information used was provided by the principals in those transactions. 
The proposed procedures will provide a consistent approach for the administration and assessment of rental payments
for communication uses on public lands. The schedule provides incentives for co-locating single users within existing
facilities under a multiple use right-of-way authorization. The rule also outlines a process for setting and updating
rental payments and phasing in substantial increases in rental payments.

Background 


The BLM's process for setting fair market rent for communication uses has been directly influenced by FS efforts to
set a rental payment schedule. In a 1983 administrative appeal decision, the FS determined that the formula used to
determine fair market rental for communication site use was not in compliance with the Federal Land Policy and Management
Act of 1976 (FLPMA) (43 U.S.C. 1701

 et seq.

). The formula used at that time was two-tenths (0.2) of 1 percent of the permittee's investment plus 5 percent of the
rental fees received by the FS permittee. 
The formula has remained unchanged for about 40 years, as have FS rental payments. 
In 1985, the FS adopted a new policy for setting rental payments. Under that policy, communication use rental fees
were to be based on (1) a fee schedule, (2) individual site appraisals, or (3) competitive bidding. In 1989, the FS implemented
regional schedules under that policy. Proposed rentals generated opposition from industry groups_primarily television
and radio broadcasters_and complaints to Congress. At the same time, efforts by certain BLM State Offices to increase
rental payments caused similar complaints to Congress. 
To forestall significant increases in rental payments, Congress enacted a moratorium prohibiting any increases
in rental fees above those in effect on January 1, 1989. This affected both agencies. The FS was also asked to review
the schedules, with particular emphasis on their impact on rural communities in the Western United States, and to
report their findings to the congressional Appropriations Committees. The report was submitted to Congress in 1991.

The BLM and FS entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) in April 1991. The MOU provides for cooperation to develop
and implement similar methods for determining rental fees. 
In November 1991, the Department of the Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Act limited increases in communication
site fees in Fiscal Year 1992 to 15 percent over the levels in effect on January 1, 1989. The conference report also directed
both the FS and BLM jointly to establish a broad-based advisory group. 
Pursuant to that direction, an advisory group, the Radio and Television Broadcast Use Fee Advisory Committee, was
established, which included BLM, FS, and representatives from the broadcast industry (users of both public and private
communication sites). The advisory committee prepared and submitted a report to the Secretaries of the Interior
and Agriculture in December 1992. 

The advisory committee report made several recommendations. These included use of rental schedules instead of individual
appraisals for setting rental payments, acceptance of industry-recognized market ranking systems, a phase-in
period for rent increases greater than $1,000, a provision for charging 25 percent of the gross sublease income, and
annual increases based on the Consumer Price Index (Urban Consumer, U.S. City Average). 
The advisory committee also recommended a specific rental schedule. The schedule included a discount of 30 percent
from estimated rental value to account for perceived difficulties in obtaining use authorizations on Federal lands.
The advisory committee report indicated that the rental schedule did not reflect fair market value, and it was required
to be amended by BLM. 
On July 13, 1993, the FS published a 

Federal Register

 notice of proposed policy (``Fee Schedule for Communication Uses'') and invited comments. The FS proposed to adopt
a revised rental schedule for television broadcast, FM radio broadcast, commercial mobile radio, and cellular telephone
uses on National Forest System lands. The proposed schedule would supplement individual FS regional schedules adopted
in 1989 and modified in 1992. The regional schedules of the FS recognize 13 types of communication uses. They include
(1) radio broadcast, (2) television broadcast, (3) broadcast translator, (4) cable and subscription television,
(5) mobile radio-commercial communications, (6) cellular telephone, (7) common carrier microwave relay, (8) industrial
microwave relay, (9) mobile radio-internal communications, (10) natural resource/environmental monitoring,
(11) passive reflector, (12) amateur radio, and (13) personal/private receive only. 
In August 1993, the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (Act) was signed into law. The Act directed the BLM and FS to assess
and collect in 1994 an annual rental payment 10 percent above the rent paid in 1993. For most right-of-way holders required
to pay rent, this was the first increase since 1989.

Summary of Comments Received by the Forest Service 


The FS received 84 letters providing suggestions and comments regarding the proposed schedule. In general, the comments
reflected confusion over the definition of uses covered, how geographic areas would be determined, and rents calculated.
Comments also suggested that the proposed rents were excessive, that the information relied upon was not representative,
and that provisions regarding indexing and revenue sharing (25 percent of the gross sublease income) were not commonplace
in the private rental market. Many comments expressed concern that adoption of the schedule would have an adverse
impact on small businesses. 
Comments provided several suggestions. Several suggested that additional price levels be added to improve fairness
and reduce impact on permit holders in rural areas. Several comments suggested that commercial mobile radio users
should not be subject to paying 25 percent of the gross sublease income when their primary business, or only use of the
facility, is to rent space to other customers. With respect to television and FM radio, most of the comments suggested
that the advisory committee report be the basis for setting rental payments. Several comments provided information
on rents currently being paid and suggested what are considered to be reasonable rental payments. 
The BLM proposed schedule has been developed considering comments received by the FS, and the comments have been adopted
or incorporated as appropriate. 


Statutory Requirements 


43 U.S.C. 1701(a)(9) states that it is the policy of the United States to receive the fair market value of the use of the
public lands and their resources unless otherwise provided by statute. 
43 U.S.C. 1761(a) gives the Secretary of the Interior authority to grant, issue, or renew rights-of-way for communication
uses, including systems for transmission or reception of radio, television, telephone, telegraph, and other electronic
signals. 
43 U.S.C. 1764(g) requires the payment of a rental. The holder is required to pay in advance the fair market value as
determined by the Secretary granting, issuing, or renewing such right-of-way. The Secretary may waive part or all
of the payment when it is found to be equitable and in the public interest. Rights-of-way issued at less than fair market
value are not assignable except with the approval of the Secretary issuing the right-of-way. The regulations implementing
right-of-way provisions of FLPMA are found in 43 CFR part 2800. Provisions regarding rental payments are found in
43 CFR subpart 2803, and state in part that the holder of a right-of-way grant or temporary use permit is required to
pay annually, in advance, with certain exceptions, the fair market value rental. This is determined by the authorized
officer, applying sound business management principles and, so far as practicable and feasible, using comparable
commercial practices.

Factors Considered in Developing the Proposed Rental Schedule 



The proposed schedule takes into consideration a variety of factors. These factors include (1) recommendations
of the Radio and Television Broadcast Use Fee Advisory Committee, (2) market information provided by users, industry
groups, private and Government appraisers, and (3) practical considerations associated with developing a cost-effective
method for setting and collecting fair market value for communication site use of public lands. 

The BLM has incorporated many of the recommendations of the Radio and Television Broadcast Use Fee Advisory Committee
regarding use of a schedule instead of individual appraisals to set rental payments, a phase-in period, use of an index
to update annual rental payments, and a provision for charging 25 percent of the gross sublease rent. However, the
BLM amended the recommended rental schedule. 

The television schedule recommended by the advisory committee was based on a market ranking system that is no longer
published, and the rental payments did not represent fair market value. The advisory committee schedules were based
on setting the highest rent for the largest market and for each smaller market dividing the rent in half. The rent suggested
by the advisory committee was further reduced by 30 percent to reflect what a majority of members of the advisory committee
believed to be the difference between a private lease and BLM or FS authorization. The advisory committee schedule
would have resulted in a reduction in current revenues from radio and television use on public lands. 

The proposed rental schedule for television and radio is higher for certain markets, and lower for others, than the
schedule recommended by the advisory committee. This reflects comparable market information, elimination of the
suggested 30 percent discount, and an effort to develop a reasonable schedule that covers markets ranging from small
rural ones in Montana and Wyoming to larger ones serving Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Reno. To increase fairness, the proposed
schedule includes 9 rent levels instead of 6 as recommended by the advisory committee. 

Market information was obtained from industry groups, individual users, appraisers, and other persons responding
to the FS notice. Market information compiled by BLM and FS appraisers was carefully screened to exclude from the rents
reported any payment for services such as power, access, building and/or tower space, or maintenance. This information
has been compiled by each BLM State Office for purposes of preparing individual appraisals. Since very few appraisals
have been prepared over the last 5 years, some of the information is outdated. Therefore, BLM considered more than
market information. The public is requested to provide information as to communication site rentals on private land
established within the last 3 years. This information would be considered in adjusting the rental schedules proposed
in this rule. 

A representative sampling of reliable market information to develop a national schedule for a variety of communication
uses is difficult to obtain. The information is not readily available, the number of recent transactions is relatively
small, and often the information is incomplete or conflicting. Generally, information provided by appraisers is
the most complete and has supplemented information provided by various industry groups. This variety of information
has been used to establish relative values for various communication uses, depending on population or location criteria.


Comparable private leases reflect several factors relevant to market value. One, strategically located mountaintops
are valuable for communication purposes. Mountaintop sites allow users to send signals from point to point or deliver
a signal that covers a geographical area. Mountaintop communication sites often provide better coverage, and are
less expensive to develop, than other alternatives for reaching the same size population. 

Two, rental payments for broadcast uses are related to the population served by the television or radio transmitter.
Strategically located mountaintops serving larger populated areas are generally more valuable than those serving
smaller markets. Locations within the same market that provide the best coverage will also rent for more than secondary
locations. It should be noted that not all mountaintops have value for broadcast use. The proposed schedule attempts
to reflect the rent for typical locations on BLM administered lands, rather than rentals set for specific authorizations
and established by appraisals. 

Three, there is competition for strategically located mountain sites. Private or public mountain locations close
to populated areas that have access and power are preferred by broadcast users. There are few places where there is
direct competition between private and public sites. The sites used are those that provide the best coverage. However,
in many areas rents charged on private lands are higher than rents charged for similarly located sites on public land.

Four, mountaintops generally are intensively developed and often command premium rental payments when compared
to single use sites. The multiple user sites provide a mixture of high and low power communication uses, including
radio, television, and mobile radio and cellular. These sites often include large buildings, a variety of towers,
and well maintained public or private roads. 

Five, various nonbroadcast uses are not dependent upon the population served. These uses include microwave, cellular,
and mobile radio facilities in rural areas. Rental payments for these uses are related to general real estate values
in the immediate area of the site. 

Six, there is little difference in the rental payment for single use sites in small rural markets. Often rent paid in
the private rural market does not vary significantly among the various communication uses. This is due to local economic
conditions and forces within the market to provide a basic level of communication service. 

In developing the schedule, consideration was given to current assessed rent. Since current BLM rentals are based
on individual appraisals, rental payments established in the last 5 years were considered to reflect fair market
value. This information was used as a benchmark for assessing reasonableness and providing a measure of consistency
in areas where there was little direct market information. 

Industry groups have objected to use of market information for setting rental payments on public lands. They argue
that the rights authorized under terms of a BLM or FS grant are different than those provided under a private lease,
and that private landowners provide more service and do not require compliance with stringent environmental requirements.
They also argue that television and radio broadcasters provide a public service and, therefore, that rental payments
should be partially or totally waived. The few cases in which there has been competitive bidding for communication
uses on Federal or State lands do not support these contentions. 

Practical considerations also contributed to development of a rental schedule. The FS has been engaged in a 10-year
effort, which BLM joined in 1990, to determine fair market rent for communication site uses. In addition, both the
BLM and the FS have supported the use of a regulatory schedule to reduce the costs and delays associated with obtaining
individual appraisals. It is estimated that the annual costs of updating and appraising BLM right-of-way grants
for communication use would be $3-4 million. This is approximately double the current annual revenues from
communication site rights-of-way. Use of a schedule would be more cost effective. 

Rents charged in the private market are not based upon schedules. Instead, rents are based upon negotiations between
the landowner and the prospective user. The rent is set on a individual basis, depending on the use and the terms and
conditions of the lease agreement. 

To the extent practicable, the schedules proposed attempt to approximate a reasonable rent for the authorized use.
They do not attempt to replicate site-specific appraisal values. Instead, the schedule merely establishes a reasonable
amount of rent to be assessed for the type of authorized use based on location or population criteria. Therefore, the
BLM believes the proposed rental schedule reflects fair market value. 



Bureau of Land Management Communication Use Program 



The BLM currently administers approximately 3,200 communication use authorizations. In accordance with agency
regulations, approximately 50 percent of the authorizations pay no rent. Right-of-way holders not required to pay
annual rent include Federal, State, and local government agencies. The remaining communication use right-of-way
holders pay an annual rental based upon agency-approved appraisals. Generally, communication use authorizations
are reappraised every 5 years and new rental payments are established. However, for a variety of reasons, most of the
communication use rental fees are currently out of date. 

Section 2803.1-2(c)(3)(i) of 43 CFR states that the rental shall be based on either a market survey of comparable
rentals, or on a value determination for specific parcels or groups of parcels. Most communication use rental fees
are based upon individual appraisals prepared by agency staff appraisers. Some BLM State Offices have instituted
market surveys or administrative schedules for setting rental payments. Current regulations also allow use of competitive
bidding for purposes of determining rental for the use of public lands. Bids less than fair market rental value of the
lands are not considered.

The proposed rule would establish a rental payment schedule for various communication uses for which fair market
rental is required. However, with the concurrence of the BLM State Director, the authorized officer may reduce or
waive the rental when it is determined that the rental will cause undue hardship on the holder/applicant and that it
is in the public interest to waive the rental payment. Current right-of-way rental waiver policy is not affected by
this proposed schedule. 

The proposed schedule reflects rental values for BLM-authorized communication uses. The BLM right-of-way authorization
is similar to a private lease for communication purposes. The authorization is for 30 years or the life of the project,
and contains provisions regarding renewal, termination, assignment, and liability. Other provisions may include
subleasing and bonding. New applicants for use of public lands are subject to application and processing fees associated
with complying with environmental requirements. New and existing users may be subject to reimbursement of reasonable
costs associated with agency monitoring of use. Therefore, the proposed schedule reflects a reasonable estimate
of the fair market rental value for communication uses on public lands. 

Impacts on industry and users paying rental vary. Television and radio broadcasters in large markets, or users whose
rent has not been adjusted for 5, 10, or more years, may experience a significant increase. However, there are several
situations where rental payments will decline. The best estimate is that total revenues from BLM-authorized communication
uses will be approximately the same. However, costs associated with individual billing and preparing and updating
appraisals will be significantly reduced. Although rental increases may be significant in some cases, they will
be phased in over a 5-year period. In addition, the current regulations include a provision (43 CFR 2803.1-2(b)(2)(iv))
allowing partial waiver or deferral of rental by the authorized officer based on a claim of hardship. 

Finally, the provision for rounding of right-of-way rental payments would be removed in the proposed rule. This would
simplify the calculation of rental payments by BLM and their payment by right-of-way holders. The rounding provision
has unnecessarily complicated the calculation of rental fees, and increased billing errors, with little or no benefit
to the customer. The rounding provision and its removal are revenue neutral. Revenues would be neither enhanced nor
diminished. 



Communication Uses Covered by Proposed Schedule 



The proposed schedule is applicable to the communication uses described below. The proposed rental schedule is not
applicable to holders of facilities authorized under terms of a right-of-way grant to public telecommunications
service operators providing public television or radio broadcast service. However, such holders would be responsible
for paying a percentage of the gross sublease rent received from tenants in the facility that do not qualify as nonprofit
entities. The term ``primary use'' is the predominant use of the facility by the holder authorized under terms of the
right-of-way authorization. The term ``facility'' is defined as the building, tower, and other related incidental
improvements authorized under terms of the right-of-way authorization. 



Television Broadcast 



This category includes right-of-way holders that operate facilities authorized by the Federal Communication Commission
(FCC) that primarily broadcast UHF and VHF audio and video signals for general public reception. The schedule is applicable
to primary transmitters that principally serve a community (city, cities, metro area, or county) reached by the transmitter.
Principal communities covered do not include outlying areas served by translators. This category does not include
stations licensed by the FCC as a Low Power Television (LPTV) or rebroadcast devices such as translators, or transmitting
devices such as microwave relays serving broadcast translators. 



FM Radio Broadcast 



This category includes right-of-way holders that operate FCC licensed facilities primarily used to broadcast frequency
modulation (FM) audio signals for general public reception. The schedule is applicable to primary transmitters
that principally serve communities reached by the primary transmitter. Principal communities covered do not include
areas reached by broadcast translators. This category is not applicable to stations licensed by the FCC as low power
FM radio, and does not include rebroadcast devices such as translators, boosters or AM synchronous transmitters
or microwave relays serving broadcast translators. 



Rebroadcast Devices 



This category includes right-of-way holders that operate FCC licensed facilities primarily used to rebroadcast
a signal from its point of origin. This category includes translators and low power television, low power FM radio,
and microwave relays. Microwave as used in conjunction with LPTV and broadcast translators are included in this category.

A translator is a rebroadcast device that transmits signals of a primary TV or FM station to another location that would
not otherwise receive the original signal. The schedule is applicable to rebroadcast devices licensed to the principal
community or other political subdivision which it primarily serves. Translators are generally located in the same
service area and are inherently low power in nature. 

LPTV refers to television translator stations that are permitted to originate programming for broadcast to the general
public. They are limited to 10 watts VHF and 1000 watts UHF. 



Cable Television 



This category includes right-of-way holders that operate FCC licensed facilities that primarily transmit video
programming to multiple subscribers in a community over a wired network. Cable television includes head-end microwave
or satellite antennas and receiver systems used for television reception that retransmit by cable or microwave (wireless
cable) methods. These systems usually operate as a commercial entity within an authorized franchise area, providing
their services to subscribers who pay a periodic fee. This category does not include rebroadcast devices that retransmit
television signals of one or more television broadcast stations, or personal or internal antenna systems such as
private systems serving hotels or residences. 



Commercial Mobile Radio Service (CMRS) 



This category includes right-of-way holders that operate an FCC-licensed commercial mobile radio facility providing
primarily mobile communication service to individual customers. The right-of-way holder owns the facility (building
and tower) and operates, maintains, rents, or sells commercial mobile radio equipment in the facility. Although
the primary use of the building is to provide communication service to customers for a fee, a portion of the income to
the owner may be derived from renting space for other communication uses unrelated to the primary use of the facility.
Primary services generally include two-way voice and paging services such as community repeaters, trunked radio
(specialized mobile radio), two-way radio dispatch, and public switched network (telephone/data) interconnect
service. 



Private Mobile Communications 



This category includes right-of-way holders that operate FCC licensed private mobile radio systems primarily used
by a single entity for the purposes of internal communications. This use is not sold and is exclusively limited to the
user in support of business, community activities, or other organizational communication needs. Services generally
include private local radio dispatch and private paging services. 



Cellular Telephone 



This category includes right-of-way holders that operate FCC-licensed systems primarily used for mobile communications,
using a blend of radio and telephone switching technology. They provide public switched network services to fixed
and mobile users within a tightly defined geographic area. The system consists of cell sites containing transmitting
and receiving antennas, cellular base station radios, telephone equipment, and often microwave communications
link equipment. The cell sites are linked to a mobile telephone switching office, often via microwave, and at that
point into the Public Switched Network. This category includes Personal Communication Systems, a digital mobile
telephone service, and enhanced specialized mobile radio. 



Common Carrier Microwave 



This category includes right-of-way holders who operate FCC-licensed facilities primarily used for long-line
intrastate and interstate telephone, television, information, and data transmissions. These uses are regulated
by State public utility commissions and are required to provide service to any consumer with the ability to pay according
to published rate schedules. The microwave system is an integral part of the company's primary business of providing
communication service.

Private Microwave 


This category includes right-of-way holders that operate FCC-licensed facilities primarily used by pipeline and
power companies, railroads, and land resource management companies. Communication services associated with this
category may include private mobile service, private two-way dispatch service, private paging, supervisory remote
control/sensing, and microwave voice/video/data services. This use is solely in support of the holder's primary
business activity. The use is not regulated by the State public utilities commission because the service is not for
sale and is used solely for internal purposes. 


Facility Manager 


This category includes right-of-way holders that operate a facility primarily owned, operated, and maintained
by a holder who may or may not have an FCC license, but does not operate telecommunications equipment. The primary purpose
of the facility is to rent or sublease space to a variety of tenants for telecommunication purposes. The building owner
generally provides space in the building and/or tower, and utilities, access, security, and backup generator services.

Communication services provided by the tenants of a facility manager may include TV or FM radio broadcast, cable television,
microwave, cellular telephone, amateur radio operators, and mobile radio. Mobile radio uses include two-way voice
and paging services such as community repeaters, trunked radio, and two-way radio dispatch, and Public Switched
Network (telephone/data) interconnect service. Tenants hold lease agreements with the facility manager. Microwave
facilities used in conjunction with broadcast uses and mobile radio are included in this category. 


Other Communication Uses 


This category includes other FCC-licensed private communication uses such as amateur radio, personal/private
receive-only antennas, passive reflectors, and natural resource and environmental monitoring equipment. 
Amateur radio includes equipment used by individuals or groups licensed as amateur radio operators. 
Personal/private receive-only includes radio and TV receiving antennas, satellite dishes, and other equipment
and/or facilities designed for the reception of electronic signals, to serve private homes, including recreation
residences. These facilities are personally owned and are not operated for profit. 
Passive reflectors include devices used to bend or ricochet electronic signals between active relay stations or
a relay station and a terminal. 
Natural resource and environmental monitoring includes the transmission of telemetry data from a remote site to
a central receiving station. Uses may include weather stations, streamflow gauges, seismic stations, wildlife
monitoring, and snow measurement devices. 


General Application of Proposed Schedule 


The proposed rental schedule applies to right-of-way holders who are authorized to operate and maintain communication
facilities on public lands. The proposed base rent charged is for the primary use of the building. The primary use is
defined as the predominant use of the facility by the holder and authorized under terms of the right-of-way authorization.
The use may be classified as television broadcast, FM radio broadcast, rebroadcast devices, cable television, cellular
telephone, commercial mobile radio, private mobile radio, private microwave, common carrier microwave, facility
manager, or be included under the miscellaneous category. Tenants occupying space in the facility under terms of
the authorization will not be required to have a separate BLM authorization. 

The proposed rental schedules will be applicable to new and existing communication use authorizations requiring
annual payment of fair market rental as of the date of publication of the final rule. However, the authorized officer
may use other methods including individual appraisals or competitive bidding for new sites, or existing sites where
it is shown that the rental schedule does not represent fair market value. Rental payments covering portions of calendar
years will be prorated. 
There are three major categories of use: broadcast, nonbroadcast, and other. 
Broadcast includes television, FM radio, rebroadcast devices, and cable television. The proposed rent for broadcast
categories will be based on the following procedures: 
1. The right-of-way holder will provide a 1-millivolt contour map or statement to BLM identifying the principal community
(city, cities, metro area, or county) served by the transmitter. Communities served do not include areas served by
translators. 
2. Rent for television, FM radio, and rebroadcast devices (translators and low power television) will be based on
the population of the principal community or communities the transmitter primarily serves. The population of the
principal community will be based on the most recent United States census information.

3. Rent for cable television will be based on total basic subscribers as reported by the holder. 
4. Rent for rebroadcast devices will be based on the U.S. census population of the principal community identified
in the FCC license that is served by the transmitter. 
The following examples are provided to illustrate how the base rent for a broadcast use would be calculated. 
A television facility in Clark County, Nevada, principally serving the communities of Las Vegas (pop. 258,259),
North Las Vegas (pop. 47,707), Henderson (pop. 64,942), and Boulder City (pop. 12,567) would pay a proposed annual
rental of $16,000 per year. This is based on total population of the principal communities of 370,908. 
An FM radio facility in Imperial County, California, principally serves El Centro (pop. 31,384), Yuma, Arizona (pop.
106,895), and San Luis Rio Colorado, Mexico (pop. 76,684). The annual rent would be calculated based on the total population
of the communities. The proposed annual rent would be $4,000 per year, based on the population of its principal communities
of 214,983. 

The rent for nonbroadcast uses_commercial mobile radio service, private mobile communication, cellular telephone,
common carrier microwave, private microwave, facility manager and miscellaneous uses_will be assessed on a different
basis. Rent will be based on county population where the transmitter is located or the population of an adjacent or
nearby county served by the transmitter, whichever is greater. 
The following examples are provided to illustrate how the base rent for nonbroadcast uses would be calculated. 
The proposed rent for a right-of-way holder owning a facility in Pershing County, Nevada, (pop. 4,436) primarily
used for common carrier microwave would be assessed $1,500. 
A commercial mobile radio service facility in Madison County, Idaho (23,674), serving the Idaho Falls community
in Bonneville County, Idaho (72,207), would be assessed a proposed rent of $1,500. Since the transmitter serves a
trade area that is predominately in the adjacent county, the Bonneville County population would be used to determine
the rental payment. 
A holder owning a commercial mobile radio service facility used primarily to provide mobile radio service in the San
Diego County (pop. 2,498,016) market would pay a proposed rent of $12,000.

The third major category is miscellaneous communication uses. These uses include amateur radio, personal/private
receive-only, passive reflectors, and natural resource and environmental monitoring equipment. These uses may
be permanent or temporary and the rent is either a flat rent of $75 for a full year or a prorated rent if the term is less
than a year. 



Additional Users 



The fair market rent depends on the type of communication use and the demand for it in a local market. Therefore, the
market value may change if there is a significant change from a single use to a multiple use facility. 

Authorized holders may allow other users in their building under terms of their right-of-way authorization. Additional
users will not be required to have a separate right-of-way authorization. 

It is proposed that all categories of use be subject to a provision regarding the payment of a percentage of gross rent
received from the sublease rent of space in the facility. The facility owner will be responsible for paying the base
rent for the authorized primary use of the facility, plus a percent of gross sublease rent for tenants within the facility.
Gross sublease rent is defined as the rent received by the holder of the communication use right-of-way grant from
tenants for space in the building or on the tower. Gross sublease rent does not include road or building maintenance
or service fees for power and backup generators. 

The BLM proposes to assess all users holding a right-of-way authorization a base rent plus 15 percent, for the first
5 years, of the annual gross receipts received from renting space in the facility. In the sixth year after the effective
date of this rule, the percentage would be increased to 25 percent. This provision would apply to any use co-located
in the facility for which the owner is receiving a sublease rental payment. The following procedures will be used to
calculate the rent: 

1. BLM will initiate a billing for the annual base rent calculated from the proposed schedule; and 

2. When making the assessed annual base rent payment, the holder will submit a certified statement to the BLM regarding
rent collected from tenants during the previous year, and include the required precentage of gross rental with the
total payment. 

The proposed rental payment required for the category of facility manager is also based on a base rent plus 15 percent
of gross receipts from rental of space in the facility. In the sixth year after the effective date of this rule, the percentage
would be increased to 25 percent. The percentage applies to all population strata for that category. 



Annual Fee Updating 



Under current procedures rental payments are updated every 5 years. During the 1980's, the increases were often fairly
substantial and resulted in complaints and increased appeals. In many cases rental payments had not been updated
for 10 to 15 years. Limitations on the agency's authority to increase rent over the last 4 years have exacerbated the
problem. 

The base rent proposed in the schedule will be updated annually based on the U.S. Department of Labor Consumer Price
Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U), U.S. City Average, published in July of each year. Calculating the amount
of the annual adjustment involves changing the previous year's rental by the change in the level of the CPI-U
for the current year. The following example illustrates the computation of percent change:

 


CPI-U, U.S. City Average 
136.0 

Less CPI for previous period 
129.9 

Equals index point change 
6.1 

Divide by previous period CPI 
129.9 

Equals 
0.047 

Result multiplied by 100 
0.047 x 100 

Equals percent change 
4.7

 


Market information regarding use of an index was mixed. However, more recent transactions indicate that increases
in annual rent are linked to changes in the Consumer Price Index instead of increases in land value. This reflects the
desire of property owners to maintain the relative value of the annual payments in terms of annual inflation. 

Comments received by the FS expressed concern that the Consumer Price Index may dramatically increase rents beyond
the ability of right-of-way holders to pass on the increases to their customers. These correspondents also were concerned
that the increases over time would be higher than normal increases in land rents in the private market. The BLM agrees
with the comments and proposes to limit annual increases based on the CPI-U to no more than 5 percent.

Phase In 



To reduce potential impact of large increases in rent, BLM proposes to phase in substantial increases in the base rent
and percentage of gross rental receipts. Additional rent based upon a percentage of gross rent for space rental in
the facility will not be phased in. Initial increases in the base rental payments in excess of $1,000 or 20 percent of
the current rent, whichever is greater, will be phased in over a 5-year period. Subsequent increases in rent above
the first year will be based on an equal annual installment, plus the inflation adjusted increase. 

As an example, if the current base rent is $700 and the new rent based on the schedule is $2,700, the first year's rent
would be $1,700 plus the inflation-adjusted increase, and the rent for years 2 through 5 would be increased $250 per
year. Assuming a 2 percent increase in the CPI-U during the 5 year phase-in period, the base rents would be calculated
as follows:

 


Year 1 ($700 x 1.02)+$1,000= $714+$1,000=$1,714 

Year 2 ($1,714 x 1.02)+$250= $1,748+$250=$1,998 

Year 3 ($1,998 x 1.02)+$250= $2,038+$250=$2,288 

Year 4 ($2,288 x 1.02)+$250= $2,334+$250=$2,583 

Year 5 ($2,583 x 1.02)+$250= $2,635+$250=$2,885 

Year 6 $2,885 x 1.02=$2,943

 


Additional rent based on a percentage of gross rent received from tenants covered by the right-of-way authorization
would also be phased in. The percentage would be set at 15 percent during the first 5 years after the effective date of
this rule, and 25 percent thereafter. 



Exceptions 



The proposed rental payments only apply to those communication users that are required to pay a fair market rental.
Current regulations exempt Federal, State, or local government agencies or instrumentalities thereof, except
municipal utilities and cooperatives whose principal source of revenue is customer charges. Also exempt are rights-of-way
authorized under a statute that explicitly does not require payment of a rental, and facilities constructed under
the Rural Electrification Act of 1936, as amended. 

The BLM proposes to close a loophole through which ``exempt'' agencies derive revenue from the rental of space within
their facility or the area authorized. Section 2803.1-2(b)(1)(i) would be amended to require ``exempt'' agencies
to pay fair market rent for those uses from which they derive revenue from the rental of space. 

It is BLM's intent to use the rental fee schedule for all existing communication uses covered by the proposed rule.
However, when it is determined by the authorized officer that the rental payment schedule does not reasonably reflect
fair market rent, other reasonable means will be used to estimate the rental payment. The BLM reserves the right to
use individual appraisals or other valuation procedures to calculate rental payments for communication uses. 



Periodic Review of Rental Schedule

The communication use rental schedule will be re-evaluated, and if necessary, revised periodically to ensure that
rentals are fair. Schedules based on county population will be re-evaluated after completion of the next census in
2000. The updated county population information will be substituted for 1990 county population figures. 


Partial Waiver of Rent 


43 U.S.C. 1764(g) provides authority to charge less than fair market value if the holder provides at reduced or no charge
a valuable benefit to the public or to the programs of the Secretary concerned. Actions taken by the holder at no cost
or reduced costs to the public may be considered in granting a temporary, partial, or full waiver. Any requirement
placed on the applicant or holder as a condition of granting or renewing the authorization is required to be legal and
not result in additional costs unrelated to the use authorized. Therefore, requirements that the building owner
set aside 10 percent of its space for Government use or that Federal agencies be granted free use in the building should
be considered in setting fair market rent. 


Basis for Rental Schedule 


In developing the schedule, the BLM has considered information from a variety of sources. This includes information
provided by industry groups, existing BLM rents that are believed to reflect fair market value, data and information
provided by BLM appraisers, and information gathered by the FS in preparing their schedule. The BLM has also taken
into consideration the recommendations of the Radio and Television Broadcast Use Fee Advisory Committee. The rental
schedules are included in the proposed regulatory text. 


Public Comment 


The BLM is requesting public comment on all aspects of this proposed rule as well as comments on specific questions.
Specific comments are requested regarding the following questions: 
1. Is the proposed schedule reasonable? If not, what information can you provide that would help in setting a fair and
reasonable schedule? 
2. Are the proposed phase-in methods for base rents and percentage of gross rental receipts reasonable? If not, please
suggest a method that can be easily implemented. 
3. Are the categories clearly defined? Would there be any potential problems in determining the category of use? Please
provide suggestions to improve the description of each category of use. 
4. Are there any potential problems in setting the base rent for commercial mobile radio services based on the population
of the county in which the transmitter is located or the nearby or adjacent county predominantly served by the transmitter,
whichever is greater? Please suggest alternative methods. 
To conform with the format requirements of the Code of Federal Regulations, the Note at the beginning of Group 2800
is being removed, and the information provided there is being included in new sections 2800.0-9, 2810.0-9,
and 2880.0-9. There is no substantive change involved. 
The principal author of this final rule is David Cavanaugh of the Division of Lands, BLM, assisted by the staff of the
Division of Legislation and Regulatory Management. 
It is hereby determined that this proposed rule does not constitute a major Federal action significantly affecting
the quality of the human environment, and that no detailed statement pursuant to Section 102(2)(C) of the National
Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)) is required. The Bureau of Land Management has determined
that this rule is categorically excluded from further environmental review pursuant to 516 Departmental Manual
(DM), Chapter 2, Appendix 1, Item 1.10, and that the rule will not significantly affect the 10 criteria for exceptions
listed in 516 DM 2, Appendix 2. Pursuant to the Council on Environmental Quality regulations (40 CFR 1508.4) and environmental
policies and procedures of the Department of the Interior, ``categorical exclusions'' means a category of actions
which do not individually or cumulatively have a significant effect on the human environment and which have been found
to have no such effect in procedures adopted by a Federal agency and for which neither an environmental assessment
nor an en
