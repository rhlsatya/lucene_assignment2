Mediterranean Fruit Fly; Removal From the Quarantined Areas 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, USDA.

 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Interim rule and request for comments.

 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 We are amending the Mediterranean fruit fly regulations by removing the quarantined area in Riverside County, CA,
from the list of quarantined areas. We have determined that the Mediterranean fruit fly has been eradicated from this
area and that restrictions are no longer necessary. This action relieves unnecessary restrictions on the interstate
movement of regulated articles from this area.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
Background


The Mediterranean fruit fly, 

Ceratitis capitata 

(Wiedemann), is one of the world's most destructive pests of numerous fruits and vegetables. The Mediterranean fruit
fly (Medfly) can cause serious economic losses. Heavy infestations can cause complete loss of crops, and losses of
25 to 50 percent are not uncommon. The short life cycle of this pest permits the rapid development of serious outbreaks.

We established the Mediterranean fruit fly regulations (7 CFR 301.78 through 301.78-10; referred to below
as the regulations) and quarantined the Hancock Park area of Los Angeles County, CA, in an interim rule effective on
November 5, 1991, and published in the 

Federal Register

 on November 13, 1991 (56 FR 57573-57579, Docket No. 91-155). The regulations impose restrictions on the
interstate movement of regulated articles from quarantined areas in order to prevent the spread of the Medfly to noninfested
areas of the United States. We have published a series of interim rules amending these regulations by adding to or removing
from the list of quarantined areas certain portions of Los Angeles, Santa Clara, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino,
and San Diego Counties, CA. Amendments affecting the quarantined areas in California were made effective on September
10, and November 12, 1992; and on January 19, July 16, August 3, September 15, October 8, November 22, and December 16,
1993; and on January 10, February 14, and March 4, 1994 (57 FR 42485-42486, Docket No. 91-155-2; 57
FR 54166-54169, Docket No. 91-155-3; 58 FR 6343-6346, Docket No. 91-155-4; 58
FR 39123-39124, Docket No. 91-155-5; 58 FR 42489-42491, Docket No. 91-155-6;
58 FR 49186-49190, Docket No. 91-155-7; 58 FR 53105-53109, Docket No. 91-155-8;
58 FR 63027-63031, Docket No. 91-155-9; 58 FR 67627-67630, Docket No. 91-155-10;
59 FR 2281-2283, Docket No. 91-155-11; 59 FR 7895-7896, Docket No. 91-155-12;
and 59 FR 11177-11180, Docket No. 91-155-13).
We have determined, based on trapping surveys conducted by the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS)
and California State and county agency inspectors, that the Medfly has been eradicated from the quarantined area
in Riverside County, CA. The last finding of the Medfly thought to be associated with the infestation in this area was
made on December 17, 1993. Since then, no evidence of infestation has been found in this area. We have determined that
the Medfly no longer exists in this area, and we are therefore removing it from the list of areas in  301.78-3(c)
quarantined because of the Mediterranean fruit fly. As a result of this action there are no longer any quarantined
areas in Riverside County. Portions of Los Angeles, Orange, and San Bernardino Counties remain quarantined.


Immediate Action


The Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that there is good cause for publishing
this interim rule without prior opportunity for public comment. The area in California affected by this document
was quarantined due to the possibility that the Mediterranean fruit fly could spread to noninfested areas of the United
States. Since this situation no longer exists, and the continued quarantined status of this area would impose unnecessary
regulatory restrictions on the public, immediate action is warranted to remove restrictions from the noninfested
area.

Because prior notice and other public procedures with respect to this action are impracticable and contrary to the
public interest under these conditions, we find good cause under 5 U.S.C. 553 to make it effective upon signature.
We will consider comments that are received within 60 days of publication of this rule in the 

Federal Register

. After the comment period closes, we will publish another document in the 

Federal Register

. It will include a discussion of any comments we receive and any amendments we are making to the rule as a result of the
comments. 



Executive Order 12866 and Regulatory Flexibility Act 



This interim rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12866. 

For this action, the Office of Management and Budget has waived the review process required by Executive Order 12866.


This interim rule affects the interstate movement of regulated articles from the Corona area of Riverside County,
CA. There are approximately 93 small entities that could be affected, including 66 fruit sellers, 14 nurseries, 6
growers, 4 vendors, and 3 swapmeets. 

These small entities comprise less than 1 percent of the total number of similar small entities operating in the State
of California. In addition, most of these small entities sell regulated articles primarily for local intrastate,
not interstate, movement, and the sale of these articles would not be affected by this interim regulation. 

Therefore, termination of the quarantine in the Riverside County area should have a minimal economic effect on the
few small entities operating there. We anticipate that the economic impact of lifting the quarantine, though positive,
will be no more significant than was the minimal impact of its imposition. 

Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that
this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. 



Executive Order 12372 



This program/activity is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance under No. 10.025 and is subject to Executive
Order 12372, which requires intergovernmental consultation with State and local officials. (See 7 CFR part 3015,
subpart V.) 



Executive Order 12778 



This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This rule: (1) Preempts all State and
local laws and regulations that are inconsistent with this rule; (2) has no retroactive effect; and (3) does not require
administrative proceedings before parties may file suit in court challenging this rule. 



Paperwork Reduction Act 



The information collection and recordkeeping requirements contained in 
subpart 301.78 have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the Paperwork Reduction Act of
1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq.

) under OMB control number 0579-0088. 



List of Subjects in 7 CFR Part 301

Commuted Traveltime Periods: Overtime Services Relating to Imports and Exports


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, USDA.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 We are amending the regulations concerning overtime services provided by employees of Plant Protection and Quarantine
by adding a commuted traveltime allowance for travel between two locations in Indiana. Commuted traveltime allowances
are the periods of time required for Plant Protection and Quarantine employees to travel from their dispatch points
and return there from the places where they perform Sunday, holiday, or other overtime duty. The Government charges
a fee for certain overtime services provided by Plant Protection and Quarantine employees and, under certain circumstances,
the fee may include the cost of commuted traveltime. This action is necessary to inform the public of commuted traveltime
between these locations. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Background 


The regulations in 7 CFR, chapter III, and 9 CFR, chapter I, subchapter D, require inspection, laboratory testing,
certification, or quarantine of certain plants, plant products, animals, animal byproducts, or other commodities
intended for importation into, or exportation from, the United States. When these services must be provided by an
employee of Plant Protection and Quarantine (PPQ) on a Sunday or holiday, or at any other time outside the PPQ employee's
regular duty hours, the Government charges a fee for the services in accordance with 7 CFR part 354. Under circumstances
described in  354.1(a)(2), this fee may include the cost of commuted traveltime. Section 354.2 contains administrative
instructions prescribing commuted traveltime allowances, which reflect, as nearly as practicable, the periods
of time required for PPQ employees to travel from their dispatch points and return there from the places where they
perform Sunday, holiday, or other overtime duty. 
We are amending  354.2 of the regulations by adding a commuted traveltime allowance for travel between two locations
in Indiana. The amendment is set forth in the rule portion of this document. This action is necessary to inform the public
of the commuted traveltime between the dispatch and service locations. 


Effective Date 


The commuted traveltime allowances appropriate for employees performing services at ports of entry, and the features
of the reimbursement plan for recovering the cost of furnishing port of entry services, depend upon facts within the
knowledge of the Department of Agriculture. It does not appear that public participation in this rulemaking proceeding
would make additional relevant information available to the Department. 
Accordingly, pursuant to the administrative procedure provisions in 5 U.S.C. 553, we find upon good cause that prior
notice and other public procedure with respect to this rule are impracticable and unnecessary; we also find good cause
for making this rule effective less than 30 days after publication of this document in the 

Federal Register

. 



Executive Order 12866 and Regulatory Flexibility Act 


This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12866. For this action, the Office of Management and Budget
has waived its review process required by Executive Order 12866. 
The number of requests for overtime services of a PPQ employee at the locations affected by our rule represents an insignificant
portion of the total number of requests for these services in the United States. 
Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that
this action will not have a 
significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. 


Executive Order 12372 


This program/activity is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic 
Assistance under No. 10.025 and is subject to Executive Order 12372, which 
requires intergovernmental consultation with State and local officials. (See 
7 CFR part 3015, subpart V.) 


Executive Order 12778 


This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This rule is intended to have
preemptive effect with respect to any State or local laws, regulations, or policies that conflict with its provisions
or that would otherwise impede its full implementation. This rule is not intended to have retroactive effect. There
are no administrative procedures that must be exhausted prior to any judicial challenge to the provisions of this
rule or the application of its provisions. 


Paperwork Reduction Act 


This rule contains no new information collection or recordkeeping requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act
of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq.

). 



List of Subjects in 7 CFR Part 354



Exports, Government employees, Imports, Plant diseases and pests, Quarantine, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements,
Travel and transportation expenses. 



Accordingly, 7 CFR part 354 is amended as follows: 


PART 354_OVERTIME SERVICES RELATING TO IMPORTS AND EXPORTS; AND USER FEES 


1. The authority citation for part 354 continues to read as follows: 





Authority:

 7 U.S.C. 2260; 21 U.S.C. 136 and 136a; 49 U.S.C. 1741; 7 CFR 2.17, 2.51, and 371.2(c).

Nursery Crop Regulations



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Federal Crop Insurance Corporation, USDA.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Federal Crop Insurance Corporation (FCIC) hereby amends the Nursery Crop Insurance regulations, effective
for the 1995 and succeeding crop years, by making a change in the policy to clarify the method of determining loss.



The Nursery policy contains the term ``said damaged crop'' which has been interpreted, in some forums, to refer to
specific damaged portion of the crop instead of the unit as was the intent.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

This action has been reviewed under USDA procedures established by Executive Order 12866 and Department Regulation
1512-1. This action does not constitute a review as to the need, currency, clarity, and effectiveness of this
regulation under those procedures. The sunset review date established for these regulations is March 31, 1999.



This rule has been determined to be ``not significant'' for purposes of Executive Order 12866 and, therefore, has
not been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB).

This action will not have a significant economic effect on a substantial number of small entities. This action does
not increase the paperwork burden on the reinsured company because the reinsured company must already provide the
additional information required by this regulation to the state in which it is licensed. Therefore, this action is
determined to be exempt from the provisions of the Regulatory Flexibility Act and no Regulatory Flexibility Analysis
was prepared.

This program is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance under No. 10.450.

This program is not subject to the provisions of Executive Order 12372 which requires intergovernmental consultation
with state and local officials. See the Notice related to 7 CFR part 3015, subpart V, published at 48 FR 29115, June 24,
1983.

This action is not expected to have any significant impact on the quality of the human environment, health, and safety,
Therefore, neither an Environmental Assessment nor an Environmental Impact Statement is needed.

The Office of the General Counsel has determined that these regulations meet the applicable standards provided in
subsections 2(a) and 2(b)(2) of Executive Order 12778. The provisions of this rule are not retroactive and will preempt
state and local laws to the extent such state and local laws are inconsistent herewith. The administrative appeal
provisions located at 7 CFR 400.169 must be exhausted before judicial action may be brought.

It has been determined under section 6(a) of Executive Order 12612, Federalism, that this rule does not have sufficient
federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federal Assessment. The policies and procedures contained
in this rule will not have substantial direct effects on states or their political subdivisions, or on the distribution
of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government.

On April 25, 1994, the FCIC published a proposed rule at 59 FR 19661 proposing to amend the nursery policy to clarify
the method of determining loss. Comments were requested for 30 days after the publication of said rule, in which time
no comments were received. Therefore, the FCIC hereby adopts the proposed rule published at 59 FR 19661 as final without
changes.

The date by which all changes in this policy must be final is June 30. All present insureds under the policy and all applicants
have been specifically advised of the changes herein. Additionally, changes have been placed in the agents' office
prior to the contract change date. Good cause is thereby found to make this rule final in less than 30 days.

Accordingly, pursuant to the authority contained in the Federal Crop Insurance Act, as amended (7 U.S.C. 1501

Guam Visa Waiver Program; Taiwan



<AGENCY>
agency: 

Immigration and Naturalization Service, Justice.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
action: 

Final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
summary: 

This rule amends the Immigration and Naturalization Service (Service) regulations by amending the one-year restriction
on Taiwan's inclusion in the Guam Visa Waiver Program, and by removing the requirement that residents of Taiwan who
are in possession of Taiwan National Identity Cards traveling to Guam, do so on a direct, nonstop flight. The removal
of the restriction is the result of an evaluation conducted by the Service that indicated that there were only two instances
of abuse of the Guam Visa Waiver Program by non-Taiwan residents detected by the Service since Taiwan was temporarily
added to the Program on July 15, 1993. This rule facilitates the travel of certain residents of Taiwan to visit Guam
under certain conditions. It enables holders of Taiwan passports who begin their travel in Taiwan and who are in possession
of Taiwan National Identity Cards to visit Guam as nonimmigrant visitors for up to 15 days for business or pleasure
without first obtaining a nonimmigrant visitor visa at an American consulate abroad.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
supplementary information: 

Under section 212(1)(1) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (Act), certain visitors from designated countries
may visit Guam for up to 15 days without having to obtain nonimmigrant visitor visas from American consulates outside
the United States.



First implemented on October 1, 1988, this program resulted in thousands of nonimmigrant visitors from Australia,
Brunei, Burma, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Nauru, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, the Republic of Korea, Singapore,
the Solomon Islands, the United Kingdom (including citizens of the colony of Hong Kong), Vanuatu and Western Samoa,
visiting Guam under the conditions mentioned in the summary.

On July 15, 1993, the Service published an interim rule with request for comments, in the 

Federal Register

, at 58 FR 38045-38046, temporarily adding Taiwan through July 15, 1994, to the list meeting the eligibility
criteria for the Guam Visa Waiver Program, implemented under the Omnibus Territories Act of 1986, Public Law 99-396.
This rule removes the one-year restriction on Taiwan's inclusion in the program.

Since the Service was concerned about potential abuse by non-Taiwan residents attempting to enter the United States
illegally, only residents of Taiwan in possession of Taiwan National Identity Cards, in addition to valid Taiwan
passports with valid re-entry permits issued by the Taiwan Ministry of Foreign Affairs, were included in the Guam
Visa Waiver Program. In addition, there was a further restriction that persons must travel on a direct, nonstop flight
from Taiwan to Guam.

Since Taiwan's inclusion in the program, only two instances of abuse of the Guam Visa Waiver Program, by non-Taiwan
residents, were detected by the Service. However, the requirement that Taiwan residents seeking to enter Guam under
this program do so on a direct non-stop flight from Taiwan had an unforeseeable impact on the tourist industry in the
Commonwealth of the Northern Marianas when the air carrier serving Guam from Taiwan via Saipan eliminated the Saipan
stop. Four comments were received by the Service concerning the change of service to the Northern Marianas. These
comments all came from the Office of the Governor, Commonwealth of the Northern Marianas, protesting that the non-stop
requirement of the interim rule negatively affected tourism in the Commonwealth because Taiwan residents could
no longer travel easily to the Commonwealth.

The Service agrees with these comments and has amended the rule to remove the direct non-stop flight requirement.
However, to address the potential for abuse by non-Taiwan residents seeking to enter the United States, the rule will
be amended to reflect that only holders of Taiwan passports who are residents of Taiwan who begin their travel to Guam
in Taipei and arrive in Guam without an intermediate layover will be eligible to participate in the Guam Visa Waiver
Program. Such travellers will be further restricted to those who arrive on a flight which has not had an intermediate
stop except in a territory of the United States. The Service reserves the right to reinstate the direct non-stop flight
requirement by means of a notice in the 

Federal Register

 should the percentage of inadmissible passengers arriving in Guam who have transited a territory of the United States
enroute to Guam exceed 20 percent of all inadmissible passengers arriving in Guam for two consecutive months.

The Commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility
Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), has reviewed this regulation and by approving it certifies that the rule will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities because of the following factors: this rule merely removes
a restriction on travel, and will have a positive economic impact for Guam by increasing tourism.

This rule is not considered by the Department of Justice, Immigration and Naturalization Service, to be a ``significant
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866, section 3(f), Regulatory Planning and Review, and the Office of
Management and Budget has waived its review process under section 6(a)(3)(A).

The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effect on the States, on the relationship between
the National Government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this rule does not have
sufficient Federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.

The Commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service certifies that she has assessed this rule in light
of the criteria in Executive Order 12606 and has determined that this regulation will enhance family well-being by
allowing eligible Taiwan families to readily come to Guam on vacation.

National Identity Cards and a valid Taiwan passport with a valid re-entry permit issued by the Taiwan Ministry of Foreign
Affairs. It does not refer to any other holder of a Taiwan passport or a passport issued by the People's Republic of China.

Brucellosis Surveillance; MCI Reactor Prevalence Rates



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, USDA. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 We are amending the brucellosis regulations to eliminate the requirement that States maintain specified Market
Cattle Identification (MCI) reactor prevalence rates to maintain their official classifications. We are instead
requiring the States to successfully close (epidemiologically investigate and resolve) certain percentages of
cases detected through the MCI program. We believe these amendments will better serve Federal and State animal health
officials in their efforts to prevent the interstate spread of brucellosis. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Background



Brucellosis is an infectious disease of certain animals and humans. In its principal animal hosts, it is characterized
by abortion and impaired fertility. Through a cooperative Federal-State effort, the United States is now approaching
total eradication of the field strain 

Brucella abortus

 in domestic cattle and bison herds. As of June 1994, there were only 235 known infected cattle and bison herds, and the
U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) had declared 33 States, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands free of the
disease. Fewer than 400 new infected herds were identified last year.

The regulations in 9 CFR part 78 (referred to below as the regulations) govern the interstate movement of cattle, bison,
and swine to prevent the spread of brucellosis.

On January 14, 1994, we published in the 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 2312-2316, Docket No. 93-024-1) a proposal to eliminate the requirement in the regulations
that States meet specific MCI reactor prevalence rates to maintain their official classifications. We also proposed
to require that to maintain their official classifications, States must successfully close a specified percentage
of MCI reactor cases.

We solicited comments concerning our proposal for a 30-day comment period ending February 14, 1994. On February 11,
1994, we published in the 

Federal Register

 a notice extending the comment period to March 14, 1994 (59 FR 6593, Docket No. 93-024-2). We received four
comments by that date, three from Federal veterinarians and one from the American Veterinary Medical Association
(AVMA). We carefully considered all of the comments we received. They are discussed below:

<PARENT> FR940713-0-00005 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The AVMA comment supported the proposal as written. The other three comments all suggested that language in a particular
paragraph in the proposal be deleted.

The language in question occurs in the definition of ``Class A State or area'' in  78.1(a)(2)(ii)(B)

(2)

, and is repeated in the definitions ``Class B State or area,'' ``Class C State or area,'' and ``Class Free State or area.''
The issue at hand is what action a designated epidemiologist must take after determining that brucellosis reactors
are present in a herd. The regulations require that such herds must be subjected to herd blood tests or quarantined
unless: 




(

2

) Evidence indicates that the brucellosis reactor is from a herd that no longer presents a risk of spreading brucellosis,
or is from a herd that is unlikely to be infected with brucellosis. Such evidence could include, but is not limited to,
situations where:

(

i

) The brucellosis reactor is traced back to a herd that has been sold for slaughter in entirety;

(

ii

) The brucellosis reactor is traced back to a herd that is certified brucellosis free and is 100-percent vaccinated;
or,

(

iii

) The brucellosis reactor showed a low titer in the MCI test and is traced back to a dairy herd that is 100 percent vaccinated
and has tested negative to the most recent brucellosis ring test required by this section for herds producing milk
for sale. 




Three commenters opposed inclusion of the language in (

i

), (

ii

), and (

iii

) that provides guidance to designated epidemiologists on how to determine that a herd where a positive MCI blood sample
was collected no longer presents a risk of spreading brucellosis, or is unlikely to be infected with brucellosis.

The commenters made the point that designated epidemiologists are highly trained professionals who are responsible,
among other duties, for determining when a herd situation presents a risk of spreading brucellosis. The commenters
believe that designated epidemiologists are fully capable of determining what evidence is relevant to such a decision,
and interpreting the evidence. As one commenter put it, ``each individual situation should be evaluated with sound
epidemiological principles which cannot be adequately enumerated by a `predetermined list'.''

We agree that no list of risk scenarios in the regulations, however extensive, could substitute for the professional
judgment and experience of a designated epidemiologist. We rely on continuing education programs the Animal and
Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) mandates for designated epidemiologists, and review of their decisions
by other USDA epidemiologists, to ensure they make reasonable determinations with regard to brucellosis risks.
We did not attempt to provide a ``cookbook'' list in the regulations to substitute for this system of professional
judgment backed by continuing education and review by professional peers.

The proposed language cites three situations that 

could 

provide evidence that a herd that no longer presents a risk of spreading brucellosis, or is unlikely to be infected
with brucellosis. These examples were provided by epidemiologists from their own experience as examples of frequently
occurring situations where the risk of spreading brucellosis is mitigated. The proposed language specifically
says that ``evidence could include, but is not limited to'' the described situations. The examples were provided
not for the benefit of designated epidemiologists, who are well aware of their relevance, but for the benefit of members
of the public who may be affected by the regulations. We believe it will aid public understanding of the regulations
to see some examples of situations that could provide evidence that a herd with an MCI reactor no longer presents a risk
of spreading brucellosis, or is unlikely to be infected with brucellosis.

Therefore, based on the rationale set forth in the proposed rule and in this document, we are adopting the provisions
of the proposed rule as a final rule, without change.



Executive Order 12866 and Regulatory Flexibility Act



This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12866. The rule has been determined to be not significant for
purposes of Executive Order 12866 and, therefore, has not been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget.

Only State animal health agencies will be affected by this rule; it will have no effect on the private sector. State
animal health officials will need to provide other States with information on only the MCI reactors detected each
month instead of total numbers of MCI test cattle slaughtered. They will also need to maintain records of the numbers
of MCI reactor cases that are successfully closed and report the percentage of successfully closed cases annually
to APHIS. The States are already required to carry out the activities that constitute successful case closure.

Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that
this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.



Executive Order 12372



This program/activity is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance under No. 10.025 and is subject to Executive
Order 12372, which requires intergovernmental consultation with State and local officials. (See 7 CFR part 3015,
subpart V.)



Executive Order 12778



This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This rule: (1) Preempts all State and
local laws and regulations that are in conflict with it; (2) has no retroactive effect; and (3) does not require administrative
proceedings before parties may file suit in court challenging this rule.



Paperwork Reduction Act



In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq.

), the information collection or recordkeeping requirements included in this rule have been submitted for approval
to the Office of Management and Budget.

Licensee Submittal of Data in Computer-Readable Form


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Nuclear Regulatory Commission.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Nuclear Regulatory Commission is amending its regulations to require certain licensees to submit data to the
NRC in computer-readable format. The final rule streamlines the collection of nuclear material transaction data
and increases the accuracy of the reported information. The final rule will save money for both NRC and licensees in
the data collection process.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
Background


The NRC has a major interest in the potential use for computer-readable submittal. This innovation not only can result
in monetary savings, but also can increase efficiency and accuracy of data collection efforts. In the past, the NRC
has permitted the use of computer-readable forms as well as the use of computer generated facsimiles of the printed
forms. Many licensees now generate their own facsimiles. The latest revision of ``Personal Computer Data Input for
NRC Licensees'' (Nuclear Materials Management and Safeguards System (NMMSS) Report D-24) contains specific
procedures for submitting in computer-readable format: DOE/NRC Form 741, ``Nuclear Material Transaction Report'';
DOE/NRC Form 741A, ``Nuclear Material Transaction Report (Continuation Page)''; DOE/NRC Form 740M, ``Concise
Note''; DOE/NRC Form 742, ``Material Balance Report''; and DOE/NRC Form 742C, ``Physical Inventory Listing.''
The amendments make mandatory the reporting in computer-readable format prescribed by the D-24 document.
These amendments eliminate the need for paper forms, thus providing a cost saving for the NRC in satisfying its statutory
and treaty obligations.
The amendments affect each licensee who transfers, receives, or adjusts the inventory, in any manner, of uranium
or thorium source material of foreign origin by 1 kilogram or more. Each specific licensee who transfers or receives
1 gram or more of contained uranium-235, uranium-233, or plutonium would also be affected.
These amendments are intended only to take advantage of current computer technology and to make the data collection
process more efficient and less costly. The Commission believes there will be minimal costs associated with the implementation
of these amendments. Many licensees already have their material accounting automated and can generate computer-readable
reports. For those licensees who have not yet automated their reporting, a diskette with the appropriate formats
and user prompts may be obtained from the NRC to facilitate this process. Licensees may obtain a copy of the NMMSS report
or the diskette by writing the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Division of Fuel Cycle Safety and Safeguards,
Washington, DC 20555-0001.

On January 26, 1993 (58 FR 6098), the Commission published a proposed rule in the 

Federal Register

 to make mandatory licensee submittal in computer-readable format. A 90-day comment period expired on April 26, 1993.
Comments were received from nine respondents. Two comments were not in favor of the amendments, whereas the others
expressed approval and encouragement to take advantage of today's technology. Several constructive suggestions
were made and are included in the summary of public comments.


Summary of Public Comment


A summary of the public comments and a clarifying response follows:
(1) 

Continued requirement for hard copy forms. 

Several respondents expressed the continued need for hard copy forms. One commenter stated their material control
and accounting (MC&A) program is based upon a ``paper trail'' utilizing the DOE/NRC Form 741. Another commenter
stated the continued requirement for submitting hard copies to various Department of Energy contractors. Another
commenter raised the question of storage of records for a period of time specified by Commission regulations. Concern
also was expressed regarding secondary distribution requirements of hard copy DOE/NRC Form 741 for certain domestic
transactions and all import and export transactions. Finally one commenter stated the current requirements, which
provide for both computer-readable and hard copy, are the more acceptable.
The final amendments require licensees to submit 
computer-readable reports to the NRC in a format prescribed in NMMSS Report D-24. The amendments do not preclude
other formats used for other purposes. Many licensees already generate facsimile reports for satisfying given requirements.
Licensees that have no capability to produce these facsimiles may use the diskette provided by the NRC which can generate
a facsimile (either hard copy or disk file for storage) of all forms subject to these amendments. With regard to records
retention, the NRC permits the storage of records on electronic media with the capability for producing legible,
accurate, and complete records during the required retention period. This would include computer generated facsimiles
of forms subject to these amendments. For the reporting system to operate efficiently, computer-readable submittal
for NRC's use is necessary.
(2) 

Accepting shipper's values. 

A respondent suggested that the action code and date on the computer-readable DOE/NRC Form 741 for a shipment can be
easily changed by the recipient to reflect accepting shipper's values.
The diskette that is available from the NRC includes a program for editing the file of a computer-readable DOE/NRC
Form 741 to edit the action code and date to reflect accepting shipper's values.
(3) 

Telecommunication of licensee submittal. 

Four respondents urged the transmission of the computer-readable files over a modem instead of using diskettes.
There is no disagreement with the commenters that modem transmission is desirable. Transmitting files by modem to
satisfy reporting requirements is an option of these amendments. The NRC will work with any licensee desiring this
option.
(4) 

Revision of guidance documents. 

Several respondents noted the need to revise the guidance documents: NUREG/BR-0006, ``Instructions for Completing
Nuclear Material Transaction Reports and Concise Note Forms''; NUREG/BR-0007, ``Instructions for Completing
Material Balance Report and Physical Inventory Listing''; and NMMSS Report D-24, ``Personal Computer Data
Input for NRC Licensees,'' to be compatible with the submittal of computer-readable formats.
NMMSS Report D-24 has been revised to include all the forms required in these amendments. The other guidance
documents will be revised, as needed, to reflect the use of computer-readable forms to replace the paper forms.


Environmental Impact: Categorical Exclusion


The NRC has determined that this final rule is the type of action described in the categorical exclusion 10 CFR 51.22(c)(2).
Therefore, neither an environmental impact statement nor an environmental assessment has been prepared for this
rule.


Paperwork Reduction Act Statement


This final rule amends information collection requirements that are subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980
(44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.). These requirements were approved by the Office of Management and Budget, approval numbers
3150-0003, -0057, -0004, and -0058.
Because the rule will eliminate the need for certain paper forms, the public burden for this collection of information
is expected to be reduced. The reduction in burden for the DOE/NRC Forms 741, 741A, 742, and 740M is estimated to average
.25 hours per response. The reduction in burden for the DOE/NRC Form 742C is estimated to average 2 hours per response,
including the time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the
data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information. Send comments regarding the estimated
burden reduction or any other aspect of this collection of information, including suggestions for further reducing
reporting burden, to the Information and Records Management Branch (MNBB-7714), U.S. Nuclear Regulatory
Commission, Washington, DC 20555-0001; and to the Desk Officer, Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs,
NEOB-3019 (3150-0003, -0004, -0057, and -0058), Office of Management and Budget, Washington,
DC 20503.


Regulatory Analysis


These final amendments have no significant impact on State and local governments and geographical regions. They
have a significant positive impact on the efficiency and accuracy of the data collection process. The final amendments
do not have a significant impact on health, safety, and the environment. This rule requires that all licensees submit
computer-readable reports regarding special nuclear material transactions. The NRC will realize a significant
cost savings. Licensees have already demonstrated their computer expertise by generating near-perfect copies
of the current forms on Laser Jet printers. Generating computer-readable data in accordance with a prescribed format
offers less burden than producing these near-perfect copies. The rule will facilitate the collection of data by the
NRC to satisfy its statutory and treaty obligations. This constitutes the regulatory analysis for this final rule.

Regulatory Flexibility Certification 



In accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 
(5 U.S.C. 605(b)), the Commission certifies that this change does not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities. This final rule affects all licensees required to report special nuclear material transactions
using DOE/NRC Forms 741, 741A, 742, 742C, and 740M. Owners of nuclear power plants and fuel fabrication plants have
already automated most, if not all, of their material accounting program and can easily generate computer-readable
reports. Other affected licensees include laboratories, universities, colleges, medical clinics and hospitals,
some of which may fall within the scope of the NRC's size standards for determination of which NRC licensees qualify
as small entities (December 9, 1985; 50 FR 50241). 

One commenter stated that the proposed rule would increase the burden for licensees with manual accountability systems
by requiring manual entry of data to diskette and a hard-copy data check for accuracy. Entities that may not yet have
automated their reporting may obtain a diskette from the NRC to assist them in satisfying their reporting requirements.
No respondent has stated a lack of computer capability to use such a diskette, and the likelihood of such a need is remote
in view of the types of affected licensees. In addition, NRC staff experience with computer readable transfer of information
indicates less burden and more efficiency for licensees and the NRC than transfer of hard-copy information. For these
reasons, any initial cost associated with preparation of computer readable reports should be minimal and lead to
a reduction in reporting burden for all affected licensees. 



Backfit Analysis 



The NRC has determined that a backfit analysis is not required for this final rule because these amendments do not involve
any provisions that would impose backfits as defined in 10 CFR 50.109(a)(1).

``Calvados,'' and ``Brandy de Jerez'' to distilled spirits products produced in certain Member States of the EU.
Under the agreement, the EU agreed to restrict, within its regulatory framework of Council Regulation (EU) No. 1576/89,
the use of the product designations ``Tennessee whisky/Tennessee whiskey,'' ``Bourbon whisky/Bourbon whiskey,''
and ``Bourbon'' to distilled spirits products of the United States. In both situations, the products remain subject
to all of the labeling requirements of the United States and the EU, respectively. 

In implementing the bilateral agreement, the United States believes that an administrative interpretation of the
existing regulations is sufficient to afford the restrictive recognition required by the agreement for ``Armagnac,''
``Calvados,'' and ``Brandy de Jerez.'' The reference to administrative measures in the agreement authorizes the
ruling approach for implementing the agreement. 

The regulations currently provide restrictive recognition to ``Irish whisky/Irish whiskey,'' ``Scotch whisky,''
and ``Cognac.'' 

The ruling will appear in a future issue of the ATF bulletin. The full and exact text of the ATF Ruling follows for the
information and reference of the industry and the public.

ATF Ruling 94-5 



27 CFR 5.22(k)(3): Class 11; geographical designations. 



The requirements in 27 CFR 5.22(k)(3) provide that geographical names that are not names for distinctive types of
distilled spirits, and that have not become generic, shall not be applied to distilled spirits produced in any other
place than the particular place or region indicated in the name. The names ``Armagnac,'' ``Calvados,'' and ``Brandy
de Jerez'' are geographical names within section 5.22(k)(3) and shall not apply to distilled spirits products other
than those produced in the particular place or region indicated by such names. Further, such ``Armagnac'' (France),
``Calvados'' (France), and ``Brandy de Jerez'' (Spain) must be produced in accordance with the regulations of the
European Union and the laws of the Member States in which those products originate.



In recent negotiations concluding in an exchange of letters between the United States (US) and European Union (EU)
regarding distilled spirits, the US agreed to restrict, within its regulatory framework of 27 CFR 5.22 (or equivalent
successor regulation) the use of the product designations ``Armagnac,'' ``Calvados,'' ``Cognac,'' ``Brandy de
Jerez,'' ``Irish whisky/Irish whiskey,'' and ``Scotch whisky'' to distilled spirits products of the Member States
of the EU, produced in compliance with Council Regulation (EU) No. 1576/89 and with the laws of the Member States in
which those products originate. Further, it is recognized that these products shall continue to be subject to all
of the labeling requirements of the US for products imported into the US. 

In like manner, the EU agreed to restrict, within its regulatory framework of Council Regulation (EU) No. 1576/89,
Article 11 (or equivalent successor regulation), the use of the product designations ``Bourbon,'' ``Bourbon whisky/Bourbon
whiskey,'' and ``Tennessee whisky/Tennessee whiskey,'' to distilled spirits products of the US, produced in compliance
with the laws and regulations (27 CFR 5.22 or equivalent successor regulation) of the US. Further, it is recognized
that these products shall continue to be subject to all of the labeling requirements of the EU for products imported
into the EU. 

The names ``Cognac,'' ``Irish whisky/Irish whiskey,'' and ``Scotch whisky'' are already restricted to products
of France, Republic of Ireland or in Northern Ireland, and Scotland, respectively, by the standard of identity regulations
for distilled spirits in 27 CFR 5.22. 

Section 5.22(k)(3) of the distilled spirits regulations establishes a standard of identity for products having
geographical designations. Under this section, geographical names that are not distinctive types of distilled
spirits, and that have not become generic, shall not be applied to distilled spirits produced in any other place than
the particular place or region indicated in the name. 



Held: 

The names ``Armagnac,'' ``Calvados,'' and ``Brandy de Jerez'' are geographical designations within section 5.22(k)(3)
and shall not apply to distilled spirits products other than those produced in the particular place or region indicated
by such name. Further, such ``Armagnac'' (France), ``Calvados'' (France), and ``Brandy de Jerez'' (Spain) must
be produced in accordance with regulations of the EU and the laws of the Member States in which those products originate.




Held further: 

``Armagnac,'' ``Calvados,'' ``Cognac,'' ``Brandy de Jerez,'' ``Irish whisky/Irish whiskey,'' and ``Scotch whisky''
imported into the US shall continue to be subject to all of the labeling requirements for distilled spirits under 27
CFR Part 5.

Revision of Regulations To Exempt Privacy Act Systems of Records



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Postal Service.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 Postal Service regulations exempt certain systems of records that it maintains from certain provisions of the Privacy
Act. This rule does not alter past application of exemptions but merely provides an explanation of the reasons for
applying specific exemptions to certain systems of records.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Postal Service regulations (39 CFR 266.9) exempt certain systems of records from specific provisions of the Privacy
Act. This rule amends those regulations to include the reasons for applying the exemptions. Those reasons were stated
in the preamble of the notice of proposed rulemaking at the time the Postal Service adopted the exemptions. 40 
FR 37227 (August 26, 1975). 



The proposed rule with invitation to comment was published in the 

Federal Register

. 59 FR 17749 (April 14, 1994). No comments were received. 



List of Subjects in 39 CFR Part 266 



Privacy.

 


For the reasons set out in this document, the Postal Service amends part 266 of 39 CFR as follows: 



PART 266_PRIVACY OF INFORMATION 



1. The authority citation for part 266 continues to read as follows:






Authority:

 39 U.S.C. 401; 5 U.S.C. 552a.




2. Section 266.9 is revised to read as follows: 



 266.9

Exemptions. 



(a) Subsections 552a(j) and (k) of title 5, U.S.C., empower the Postmaster General to exempt systems of records meeting
certain criteria from various other subsections of section 552a. With respect to systems of records so exempted,
nothing in this part shall require compliance with provisions hereof implementing any subsections of section 552a
from which those systems have been exempted. 

(b) At paragraph (b)(1) of this section is a summary of the Act's provisions for which exemption is claimed pursuant
to, and to the extent permitted by, subsections 552a(j) and (k) of title 5, U.S.C., for some systems of records. Paragraphs
(b)(2) through (6) of this section identify the exempted systems of records, the exemptions applied to each, and the
reasons for the exemptions: 

(1) 

Explanation of the Act's provisions for which an exemption is claimed in the systems discussed below. 

(i) Subsection (c)(3) requires an agency to make available to the individual named in the records an accounting of
each disclosure of records. 

(ii) Subsection (c)(4) requires an agency to inform any person or other agency to which a record has been disclosed
of any correction or notation of dispute the agency has made to the record in accordance with subsection (d) of the Act.

<PARENT> FR940713-0-00011 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(iii) Subsection (d)(1)-(4) requires an agency to permit an individual to gain access to records about the individual,
to request amendment of such records, to request a review of an agency decision not to amend such records, and to provide
a statement of disagreement about a disputed record to be filed and disclosed with the disputed record. 

(iv) Subsection (e)(1) requires an agency to maintain in its records only such information about an individual that
is relevant and necessary to accomplish a purpose required by statute or executive order of the President. 

(v) Subsection (e)(2) requires an agency to collect information to the greatest extent practicable directly from
the subject individual when the information may result in adverse determinations about an individual's rights,
benefits, and privileges under federal programs. 

(vi) Subsection (e)(3) requires an agency to inform each person whom it asks to supply information of the authority
under which the information is sought, the purposes for which the information will be used, the routine uses that may
be made of the information, whether disclosure is mandatory or voluntary, and the effects of not providing the information.


(vii) Subsection (e)(4) (G) and (H) requires an agency to publish a 

Federal Register

 notice of its procedures whereby an individual can be notified upon request whether the system of records contains
information about the individual, how to gain access to any record about the individual contained in the system, and
how to contest its content. 

(viii) Subsection (e)(5) requires an agency to maintain its records with such accuracy, relevance, timeliness,
and completeness as is reasonably necessary to ensure fairness to the individual in making any determination about
the individual. 

(ix) Subsection (e)(8) requires an agency to make reasonable efforts to serve notice on an individual when any record
on such individual is made available to any person under compulsory legal process when such process becomes a matter
of public record. 

(x) Subsection (f) requires an agency to establish procedures whereby an individual can be notified upon request
if any system of records named by the individual contains a record pertaining to the individual, obtain access to the
record, and request amendment. 

(xi) Subsection (g) provides for civil remedies if an agency fails to comply with the access and amendment provisions
of subsections (d)(1) and (d)(3), and with other provisions of the Act, or any rule promulgated thereunder, in such
a way as to have an adverse effect on an individual.

(xii) Subsection (m) requires an agency to cause the requirements of the Act to be applied to a contractor operating
a system of records to accomplish an agency function. 

(2) 

Inspection Requirements_Investigative File System, USPS 080.010; Inspection Requirements_Mail Cover Program,
USPS 080.020. 

These systems of records are exempt from 5 U.S.C. 552a (c) (3) and (4), (d)(1)-(4), (e)(1)-(3), (e)(4)
(G) and (H), (e) (5) and (8), (f), (g), and (m). The reasons for exemption follow: 

(i) Disclosure to the record subject pursuant to subsections (c)(3), (c)(4), or (d)(1)-(4) could (A) Alert
subjects that they are targets of an investigation or mail cover; (B) alert subjects of the nature and scope of the investigation,
and of evidence obtained; (C) enable the subject of an investigation to avoid detection or apprehension; (D) subject
confidential sources, witnesses, and law enforcement personnel to harassment or intimidation if their identities
were released to the target of an investigation; (E) constitute unwarranted invasions of the personal privacy of
third parties who are involved in a certain investigation; (F) intimidate potential witnesses and cause them to be
reluctant to offer information; (G) lead to the improper influencing of witnesses, the destruction or alteration
of evidence yet to be discovered, the fabrication of testimony, or the compromising of classified material; and (H)
seriously impede or compromise law enforcement, mail cover, or background investigations that might involve law
enforcement aspects as a result of the above. 

(ii) Application of subsections (e)(1) and (e)(5) is impractical because the relevance, necessity, or correctness
of specific information might be established only after considerable analysis and as the investigation progresses.
As to relevance (subsection (e)(1)), effective law enforcement requires the keeping of information not relevant
to a specific Postal Service investigation. Such information may be kept to provide leads for appropriate law enforcement
and to establish patterns of activity that might relate to the jurisdiction of the Postal Inspection Service and/or
other agencies. As to accuracy (subsection (e)(5)), the correctness of records sometimes can be established only
in a court of law. 

(iii) Application of subsections (e)(2) and (e)(3) would require collection of information directly from the subject
of a potential or ongoing investigation. The subject would be put on alert that he or she is a target of an investigation
or mail cover, enabling avoidance of detection or apprehension, thereby seriously compromising law enforcement,
mail cover, or background investigations involving law enforcement aspects. Moreover, in certain circumstances
the subject of an investigation is not required to provide information to investigators, and information must be
collected from other sources.

(iv) The requirements of subsections (e)(4)(G) and (H), and (f) do not apply because this system is exempt from the
individual access and amendment provisions of subsection (d). Nevertheless, the Postal Service has published notice
of its notification, access, and contest procedures because access is appropriate in some cases. 

(v) Application of subsection (e)(8) could prematurely reveal an ongoing criminal investigation to the subject
of the investigation. 

(vi) The provisions of subsection (g) do not apply because exemption from the provisions of subsection (d) renders
the provisions on suits to enforce subsection (d) inapplicable. 

(vii) If one of these systems of records is operated in whole or in part by a contractor, the exemptions claimed herein
shall remain applicable to it (subsection (m)). 

(3) 

Personnel Records_Preemployment Investigation Records, USPS 120.110; Personnel Records_Postmaster Selection
Program Records, USPS 120.130. 

These systems of records are exempt from 5 U.S.C. 552a(d)(1)-(4) and (e)(1) to the extent that information in
the system is subject to exemption under 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(5) as relating to the identity of a source who furnished information
to the government in confidence as a part of an investigation conducted solely for the purpose of determining suitability,
eligibility, or qualifications of an individual for employment. The reasons for exemption follow: 

(i) During its investigation and evaluation of an applicant for a position, the Postal Service contacts individuals
who, without an assurance of anonymity, would refuse to provide information concerning the subject of the investigation.
If a record subject were given access pursuant to subsection (d)(1)-(4), the promised confidentiality would
be breached and the 
confidential source would be identified. The result would be restriction of the free flow of information vital to
a determination of an individual's qualifications and suitability for appointment to or continued occupancy of
his position. 

(ii) In collecting information for investigative and evaluative purposes, it is impossible to determine in advance
what information might be of assistance in determining the qualifications and suitability of an individual for appointment.
Information that seems irrelevant, when linked with other information, can sometimes provide a composite picture
of an individual that assists in determining whether that individual should be appointed to or retained in a position.
For this reason, exemption from subsection (e)(1) is claimed. 

(4) 

Personnel Records_Personnel Research and Test Validation Records, USPS 120.120; Personnel Records_Career Development
and Training Records, USPS 120.152. 

These systems of records are exempt from 5 U.S.C. 552a(d)(1)-(4), (e)(4)(G) and (H), and (f) to the extent that
information in the system is subject to exemption pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(6) as relating to the compromise of
the objectivity or fairness of the testing or examination process. The reasons for exemption follow: 

(i) These systems contain questions and answers to standard testing materials, the disclosure of which would compromise
the fairness of the future use of these materials. It is not feasible to develop entirely new examinations after each
administration as would be necessary if questions or answers were available for inspection and copying. Consequently,
exemption from subsection (d) is claimed. 

(ii) The requirements of subsections (e)(4)(G) and (H), and (f) do not apply to these systems for which exemption from
subsection (d) of the Act has been claimed. Nevertheless, the Postal Service has published notice of its notification,
access, and contest procedures because access to system records that do not compromise the objectivity or fairness
of the testing examination process is appropriate in some cases. 

(5) 

Personnel Records_Recruiting, Examining, and Appointment Records, USPS 120.151. 

This system is exempt from 5 U.S.C. 552a(d)(1)-(4), (e)(1), (e)(4)(G) and (H), and (f) to the extent that information
in the system is subject to exemption pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(5) as relating to the identity of a source who has
furnished information to the government in confidence as part of an investigation conducted solely for the purpose
of determining suitability, eligibility, or qualifications of an individual for employment; and to exemption pursuant
to subsection 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(6) as relating to the compromise of the objectivity or fairness of the testing or examination
process. The reasons for exemption follow: 

(i) To the extent that information in this system is subject to exemption pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(5), application
of the provisions at subsection (d)(1)-(4) would reveal to the applicant whose suitability is being investigated
the identity of individuals who supplied information under a promise of anonymity. As a result, the Postal Service's
promise of confidentiality would be breached, its ability to obtain information in the future would be diminished,
and the information source could be subjected to harassment by the applicant. To the extent that information in this
system is subject to exemption pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(6), the requirements of the exemption at subsection (d)(1)-(4)
and the reasons for exempting information relating to the compromise of the objectivity or fairness of the testing
or examination process are the same as those given in paragraph (b)(5)(i) of this section.

(ii) The reasons for exempting this system of records from subsection (e)(1) are the same as those given in paragraph
(b)(4)(ii) of this section. 
(iii) The requirements of subsections (e) (4) (G) and (H), and (f) do not apply to this system for which exemption from
subsection (d) of the Act has been claimed. Nevertheless, the Postal Service has published notice of its notification,
access, and contest procedures because access to system records that do not compromise the objectivity or fairness
of the testing or examination process or reveal the identity of a confidential is appropriate in some cases. 
(6) 

Equal Employment Opportunity_EEO Discrimination Complaint Investigations, USPS 030.010. 

This system is exempt from 5 U.S.C. 552a(d) (1)-(4), (e) (4) (G) and (H), and (f) to the extent that information
in the system is subject to exemption pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2) as material compiled for law enforcement purposes
and subsection (k)(5) as relating to the identity of a source who has furnished information to the government in confidence
as a part of an investigation conducted solely for the purpose of determining suitability, eligibility, or qualifications
of an individual for employment. The reasons for exemption follow. 

(i) To the extent that information in this system is subject to exemption pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2), application
of the requirements of the exemption at subsection (d)(1)-(4) would cause disruption of enforcement of the
laws relating to equal employment opportunity (EEO). To the extent that information in this system is subject to exemption
pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(5), application of the provisions at subsection (d)(1)-(4) would reveal to the
EEO complainant the identity of individuals who supplied information under a promise of anonymity. It is essential
to the integrity of the EEO complaint system that information collected in the investigative process not be prematurely
disclosed and that witnesses be free from restraint, interference, coercion, or reprisal. 
(ii) The requirements of subsections (e) (4) (G) and (H), and (f) do not apply to this system for which exemption from
subsection (d) of the Act has been claimed. Nevertheless, the Postal Service has published notice of its notification,
access, and contest procedures because access to system records that do not compromise the investigative process
or reveal the identity of confidential sources is appropriate in some cases.

Pesticide Tolerances for Glufosinate Ammonium 




<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document establishes time-limited tolerances for residues of the herbicide glufosinate ammonium [ammonium
DL-homoalanine-4-yl-(methyl phosphinate)] and its metabolite, 3-methylphosphinico-propionic acid, in or on
raw agricultural commodities (RAC's) apples and grapes at 0.05 part per million (ppm) and tree nuts group (except
almonds) at 0.1 ppm. Hoechst Celanese Corp. (now AgrEvo) requested these tolerances in petitions submitted to EPA.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 In the 

Federal Register

 of May 25, 1988 (53 FR 18897), EPA issued a notice announcing that Hoechst Celanese Corp., Route 202-208 North, Sommerville,
NJ 08878, had submitted a pesticide petition (PP 8F3607) proposing to amend 40 CFR part 180 by establishing a regulation
pursuant to section 408 of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, 21 U.S.C. 346a, to permit the residues of the herbicide
monoammonium 2-amino-4-(hydroxymethylphosphinyl)-butanoate (expressed as 2-amino-4-(hydroxymethylphosphinyl)-butanoic
acid) and 3-methylphosphinicopropionic acid (expressed as 2-amino-4-(hydroxymethylphosphinyl)-butanoic
acid), in or on soybean seed, apples, grapes, field corn (grain, forage, silage, and fodder), and nuts at 0.05 ppm and
almond hulls at 0.50 ppm. This petition was assigned the number 8F3607. The proposed analytical method for determining
residues was high-pressure liquid chromatography.


There were no comments of request for referral to an advisory committee received in response to the notice of filing.
The petitioner subsequently amended the petition by withdrawing the tolerance proposal for residues of the active
ingredient and its metabolite in or on soybean seed, field corn grain, field corn forage, field corn silage, and field
corn fodder. Since this revision decreases the pesticide burden on the environment, it was not published for comment.
The data submitted in the petition and other relevant material have been evaluated. The toxicology data listed below
were considered in support of these tolerances.
1. A battery of acute toxicity studies placing technical glufosinate-ammonium in Toxicity Categories II and III.
2. A 90-day feeding study in rats at dietary intakes of 0, 0.52, 4.1, 32, or 263 mg/kg/day with a no-observed-effect
level (NOEL) of 4.1 mg/kg/day. The lowest-observed-effect level (LOEL) was established at 32 mg/kg/day based on
increased absolute and relative kidney weights.
3. A 90-day feeding study in mice at dietary intakes of 0, 16.6, 67.1, or 278 mg/kg/day with a NOEL of 16.6 mg/kg/day and
a LOEL of 67.1 mg/kg/day based on increased absolute and relative liver weights (both sexes) and an increase in serum
potassium levels (males).
4. Three teratology studies in rats at doses from 0.5 to 250 mg/kg/day with no teratogenic effects occurring up to and
including 250 mg/kg/day. A NOEL for developmental toxicity was 2.24 mg/kg/day, based upon an increase in the incidence
of dilated renal pelvis with hydroureter in the fetuses at 10 mg/kg/day. The maternal NOEL was also 2.24 mg/kg/day.
5. A teratology study in rabbits at doses of 0, 2, 6.3, or 20 mg/kg/day with no teratogenic effects occurring up to and
including 20 mg/kg/day, and a maternal NOEL of 6.3 mg/kg/day and a developmental NOEL of 20 mg/kg/day, the highest
dose tested.
6. A two-generation reproduction study in rats at dietary concentrations of 0, 40, 120, or 360 ppm with a NOEL for reproductive
effects at 120 ppm (equivalent to 12 mg/kg/day) based upon reduced number of pups in the high dose group. The NOEL for
parental toxicity was also 120 ppm based upon increased kidney weights in the high-dose group.
7. A 12-month feeding study in dogs at doses of 0, 2, 5, or 8.5 mg/kg/day. The NOEL was 5.0 mg/kg/day based upon the death
of one male and one female dog at 8.5 mg/kg/day with no other treatment-related toxicity.
8. A mouse carcinogenicity study at doses of 0, 2.8, 10.8, or 22.7 mg/kg/day in males and 0, 4.2, 16.2, or 64.0 mg/kg/day
in females for 104 weeks with no carcinogenic effects observed under the conditions of the study up to and including
64 mg/kg/day and a systemic NOEL of 10.8 and 16.2 for males and females, respectively, based on the dose-related increase
in mortality.
9. A chronic feeding/carcinogenicity study in rats at dietary doses of 0, 2.5, 8.8, or 31.5 mg/kg/day (males) and 0,
2.4, 8.2, or 28.7 mg/kg/day (females) with a NOEL of 2.1 mg/kg/day for systemic effects based on an increase in mortality
rate in females at the two higher doses. There were no treatment-related carcinogenic effects at any dose level.
10. Acceptable studies on gene mutation (Salmonella, E. coli, and mouse lymphoma assays), structural chromosomal
aberration (

in vivo

 micronucleus assay in mice), and other genotoxic effects (unscheduled DNA synthesis assay with rat hepatocytes)
yielded negative results.
11. Pharmacokinetic and metabolism studies which indicated that approximately 80 to 90 percent of the orally administered
dose of glufosinate ammonium remained unabsorbed and was eliminated in the feces. Approximately 10 to 15 percent
was eliminated in the urine. The major metabolic pathway is oxidative deamination yielding the metabolite, 3-methyl-phospinico
propionic acid.
The chronic analysis used a Reference Dose (RfD) of 0.02 mg/kg body weight/day, based on a NOEL of 2.1 mg/kg/day and
an uncertainty factor of 100. The NOEL is based on a 2-year rat feeding study that demonstrated increased absolute
and relative kidney weight in males as an endpoint effect.
Using tolerance-level residues and assumptions that 100 percent of every crop for which glufosinate-ammonium has
a proposed use is treated, the total Theoretical Maximum Residue Contribution (TMRC) for the general population
and the highest exposed subgroup in DRES are as follows (as percents of RFD): General population, 0.3 percent; nonnursing
infants less than 1 year old, 2.1 percent.

A data gap currently exists for a rat carcinogenicity study. The tolerances will be time-limited because of this gap.
The time limitation allows for development and review of the data.

The analysis for glufosinate-ammonium using tolerance level residues suggests that the proposed uses on apples,
grapes, and nuts (excluding almonds) will not cause exposure to exceed the levels at which the Agency believes there
is an appreciable risk. All DRES subgroups are below 100 of the RfD for chronic effects.

The pesticide is useful for the purposes for which these tolerances are sought. The nature of the residue is adequately
understood for the purpose of establishing these tolerances. Adequate analytical methodology (gas chromatography
with flame photometric detection of phosphorus) is available for enforcement purposes. Because of the long lead
time from establishing these tolerances to publication, the enforcement methodology is being made available in
the interim to anyone interested in pesticide enforcement when requested by mail from: Calvin Furlow, Public Response
Branch, Field Operations Division (7506C), Office of Pesticide Programs. Environmental Protection Agency, 401
M St., Washington, DC 20460. Office location and telephone number: Rm. 1130A, CM #2, 1921 Jefferson Davis Hwy., Arlington,
VA 22202, (703)-305-5937.

There are currently no actions pending against the registration of this chemical. There is no reasonable expectation
that secondary residues will occur in meat, fat, and meat byproducts of cattle, goats, hogs, horses, sheep, or poultry,
nor is there any reasonable expectation that secondary residues will occur in eggs or milk.

Based on the information cited above, the Agency has determined that the establishment of the tolerances by amending
40 CFR part 180 will protect the public health; therefore, the tolerances are established as set forth below.

Any person adversely affected by this regulation may, within 30 days after publication of this document in the 

Federal Register

, file written objections with the Hearing Clerk, at the address given above. 40 CFR 178.20. The objections submitted
must specify the provisions of the regulation deemed objectionable and the grounds for the objections. 40 CFR 178.25.
Each objection must be accompanied by the fee prescribed by 40 CFR 180.33(i). If a hearing is requested, the objections
must include a statement of the factual issue(s) on which a hearing is requested, the requestor's contentions on each
such issue, and a summary of any evidence relied upon by the objector. 40 CFR 178.27. A request for a hearing will be granted
if the Administrator determines that the material submitted shows the following: There is a genuine and substantial
issue of fact; there is a reasonable possibility that available evidence identified by the requestor would, if established,
resolve one or more of such issues in favor of the requestor, taking into account uncontested claims or facts to the
contrary; and resolution of the factual issue (s) in the manner sought by the requestor would be adequate to justify
the action requested. 40 CFR 1798.32

The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the requirements of Executive Order 12866.

Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601-612),
the Administrator has determined that regulations establishing new tolerance or raising tolerance levels or establishing
exemptions from tolerance requirements do not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small
entities. A certification statement to this effect was published in the 

Federal Register

 of May 4, 1981 (46 FR 24950).

Carbophenothion; Revocation of Tolerances 




<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document revokes all food tolerances for residues of the insecticide carbophenothion, all food additive tolerances,
and all feed tolerances. EPA is taking this action because all registered uses of carbophenothion on these commodities
have been cancelled.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 This document announces the revocation of tolerances established under sections 408 and 409 of the Federal Food,
Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) (21 U.S.C. 346(a) and 348), for residues of the insecticide carbophenothion in or on
the commodities listed in 40 CFR 180.156, 40 CFR 185.700, and 40 CFR 186.700. These commodities are: alfalfa (fresh
and hay); almond hulls; apples; apricots; beans (dry); beans, lima (succulent); beans, snap (succulent); bean straw;
beets, garden (root and top); blueberries; cantaloupe; cattle fat; cherries; clover (fresh and hay); corn (kernels
plus cob with husks removed); corn forage; cottonseed, undelinted; crabapples; cucumbers; eggplants; figs; goats,
fat; grapefruit; grapes; hogs, fat; lemons; limes; milk; nectarines; olives; onions (dry bulb and green); oranges;
peaches; pears; peas (succulent); pecans; peppers; pimentos; plums (fresh prunes); quinces; sheep, fat; sorghum,
forage; sorghum, grain; soybeans (succulent); spinach; strawberries; sugarbeets (roots and tops); summer squash;
tangerines; tomatoes; walnuts and watermelons (180.156); dried tea (185.700); and dehydrated citrus pulp and citrus
meal for cattle feed (186.700).


EPA issued a proposed rule, published in the 

Federal Register

 of October 21, 1993 (58 FR 54316), which proposed the revocation of tolerances for residues of carbophenothion in
or on various commodities. The Agency's decision to revoke these tolerances was based on the fact that all registered
uses of carbophenothion products have been cancelled and any provision for sales and/or distribution of stocks has
expired.
The Agency believes that sufficient time has passed for legally treated agricultural commodities to have gone through
the channels of trade. Since it is unlikely that carbophenothion, which is not a persistent pesticide, would persist
in soil more than 4 years, there is no anticipation of a residue problem due to environmental contamination. Consequently,
no action levels are being recommended to replace these revoked tolerances. No public comments or requests for referral
to an advisory committee were received in response to the notice of proposed rulemaking. Therefore, based on the information
considered by the Agency and discussed in detail in the October 21, 1993 proposal and in this final rule, the Agency
is hereby revoking the tolerances listed in 40 CFR 180.156, 40 CFR 185.700 and 40 CFR 186.700.
Any person adversely affected by this regulation may, within 30 days after publication of this document in the 

Federal Register

, file written objections and/or a request for a hearing with the Hearing Clerk, at the address given above (40 CFR 178.20).
A copy of the objections and hearing requests filed with the Hearing Clerk should be submitted to the OPP docket for
this rulemaking. The objections submitted must specify the provisions of the regulation deemed objectionable and
the grounds for the objections (40 CFR 178.25). Each objection must be accompanied by the fee prescribed by 40 CFR 180.33(i).
If a hearing is requested, the objections must include a statement of the factual issue(s) on which a hearing is requested,
the requestor's contentions on each such issue, and a summary of any evidence relied upon by the objector (40 CFR 178.27).
A request for a hearing will be granted if the Administrator determines that the material submitted shows the following:
There is a genuine and substantial issue of fact; there is a reasonable possibility that available evidence identified
by the requestor would, if established, resolve one or more of such issues in favor of the requestor, taking into account
uncontested claims or facts to the contrary; and resolution of the factual issue(s) in the manner sought by the requestor
would be adequate to justify the action requested (40 CFR 178.32).
Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, Oct. 4, 1993), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action is
``significant'' and therefore subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the requirements
of the Executive Order. Under section 3(f), the order defines a ``significant regulatory action'' as an action that
is likely to result in a rule (1) Having an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely and materially
affecting a sector of the economy, productivity, competiton, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or
State, local or tribal governments or communities (also referred to as ``economically significant''); (2) creating
serious inconsistency or otherwise interfering with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially
altering the budgetary impacts of entitlement, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations
of recipients thereof; or (4) raising novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's
priorities, or the principles set forth in this Executive Order. 
Pursuant to the terms of the Executive Order, EPA has determined that this rule is not ``significant'' and is therefore
not subject to OMB review.
This rulemaking has been reviewed under the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C.
601 et seq.), and it has been determined that it will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small businesses, small governments, or small organizations. The reasons for this conclusion are discussed in
the proposed rule.

National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program; Criteria for Acceptance of Gifts, Bequests, or Services 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).

 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This final rule establishes criteria for determining whether the Director of FEMA may accept gifts, bequests or donations
of services, money or property for the National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program (NEHRP). 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA or Agency) published a proposed rule, ``National Earthquake Hazards
Reduction Program; Criteria for Acceptance of Gifts, Bequests, or Services,'' on July 9, 1992, 57 FR 30455. Comments
from the public were invited but, since publication, none have been received. The Agency is now publishing the final
rule with minor editorial changes in the preamble. 


Under 31 U.S.C. 1342, officers and employees of the United States Government may not accept voluntary services or
employ personal services exceeding those authorized by law except for emergencies involving the safety of human
life or the protection of property. Unless expressly authorized by law to do so, Federal officers and employees may
not accept gifts or bequests of property or money. The general rule is that appropriations may not be augmented with
funds or property from private sources unless specifically authorized by law. 
Under section 9 of the National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program Reauthorization Act, 42 U.S.C. 7705c, the Director
of FEMA may accept and use bequests, gifts, or donations of services, money or property. Section 9(b) of the Act requires
the Director to establish by regulation criteria for accepting such bequests, gifts, or donations, and to take into
consideration the impact of such acceptance on the Director's ability to conduct business fairly and objectively,
or its impact on the integrity of the National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program (NEHRP). This authority is similar
to that granted by other statutes to other agencies in the NEHRP and the Federal Government. 
These regulations establish the required criteria for determining whether to accept bequests, gifts, or donations
of services, money or property to further the purposes of the NEHRP. 


National Environmental Policy Act.

 This rule is categorically excluded from the requirements for environmental assessments of 44 C.F.R. part 10, Environmental
Consideration. No environmental impact assessment has been prepared. 


Regulatory Flexibility Act. 

I certify that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities in accordance
with the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601 et seq., because the rule states how FEMA will administer acceptance
of gifts, bequests, or services, defines the criteria for acceptance of gifts, bequests, or services to the National
earthquake Hazards Reduction Program, and is not expected (1) to have significant secondary or incidental effects
on a substantial number of small entities, nor (2) to create any additional burden on small entities. 


Regulatory Planning and Review. 

This rule is not a significant regulatory action under Executive Order 12866 of September 30, 1994, Regulatory Planning
and Review, 58 FR 51735. To the extent possible this final rule adheres to the principles of regulation as set forth
in Executive Order 12866. 


Paperwork Reduction Act.

 This rule does not involve any collection of information for purposes of the Paperwork Reduction Act. 


Executive Order 12612, Federalism. 

This rule involves no policies that have federalism implications under Executive Order 12612, Federalism, dated
October 26, 1987. 


Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform.

 This rule meets the applicable standards of section 2(b)(2) of Executive Order 12778.

 362.3 

Criteria for determining acceptance. 


The following criteria shall be applied whenever a gift of property or gift of services is offered to the Director for
the benefit of the National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program. 
(a) The gift of property or gift of services must clearly and directly further the objectives of the National Earthquake
Hazards Reduction Program, as defined in 42 U.S.C. 7702. 
(b) All gifts of property must be offered unconditionally, with sole discretion of use, administration and disposition
of such property to be determined by the Director or his designee. 
(c) The Director may accept and use gifts of services of voluntary and uncompensated personnel, and may provide transportation
and subsistence as authorized by 5 U.S.C. 5703 for persons serving without compensation. 
(d) Employees of FEMA or the Program agencies may not solicit gifts of property, or gifts of services. 
(e) Acceptance of gifts of property, or gifts of services must first be approved by the Office of the General Counsel,
FEMA, for conformance with all applicable laws and regulations. 
(f) In all cases where it is determined that the acceptance of a gift may create a conflict of interest, or the appearance
of a conflict of interest, the gift will be declined.

Sports Programming Migration



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Federal Communications Commission.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final report.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The 

Final Report

 of the FCC's sports migration inquiry finds that there has not been significant migration of sports programming from
broadcast to subscription media, but expresses concern about a decline in broadcast coverage of college football
games in some markets. In the 

Final Report

, the Commission states its intention to monitor sports programming availability and to act promptly, consistent
with its statutory authority, should any significant threat to that availability develop.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

This is a synopsis of the 

Final Report

 in PP Docket No. 93-21, adopted June 9, 1994 and released June 30, 1994. The complete text of this 

Final Report

 is available for inspection and copying during normal business hours in the FCC Reference Center (room 239), 1919
M Street NW., Washington, DC 20554, and also may be purchased from the Commission's copy contractor, International
Transcription Services, Inc., at 1919 M Street NW., room 246, Washington, DC 20554 (telephone: (202) 857-3800).



In section 26 of the 1992 Cable Act, Congress instructed the Commission to conduct an examination of ``the carriage
of local, regional, and national sports programming by broadcast stations, cable programming networks, and pay-per-view
services,'' and ``the extent to which preclusive contracts between college athletic conferences and video programming
vendors have artificially and unfairly restricted the supply of the sporting events of local colleges for broadcast
on local television stations'' or are prohibited by existing statutes. Congress directed the FCC to submit to it an


Interim Report

 by July 1, 1993 (see 58 FR 38088, July 15, 1993) and a 

Final Report

 by July 1, 1994, including legislative or regulatory recommendations as appropriate.

The Commission defined sports programming migration as ``the movement of sports programming from broadcast television
to a subscription medium (

i.e., 

one for which viewers pay a fee).'' The inquiry focused on professional baseball, football, basketball and hockey
and college football and basketball. The Commission looked at the time period from 1980 to the present and examined
local and national telecasts.

The Commission found no evidence of migration of National Football League or college basketball games. At the national
level, it saw no evidence of migration of professional basketball or hockey games. In fact, it found instances of ``reverse
migration'' in hockey at the national level. At the local level, there have been some declines in broadcast coverage
of professional basketball and hockey, but no overall pattern of migration.

The inquiry determined that national broadcast coverage of regular season Major League Baseball games has declined,
but found evidence that the drop is due to reduced demand rather than migration. Local broadcast coverage of baseball
has increased for most teams, but declined significantly in a few cases. The Commission concluded that there was no
pattern of migration of local baseball games. ESPN provides some national cable coverage of regular season baseball
games. While ESPN has exclusivity 

vis-a-vis

 local broadcasters on Wednesday nights, this appears to have had little effect on total games broadcast. Rather,
it has been associated with an increase in games televised on days other than Wednesday.

The Commission found evidence of a decline in college football broadcasts in some markets between 1984 and 1993, but
could not isolate the cause of the decline. The Commission expressed concern about the decline, but noted that new
college football contracts now being negotiated may lead to an increase in network coverage.

``Preclusive contracts'' are defined in the 1992 Cable Act as contracts between college athletic conferences and
video programming vendors that prohibit local television stations from broadcasting live games of local college
teams that are not carried live by a local cable system or prohibit tape delay broadcasts of local college games that
are not carried live or on tape delay by a local cable system.

The Commission's inquiry found no evidence of such preclusive contracts for college basketball, but questions were
raised in the case of college football. In the 

Interim Report

 the Commission noted that it would use the ``rule of reason'' framework to analyze contracts of this type, as suggested
to it by the Department of Justice. The Commission's analysis of typical contract terms suggested that, without the
sort of factual evidence presented at a full-scale trial, it could not determine whether the contracts violated the
antitrust laws. There was no suggestion that the contracts might violate other statutes.

The Commission found that there is a substantial amount of sports programming available on broadcast television,
including the ``marquee'' events of all the major sports. Because the Commission's interest in the availability
to the public of a diverse menu of programming encompasses both sports and non-sports programming, the 

Final Report

 concluded that additional government intervention to promote free access to sports programming, whether via regulation
of preclusive contracts or by some other means, is not warranted at this time.

Although it found that no legislative or regulatory recommendations in the area of sports programming migration
are necessary, the Commission noted its continuing concern regarding broad and economical public access to sports
programming and said it would take action if any significant threat to such access developed in the future. Moreover,
the Commission urged interested parties to file legitimate complaints in the event that current or future college
football contracts artificially and unfairly constrain local stations' access to local teams' games and committed
itself to pursue such complaints vigorously and promptly. In addition, the Commission said it would transmit the


Final Report

 to the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission.

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Federal Communications Commission is adopting range for the underlying factors that are used to compute depreciation
rates for the local exchange carriers (LECs) regulated under the price cap incentive regulatory plan. This 

Second Report and Order

 establishes ranges for 22 of the 33 depreciation rate categories. LECs may make streamlined filings for changes in
depreciation rates for these categories, if their underlying factors fall within the prescribed ranges. The rule
change will lessen the depreciation prescription burden on price caps LECs in light of regulatory and market changes
without sacrificing protection for consumers.

Title: 

Section 43.43_Report of Proposed Changes in Depreciation Rates.



OMB Control No.:

 3060-0168.



Action:

 Revised collection.



Respondents:

 Businesses or other for-profit entities.



Frequency of Response:

 On occasion; Triennially; Annually.



Estimated Annual Burden:

 12 responses; 7500 hours per response; 90,000 hours total.



Needs and Uses:

 In the 

Report and Order

 in CC Docket No. 92-296 (released 10/20/93), the Commission streamlined its depreciation prescription process
for local exchange carriers (LECs) regulated under its price cap regulatory scheme by adopting a modified form of
the basic factor range option. The 

Second Report and Order

 adopts the initial set of accounts and ranges for the price caps LECs. The Commission has modified its information
collection requirements whereby large LECs must submit analyses on proposed changes in depreciation rates. The
changes should reduce by 25% the amount of time needed to prepare and review these analyses. The information will be
used by the Commission staff to establish proper depreciation rates to be charged by the carriers pursuant to Section
220(b) of the Communications Act, as amended. 47 U.S.C.  220(b).

Summary



1. On September 23, 1993, we adopted streamlined depreciation prescription procedures for the local exchange carriers
(``LECs'') regulated under our price cap incentive regulatory plan.
 These procedures require us to establish ranges for the underlying factors that are used to compute depreciation
rates for plant categories. The new procedures generally will permit carriers to make streamlined filings for changes
in depreciation rates for these categories, as long as their underlying factors fall within the prescribed ranges.
By adopting these streamlined procedures, we hoped to simplify the depreciation process, achieve administrative
savings, and allow the LECs greater flexibility
 in the depreciation process, while remaining consistent with the public interest.






2. We further concluded that the streamlined procedures should be implemented as soon as practicable. To that end,
we decided to implement the new procedures in two phases. In phase one, we directed the Common Carrier Bureau to identify
the accounts most readily adaptable to the range approach and propose ranges for them. In phase two, we will establish
ranges for the remaining, more complex accounts, to the extent feasible.

3. On November 8, 1993, we adopted an 

Order Inviting Comment


 on 22 plant categories selected by the Bureau for initial implementation of the streamlined procedures. These categories
represent two-thirds of the 33 plant categories for which carriers currently submit depreciation studies. In addition,
the 

OIC

 sought comments on the proposed projection life and future net salvage ranges proposed by the Bureau for these categories.





4. In response to the 

OIC,

 the LECs and the United States Telephone Association (USTA) maintained that, to maximize the benefits of the simplification
procedures, ranges should be established for all accounts as quickly as possible. They argued that the limited number
of accounts for which ranges have been proposed in phase one severely restricts the benefits of streamlining depreciation.
On the other hand, MCI, the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners (NARUC) and the state commissions
supported the 22 plant categories proposed in the 

OIC

 for implementation in phase one of the simplification process.

5. We agree with the commenters that the ranges should be established as soon as possible. However, to begin the simplification
process in 1994, it is necessary to implement the streamlined depreciation procedures in two phases and to limit the
initial phase to certain categories of plant readily adaptable to the range approach. As we stated in the 

Depreciation Simplification Order,

 this schedule will make the most efficient use of our limited resources. To change our plans at this time and to perform
the thorough analyses required to establish appropriate ranges for additional plant accounts would delay unnecessarily
the use of the new procedures for the depreciation categories identified in the 

OIC.

 The commenting parties have presented no new information or arguments that would warrant a change in our plans.

6. Prior to the release of the 

Notice of Proposed Rulemaking

 in this proceeding, the staff of the Common Carrier Bureau had been considering ways to improve and to streamline the
depreciation prescription process. The staff collected a substantial amount of data and performed analyses to determine
the difficulty of establishing ranges for various accounts. Based on these analyses, it concluded that the 22 plant
categories proposed in the 

OIC

 were the categories most adaptable to the range approach, because their life and salvage factors did not vary substantially
among the carriers, or over time. The commenting state commissions generally concur with this conclusion.

7. We estimate that instituting these procedures for the 22 categories selected for phase one will reduce the size
of a typical depreciation study by 50%. We recognize that a 50% reduction in the size of the study will not necessarily
result in a reduction of the workload by 50%. Nevertheless, in our view, the elimination of so much of the detailed analyses
currently required in the studies will produce a substantial administrative savings for both the LECs and our staff.
Moreover, we plan to propose ranges for additional accounts later this year, and to adopt ranges for these accounts
early in 1995. As a result, we expect that the simplification procedures will be in place for all accounts, to the extent
feasible, for the 1995 depreciation prescription review process. The ranges we establish in this 

Second Report and Order

 will be used to establish depreciation rates for 1994. Considering that ranges for additional accounts will take
effect in 1995, we believe that our two-phase plan will allow us to achieve a major improvement in the depreciation
prescription process in a very short period of time.

8. In the 

OIC,

 we proposed to establish ranges at the account level for sixteen plant accounts and at a rate category level for four
additional accounts. The majority of parties commenting on this matter supported our proposal. Pacific Bell further
suggested that, where a carrier maintains levels of categorization more detailed than those proposed by the Commission,
it should be allowed to use the streamlined procedures, if the ``composite'' factors of its individual rate categories
are within the ranges established for the category as a whole. In addition, NYNEX made a special request that the Commission
establish a separate rate category with appropriate ranges for interoffice cable plant, because it contends the
life characteristics of this plant are significantly different from those of subscriber cables.

9. Based on these comments, we have decided to adopt the ranges for the 22 rate categories as proposed in the 

OIC

 (see Appendix below). As NARUC observed, establishing ranges at these levels should not require any additional record
keeping or substantial effort on the part of the LECs, since they are presently required to maintain their accounting
records at these levels under Part 32.






10. We have decided not to develop special ranges for LECs that have chosen to study rate categories at levels not listed
in the Appendix. The application of our range approach is based on national averages of prescribed depreciation factors.
Consequently, to develop special ranges would slow the process significantly as it would be necessary to require
many carriers to submit large amounts of data which we would then have to analyze in order to establish appropriate
ranges. This would place an undue burden on the majority of the carriers that do not study the plant investment at the
levels of detail desired by those LECs that seek ranges for additional categories.

11. Nevertheless, we will consider requests from LECs like Pacific, that study an account listed in the Appendix at
a more detailed level than shown, but wish to qualify within the established range for that account. During the prescription
process, we will consider their proposals on a case-by-case basis to use the basic factors computed at the more detailed
levels to satisfy the range requirements.

12. In the 

OIC

, we solicited comments on a specific set of proposed ranges for the future net salvage and projection life factors
for 22 plant categories. USTA and the LECs argued that the proposed ranges are too narrow, because the LECs will be able
to use the streamlined procedures for fewer than 50% of the 22 plant categories. They argued that the ranges should
be expanded in order to streamline the process significantly. In addition, for a few of the plant categories, they
argued that the proposed life ranges are too high. They suggested that, because of the rapid changes in technology,
certain plant accounts should be written off more quickly. However, GSA, MCI, NARUC and most of the state commission
commenters support the ranges proposed in the 

OIC

. California CATV and GSA believe that the objections to the proposed ranges raised by the LECs are aimed at obtaining
higher depreciation rates, rather than streamlining the depreciation process.

13. In the 

Depreciation Simplification Order

, we set forth the specific data that should be considered in establishing the projection life and future net salvage
ranges, and we used these data in proposing ranges in the 

OIC

. We based the ranges on statistical studies of the most recently prescribed factors. These statistical studies required
detailed carrier-by-carrier analyses of the most recent plant retirement patterns, the carriers' plans, and the
current technological developments and trends. Because the proposed ranges reflect these data, we believe that
the ranges provide a reasonable degree of confidence that the basic factors falling within their bounds will produce
depreciation rates accurately reflecting plant retirements, company plans, and technological trends. Moreover,
they allow the LECs sufficient flexibility in the selection of the final factors.

14. Furthermore, we do not believe that the ranges are too high, or too low, as some of the commenters contend. Our objective
was not to change the depreciation rates, but to streamline the process used by the Commission to prescribe those rates.
Consequently, we will not at this time modify any of the proposed ranges. We believe that some experience with the ranges
should be developed before we consider modifying them. If changing conditions require revisions in the ranges, we
can modify them at that time.

15. The LECs' assertion that they will be able to use the streamlined procedures for fewer than 50% of the 22 rate categories
is incorrect.
 We have studied the potential application of the ranges to every carrier for which the Commission prescribes depreciation
rates. We have found that today over two-thirds of the carriers would qualify for the streamlined procedures for the
22 proposed rate categories. Furthermore, our most recent depreciation rate reviews indicate that the proportion
should increase over the next few years.




16. In the past, we allowed two informal, alternative streamlined procedures for plant accounts representing less
than 3% of a carrier's total depreciable investment in a jurisdiction. We are replacing these informal streamlined
study procedures with the adoption of our range option. To have several streamlined procedures in place at the same
time could prove confusing and could negate any streamlining achieved by the Commission. Moreover, these previous
procedures had a minimal streamlining effect as compared with the new streamlined procedures. To illustrate, they
only reduce the studies by 3 or 4 pages per category, whereas our new procedures reduce them by 15 pages. Therefore,
we have decided to employ only the streamline range option adopted in our 

Depreciation Simplification Order.

17. Under our depreciation prescription process, one-third of the carriers for which we prescribe depreciation
rates have their rates reviewed each year. In the Depreciation Simplification Order

, we stated that price cap LECs scheduled for review in 1995 and 1996 could file for changes in their depreciation rates
for 1994 as long as they used basic factors within the ranges we selected. These carriers must file these depreciation
rate changes in a timely manner in accordance with the requirements set forth in the 

Depreciation Simplification Order.

18. Accordingly, it is ordered

, pursuant to Section 4(i), 201-205 and 220(b), of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, 47 U.S.C.   154(i),
201-205 and 220(b), that the ranges for the future net salvage and the projection life factors for the accounts
listed in the Appendix are 

hereby adopted 

as specified in the Appendix.

19. 

It is further ordered

, that this order is effective thirty days after publication in the 

Federal Register.

20. 

It is further ordered,

 that carriers may use the ranges established herein for federal filing purposes prior to the effective date of this
order.

Use of the Frequencies in the Instructional Television Fixed Service



<AGENCY>

<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The FCC amended the Instructional Television Fixed Service (ITFS) rules to permit licensees to utilitize channel
loading in meeting their basic educational programming requirements. Channel loading is the scheduling, or ``loading,''
of the requisite amount of ITFS programming onto fewer than the authorized channels in a four-channel ITFS group.
It represents a cost-free means of freeing up ITFS channels for full-time commercial programming by wireless cable
operators who lease excess capacity from ITFS licensees.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

This is the Commission's 

Report and Order 

in MM Docket No. 93-106, adopted on June 9, 1994 and released on July 6, 1994.



The complete text of this 

Report and Order 

is available for inspection and copying during normal business hours in the FCC Reference Center, Room 239, at the
Federal Communications Commission, 1919 M Street NW., Washington, DC 20554, and may also be purchased from the Commission's
copy contractor, International Transcription Service, at (202) 857-3800, 2100 M Street NW., suite 140, Washington,

Report and Order



1. Forming the nucleus of the channel-loading rules are the five elements of an industry-wide agreement reached late
last summer by educators and wireless cable operators, 

see 

58 FR 42522 (August 10, 1993), with some minor modifications designed to provide additional assurances that the primary
educational purpose of ITFS will be preserved.

2. First, licensees wishing to lease excess capacity must provide for the continued minimum total of 160 hours per
week of ITFS programming, or 40 hours per channel per week, composed of 80 hours to be immediately used and the remaining
80 hours to be subject to ready recapture by the ITFS licensee, in the event it wishes to expand its educational programming.

3. Second, as agreed to in the compromise, licensees must transmit the minimum total of 80 hours per week over only their
authorized ITFS channels. Licensees may ``load'' this amount of programming onto fewer than their four channels.
However, the rules will not permit licensees utilizing channel loading to transmit the reduced amount of 12 hours
per channel per week, an allowance now made for licensees during their first two years of operation. The Commission
views channel loading as an alternative to the two-year, 12-hour minimum programming option.

4. Third, a licensee may agree to the transmission of its 80 hours of ready recapture programming over any channel in
a market-wide wireless system, whether it be an ITFS or MMDS channel. The licensee will have the right to recapture
time on up to four channels to air simultaneously 20 additional hours of educational programming per channel. This
time may be recaptured upon six months' written notification to the wireless cable operator, rather than the one-year
notice now required. The Commission deemed this shortened notice period an appropriate trade-off for wireless cable
operators, who now will have the flexibility to transmit the recaptured ITFS prog
