Enhanced Poultry Inspection 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Food Safety and Inspection Service, USDA.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Proposed rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Food Safety and Inspection Service is proposing to amend the poultry products inspection regulations to implement
a new system of post-mortem inspection for all poultry species. The proposed system contains several innovations
to provide assurances that USDA-inspected and passed poultry products will be free of visible contamination and
will require the use of approved antimicrobial treatments in all official establishments. The proposed system would
replace all existing systems of poultry post-mortem inspection with a single system in which two FSIS inspectors
would staff each poultry processing line and examine carcasses for disease and visible contamination. The proposed
regulation would not mandate a reduction in maximum linespeeds. The proposed system would place additional responsibility
on official establishments to assure that the poultry they process is wholesome and free of disease. Establishment
personnel, positioned before the on-line post-mortem FSIS inspector, would check carcasses prior to inspection
and present for inspection only those poultry that are free of disease. Additionally, they would identify all poultry
requiring off-line trim, salvage or reprocessing prior to presentation to FSIS for inspection. A second FSIS inspector
would be positioned at a new inspection station that would incorporate that portion of the processing line between
viscera harvest and the chiller. This is a location where contamination can occur but where there is currently no on-line
inspection taking place. Finished Product Standards would be revised to eliminate process tolerances for fecal
contamination. Recordkeeping and verification procedures would be required so that establishment process control
could be assured. Additionally, all contaminated poultry that are reprocessed would be reinspected on the main processing
line by the second FSIS inspector and antimicrobial treatments would required to be applied to carcasses before the
chilling operation.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 




Comments 



The Agency recognizes that there may be additional information that was not available for its consideration at the
time this proposal was written. Therefore, the Agency is conducting further analysis of the benefits and costs of
the proposal and also is soliciting additional information on this proposal. In particular, FSIS is interested in
receiving information on inspector sequence, benefits, and costs of the proposed rule. FSIS expects that this information
will be submitted in the form of comments from the public. 

Interested persons are invited to submit comments concerning this proposal. Written comments should be sent to the
Policy Evaluation and Planning Staff and should refer to the docket number that appears in the heading of this document.
Any person desiring opportunity for oral presentation of views, as provided under the Poultry Products Inspection
Act, must make such request to Dr. Arrington so that arrangements may be made for such views to be presented. A record
will be made of all views orally presented. All comments submitted in response to this proposal will be available for
public inspection in the Policy Office from 9 a.m. to 4:00 p.m., Monday through Friday.

Additionally, FSIS will collect data by pilot testing this proposal during the comment period. The Agency will comply
with all bargaining obligations under the National Basic Agreement and the Federal Service Labor Management Relations
Statute relating to the impact any Poultry Enhancement Inspection System pilot test would have on employee working
conditions.

To the extent that the further analysis conducted by USDA and the comments solicited by this proposal contain meritorious
alternatives, information, or data not previously considered, the Agency may decide to propose changes to specific
provisions of this proposed rule. In this event, the Agency is committed to supplement this rulemaking to provide
the public an opportunity to comment on the specific revised regulatory provisions.



Background



Introduction



The Secretary of Agriculture is charged by the Poultry Products Inspection Act (PPIA_21 U.S.C. 451 

et seq.

) with carrying out a mandatory poultry products inspection program. The purpose of this inspection is to assure that
poultry products in interstate and foreign commerce are wholesome, not adulterated, and properly marked, labeled,
and packaged. The Act prohibits the shipment in commerce of poultry products that are adulterated or misbranded (21
U.S.C. 458), including any poultry products that bear or contain any poisonous or deleterious substance that may
render them injurious to health (21 U.S.C. 453(g)(1)) or that for any other reason are unsound, unhealthful, unwholesome,
or otherwise unfit for human food (21 U.S.C. 453(g)(3)). The Act requires post-mortem inspection of all carcasses
of slaughtered poultry subject to the Act and such reinspection as deemed necessary (21 U.S.C. 455(b)). The Secretary
is authorized to promulgate such rules and regulations as are necessary to carry out the provisions of the Act (21 U.S.C.
463(b)).

FSIS has stationed about 2,705 inspectors in 300 poultry slaughtering establishments nationwide. They are responsible
for ante-mortem and post-mortem inspection, and the inspection of further processed products at these establishments.
They are also responsible for assuring that facilities and equipment are sanitary and the plant environment conducive
to the manufacture of a wholesome product.

To meet the PPIA requirement for post-mortem inspection of every poultry carcass, FSIS stations inspectors on every
slaughter line throughout every working shift. Most poultry slaughtering establishments operate moving production
lines that carry the poultry through all the stages of processing from that of the live bird to the finished, ready-to-cook
stage.



Slaughter and Dressing Process



Currently, live birds are brought to the plant and hung upside-down on shackles on the moving conveyor line. They are
moved first to the stunning and slaughtering area, where they are bled out. Next, they are moved into scalding vats
where the feathers are loosened. They are then conveyed to automatic defeathering machines (called ``pickers''),
where the feathers are taken off the carcass by rapidly moving rubber ``fingers.'' After this operation, the birds
pass through a hock removal area. Then they pass to the evisceration area of the plant, where the birds are eviscerated
by automatic machinery. Evisceration is usually accomplished by cutting the bird's abdomen and ``scooping'' out
the organs with metal ``spoons'' or paddles.

The viscera are left attached to and suspended outside the carcass throughout post-mortem inspection. The birds
are presented for inspection with the hanging viscera suspended to one side of the carcass. The inspector conducts
a post-mortem examination for signs of disease or abnormality by holding open the abdominal cavity with one hand and
viewing its interior and then quickly manipulating the viscera with the other hand. At the same time, the inspector
observes the external surfaces of the carcass for signs of disease, abnormality, or contamination. The inspector
also points out to establishment employees lesions or other conditions that may be removed by trimming.

Birds that do not pass post-mortem inspection are either removed from the processing line and placed on a hang-back
rack for veterinary disposition or they are designated for off-line trimming, salvage, or reprocessing, or condemned.
Birds that are inspected and passed by FSIS move on to the next operations, which include viscera removal, giblet harvest,
and final trimming and washing. The carcasses then proceed to the chilling operation, where usually they are immersed
in ice and cold water tanks to bring the carcass temperature down to acceptable levels and to retard bacterial growth.
The chilled birds are then packaged and readied for shipment or further processed.

Basis of Inspection



All post-mortem inspection is based on the use of an organoleptic method of inspection. That is, inspectors and veterinarians
rely on the use of their five senses in making decisions regarding the disposition of poultry carcasses and their parts.
Additionally, FSIS personnel monitor chemical residues and microbial baselines by taking random samples of inspected
birds for laboratory microbiological or chemical analyses. Laboratory analysis can be utilized to confirm post-mortem
dispositions or suspected chemical residues.

The organoleptic method has proven reliable over many years in the detection of diseases or abnormalities that could
be dangerous and are certainly objectionable to consumers. Nevertheless, the organoleptic method is not capable
of detecting microbial pathogens that may be present on raw, ready-to-cook product. Because of the continuing and
increasing threat of foodborne pathogens, including pathogens known to be carried on the surfaces of dressed poultry
carcasses and in feces, the focus of meat and poultry inspection must shift towards enhancing public health.



Pathogen Reduction Initiatives



In this regard other FSIS initiatives include prevention programs for use on the farm and during live-animal transit,
the development of rapid detection methods using the latest technologies, the collection of microbiological baseline
data, the development of risk analysis methods applicable to meat and poultry inspection, microbial detection and
reduction activities in both slaughtering and processing plants, and an intensified education program directed
at retail outlets, food handlers, and consumers.

Some of these initiatives will obviously take longer than others to carry out. Some in-plant activities will depend
on the development of new technology. Even though all critical research questions have not yet been answered, FSIS
recognizes and accepts its obligation to proceed with activities that are likely to succeed based on current theories
about pathogen control. The agency also has the opportunity to introduce useful microbial detection technologies
into the present inspection program as they become available, not waiting for the fully developed new system.

This proposal includes several activities which are based on present knowledge, especially that which suggests
that pathogen presence on carcasses is likely associated with fecal contamination and that careful process control
can reduce the potential for contamination.



Current Inspection Systems



Several poultry post-mortem inspection systems are currently operated in federally inspected establishments_traditional,
New Line Speed (NELS), New Turkey Inspection System (NTIS), and the Streamlined Inspection System (SIS). Within
each of these current systems no product with visible fecal contamination is permitted to enter the chiller, but the
assurance of this standard is based on monitoring samples; inspectors do not have the opportunity to continuously
verify that fecal contamination doesn't enter the chiller.



Traditional



Under traditional inspection, the oldest system, one inspector examines a whole bird and is responsible for its proper
disposition, including directing and verifying any required trimming by an establishment employee who is the ``inspector's
helper,'' before the bird leaves the area of inspection. A sample of inspected product is reinspected for processing
nonconformances through an acceptable quality level (AQL) statistical program. Line speeds for traditional inspection
were based on work-measurement studies and were set at the limit at which an inspector could carry out the organoleptic
examination and manipulation of each carcass presented for inspection. Also, industry was not capable of producing
birds at a higher speed and therefore, these line speeds were acceptable.



SIS



In the mid-1970's, the development of automated evisceration equipment, as well as improvements in genetics, nutrition,
health, and flock management, allowed the poultry industry to present uniform lots of birds to inspectors faster
than inspectors could inspect using traditional methods. In 1978, the FSIS approved the use of a new inspection method
known as Modified Traditional Inspection (MTI). MTI allowed industry to run an eviscerating line at speeds of up to
70 birds per minute.

In 1985, USDA designed a new system to replace MTI that would permit the industry to continue to operate at 70 birds per
minute but require fewer on-line inspectors. This system became known as the Streamlined Inspection System (SIS).
SIS, which is currently the standard form of inspection for young chickens, requires one or two inspectors to be positioned
on each processing line after the birds have been eviscerated. Each inspector performs a whole-bird inspection involving
the examination of the outside, inside, and viscera of the birds presented for inspection. The one-inspector form
of SIS is known as SIS-1; the two-inspector version, called SIS-2, is the most widely used (about 140 plants,
compared with only about 3 plants for SIS-1).

Inspection under both SIS-1 and SIS-2 is conducted in two phases_a post-mortem inspection phase and a
reinspection phase. In the inspection phase, inspectors determine which birds must be salvaged, reprocessed, condemned,
retained for veterinary disposition, or allowed to be moved down the line as a passed bird subject to reinspection.

The reinspection station or stations are located both before and after each chiller. At the prechill station, inspectors
examine carcasses by visually monitoring, checking quality control data, or sampling product at the station. SIS
incorporates a finished product standards (FPS) program by which product is evaluated and the results tracked with
the aid of the CUSUM statistical method. The tabulation and charting of CUSUM results enables the establishment and
FSIS inspectors to determine whether the establishment's processes are under control, and hence, whether the process
will produce consistently sound, wholesome product. 


NELS


During the 1970's and 1980's the industry continued to make significant technological advances and were capable
of better process control. The FSIS inspection procedure became the limiting factor on industry productivity. In
1981, the Agency developed a new procedure, New Line Speed (NELS), that shifted quality control responsibilities
to the plant and relied more heavily on monitoring and verification than in the past. This is a voluntary program, and,
if approved the establishment can operate at a maximum rate of 91 birds per minute. 
NELS combines SIS post-mortem inspection procedures with an establishment-operated slaughter quality control
program that is monitored by FSIS. The Agency permits the NELS system in appropriately equipped establishments that
have requested and been approved for the system. The NELS inspection system consists of three FSIS inspectors performing
the NELS whole-bird post-mortem inspection procedure and at least one inspector monitoring the application of an
FSIS-approved, plant-operated slaughter quality control (QC) program. The QC program is designed to assure that
the processing system is under control. 


NTIS


The above discussion regarding MTI, SIS, and NELS is specific to the development of inspection systems for young chickens,
the largest segment of the poultry industry. Other classes of poultry have not evolved through the same inspection
procedures. However, as the turkey industry began to grow and become more automated, merely expanding traditional
procedures was impractical and inefficient. Therefore, in 1985, FSIS established the New Turkey Inspection (NTI)
system which was based on the concepts and procedures used in NELS system. 
This system calls for one or two inspectors on each inspection line to inspect the inside, outside, and viscera of each
bird presented, with establishment employees responsible for trimming passed carcasses. The adequacy of the trimming
is assured through an establishment-operated quality control and finished product standards (FPS) program that
is monitored by FSIS personnel. 


Poultry Enhancement Program


Introduction


Experience has shown that there are two points on the poultry main processing line where birds are more likely to become
contaminated. The first of these is at evisceration, when improperly adjusted equipment may perforate or burst the
intestines as the viscera is ``scooped'' out, resulting in fecal contamination on the interior surface of the carcass.
The second point where contamination may occur is where the viscera are separated from the carcass. Unless the viscera
harvest is properly carried out, the interior surface of carcasses can become contaminated with feces. In March,
the Secretary of Agriculture announced a series of measures that are intended to strengthen poultry products inspection
and reduce the occurrence of pathogens on raw product. The initiatives included a better method for enforcing ``zero
tolerance'' for fecal contamination on raw product by changing the inspection sequence to provide on-line inspection
checks for contamination, which is not provided by current systems. Also included among the initiatives are the use
of approved antimicrobial treatments on carcasses and the 100% reinspection of reprocessed carcasses. Because
these initiatives would change procedures that are already authorized or required by the regulations, it is necessary
to amend the regulations to carry them out.

The proposal would implement a new system of post mortem inspection, require re-inspection of all reprocessed birds
on the main processing line, revised the existing finished product standards program, and require the use of an antimicrobial
treatment before the chilling operation. The proposed new inspection system is intended to assure that only uncontaminated
poultry would enter the chiller and the required antimicrobial treatment is applied to every carcass. A benefit of
these is to reduce the chance of cross-contamination in the chilling operation.


Inspection Sequence Changes


The proposal would replace all existing systems of poultry post-mortem inspection with a single system in which two
FSIS inspectors would staff each poultry processing line. The first inspector would examine eviscerated poultry
at an ``on-line post-mortem inspection station,'' located at or near the present post-mortem inspection position.
This inspector would assure that carcasses sorted by the establishment are free of condemnable pathology or are properly
designated for off-line trim, salvage, or reprocessing.
The second inspection station, the ``on-line/off-line carcass inspection station,'' would be positioned just
before the chiller. The inspector at this station would perform on-line inspection for fecal contamination thus
ensuring that no visible fecal contamination is present on carcasses entering the chiller. This inspector would
also be responsible for observing plant operations between the viscera harvest and the final wash and for reinspecting
all reprocessed birds on the line.
The Agency requests that comments on the proposal include information and data on this proposed inspector sequence,
or information and data relative to any alternatives to this proposed inspector sequence.


Establishment Responsibilities


Establishment personnel, known as sorters, would be positioned before the first FSIS inspector. This position will
be a reassignment of duties for the current plant presenters and inspector helpers. The establishment sorters differ
in responsibility from the inspectors' helpers under the current regulations because the sorters would be more active
in detecting disease and abnormality and sorting birds affected by such conditions from normal birds.

The required establishment sorter or sorters would be responsible for assuring that no diseased poultry requiring
condemnation are presented for FSIS inspection. They would designate poultry for off-line salvage, trimming, or
reprocessing, or condemn the birds prior to presentation for inspection, and they would be required to record all
condemnations on a disposition reporting form required for the purpose. Only those birds without condemnable conditions
would be permitted to reach the post-mortem inspection station, except for those designated and marked for reprocessing,
knife-salvage, or other off-line procedures. These would be removed from the evisceration line only after the bird
passed the FSIS post-mortem inspector at the on-line post-mortem inspection station but before the viscera harvest.

Under the proposal, as is currently required, the establishment would have to position an employee after the post-mortem
inspector and before the viscera harvest. This employee would be required to perform duties such as removing carcasses
marked for salvage or reprocessing, or placing birds on hangback racks for veterinary disposition or correlation.

The establishment also would continue to be required to position one or more trimmers after the giblet harvest and
before the final wash. These trimmers would continue to perform the duties required by the current regulations, but
they would have the additional responsibility of removing for reprocessing birds that are contaminated with feces
on the inner surfaces and assuring that only birds that are properly trimmed are presented to the FSIS inspector at
the on-line/off-line carcass inspection station.



Reprocessing


Currently, reinspection of reprocessed birds by FSIS is done by random sampling of lots. The proposed system would
require all reprocessed birds to be returned to the main processing line at a point before the second FSIS inspector
to assure that they are reinspected. If any reprocessed bird were found with fecal contamination, all birds remaining
in the reprocessed lot would be returned to the establishment's reprocessing station for rework.

Equipment and Facilities Requirements


All poultry slaughtering establishments would be required to comply with the same equipment and facility requirements,
which would be essentially those of the present SIS, NELS, and NTIS inspection systems, extended to accommodate inspection
at the proposed on-line/off-line inspection station. For example, establishments would have to furnish adjustable
inspection stands and shadow-free lighting with a minimum intensity of 200 foot candles and a color rendering index
of 85 at the inspection stations. Also, guidebars would have to be installed at both inspection stations in all establishments
to permit birds to be moved smoothly and consistently to the edge of the trough running below the conveyor so that birds
would be properly presented to the FSIS inspector.


Linespeed


Maximum linespeeds allowed under optimal conditions would remain the same under the proposed system. The proposed
system does not prescribe specific hand motions which in the past have been a determining factor in the rate at which
an inspector could inspect each bird. This system would allow the inspector flexibility in the technique used to inspect
each bird. Also, this proposal would eliminate the presentation for FSIS inspection of those birds with condemnable
conditions.
FSIS also considered the impact linespeeds have on the safety and wholesomeness of poultry. A study was conducted
between June 1990 and May 1991 at a poultry establishment to determine if the microbiological quality of poultry carcasses
was different when processed at varying linespeeds. The general conclusion was that mean bacterial counts and 

Salmonella 

prevalence did not change significantly with varying processing linespeeds.





Also, there are data to support the incidence of 

Salmonella 

on whole broiler carcasses declined from 36.9% to 25.0% between 1979 and 1992 irrespective of changes in linespeeds.





Other factors do impact the microbiological quality of the product such as chlorine and other antimicrobial treatments
as well as process control and the adherence to good manufacturing practices by the establishment.






Based on this information, maximum inspection rates for young chickens would remain at 70 birds per minute for establishments
without approved slaughter PQC programs and at 91 birds per minute for establishments with approved slaughter PQC
programs. The rates for turkeys with J-type opening cuts and weighing under 16 lbs. would be 20 birds per minute at establishments
without such PQC programs and 51 birds per minute at establishments operating such PQC programs. The rates for such
turkeys weighing more than 16 lbs. would be 16 birds per minute without such PQC and 41 birds per minute with such PQC.
The rates for turkeys with bar-type opening cuts weighing under 16 lbs. would be 20 birds per minute at establishments
without PQC programs and 45 birds per minute at establishments operating PQC programs. The corresponding rates for
such turkeys weighing over 16 lbs. would be 16 birds per minute without a PQC program and 35 birds per minute with a PQC
program. (See Table 1.)

<TEXT>
 



Under the proposal, the FSIS inspector in charge (IIC) or his/her designee would retain the responsibility for determining
whether conditions permit adequate post-mortem inspection at the maximum rates. Criteria for justifying linespeed
reductions would include the inability of the official establishment to present carcasses so that internal and external
surfaces and organs can be inspected, remove condemnable birds from the line, and properly identify contaminated
birds for trimming or knife salvage.


Finished Product Standards Revisions


The FPS now provided in the regulations would be updated and tightened to reflect more accurately the current conditions
in the poultry industry.

The current FPS program was developed on the basis of 1983 in-house data. Since the standards were adopted, the program
has proven more effective in preventing nonconformances than the AQL it supplanted. However, experience in applying
the FPS has disclosed certain limitations involving the application of testing rules and actions. The proposed revised
FPS would overcome these limitations while preserving the advantages of the current FPS. The strength of both the
current program and the proposed revised FPS is the effectiveness of on-line quality control in maintaining processing
control. Processing control, which focuses on prevention rather than the detection of nonconformances, would continue
to be the guiding concept of the FPS.
The proposed FPS program would incorporate the following changes to the current FPS processing control monitoring
program:
(1) Consolidation of nonconformance categories.
(2) Elimination of feces from reinspection categories.
(3) Elimination of post-chill testing.
(4) Setting nonconformances tolerances at same level for all poultry classes.
(5) Separation of the trimmable lesion/condition category from processing/trim categories.
(6) Simplification of on-line processing control monitoring rules.


Consolidation of Nonconformance Categories


The proposed revised FPS nonconformance categories (Table 1 at proposed 9 CFR 381.76(h)) would be fewer than the existing
FPS nonconformance categories and the testing procedure would be simpler. The proposed category changes would make
testing easier and provide earlier feedback. Appropriate preventive and corrective actions could be initiated
because the carcass nonconformance would be based on ready-to-cook (RTC) requirements and sanitary dressing procedures.
The current finished product standards (FPS) program has 20 prechill processing, 14 prechill trim, and 3 post-chill
categories (37 categories). These groupings are based on the type of nonconformances found on carcasses. The proposed
FPS program would have 8 nonconformance categories and 1 separate trimmable lesion/condition category. The nonconformances
would be assigned to common groups with respect to control, origin, prevention, or removal. Prechill processing
and trim categories would be combined on one test form to simplify the testing process so that only one cumulative summation
(CUSUM) would be calculated.

<PARENT> FR940713-1-00001 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 


The relative risk of nonconformances would be the same for each poultry class. Because the comparative risk between
categories is not known, the new nonconformance categories would be weighted equally (each having a weight factor
of one). This change would also eliminate any tendency to correct only those nonconformances with higher weights.



Elimination of Feces From the Nonconformance Categories




One goal of the FPS program would be to ensure that poultry carcasses are free of feces. To emphasize the Agency's determination
to enforce the ``zero tolerance'' for such contamination, feces would no longer be listed among nonconformance categories.
Any finding of fecal contamination during an FPS check would require an immediate line speed reduction. On-line processing
control by the establishment is necessary to exclude fecal contamination from product ready to enter the chilling
system.


There are two operations in the slaughtering process where there is a greater chance for carcass contamination. These
operations are evisceration and viscera harvest. Under this proposal, FSIS inspectors would be stationed after
each of these operations to ensure only non-contaminated carcasses proceed down the line.



Elimination of Post-Chill Testing




One goal of the proposed FPS reinspection test would be to ensure that the establishment keeps its evisceration process
under control with emphasis on preventing fecal contamination from entering the carcass chilling system. All carcasses
would be subject to sampling using the proposed FPS test, which includes a modified extraneous material category,
prior to entering the chill system; therefore, these defects should not enter the chill system. The current FPS post-chill
test focuses on the detection of extraneous material nonconformances too late in the slaughtering and dressing procedure
to provide information that could be used to improve evisceration controls.



Setting Tolerances at the Same Level for All Poultry Classes




It is reasonable to set one tolerance to provide a uniform standard for evaluating all poultry carcasses after slaughter
and dressing since ready-to-cook (RTC) requirements and the same nonconformances apply to all poultry classes.
Established tolerances for poultry carcasses are already approaching uniformity. The current FPS pre-chill trim
nonconformance limits for young chickens and turkeys are already the same. The FPS pre-chill processing and post-chill
nonconformance limits for young chickens and young turkeys are almost the same.


Ideally, if optimal processing controls were maintained, poultry would be nonconformance-free. Nonconformance-free
product may be theoretically achievable but is not likely to be commercially feasible. A reasonable tolerance would
allow for the presence of a few accidental nonconformances incidental to the process and, at the same time, define
acceptable quality levels. Establishing a new tolerance for all poultry classes along with changes in the testing
rules would encourage continual improvement in processing control. Periodic re-evaluation of these limits would
be essential to encouraging the trend toward the production of poultry that is free of nonconformances.


The current FPS tolerances and action numbers are based on data collected in 1983. The Agency is now offering for comment
the modifications of these standards that field inspection experience has shown to be necessary. Even so, the Agency
will be especially attentive to comments addressing the proposed FPS standards.


Currently, the FPS upper limit of acceptability of a 10-bird test sample is called the subgroup absolute limit. The
subgroup absolute limit is defined by the tolerance number plus 5 (T+5). The ``plus 5'' is the expected normal variance
in a process under control. In the proposed FPS program, the need for the subgroup absolute limit (T+5) is eliminated
by incorporating normal process variability within tolerance. Following the cumulative summation (CUSUM) method,
the process variability exceeding tolerance is recorded. The proposed FPS program uses CUSUM to determine when the
process is out of control and to identify product requiring rework. Tolerance levels for nonconformances would ensure
appropriate corrective actions at the control points. In recent years, a zero CUSUM has been achieved consistently
by establishments under the current FPS program_evidence that nonconformance process control has improved. A zero
CUSUM over time is not expected. Because of process variation, a certain number of tests are expected to exceed tolerance
and cause an increase in the CUSUM. The FPS tolerance numbers for nonconformances were set at such a level that one test
in 20 would be expected to exceed the tolerance number plus 5. Under the present FPS program, exceeding the subgroup
absolute limit (T+5) is usually the only cause for corrective action or testing. Maintaining a zero CUSUM does not
encourage further improvement in process control.

Separation of the Trimmable Lesion/Condition Category From the Processing/Trim Categories


One goal of the proposed revised FPS program would be to ensure process control with a statistically valid method of
identifying trimmable lesions and conditions and product requiring rework. The confidence level of the proposed


on-line 

test ensures a standard of no tolerance for trimmable lesions and conditions. The test would be objective and would
result in actions that are firm, fair, and consistent. The standard for trimmable lesion/condition nonconformances
is met through testing and actions independent of the other proposed FPS nonconformance categories.
Separating the trimmable lesion/condition category from the other proposed FPS nonconformance categories allows
independent actions which include: (a) Monitoring a statistically valid number of carcasses on-line; (b) notifying
the IIC immediately of trimmable lesion/condition nonconformance; (c) accurately identifying product with trimmable
lesion/condition nonconformance for rework; (d) recording and evaluating corrective actions taken.
The current finished product standards (FPS) program assigns a point value to the trimmable lesion/condition nonconformances
found during a 10-bird monitoring test. These points are included in the CUSUM calculation for the pre-chill trim
test. At the same time, trimmable lesion/condition nonconformances have a ``zero tolerance.'' That is, an immediate
retest involving an additional 10-bird sample is required when a trimmable lesion/condition is detected. The 10-bird
retest is not a statistically valid number of carcasses. The probability that trimmable lesions and conditions will
be found through such 10-bird tests is low, even when the process is out of control. Thus, the testing does not result
in identifying product for rework.
The proposed on-line verification test is statistically based to ensure processing control and takes a reasonably
short time to perform. The test would be conducted by the establishment on a 300-bird sample taken after the final wash
at the reinspection sample collection site. An FSIS floor inspector would typically perform verification sampling
for the Agency. A line-stop button would be required to facilitate the removal of carcasses with trimmable lesions
and conditions during the on-line test.


Simplifcation of Rules for Monitoring On-Line Processing Control


An additional goal of the proposed revised FPS program would be to modify testing rules and procedures to ensure that
testing is sensitive and specific enough to identify loss of processing control. A high probability of identifying
product requiring rework would be associated with actions taken on the basis of the tests.
As mentioned, testing rules in the current FPS program are cumbersome and result in repeated testing which rarely
results in identifying product for rework. When pre-chill nonconformances reach action levels, immediate multiple
location testing and retesting is required at pre-chill, post-chill, and on-line control points. This increase
in simultaneous testing is labor-intensive for both the establishment and inspection. This labor-intensive effort
rarely results in the identification of product for rework. There is little incentive to do testing that almost never
leads to regulatory action. The program requirements generate a lot of paper work, while the intended effect on processing
control is difficult to quantify.
The proposed revised FPS program would identify when the establishment's processing is out of control and product
requires rework. All monitoring tests would be applied at pre-chill. Under the current FPS program, product is tested
at post-chill using pre-chill standards to identify product requiring rework. At post-chill, product from multiple
evisceration lines is sometimes commingled in one chiller. This commingling dilutes nonconformances and decreases
the probability of identifying product for rework when tested post-chill. With the proposed FPS, all affected carcasses
would be subject to reinspection, identified at pre-chill, and segregated for rework.
The proposed revised FPS is easily applied even when carcasses go directly to further processing. The proposed categories
(Table 1 at proposed 9 CFR 381.76(h)) are designed to provide feedback to the establishment to ensure processing control.


Corrective Actions


If the on-line postmortem inspector observed a bird that should have been condemned or designated and marked for off-line
knife-salvage, trimming, or reprocessing, the inspector would stop the processing line to make a proper disposition.
The inspector would have the bird condemned, removed from the line, or, if the condition of the bird was found to be questionable,
placed on a hang-back rack for veterinary disposition.

If the on-line/off-line carcass inspector observes any fecally contaminated birds, the line would be stopped and
the bird removed for reprocessing. Additionally, a mandatory linespeed reduction would be required. The linespeed
would be reduced to the extent necessary to ensure process control in preventing/eliminating all feces and for such
duration until it is determined by FSIS that the process can be maintained in compliance with the no visible fecal contamination
standard.
If any reprocessed bird is found with fecal contamination, the on-line/off-line inspector will require all birds
remaining in the reprocessed lot to be returned to the establishment's reprocessing station for rework.
Any finding of fecal contamination during a Finished Product Standard check would require an immediate linespeed
reduction and reprocessing of the contaminated carcass.


Antimicrobial Treatments


In spite of the best efforts to reduce or eliminate visible contamination through the measures that this proposal
would require, poultry would still harbor bacteria. The numbers of these invisible contaminants can only be reduced
through antimicrobial treatments. With this proposed rulemaking, the Agency would require, for the first time,
that poultry slaughtering establishments provide antimicrobial interventions before the carcasses enter the
chilling system.
Thus, in addition to changing post-mortem inspection staffing and procedures and reinspection criteria, this proposed
rulemaking would mandate the use of an approved antimicrobial treatment for poultry. The treatments could be applied
at any point preceding the chilling operation. Many establishments would already be in compliance with this provision
of the proposed regulations because they routinely apply a 20-ppm chlorinated spray at the final wash. Spoilage and
pathogenic bacteria naturally reside on the surface of raw poultry. It has been assumed that a certain level of bacteria
present on carcass surfaces was unavoidable due to the inherent characteristics of animals and raw poultry meat and
the nature of the slaughter and processing operation. Consequently, organoleptic inspection procedures were designed
to detect obvious carcass diseases or abnormalities. FSIS is expanding its inspection activities to address increasing
concern by the scientific community and the public about the threat of foodborne illness from consumption of meat
and poultry products. Pathogens of concern in poultry include 

Salmonella 

and 

Campylobacter, 

which are frequently carried on raw poultry. These bacteria cannot be detected by sight, smell, or taste.
Salmonellae, found in the intestinal tract and waste of most warm-blooded animals, are the most important cause of
bacterial foodborne illness with a 0.1 percent case fatality rate and highest average cost per case.
 Foods of animal origin, particularly meat and poultry, are considered to be the primary source of human salmonellosis.
The organisms are present in the skin and feathers of live birds whose carcasses can also become contaminated during
slaughter from intestinal tract contents of otherwise healthy animals. Cross contamination of cooked foods from
raw meat and poultry, kitchen utensils, or surfaces has been frequently described as a cause of salmonellosis.






Campylobacter jejuni 

lives naturally as a harmless inhabitant in the intestinal tract of many warm-blooded animals, including poultry.
In many countries the incidence of 

Campylobacter 

infection is higher than that for 

Salmonella. 

In North America, campylobacteriosis is believed to be the principal cause of foodborne enteritis, accounting for
the highest number of cases.
 Poultry meat is most often implicated as the primary source of infection.




From 1983 to 1987, 2,397 foodborne disease outbreaks were reported to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), representing
91,678 cases. CDC defined an outbreak as an incident in which two or more persons experience a similar illness and food
is implicated. The etiology was unknown in the majority of outbreaks. Among outbreaks in which etiology was determined,
bacterial pathogens caused the largest number of outbreaks (66 percent) and cases (92 percent). During the five-year
interval, meat and poultry accounted for approximately 16 percent of the bacterial disease outbreaks. 

Salmonella 

was the most frequently reported pathogen each year.

FSIS recognizes that the technologies now available for reducing bacterial contamination on raw poultry carcasses
are limited. There are currently no approved antimicrobial agents for use pre-chill listed in the poultry inspection
regulations, although several compounds appear promising. Described below are a few alternative treatment methods
available to the poultry industry for use or further development.

Trisodium phosphate is approved by FDA for use as a processing aid on raw poultry. It is listed in the FDA regulations
as generally recognized as safe (GRAS) for multiple purpose use in accordance with good manufacturing practice (21
CFR 182.1778). FSIS has granted approval for testing of trisodium phosphate at pre-chill and post-chill locations
and has begun rulemaking procedures to include this compound and its use conditions in the table of substances in 9
CFR 381.147(f)(4). Trisodium phosphate has been shown to reduce microbial contamination on poultry carcasses when
applied by spraying or dipping carcasses for up to 30 seconds in an 8- to 12-percent solution. Industry studies show
a one to one and one-half logarithm reduction in the number of 

Salmonella

 and other bacteria on carcass surfaces when carcasses are dipped in or sprayed with trisodium phosphate.






Several organic acid compounds, including lactic acid and acetic acid, have antimicrobial effects and are listed
in the FDA regulations as GRAS. Although listed in 21 CFR, conditions-of-use have not been established for use of these
compounds on poultry products. Researchers have obtained varying degrees of microbial reductions when treating
carcasses with organic acid compounds. Early studies indicated changes in carcass skin color when carcasses were
treated with organic acid compounds. More recent studies provide data supporting the effectiveness of organic acid
compounds at concentrations that do not compromise the sensory properties of the meat.






The washing of carcasses with chlorinated water to reduce the numbers of spoilage and pathogenic bacteria on carcasses
is a longtime practice in the poultry industry. As early as 1951, researchers noted the effectiveness of in-plant
chlorination in lowering bacteria counts on product, increasing shelf life, reducing odors in the establishment,
and reducing slime on equipment.
 Chlorine is used now in most poultry establishments, primarily in chill water, to prevent bacterial cross-contamination
and as an effective sanitizing agent on facilities and equipment usually at levels of 20 to 50 parts per million available
chlorine.
 A 1992 FSIS study showed significant microbial reductions on raw chicken carcasses and giblets immersed in chlorinated
chill water.








Manufacturers of chlorine dioxide have petitioned FDA to permit the use of this compound to disinfect waters contacting
fresh meat, fresh poultry, processed meat, and processed poultry.
 Studies have shown that chlorine dioxide used at lower concentrations is as effective as chlorine in reducing bacterial
levels on poultry.''

Mechanical process modifications have also been studied. Good effects in reducing bacterial levels on carcasses
have been obtained when conventional scald and chilling systems have been replaced with countercurrent scald and
chilling systems. In countercurrent systems, carcasses exit from the system where the water is the cleanest.

14

 In 1991, the industry conducted a major study that showed that a combination countercurrent scald system, post-scald
rinse, and chlorination at several control points on the evisceration line effectively reduced the number of spoilage
and pathogenic organisms on carcass surfaces.

15

 






Washing the carcass more often during the slaughter and dressing operation has been shown to reduce the levels of bacteria
on carcass surfaces. Researchers theorize that spray washing at critical points during the process creates a water
film between the bacteria and the carcass surface which prevents bacteria from attaching to carcass surfaces. Simply
washing carcasses with hot water has also been shown to be effective in reducing the levels of bacteria on carcass surfaces.

16

 





FSIS is studying the use of the Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP) concept in official establishments
as an effective means of improving the process and reducing bacterial loads on carcasses. Using HACCP in poultry inspection
was proposed by the National Academy of Science in a 1985 study, ``Meat and Poultry Inspection: The Scientific Basis
of the Nation's Program.''
 The first step in developing an effective HACCP plan is to define the hazards. Microbiological hazards are defined
as ``the unacceptable survival by microorganisms of concern to safety or spoilage and/or the unacceptable production
or persistence in foods of products of microbial metabolism.'' After hazards are identified, critical control points
are established. The critical control point describes the location or points in the process which, if not correctly
controlled, could lead to contamination with unacceptable growth.

18

 






The use of an antimicrobial treatment on raw poultry carcasses would not eliminate the need for continued careful
handling of raw poultry products, but would reduce the levels of bacteria that may be present. Establishments have
several options to use as effective treatments in reducing bacterial contamination on carcass surfaces. Some treatments
will require further development as indicated. Finding practical ways to reduce bacterial contamination on raw
poultry products will continue to be a top priority in the agency. 



Anticipated Improvements 



Inspectors and veterinarians would be free to concentrate their attention on disease problems, on more intensive
inspection of various on-line and off-line plant operations and on microbial controls. The Agency could more effectively
utilize its inspection resources to maintain bird-by-bird inspection at this time, particularly for pathology
and disease conditions, while enhancing and increasing its use of a comprehensive program of sampling and quality
assurance. This proposal would also allow the Agency to begin to lay the groundwork necessary for further training
of personnel to perform monitoring and prevention activities needed to implement the Hazard Analysis and Critical
Control Points System in the future. The poultry enhancement initiatives included in this proposal are intended
to improve the current inspection system and not be a substitute for inspection. A comparison of the current and proposed
systems is summarized in Table 2.

There are currently a total of 8382 in-plant inspector positions, including poultry and meat inspectors. These proposed
enhancements would not have any impact on the total number of inspector positions. There are 424 total in-plant inspector
vacancies. FSIS has requested funds for 200 additional inspectors for FY95 to help fill some of these vacancies. The
implementation of these poultry enhancement changes would not have an impact on the number of vacancies.
The total number of inspectors available for off-line duties as a result of the proposed poultry enhancement program
would be 139. (See Tables 3a. and 3b.)

Currently, the average net increase in in-plant inspector positions is 55-57 per year. The majority of increased
positions have resulted from industry growth. It is projected that the growth of the poultry industry will continue
and possibly increase. Additionally, FSIS expects an increased need for inspectors for HACCP monitoring and additional
microbiological duties. The 139 inspection personnel resulting from the implementation of the enhanced poultry
inspection system could fill the new positions resulting from industry growth, as well as the new positions created
for HACCP monitoring and additional microbiological duties. Other positions considered could include permanent
relief inspector positions or additional off-line inspector positions. 

Although not available for the present rulemaking, new microbiological tests and sampling programs are under development.
The proposed system requires inspection at a point where FSIS expects some microbiological testing to occur. Research
is aimed at determining typical microbial conditions at various in-plant and in-process locations. On the basis
of such information, it is hoped, criteria can be developed for determining when plant processes are in control and
in compliance with a standard, based on microbiological test results. In the future, with the aid of rapid in-plant
tests, inspectors and veterinarians should be able to determine more precisely the source and nature of microbial
threats to public health. 



Executive Order 12866 



FSIS has determined that this proposed rule is significant, but does not believe it to be economically significant,
for the purposes of Executive Order 12866, because it raises significant policy issues arising out of legal mandates
and the Administration's priorities, which include a regulatory system that improves, protects, and maintains
public health and safety without imposing unacceptable costs on the private sector. 

The proposed rulemaking would meet the objectives of the Secretary of Agriculture to enhance poultry inspection
by enforcing a more stringent policy for the removal of feces from dressed poultry carcasses and by requiring the application
of antimicrobial treatments. It is thereby intended to improve public health and safety and strengthen consumer
confidence in poultry products. 

While the proposed rulemaking would impose initial costs and additional responsibilities on the regulated industry,
the Agency's assessment indicates that the proposed rulemaking is cost-effective as compared to the alternatives
considered. There would be no reduction in maximum poultry production linespeeds currently allowed under optimal
conditions, but the proposed regulation would provide inducements to industry to improve processing controls and
further ensure the quality and safety of outgoing product. 

At the same time, the proposed rulemaking would apply the President's regulatory philosophy by addressing a compelling
public need ``. . . to protect or improve the health and safety of the public . . . or the well-being of
the people.'' (E.O. 12866, section 1(a).) This need is evidenced by epidemiological and economic studies carried
out in recent years that show the presence of microbial pathogens on raw poultry products to be a continuing and possibly
an increasing threat to the public health and the economy of the nation.
 




Preliminary assessment by FSIS indicates that this proposal is consistent with other planned regulatory actions
and with Administration policy goals. For example, this proposed rulemaking would be both compatible with and a precursor
of the planned mandatory Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP) programs for meat and poultry establishments.
The inspection and plant sorting stations to be provided for control of disease and contamination would be consistent
with certain control points that would be chosen for monitoring under a HACCP system. The proposal is also intended
to contribute to the fulfillment of the Administration's public health objectives as set forth in the Healthy People
2000 initiative. 



Benefits of Proposed Rule 



The benefits to be derived from the proposed rule include potential reductions in the microbial profile of dressed,
ready-to-cook poultry, including both pathogens and other bacterial organisms. A reduction in visible contamination,
combined with antimicrobial treatments, can result in a decrease in the microbial load on dressed poultry carcasses.
 




Foodborne illness exacts a significant annual toll on the American people and economy. An estimated 6.5 million to
33 million people in the United States become ill and 6,000 to 9,000 die each year from foodborne illness. Meat, poultry,
dairy, and seafood products are the foods most likely to contain contaminants. Microbial foodborne disease causes
an estimated $2.5 billion to $3.4 billion in medical costs and reduced productivity to be spent each year for four major
bacterial pathogens and $2.6 billion each year for parasitic diseases.
 




Of the four bacterial pathogens, 

Salmonella, Campylobacter jejuni, Listeria monocytogenes, 

and 

Escherichia coli

 0157:H7, the first three are found on poultry. In as many as 17.2 percent of salmonellosis cases, poultry products
have been implicated as the vehicle (immediate source of infection). Annual medical costs attributable to salmonellosis
range from $1.2 billion to $1.6 billion. The costs associated with campylobacteriosis cases are in the neighborhood
of $1 billion per year. More than 40 percent of campylobacteriosis cases can be attributed to the consumption of improperly
handled chicken. Productivity losses from such cases are estimated at over $400 million for 1992.
 The growing proportion of the U.S. population that is compromised by immunologic deficiencies and age exacerbates
the problem because these subpopulations are more susceptible to infection and death resulting from infection.

<TEXT>
 

The costs associated with foodborne illness attributable to improperly handled poultry are thus substantial in
both human and monetary terms, and the Department has undertaken a comprehensive program of research, regulation,
and consumer education to try to improve the situation. The reduction of foodborne pathogens on meat, meat food, and
poultry products remains the Agency's highest research priority. Eight of the Agency's ``top ten'' research topics
concern aspects of this problem. FSIS is developing a number of regulations, including this proposed rule, to deal
comprehensively with the problems associated with pathogens on raw meat and poultry. For example, the Agency recently
promulgated a regulation requiring safe handling labeling on all meat and poultry products that are raw or have not
been subjected to a process that would make them ready-to-eat. A vigorous consumer education campaign is underway
to publicize the safe handling labels and to remind consumers of the importance of food safety practices.
The proposed rule would strengthen the Department's pathogen reduction effort by providing enhanced assurance
that ready-to-cook poultry are free of disease and visible contamination that may harbor pathogens. This would be
accomplished, first, by requiring official establishments to meet their responsibility to present for post-mortem
inspection only birds that have been presorted for condemnable conditions. Second, FPS process tolerances for fecal
contamination would be eliminated. The effort to reduce such contamination is likely to yield corresponding reductions
in harmful bacteria on dressed poultry carcasses.
Third, the on-line/off-line carcass inspector, provided by the proposal, would be able to increase FSIS oversight
over establishment dressing procedures, such as viscera harvest, and on-line trimming. Inspectors would now have
the opportunity to inspect every carcass after the viscera harvest operation. Because, under the current inspection
systems, there is no on-line inspection position after viscera removal, Federal inspectors are not able to view every
carcass at the end of the production line before the carcasses enter the chiller. This proposal would correct that
situation.
Fourth, all reprocessed poultry would be reinspected. Added assurance would thus be provided that reprocessed poultry
are free of visible contamination and unlikely to be a cause of cross contamination when introduced into the chill
system.

Fifth, a pre-chill antimicrobial treatment step would be required. This would help assure lower microbial populations
on raw carcasses.

The additional assurance of poultry wholesomeness provided by the proposed regulation would increase consumer
confidence in the U.S. poultry supply, with further increases in the domestic and export markets for U.S. poultry
a likely result.

Another benefit of the proposed regulation would be improved safety and health conditions for FSIS inspectors. The
new inspection procedures to be implemented by this proposal would result in the elimination of most repetitive inspector
hand motions, and this would lead in turn to a dramatic reduction in repetitive motion disorder among FSIS poultry
inspectors_including days off from work for medical consultation and treatment. Annual claims reported by FSIS
inspectors (both poultry and red meat) to the Office of Workers Compensation Programs of the Department of Labor have
amounted to over $500,000 per year for repetitive motion disorder. In addition to such well-publicized conditions
as carpal tunnel syndrome and tendinitis, inspector have reported cases of epicondylitis, ganglionic cyst, and
other conditions imposing compensation costs of $4,000 to $5,000 per case.

Finally, the proposed regulation would establish a single, uniform inspection system for all classes of poultry
that are subject to the PPIA. Poultry processors would have added assurance that_no matter what kind of poultry they
market_the standards and procedures by which the poultry are inspected are the same, and that all birds are expected
to meet uniform requirements. All establishments would be able to maintain, and some establishments would be able
to increase, their production rates.

The Agency would gain short-term flexibility in assigning inspectors from some line positions to existing vacancies
in the inspection program, and long-run flexibility to train personnel in a uniform methodology and to assign or reassign
them more readily to locations where they are most needed. Implementation of enhanced poultry inspection would benefit
the Agency by helping to offset the need for more inspectors to meet industry growth, fulfill HACCP monitoring requirements,
and carry out microbiological sampling programs. Finally, consumers would gain the assurance that the same dressing
and contamination standards had been applied to all types of federally inspected poultry.

The Agency requests that comments on these and other benefits be submitted to help evaluate the advantages that could
be expected from implementation of a final rule.



Costs of Proposed Rule



The major impacts of the proposal on the poultry industry would be the one-time costs associated with installing new
facilities and equipment and the on-going costs associated with information collections and the 100-percent reinspection
of reprocessed birds. Preliminary estimates of these costs are summarized in Table 4. The Agency requests that comments
on the proposal include information on the costs to the extent it is available. These comments would help evaluating
the costs in the final rule. As indicated in the section of this preamble concerning the Paperwork Reduction Act, a
detailed analysis of the information collection requirements of the proposal is being submitted to the Office of
Management and Budget.

The figures listed in Table 4 take into account the number of federally inspected poultry slaughter establishments
currently in operation and the number of slaughtering lines for each inspection system. The estimates provided for
inspection stand purchase and installation are based on consultation with several equipment manufacturers. Most
of the approximately 186 establishments currently operating under SIS-2 and NELS may be able to use or move existing
inspection stands at a cost of no more than $1,000 each. For example, an establishment currently operating under the
NELS inspection system may be able to provide a reconfigured inspection line by moving an inspection stand from the
post-mortem inspection area to the pre-chiller carcass inspection station. Some plants, however, would have to
purchase or construct and install at least one new inspection stand at a cost of $6,000 to $10,000 per installation.
A guidebar would have to be installed at each on-line post-mortem inspection station to permit eviscerated birds
to be presented to the inspector for examination.
The estimates for installation of 200 foot-candle lighting take into account the fact that establishments operating
under several of the current inspection systems (SIS, NELS, and NTIS) are already provided with enhanced lighting.
Establishments operating under traditional inspection (as many as 96 lines) would have to install new lighting at
a cost of about $1,000 per purchase and installation. The enhanced lighting is necessary to ensure the effectiveness
of post-mortem inspection and the FPS checks under the new system.
As noted, most projected costs are one-time only. A few establishments may have to hire new personnel to staff some
poultry slaughter lines. Additional expenses for retraining establishment personnel are likely to be incurred
by all establishments. In addition, most establishments affected by this proposal would incur miscellaneous line
reconfiguration expenses involving space reallocation at an estimated $1,000 per establishment.
To meet the requirement for antimicrobial treatment before the chiller, approximately 30 percent of poultry plants
would have to install equipment. Most poultry establishments would not be affected immediately by the requirement
because their final washers are already using an antimicrobial agent. Those establishments that are not using their
final washes to add an antimicrobial agent could do so for approximately $500 per processing line simply connecting
their existing chlorine supply to their final carcass wash equipment.
The industry would incur additional annual costs in connection with the 100-percent on-line reinspection of reprocessed
birds. These costs have been computed on the basis of the average linespeeds for the different inspection systems
and the assumption of a 2-percent overall rate of reprocessing. It has also been assumed that most reinspection of
reprocessed carcasses would result in overtime hours and that a labor cost would be incurred for rehanging birds on
the processing line. Overtime salaries for Federal inspectors (paid by affected establishments) and wages for establishment
personnel have been factored into the estimates. The 2-percent reprocessing rate is based on approximately two years
of in-plant data collection and represents the national average. Through a combination of process control, good
husbandry practices, and good manufacturing practices individual establishments can lower this rate thereby decreasing
this on-going cost.

Also, an allowance for minor plant reconfigurations has been made. It is expected that some establishments would
have to move equipment and rearrange their slaughtering lines to a limited extent to make room for inspection locations.

Below are estimated costs to the poultry industry of converting to enhanced poultry inspection:




Inspection and plant sorter stands and guidebars for at most 643 lines: $2,129,920
Enhanced lighting for as many as 100 lines: $110,000
Expenses for training and hiring new establishment personnel: $544,500
Cost of inspection of reprocessed carcasses: $2.2 million
Miscellaneous processing line reconfiguration costs: $308,000
Cost of minimal equipment installations to meet final wash antimicrobial treatment requirement: $89,000
Estimated annual cost of information collections: $1.4 million
Total estimated direct impact on federally inspected establishments: $6.8 million
Estimated direct impact on (approx. 160) State-inspected establishments operating under ``at least equal to''
programs: $3.4 million
Estimated direct impact on poultry industry: $10.2 million




The Agency does not expect economic losses to occur as a result of slowing linespeeds due to proposed corrective action.
As indicated earlier in the preamble to this rule, maximum linespeeds allowed under optimal conditions would remain
the same. If establishment sorters fulfill their responsibility, as outlined in this proposal, then maximum linespeeds
should be attainable. Establishments currently operating under traditional inspection may be able to achieve increases
in linespeeds under this proposal but such action could only occur if quality and safety of the outgoing product was
ensured. As indicated by this analysis, the industry could operate with maximum effectiveness with a small investment
in personnel and training. As currently allowed, the FTIS inspector in charge or his/her designee would retain the
discretion to reduce linespeeds when necessary.


Alternatives Considered


FSIS considered two alternatives to this proposal that would meet the Secretary's objectives. The first of the alternatives
would involve detaching the viscera from poultry carcasses prior to inspection and presenting the organs and the
carcass for inspection at the same time, but separated. A separate belt or tray would be provided for the viscera to
prevent the viscera from contaminating the carcass. However, the cost to industry would be approximately $140 million
for new equipment. In addition, downtime for construction and installation could cost the industry as much as $780
million.

<PARENT> FR940713-1-00001 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Under the second alternative, the current post-mortem inspection procedures would be retained utilizing existing
inspection techniques, but with an inspector at the end of the line after the viscera have been removed from the carcasses
to examine each carcass for fecal contamination. This could be accomplished either by moving an existing inspector
to the end of the line, or by adding a new inspector to every line, or by a combination of both arrangements. However,
this would mean that the Government could incur additional personnel costs of approximately $16 million per annum.
Further, production rates could be reduced by 30 to 50 percent if the inspectors tasks remained identical, but fewer
inspectors were used to perform those functions. The impact of the slowed linespeeds could reach $5.2 billion per
year for chickens and turkeys.

In the judgment of the Agency, either of these alternatives would impose unacceptable costs.



Executive Order 12778



This proposed rule has been reviewed pursuant to Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. States and local jurisdictions
are preempted under the PPIA from imposing any requirements with respect to federally inspected premises and facilities,
and operations of such establishments, that are in addition to, or different than, those imposed under the PPIA. States
and local jurisdictions are also preempted under the PPIA from imposing any marking, labeling, packaging, or ingredient
requirements on federally inspected poultry products that are in addition to, or different than, those imposed under
the PPIA. States and local jurisdictions may, however, exercise concurrent jurisdiction over poultry products
that are outside official establishments for the purpose of preventing the distribution of poultry products that
are misbranded or adulterated under the PPIA or, in the case of imported articles, which are not at such an establishment,
after their entry into the United States. States and local jurisdictions may also make requirements or take other
actions that are consistent with the PPIA, with respect to any other matters regulated under the PPIA.

Under the PPIA, States that maintain poultry product inspection programs must impose requirements on State-inspected
products and establishments that are at least equal to those required under the PPIA. These States may, however, impose
more stringent requirements on such State-inspected products and establishments.

In the event of its adoption, no retroactive effect would be given to this proposed rule, no administrative procedures
must be exhausted before any judicial challenge can be taken to the application of these provisions.



Effect on Small Entities



The Administrator has determined that this proposed rule will not have a significant effect on a substantial number
of small entities. The small entities affected by this proposal are small poultry slaughtering establishments operating
one or two slaughtering lines each staffed by one FSIS food inspector. They include establishments operating under
the SIS-1 and NTIS-1 inspection systems, and some small entities operating under the traditional inspection
procedures; these account for 75 of the approximately 300 poultry slaughtering establishments that would be affected
by the proposed rule. Thus, the proposed rule would affect a substantial number of small entities.

It may be assumed that each establishment with only one single-inspector processing line would be required to make
a one-time investment of about $10,000 for an inspection platform and installation, enhanced lighting, equipment
installation to meet the requirement for antimicrobial treatment of dressed poultry, and training of establishment
personnel. Each establishment with two lines could incur expenses of as much as $17,000.

Also, every establishment would be required to operate a finished product standards program. Establishments now
operating under traditional inspection would thus assume a modest information collection burden.

However, there would be no production rate reductions and, in fact, small establishments could benefit from increases
in production rates. For example, some processing lines staffed by a single FSIS inspector would now be staffed by
two inspectors and plant sorters. That means that, consistent with physical plant limitations, the class of poultry
processed, market demand for poultry products (which has been steadily increasing in recent decades), and the establishment's
ability to maintain processing controls and quality standards, production rates on these processing lines could
be increased with the adoption of the proposed rule. In the most favorable scenario, an establishment currently operating
under traditional inspection and processing young chickens at the rate of 25 per minute would be able to increase its
production rate up to 70 birds per minute. The increase in annual returns resulting from such a production-rate increase
would more than offset any necessary one-time investment.

In addition, for reasons given in this notice in support of changes to the FPS, there would be greater assurances of
processing stability and product quality under the proposed rule. Identification of product requiring rework would
be more certain. Resulting efficiencies could be expected to yield returns that, combined with productivity gains,
would offset outlays for equipment in the near term for most establishments.

For these reasons, therefore, the proposed rule would not have a significant net effect on a substantial number of
small entities.



Paperwork Requirements



This proposed rule requires paperwork and recordkeeping activities that would provide FSIS with information to
ensure that establishments are in compliance with the proposed regulations.

Each day, establishments would complete a form that reports that day's poultry condemnations. Also, under the proposed
FPS program, establishments would report data on only one form. Under the current FPS system, establishments complete
three forms to report data from FPS checks.

Establishments using chlorinated water to meet the proposed antimicrobial treatment requirements would be required
to monitor the concentration by testing three times a shift and keeping on file records of the test results.

Any establishment wishing to operate an approved PQC program would have to send a copy of the program to the Administrator
for approval. Additionally, an establishment wishing to use antimicrobial compounds not listed in the table of approved
substances may request, in writing, approval for use of such compounds from the Administrator.

The paperwork requirements contained in this proposal have been submitted to the Office of Management and Budget
for approval under the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq

.). Comments on the paperwork burden of this proposed rule should be sent to: Office of Management and Budget, Desk
Officer for FSIS, Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Room 3208, New Executive Office Building, Washington,
DC 20503, and to the Clearance Office, Room 404-W, Administration Building, Washington, DC 20250.

inspection stations, and 4 feet for the inspector helper provided by the establishment as required under  381.76(d).
(iii) Guidebars shall be installed in all establishments so that the inspector will receive birds on at least 6-inch
centers for young chicken lines and at least 12-inch centers for turkey lines. The guidebar must move the bird to the
edge of the trough for the inspector, and provide smooth, steady, and consistent movement through both the on-line
post-mortem inspection station and the on-line/off-line carcass inspection station.
(iv) The on-line post-mortem inspection station and the on-line/off-line carcass inspection station shall meet
the requirements specified in  381.53. Each inspection station shall have a platform that is slip-resistant
and can be safely accessed by the inspector. The platform shall be designed so that it can be easily and rapidly adjusted
for a minimum of 14 inches vertically while standing on the platform. The platform shall be a minimum length of 4 feet
and have a minimum width of 2 feet; the platform shall be designed with a 42-inch high rail on the back side and with 1/2
inch foot bumpers on both sides and front to allow safe working conditions. The platform must have a safe lift mechanism
and be large enough for the inspector to sit on a stool and to change stations during breaks or inspector rotation.
(v) Conveyor line stop/start switches shall be located within easy reach of each inspector.
(vi) A trough or other facilities complying with  381.53(g)(4) shall extend beneath the conveyor at all places
where processing operations are conducted from the point where the carcass is opened to the point after the second
inspector. The trough must be of sufficient width to preclude trimmings, drips, and debris from accumulating on the
floor or platforms. The clearance between the suspended carcasses and the trough must be sufficient to preclude contamination
of carcasses by splash.
(vii) A minimum of 200 footcandles of shadow-free lighting with minimum color rendering index value of 85
 where the birds are inspected to facilitate inspection, notwithstanding the requirements of  381.52(b).

(x) The on-line post-mortem inspection station shall be provided with receptacles for condemned carcasses and parts.
Such receptacles shall conform to the requirements of  381.53(m).
(2) In addition to the requirements prescribed in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the establishment shall provide
safely accessible space for the on-line/off-line carcass inspector to perform on-line inspection checks of carcasses
between the viscera harvest and the final wash.
(3) Reinspection stations for Finished Product Standards (FPS) monitoring, as prescribed in  381.76(h),
are required. The Agency will determine the number of stations needed in those establishments having more than one
processing line or more than one chiller. One or more FPS reinspection stations shall be conveniently located at the
end of the line or lines prior to chilling. Each reinspection station must meet the following provisions:
(i) Floor space shall consist of 3 feet along each conveyor line. The space shall be level and protected from all traffic
and overhead obstructions.
(ii) A table at least 2 feet wide and 2 feet deep and 3 feet in height shall be provided for reinspecting the sampled carcasses,
except that such a table shall be at least 3 feet wide and 2 feet deep in establishments processing turkeys. All such
tables shall be designed to be readily cleanable and drainable.
(iii) A minimum of 200 footcandles of shadow-free lighting with a minimum color rendering index of 851 on the table
surface shall be provided.
(iv) A separate clip board holder shall be provided for holding the recording sheets.

(v) Hangback racks designed to hold 10 carcasses shall be provided for and positioned within easy reach of persons
at the station.

3. Section 381.67 would be revised to read as follows:



 381.67

Maximum post-mortem inspection rates.



(a) The maximum post-mortem inspection rates for the classes of poultry are specified in the following table. Establishments
that operate under an approved partial quality control (PQC) program, as prescribed in  381.76(i), may operate
at higher production rates when optimum conditions are met. These maximum rates shall not be exceeded.






(b) The inspector in charge or his or her designee shall be responsible for reducing production rates where, in the
inspector's judgment, the post-mortem inspection procedure cannot be adequately performed with the time available
because of either of the following conditions:

(1) The official establishment cannot present the birds in such a manner that the carcasses including both internal
and external surfaces and all organs, are readily accessible for inspection, or 

(2) The establishment cannot properly remove diseased birds or properly identify contaminated birds and birds for
off-line trimming or knife salvage.

4. Section 381.68 would be removed and reserved.

5. Subpart I would be amended by adding a new  381.69 to read as follows:



 381.69

Treating carcasses to reduce bacterial contamination.



(a) 

General.

 Raw, unchilled poultry carcasses shall be treated at any point during the slaughter and dressing operation to reduce
levels of bacterial contamination on carcass surfaces.

(b) 

Treatment methods.

 Official establishments shall use any of the following treatment methods to reduce bacterial contamination, provided
that the equipment used to apply the treatment has been approved under  381.53, the operation of the method results
in full compliance with the Act and this part, and that the method permits effective and efficient monitoring by program
employees.

(1) Any chlorine compound approved by the Administrator and administered to raw, unchilled whole poultry carcasses
or major carcass portions at 20 to 50 parts per million (ppm) in the intake water at the final wash. The Administrator
will prepare a list containing compounds approved for use in official establishments. A copy of the list may be obtained
from the Compounds and Packaging Division, Regulatory Programs, Food Safety and Inspection Service, U.S. Department
of Agriculture, Washington, DC 20250-3700.

(i) The establishment must conduct three tests per 8-hour shift on the intake water of each final washer using a starch-iodide
titration test kit, or any other chlorine analysis method acceptable to the IIC, to assure that chlorine intake levels
are within the range prescribed above. An initial test must be conducted at the start of the shift before the first carcass
enters the final washer. The two other tests must be conducted at randomly selected times during the shift. Records
of chlorine test results that specify the time of the test, chlorine concentration levels, and the name and position
of the person administering the test shall be on file in the establishment and shall be made available to program employees,
upon request. 

(ii) If the chlorine level is above or below the range of 20 to 50 ppm available chlorine in the final wash water, the establishment
shall adjust the chlorine level to an acceptable level within 15 minutes. If adjustments are not made within 15 minutes,
the establishment shall suspend the treatment and shall not permit any carcasses to enter the final washer until the
chlorine level is within the prescribed range. 

(2) Any antimicrobial compound listed in the table in  381.147(f)(4) permitted for use on poultry products
may be used under the conditions specified therein.

(3) Any compound previously approved for use in poultry or poultry products as a food additive or processing aid by
the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and listed in title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations, parts 73, 74, 81, 172,
173, 182, or 184 may be used, provided the owner or operator has received approval for such use from the Administrator
in accordance with section 381.147(f)(1). The owner or operator shall submit to the Administrator information and
data indicating the site of application and that the substance is effective in reducing bacterial contamination
on carcass surfaces, and its use is in compliance with applicable FDA requirements and will not render the carcass
adulterated or misbranded or otherwise not in compliance with the requirements of the Act.

(4) Any countercurrent scalder, designed such that potable water enters at or near the point where carcasses exit
the scalder, overflow outlets are located at or near the point where carcasses enter the scalder, and exiting carcasses
do not come in contact with overflow water, that is used concurrently with a post-scald rinse may be used, provided
the equipment is evaluated and found acceptable by the Administrator. The Administrator will prepare a list containing
each model approved for use in official establishments. A copy of the list may be obtained from the Facilities, Equipment,
and Sanitation Division, Science and Technology, Food Safety and Inspection Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture,
Washington, DC 20250-3700.

(5) Any mechanical process modifications, other than that listed in paragraph (b)(4) of this section, such as hot
water rinses, used singly or in combination with approved antimicrobial compounds may be used, provided the owner
or operator has received approval for such use from the Administrator. The owner or operator shall submit to the Administrator
information and data indicating that the proposed method is effective in reducing bacterial contamination on carcass
surfaces, and it will not render the carcass adulterated or misbranded or otherwise not in compliance with the requirements
of the Act.
6. Section 381.76 would be amended by adding a heading for paragraph (a), revising paragraphs (b) and (c), and adding
new paragraphs (d) through (h) to read as follows:


 381.76


Post-mortem inspection, when required; extent; rate of inspection.


(a) 

General.

 * * *
(b) 

Line configuration. 

There are two inspection stations located on each post-mortem inspection line. The first inspection station is located
immediately after the establishment sorter or sorters who are positioned immediately after evisceration. This
is known as the ``on-line post-mortem inspection station.'' The second inspection station is located after the final
wash and prior to the chiller. This is known as the ``on-line/off-line carcass inspection station.''
(c) 

Presentation. 

(1) The establishment is responsible for presenting to the on-line post-mortem inspector only carcasses that are
free of pathology and disease that would result in condemnation, in accordance with this part, designated for trimming
or knife salvage of such conditions, or designated for reprocessing. The establishment shall present each carcass
to the on-line post-mortem inspector properly eviscerated with the back side toward the inspector and the viscera
uniformly trailing or leading.
(i) The establishment shall place a sorter or sorters immediately after evisceration and prior to the on-line post-mortem
inspector to sort the carcasses and remove and condemn the carcasses, as necessary, or designate the carcasses for
knife salvage, off-line trimming, or reprocessing. The establishment sorter or sorters shall be positioned on the
processing line in a manner that does not impede inspection. The establishment records the reason for condemnation
of every carcass for each sorter.
(ii) The on-line post-mortem inspector shall assure that carcasses are appropriately designated for knife salvage,
off-line trimming, or reprocessing, and that condemnable carcasses are condemned.
(iii) If the on-line post-mortem inspector finds any birds on the processing line that should have been condemned
or designated for knife salvage, off-line trimming, or reprocessing, he or she shall stop the line for proper disposition,
and require removal of such birds, and recording of condemned birds by the establishment. The on-line post-mortem
inspector shall retain questionable birds for disposition by the inspector in charge.
(iv) Carcasses with certain defects not requiring condemnation of the entire carcass that were not designated by
the establishment sorter for off-line trimming, knife salvage, or reprocessing shall be passed by the on-line post-mortem
inspector, but he or she shall stop the line and the establishment shall be required to remove them for off-line trimming
or knife salvage.
(v) Carcasses that are designated for off-line trimming shall be removed from the processing line by the establishment
after the on-line post-mortem inspector and prior to viscera harvest.
(vi) Carcasses that are designated for knife salvage shall be removed from the processing line by the establishment
after the on-line post-mortem inspector and before the viscera harvest.
(vii) Carcasses that are designated for reprocessing shall be removed from the processing line by the establishment
after the on-line post-mortem inspector and prior to the viscera harvest and reprocessed at an approved reprocessing
station, as prescribed in  381.91(b). Such reprocessed birds shall be returned to the processing line by the
establishment after viscera harvest and prior to the on-line/off-line carcass inspector for reinspection.
(2) The establishment is responsible for presenting to the on-line/off-line carcass inspector only carcasses that
are free of fecal contamination and have been properly trimmed or reprocessed.

<TEXT>
 

(i) The establishment shall position a trimmer or trimmers between the viscera harvest and the final wash to trim carcasses
for trimmable lesions and quality defects, and to remove for reprocessing carcasses that are contaminated on inner
surfaces with feces. The trimmer or trimmers shall be positioned on the processing line in a manner that does not impede
inspection.
(ii) If the on-line/off-line carcass inspector finds any carcasses on the processing line that should have been designated
for reprocessing, he or she shall stop the line for proper disposition, and require removal of the carcasses, and recording
of any such carcasses condemned by the establishment. Carcasses that are reprocessed by the establishment shall
be returned to the processing line by the establishment at a point after the viscera harvest and prior to the on-line/off-line
carcass inspector.
(iii) If the on-line/off-line carcass inspector finds any fecal contamination on a reprocessed carcass, the establishment
shall be required to rework all remaining reprocessed carcasses in that reprocessed lot which shall be identified
as prescribed in  381.91(b).
(iv) Under the following conditions, the establishment's production rate shall be reduced immediately to the extent
necessary to ensure process control in preventing fecal contamination, and for such duration, until FSIS determines
that the establishment can demonstrate process control at the higher production rate:
(A) When the on-line/off-line carcass inspector finds any fecal contamination on a carcass, other than reprocessed
carcasses, or 
(B) When the establishment or the inspector finds any fecal contamination on a carcass during testing under the Finished
Product Standards Program, as prescribed in paragraph (h) of this section.
(d) 

Inspector helper. 

The on-line post-mortem inspector shall be flanked by an establishment employee assigned to duties such as removing
carcasses previously designated by the establishment for knife salvage, off-line trimming, or reprocessing or,
as directed by the inspector, removing birds for veterinary disposition or correlation.
(e) 

Inspection rates.

 (1) Establishments shall operate at the rates prescribed in  381.67. Establishments that operate under an
approved PQC program, as prescribed in paragraph (i) of this section, may operate at higher rates than establishments
operating without PQC.
(2) For the establishment to run its production line at maximum speed, optimal conditions must be maintained so that
inspection may be conducted efficiently. The inspector in charge or his or her designee determines the speed at which
each processing line may be operated to permit inspection. A variety of conditions may affect this determination
including the health of each flock and the manner in which birds are being presented to the inspector for inspection
and the accuracy of the establishment sorters.
(f) 

Facilities. 

Each inspection station must comply with the facility requirements in  381.37(c).

(g) 

Recordkeeping. 

Establishments shall record information pertaining to the birds that are condemned.

(h) 

Finished Product Standards. 

The Finished Product Standards (FPS) shall be conducted in all poultry slaughter establishments.

(1) For purposes of this paragraph (h), the following definitions shall apply:

(i) 

Cumulative sum (CUSUM). 

A statistical concept used by the establishment and monitored by the inspector whereby compliance is determined
based on sample results collected over a period of time. For purposes of determining compliance with the finished
product standards, the CUSUM is equal to the sum of prior test results plus a measure of the current test minus the tolerance,
with the condition that the resulting CUSUM cannot go below zero.


(ii) 

Tolerance number. 

A measure that equates to product being produced at a national product quality level. 

(iii) 

Action number. 

A level reached by the CUSUM where the process is out of control and product action is required by the establishment
or the inspector.

(iv) 

Start number. 

A value halfway between zero and the action number. The start number is used to determine the starting CUSUM for the
first subgroup of a shift and to reset the CUSUM value if the CUSUM is equal to or greater than the action number.

(v) 

Subgroup.

 A 10-bird sample collected before product enter the chiller.


(vi) 

FPS testing.

 Testing conducted by the establishment to determine the CUSUM on consecutive 10-bird subgroup samples collected
prior to product entering the chilling system.


(vii) 

Rework.

 Reconditioning the product to correct the condition or conditions causing the nonconformances listed in Table 1.


(2) Finished Product Standards are criteria applied to processed birds to ensure the product consistently meets
ready-to-cook requirements. The FPS Program is designed to monitor the quality and effectiveness of the dressing
and evisceration procedures. The criteria consist of nonconformances (see Table 1 of this section), the incidence
of which is determined from 10-bird subgroup samples, reduced to a CUSUM number, and measured against the standards
(see Table 2 of this section). Standards are applied to permit the Agency to estimate when the production process is
in control and when it is out of control. The establishment is responsible for maintaining the FPS Program which, in
turn, is monitored by the inspector. If an out-of-compliance condition is found, the product is segregated for rework,
reworked, and retested before it may proceed into commerce.


(i) 

Actions to be taken when the process is in control.

 If the CUSUM is less than the action number and the most recent subgroup sample is tolerance or below, the process is
judged to be in control.


(A) 

Establishment actions.

 The establishment shall:


(

1

) Randomly select and record subgroup sampling times for each production unit of time before product reaches the FPS
reinspection station on the production line. In no case shall the time between tests exceed 1 hour of production time.


(

2

) Conduct a 10-bird subgroup test at a random time on each poultry slaughter line. These times are preselected by the
establishment and available to the inspector prior to the start of the shift/day's operation. All 10 samples of the
subgroup shall be collected at the random time.


(

3

) Record the test results. If the subgroup total is tolerance or below, conduct the next randomly scheduled subgroup
test.


(B) 

Inspector actions.

 The inspector shall:


(

1

) Select random times for monitoring subgroup tests for each half-shift on the evisceration line. In establishments
that have multiple evisceration lines on a production shift, monitor all lines of product at the random times.


(

2

) Collect the subgroup samples to be monitored at preselected times. All 10 samples of the subgroup shall be collected
at the random time selected.


(

3

) Conduct the 10-bird monitoring subgroup test. Record the test results. If the subgroup total is tolerance or below,
conduct the next randomly scheduled subgroup test.


(ii) 

Actions to be taken with rising CUSUM.

 If the establishment or inspection subgroup test result is above tolerance, the process is judged to be under questionable
process control.


(A) 

Establishment actions.

 The establishment shall:


(

1

) Immediately notify the inspector in charge and the production supervisor responsible for the affected evisceration
line.


(

2

) Take specific process corrective actions for each FPS category with nonconformances to prevent the process from
yielding product requiring rework. These actions are recorded on the FPS form.


(

3

) Suspend random time FPS testing. Conduct additional subgroup tests a minimum of 15 and a maximum of 30 minutes apart
at the reinspection station to determine the adequacy of process corrective actions. Include the test results in
the CUSUM. If the testing results in an additional subgroup total exceeding tolerance or CUSUM equals or exceeds the
action number, identify subsequent product for rework and follow procedures for process out of control.


(

4

) If two consecutive additional subgroup tests a minimum of 15 and a maximum of 30 minutes apart demonstrate process
control with subgroup totals equal to or less than tolerance, but they do not cause CUSUM to fall to the start line or
below, reset CUSUM at the start number.


(

5

) Resume random time subgroup testing as set forth in actions to be taken when the process is in control.


(B) 

Inspector actions.

 The inspector shall monitor product and the effectiveness of process corrective actions by making spot-check observations
to ensure that all program requirements are met. 


(iii) 

Actions to be taken when the CUSUM reaches the action number.

 If the subgroup test results in CUSUM equal to or exceeding the action number, or results in a rising CUSUM and a subsequent
subgroup test above tolerance, the process is judged not in control.


(A) 

Establishment actions.

 The establishment shall:


(

1

) Identify subsequent product for rework.


(

2

) Immediately notify the inspector in charge and production supervisor responsible for the affected evisceration
line.


(

3

) Take specific process corrective actions for each FPS category with nonconformances to regain process control
and minimize rework. These actions shall be recorded on the FPS form.


(

4

) Suspend random time testing. Conduct additional subgroup tests at the reinspection station to determine the adequacy
of process corrective actions. Include the test results in the CUSUM.


(

5

) After two consecutive subgroup tests at least 30 minutes apart result in subgroup totals equal to or less than tolerance,
identify product that will mark the end of the rework action.


(

6

) If two consecutive additional subgroup tests demonstrate process control with subgroup totals equal to or less
than tolerance, but they do not cause CUSUM to fall to the start line or below, reset CUSUM at the start number.

(

7

) Resume random time subgroup testing as set forth in actions to be taken when the process is in control.
(B) 

Inspector action. 

The inspector shall monitor product and the effectiveness of process corrective actions by making spot-check observations
to ensure that all program requirements are met.
(iv) 

Off-line rework of product. 

(A) When the product has been identified as having been produced when the process was not in control, off-line product
corrective actions must take place. All corrective actions such as identifying affected product, segregating product,
and maintaining control through rework actions are the establishment's responsibility.
(B) The inspector shall spot check the establishment's identification, segregation, and control of reworked product
to ensure that program requirements are met. If the establishment fails in its responsibilities, the inspector shall
identify, segregate, and retain affected product to prevent adulterated product from reaching consumers.
(C) Reworked product must be tested by the establishment with a randomly selected subgroup test of the accumulated
reworked lot. Before product is released, the subgroup test must be less than or equal to tolerance. If the subgroup
test of the reworked lot exceeds tolerance, the lot must be reworked again before another subgroup test is selected.
The following actions are required.
(

1

) 

Establishment actions. 

The establishment shall:
(

i

) Select the 10-bird subgroup from throughout the lot only after the total lot has been reworked.
(

ii

) Conduct the 10-bird test.
(

iii

) Release the lot if the subgroup test is less than or equal to tolerance.
(

iv

) Identify and control the lot to be reworked again if the subgroup again exceeds tolerance.
(

2

) 

Inspector actions. 

The inspector shall spot check the rework procedure and testing to ensure that establishment monitoring and production
meet the requirements of the program.
(3) 

Trimmable Lesion/Condition Testing and Actions. 

The trimmable lesion/condition test is designed to monitor the establishment's ability to remove trimmable lesions
and conditions from inspected and passed carcasses. The trimmable lesions and conditions in this category include,
but are not limited to, the definition of trimmable lesion/condition nonconformances (see Table 1). A 300-bird test
is conducted on-line at the reinspection collection site at the end of the slaughter process. The test follows the
same random schedule selected for FPS category testing and is conducted immediately following the FPS 10-bird test.
Zero tolerance for trimmable lesion/condition nonconformances is met through testing and actions independent
of the other FPS nonconformance categories. Trimmable lesions and conditions detected on carcasses through the
FPS 10-bird test are removed before carcasses are returned to product flow. All product identified through the 300-bird
on-line test as having trimmable lesions or conditions is retained, reworked, and retested before proceeding into
commerce.

(i) 

Actions to be taken when the process is in control

. When no trimmable lesions or conditions are found on the 300-bird on-line test, the process is judged in control.


(A) 

Establishment actions

. The establishment shall: 

(

1

) Randomly select and record subgroup sampling times for each production unit of time before product reaches the reinspection
station on each production line. In no case shall a test represent more than 1 hour of production. 

(

2

) Conduct 300-bird on-line test at random selected time on each poultry slaughter line. Record the test results. If
no trimmable lesion/condition is detected, continue the random scheduled time 300-bird on-line testing. 

(B) 

Inspector actions

. The inspector shall: 

(

1

) Select random times for 300-bird on-line tests for a minimum of each half-shift on each evisceration line. In establishments
that have multiple evisceration lines on a production shift, monitor all lines of product at the random times. 

(

2

) Conduct the 300-bird on-line test at random selected time on each poultry slaughter line. Record the test results.
If no trimmable lesion/condition is detected, conduct the next 300-bird on-line test at random scheduled time. 

(

3

) If either establishment or inspection monitoring finds a trimmable lesion/condition during a 300-bird on-line
test, the process is judged out of control. 

(ii) 

Actions to be taken when the process is out of control

. When any trimmable lesions or conditions are found on the 300-bird on-line test, the process is judged out of control.


(A) 

Establishment actions

. The establishment shall: 

(

1

) Immediately identify subsequent product for rework. 

(

2

) Immediately notify the inspector in charge of trimmable lesion/condition. 

(

3

) Record specific process corrective actions taken for the trimmable lesion/condition category on the test sheet.


(

4

) Suspend random time testing for the trimmable lesion/condition category. 

(

5

) Conduct additional 300-bird on-line tests after the final wash to determine the adequacy of process corrective
actions. 

(

6

) After a 300-bird on-line test is free of any trimmable lesion/condition: 

(

i

) Identify product that will mark the end of the rework action. 

(

ii

) Resume random time 300-bird on-line testing as set forth in actions to be taken when the process is in control. 

(B) 

Inspector actions

. The inspector shall monitor product and the effectiveness of process corrective actions by making spot-check observations
to ensure that all program requirements are met. 

(iii) 

Off-line rework of product

. (A) When the product has been identified as having been produced when the process was not in control, off-line product
corrective actions must take place. All corrective actions such as identifying affected product, segregating product,
and maintaining control through rework actions are the establishment's responsibility. 

(B) The inspector shall spot check the establishment's identification, segregation, and control of reworked product
to ensure that program requirements are met. If the establishment fails in its responsibilities, the inspector shall
identify, segregate, and retain affected product to prevent adulterated product from reaching consumers. 

(C) Reworked product must be tested by the establishment with a randomly selected subgroup test of the accumulated
reworked lot. Before product is released, the subgroup test must be free of any trimmable lesion/condition. If the
subgroup test of the reworked lot detects a trimmable lesion/condition, the lot must be reworked again before another
subgroup test is conducted. The following actions are required. 

(

1

) 

Establishment actions

. The establishment shall: 

(

i

) Select a subgroup sample from throughout the lot only after the total lot has been reworked. 

(

ii

) Conduct the rework subgroup test. 

(

iii

) Release the lot if no trimmable lesion/condition is found in the reworked lot. 

(

iv

) Identify and control the lot to be reworked again if any trimmable lesion/condition is found in the reworked lot.


(

2

) 

Inspector actions

. The inspector shall monitor product and the effectiveness of process corrective actions by making spot-check observations
to ensure that all program requirements are met.

(i) 

Partial quality control program.

 (1) Any owner or operator of an official establishment preparing poultry products who wishes to operate under an approved
PQC program must submit to the Administrator a partial quality control program designed to assure that poultry is
wholesome and properly prepared and shall request a determination as to whether or not that program is adequate to
result in product being in compliance with the requirements of the Act and therefore qualify for the higher inspection
rates specified in  381.67.

(2) The approved quality control program for the establishment shall include control points on the line, which shall
be monitored by the inspector.

(3) Establishment quality control employees shall operate the poultry carcass on-line quality control program
and shall make immediately available to inspection personnel any and all data collected and maintained under the
approved partial quality control program.

(4) An inspector shall monitor the establishment's application of the poultry carcass on-line quality control program
and shall take corrective action when he or she determines that the establishment has failed to maintain or correct
its process as described in the approved quality control program.

(5) The application, evaluation, and termination procedures for a PQC program are prescribed in  381.145.
If approval of the PQC program has been terminated in accordance with the provisions of  381.145(g), an application
and request for approval of the same or modified quality control program will not be evaluated by the Administrator
for at least 2 months from the termination date. In order for the Department to provide the Federal inspection required
under the Act, an establishment whose PQC program has been terminated will be allowed to continue operating at maximum
inspection rates for establishments without PQC programs as prescribed in  381.67, provided all requirements
of the Act and regulations thereunder are met.

<USDEPT>CONSUMER PRODUCT SAFETY COMMISSION</USDEPT>





Strangulation Hazards Associated With Crib Toys; 
Withdrawal of Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Consumer Product Safety Commission. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Withdrawal of advance notice of proposed rulemaking.

 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Consumer Product Safety Commission has decided to terminate a proceeding for the development of requirements
to address strangulation hazards to children associated with crib toys.

1

 The Commission began this proceeding by publication of an advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPR) on October
19, 1990. 




On October 26, 1993, the Commission voted to terminate this proceeding and to withdraw the ANPR published in 1990.
The Commission took this action after considering written comments received in response to the ANPR and correspondence
concerning this proceeding; information about strangulation deaths and injuries to children from January, 1973,
through February, 1993; annual sales of crib toys and the number of crib toys currently in use; the potential effectiveness
of labeling and other mandatory requirements to reduce strangulation deaths and injuries to children associated
with crib toys; other written materials prepared by the Commission staff; an oral briefing presented by the Commission
staff; and other information. 
The Commission concluded that evidence is not available at this time to demonstrate that crib toys present an unreasonable
risk of strangulation death or injury to children. The Commission also concluded that such evidence would not likely
be developed if the proceeding were continued. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
A. Background 


In 1990, the Commission granted a petition which requested issuance of a rule to address risks of strangulation deaths
and injuries to children associated with certain crib toys and crib mobiles (1).

2

 The petition used the term ``crib toy'' to describe a variety of toys which are intended to be strung across a crib or
play pen or attached to the side of a crib or play pen and which are intended to be manipulated by infants. ``Crib mobiles''
are decorative articles which are designed to hang above a crib or play pen, but are not intended to be touched or manipulated
by infants. The petition requested issuance of a rule to: 




 Require that a crib gym or similar manipulative toy 
intended to be strung across the top of a crib must 
have a rigid horizontal suspension member attachable 
at or above the height of the crib side rails with no 
vertical protrusions; 
 Prohibit any crib toy from having any protrusions 
which can catch clothing or any other item worn by 
an infant; 
 Limit the length of any vertical string on any crib 
toy to six inches; 
 Prohibit on any crib toy any cords or other components 
which form a perimeter greater than 14 inches; 
 Prohibit on any crib toy any pull ring attached to a 
cord; 
 Ban any crib mobile that can be located within reach 
of an infant who is not capable of pushing up on his 
or her hands and knees inside a crib; 

 Require labeling and instructions for various crib 
toys and crib mobiles to warn of strangulation 
hazards associated with those products. 
On October 19, 1990, the Commission published an advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPR) in the 

Federal Register

 (55 FR 42402) under the Federal Hazardous Substances Act (FHSA) (15 U.S.C. 1261 et seq.) to begin a proceeding to develop
the rule requested by the petition (2). 


B. Statutory Authority 


Section 2(f)1(D) of the FHSA (15 U.S.C. 1261(f)1(D)) defines the term ``hazardous substance'' to include ``[a]ny
toy or other article intended for use by children'' which the Commission determines by regulation to present a ``mechanical
hazard.'' Section 2(s) of the FHSA (15 U.S.C. 1261(s)) provides that a toy or children's article may be determined
to present a 



mechanical hazard if, in normal use or * * * reasonably foreseeable * * * abuse, its
design or manufacture presents an unreasonable risk of personal injury * * * from * * *
points or other protrusions, * * * openings, or closures, * * * or * * *
because of any other aspect of the article's 
design or manufacture.

The Commission may make a determination that a toy or children's article presents a mechanical hazard by issuance
of a regulation in accordance with provisions of sections 3(e) through (i) of the FHSA (15 U.S.C. 1262(e)-(i)).
A toy or children's article which is the subject of a rule issued in accordance with provisions of sections 3(e) through
(i) and which fails to comply with all requirements of such a rule is a ``banned hazardous substance'' as that term is
defined by section 2(q)(1)(A) of the FHSA (15 U.S.C. 1261(q)(1)(A)). The introduction into interstate commerce
of a banned hazardous substance is prohibited by section 4 of the FHSA (15 U.S.C. 1263). 
Section 3(f) of the FHSA (15 U.S.C. 1262(f)) requires publication of an ANPR to begin a proceeding for issuance of a
rule in accordance with sections 3(e) through (i) to make a determination that a toy or children's article presents
a ``mechanical hazard.'' Section 3(f) also sets forth requirements for the content of the ANPR. 
In accordance with section 3(f) of the FHSA, the ANPR for crib toys identified the products and the risk of injury which
are the subject of the rulemaking proceeding, and set forth the regulatory options under consideration by the Commission.
The ANPR stated that the Commission was considering issuance of any or all of the requirements requested by the petition.
The ANPR also summarized provisions applicable to crib toys in a voluntary standard published by ASTM (formerly the
American Society for Testing and Materials), designated F963-86, Standard Consumer Safety Specification
for Toy Safety. In addition, the ANPR stated that the Commission was also considering the possibility that this voluntary
standard could be revised to address additional hazards associated with crib toys, or that a new voluntary standard
could be developed to address those hazards (2). 
As required by section 3(f) of the FHSA, the ANPR solicited comments from interested persons about the products and
risk of injury under consideration; invited interested persons to submit an existing standard as the proposed regulation;
and invited interested persons to submit a statement of intention to develop or modify a voluntary standard to address
risks of strangulation death and injury associated with crib toys. (2) In response to the ANPR, the Commission received
comments from 17 organizations and individuals (3-19). The Commission also received a joint-communication
from six organizations concerning the proceeding for crib toys after the close of the comment period for the ANPR (20).

On September 21, 1993, the Commission staff transmitted to the Commissioners a briefing package of information concerning
the development of requirements to address strangulation hazards associated with crib toys (21). On October 22,
1993, the staff presented an oral briefing to the Commission concerning this proceeding. 


C. Action by the Commission 


On October 26, 1993, the Commission voted to terminate the rulemaking proceeding applicable to crib toys and to withdraw
the ANPR published on October 19, 1990. 
To make a determination that a product presents an ``unreasonable risk of injury'' under the FHSA, the Commission
considers: 
 The nature and severity of the risk of injury associated with the product; 
 The potential of mandatory requirements for the product to reduce the frequency and severity of the injury;
and 
 The effect of mandatory requirements on the cost, utility, or availability of the product. 
Additionally, section 3(i) of the FHSA (15 U.S.C. 1262(i)) provides that in order to issue a final rule expressing
the Commission's determination that a toy presents a ``mechanical hazard,'' the Commission must prepare a regulatory
analysis which includes a description of potential benefits and potential costs of the rule and identifies those
parties likely to receive the benefits and to bear the costs. Section 3(i) provides further that the Commission may
not issue a final rule unless it makes a finding that ``the benefits expected from the regulation bear a reasonable
relationship to its costs.'' 
Applying the factors involved in the determination of an unreasonable risk of injury to the information developed
during this proceeding, the Commission finds the following: 


The Nature and Severity of the Risk of Injury 


The nature of the risk of injury associated with crib toys is strangulation on the product. Strangulation injuries
may result in death or permanent brain damage. For this reason, strangulation injuries have the potential to be of
the utmost severity. 
However, the likelihood of a strangulation incident involving a crib toy is relatively small. During the period from
January, 1973, through February, 1993, 28 children died in strangulation accidents associated with crib toys, an
average of three deaths every two years (22). During the same period, one child sustained permanent brain damage from
a strangulation accident associated with a crib toy (22). At the same time, however, an estimated 10 to 25 million crib
toys were sold each year, and an estimated 50 million crib toys were in use on any given date (23).

The Potential of Mandatory Requirements To Reduce the Frequency and Severity of the Risk of Injury 



The information considered by the Commission indicates that the potential of mandatory requirements to reduce risks
of strangulation death and injury associated with crib toys is limited. 

A 1987 analysis of strangulation injuries associated with crib toys identified three hazard patterns involved in
32 fatalities. In seven of these fatalities, an article worn by the child, such as a bib or a necklace, caught on a protrusion
of a crib toy (24). After publication of the ANPR, the Commission undertook additional work to identify characteristics
of hazardous protrusions. However, the Commission has not been able to develop an objective test to distinguish those
protrusions which present a strangulation hazard from those which do not (21, 25). 

Another hazard pattern identified in the 1987 analysis was that of postural strangulation. In six of the fatalities
described in that analysis, the child's head and neck were suspended over a horizontal cord. All but one of these cases
involved crib gyms. The 1987 analysis recommended that the horizontal member of a crib gym should consist of a rigid
structure rather than a cord, and that the design of a crib gym should not allow installation of the product below the
height of the top rails of the crib sides (24). These recommendations were intended to eliminate the risk of postural
strangulation associated with a crib gym left in a crib occupied by a child who is able to push up on his or her hands and
knees (typically, a child older than five months of age). 

However, after consideration of more recently developed information, the Commission is concerned that a design
requirement for a rigid horizontal member on a crib gym could create other risks of injury to a child who is able to push
up on his or her hands and knees. If one end of a crib gym with a rigid horizontal member became detached from the side of
the crib and rested on the crib mattress, the crib gym might provide a means by which such a child could climb over the
side rail of the crib (21). Additionally, if a crib gym with a rigid horizontal member were installed near the end panel
of a crib, another risk of strangulation injury might result if that placement created an opening which would be large
enough to allow a child's head to enter, but which would be too small for the head to exit if turned to another orientation
(21). 

The third hazard pattern discussed in the 1987 analysis of strangulation incidents associated with crib toys resulted
when a child's neck became entangled in one or more strings or cords of a crib toy. Four of the fatalities discussed in
that analysis resulted when a child's neck became entangled in two or more cords attached to a stuffed toy animal (24).
A comment on the ANPR from an association of toy manufacturers observed that stuffed animal toys with attached suspension
cords are prohibited by the voluntary toy safety standard, and that such toys have not been manufactured for several
years (8). Two other fatalities discussed in the 1987 analysis resulted when a child's neck became entangled in a single
vertical cord which extended from a crib toy (24). To address that risk of strangulation, the 1987 analysis recommended
that the length of any vertical string attached to a crib toy should not exceed six inches. However, the comment from
the association of toy manufacturers states that no report of any fatality resulting from entanglement in a single
vertical cord extending from a crib toy has been received since 1986 when the voluntary toy safety standard was revised
to restrict the length of such cords to less than 12 inches. (8)

The 1987 analysis of crib toy strangulation incidents also recommended that crib mobiles should be labeled to warn
that the article should be kept out of the reach of infants, and should be removed when the infant attains the age of five
months or is able to push up on his or her hands and knees. That analysis further recommended instructions accompanying
crib toys should include warnings to place the crib mattress in one of the lower positions and to raise the crib drop
side when attaching a crib toy. (24) However, the Commission has received newer information indicating that labeling
alone cannot be expected to reduce strangulation hazards associated with crib toys (25). 



The Effect of Mandatory Requirements on the Cost, Utility, and Availability of the Product 



The Commission was unable to obtain information about the costs which might result to manufacturers or consumers
from imposing any of the requirements for crib toys discussed in the ANPR. The Commission did not attempt to make cost
estimates because of uncertainty about the numbers and specific kinds of crib toys which might be affected by each
of the requirements discussed in the ANPR. 



D. Voluntary Standard 



The Commission also considered alternatives to development of mandatory requirements for crib toys. These alternatives
included existing provisions of a voluntary standard for toy safety intended to address risks of strangulation injury
associated with crib toys, and revisions of that voluntary standard which were under consideration at the time the
Commission decided to terminate this proceeding. 

The proposed revisions included the addition of design guidelines to the voluntary standard to minimize strangulation
hazards from protrusions on crib toys. The guidelines are intended to be used by manufacturers in the development
of crib toys (27, 28). 

As noted above, the Commission staff was not able to devise objective criteria to identify protrusions on crib toys
which present a strangulation hazard. In the absence of objective criteria to identify hazardous protrusions, the
Commission concludes that addition of the proposed design guidelines to the voluntary standard would be worthwhile
(27). 

The revisions of the voluntary standard under consideration also included: 

 Language to limit to 14 inches the perimeter formed by strings or cords which can tangle to form a loop; 

 Improved warning labels concerning strangulation hazards associated with crib gyms and similar toys intended
to be strung across the top of a crib or 
playpen; 

 Addition of labeling requirements for crib mobiles to advise parents of precautions needed to minimize strangulation
hazards associated with those products; 

Addition of language to the instructions to accompany crib gyms and similar toys to advise parents of precautions
to be taken to minimize strangulation hazards associated with those products. (27)

After considering information about the voluntary standard and proposed revisions of that standard, the Commission
concludes that the proposed changes would adequately address the hazards identified in the ANPR. 

Section 3(g)(2) of the FHSA requires the Commission to terminate a proceeding for the development of a rule to address
an unreasonable risk of injury associated with a toy or children's article if the Commission determines that a voluntary
standard developed or modified after publication of the ANPR adequately addresses the risk of injury under consideration
and that substantial compliance with such a voluntary standard is likely to be achieved. 

However, provisions of section 3(g)(2) apply only to a voluntary standard which has been ``finally approved'' by
the organization which developed the standard. The proposed revisions of the ASTM voluntary standard for toys discussed
above have not yet been finally approved by ASTM. For that reason, the Commission is not required by section 3(g)(2)
of the FHSA to terminate this proceeding. 



E. Conclusions by the Commission 



From its consideration of all available information about risks of strangulation injuries to children associated
with crib toys and mandatory requirements to address those risks, the Commission concludes that:

(1) To date, information has not been developed to establish that crib toys present an unreasonable risk of strangulation
injury to children; 

(2) Consequently, information has not been developed to establish that issuance of a mandatory rule for crib toys
to address that risk of injury is reasonably necessary; and 

(3) If this proceeding were continued, such information would not likely be developed. 

The Commission also concludes that information is not now available or likely to be developed to support a finding
that the expected benefits from a mandatory rule to address strangulation hazards associated with crib toys would
bear a reasonable relationship to the costs imposed by such a rule. Such a finding is required by section 3(i) of the
FHSA to issue a rule for crib toys. 

Accordingly, the Commission hereby withdraws the ANPR published in the 

Federal Register

 of October 19, 1993 (55 FR 42402) to initiate a proceeding for development of requirements to address risks of strangulation
deaths and injuries associated with crib toys.

Guides for the Hosiery Industry, Extension of Time Within Which To File Public Comments



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Federal Trade Commission.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Extension of time within which to file public comments.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Federal Trade Commission (the ``Commission'') has requested public comments on its Guides for the Hosiery Industry

Safety Zone; Widmann Wedding Fireworks Display, Sheffield Island, CT


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Coast Guard, DOT.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of proposed rulemaking.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Coast Guard proposes to establish a safety zone in Sheffield Harbor, around the fireworks barge C-33 located
approximately 1200 feet northwest of the abandoned lighthouse on Sheffield Island, Norwalk, CT from 9:15 p.m. through
10 p.m. on September 17, 1994. This safety zone is needed to protect the maritime community from possible navigation
hazards associated with a fireworks display. Entry into this zone will be prohibited unless authorized by the Captain
of the Port, Long Island Sound.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
Requests for Comments


The Coast Guard encourages interested persons to participate in this rulemaking by submitting written data, views,
or arguments. Due to the limited amount of time available prior to the event, only a 30 day comment period can be provided.
Persons submitting comments should include their name and address, identify this rulemaking [CGD01-94-064]
and the specific section of this proposal to which each comment applies, and give a reason for each comment. Persons
wanting acknowledgment of receipt of comments should enclose a stamped, self-addressed postcard or envelope.
The Coast Guard will consider all comments received during the comment period. It may change this proposal in view
of the comments. The Coast Guard plans no public hearing. Persons may request a public hearing by writing to the Project
Officer at the address under ADDRESSES

. If it determines that the opportunity for oral presentations will aid this rulemaking, the Coast Guard will hold
a public hearing at a time and place announced by a later notice in the 

Federal Register

.


Drafting Information


The principal persons involved in drafting this document are LCDR T.V. Skuby, Project Officer, Captain of the Port,
Long Island Sound, and LCDR J. Stieb, Project Attorney, First Coast Guard District, Legal Office.


Background and Purpose


The sponsor, Jim Widmann, President of CT Pyro Display Company, South Norwalk, CT has requested that a fireworks display
be permitted in the port of Norwalk in the vicinity of Sheffield Island, Norwalk, CT, from 9:15 p.m. through 10 p.m.
on September 17, 1994. The fireworks display is scheduled to celebrate the sponsor's wedding. The safety zone will
cover all waters of Sheffield Harbor within a 1200 foot radius of the fireworks barge C-33, which will be located
approximately 1200 feet northwest of the abandoned lighthouse on Sheffield Island, Norwalk, CT. This zone is required
to protect the maritime community from the dangers and potential hazards to navigation associated with the fireworks
display. Entry into or movement within this zone will be prohibited unless authorized by the Captain of the Port or
his on scene representative.


Regulatory Evaluation


This proposal is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does not require
an assessment of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that order. It has been exempted from review
by the Office of Management and Budget under that order. It is not significant under the regulatory policies and procedures
of the Department of Transportation (DOT) (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). The Coast Guard expects the economic impact
of this proposal to be so minimal that a full Regulatory Evaluation under paragraph 10e of the regulatory policies
and procedures of DOT is unnecessary.
The Coast Guard expects the economic impact to be minimal due to the limited duration of the fireworks display, the
small size of the safety zone, the low level or non existent commercial vessel traffic expected in the area during the
effective time of the zone, and the broadcast of marine safety advisories the day of the event.


Small Entities


Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq.

), the Coast Guard must consider whether this proposal will have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities. ``Small entities'' include independently owned and operated small businesses that are not dominant
in their field and that otherwise qualify as ``small business concerns'' under section 3 of the Small Business Act
(15 U.S.C. 632).
For the reasons addressed in the Regulatory Evaluation above, the Coast Guard certifies under 5 U.S.C. 605(b) that
this proposal, if adopted, will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.


Collection of Information


This proposal contains no collection of information requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501


et seq.

).

The Coast Guard has analyzed this proposal in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive
Order 12612 and has determined that this proposal does not raise sufficient federalism implications to warrant the
preparation of a Federalism Assessment.



Environment



The Coast Guard has considered the environmental impact of this proposal and concluded that under section 2.B.2.c.
of Commandant Instruction M16475.1B, it is an action under the Coast Guard's statutory authority to protect public
safety, and thus is categorically excluded from further environmental documentation. A Categorical Exclusion
Determination will be made available in the docket.

Notification to the Secretary of Agriculture of a Proposed Rule on Plant-Pesticides Subject to the Federal Insecticide,
Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act 



 

<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notification to the Secretary of Agriculture.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 Notice is given that the Administrator of EPA has forwarded to the Secretary of Agrculture, as required by section
25(a)(2) of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA), a proposed rule under sections 3 and
section 25(a) and (b) of FIFRA. EPA proposes to amend an existing regulation and to create a new regulation to clarify
the relationship between plants and plant-pesticides and their regulatory status under FIFRA. EPA also proposes
to exempt from FIFRA requirements classes of plant-pesticides that the Agency has determined pose low probability
of risk and are not likely to cause unreasonable adverse affects on the environment. Recognizing the unique characteristics
of plant-pesticides, the Agency proposes to create a new part in the CFR for regulations unique to plant-pesticides.




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Section 25(a)(2)(A) of FIFRA provides that the Administrator shall provide the Secretary of Agriculture with a copy
of any proposed regulation at least 60 days prior to signing it for publication in the 

Federal Register

. If the Secretary comments in writing regarding the proposed regulation within 30 days after receiving it, the Administrator
shall issue for publication in the 

Federal Register

, with the proposed regulation, the comments of the Secretary, if requested by the Secretary, and the response of the
Administrator concerning the Secretary's comments. If the Secretary does not comment in writing within 30 days after
receiving the proposed regulation, the Administrator may sign the proposed regulation for publication in the 

Federal Register

 anytime thereafter. As required by FIFRA section 25(a)(3), a copy of this proposed regulation has been forwarded
to the Committee on Agriculture of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and
Forestry of the Senate.

Pesticide Tolerances for Triasulfuron 




<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency. 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 EPA proposes to extend the tolerances for residues of the herbicide triasulfuron [3-(6-methoxy-4-methyl-1,3,5-triazin-2-yl)-1-(2-chloroethoxy)phenylsulfonyl)urea]
in or on barley and wheat grain at 0.02 part per million (ppm); barley and wheat straw at 2.0 ppm; barley and wheat forage
at 5.0 ppm; meat, fat and meat by products (excluding kidney) of cattle, goats, hogs, horses, and sheep; kidney of cattle,
goats, horses, and sheep at 0.2 ppm; and milk at 0.02 ppm. The Agency has not completed the regulatory assessment of
our science findings; therefore, the Agency is proposing to extend these tolerances for 1 year.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFROMATION:

 In the 

Federal Register

 of March 13, 1992 (57 FR 8844), EPA issued a final rule which established tolerances for residues of the herbicide triasulfuron
[3-(6-methoxy-4-methyl-1,3,5-triazin-2-yl)-1-(2-chloroethoxy)phenylsulfonyl)urea] in or on barley and
wheat grain at 0.02 ppm; barley or wheat forage at 5.0 ppm; barley and wheat straw at 20 ppm; meat, fat, and meat byproducts
(excluding kidney) of cattle, goats, hogs, horses, and sheep at 0.1 ppm; and milk at 0.02 ppm, with an expiration date
of March 13, 1995. These tolerances with an expiration date were required by EPA to allow the petitioner, Ciba-Geigy
Corp. to submit additional data required in the area of environmental fate and groundwater, and to allow the Agency
to complete the regulatory assessment of its scientific findings. The petitioner has submitted all the required
data. Because the Agency has not completed the requlatory assessment of its scientific findings, EPA is amending
40 CFR 180.459 to extend the expiration date for these tolerances until March 13, 1996.


Based on the information cited above and in the document establishing the time-limiting tolerance for triasulfuron
(57 FR 8844, March 13, 1992), the Agency has determined that when used in accordance with good agricultural practice,
this ingredient is useful and the tolerances will protect the public health. Therefore, EPA is proposing to extend
the tolerances as set forth below.

Any person who has registered or submitted an application for registration of a pesticide, under the Federal Insecticide,
Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) as amended, which contains any of the ingredients listed herein, may request
within 30 days after publication of this document in the 

Federal Register

 that this rulemaking proposal be referred to an Advisory Committee in accordance with section 408(e) of the Federal
Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.

Interested persons are invited to submit written comments on the proposed regulation. Comments must bear a notation
indicating the document control number [PP 8F3658/P584]. All written comments filed in response to this petition
will be available in the Public Response and Program Resources Branch, at the address given above from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m.,
Monday through Friday, except legal holidays.

The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the requirements of section 3 of Executive Order 12866.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601-612),
the Administrator has determined that regulations establishing new tolerances or food additive regulations or
establishing exemptions from tolerance requirements do not have a significant impact on a substantial number of
small entities. A certification statement to this effect was published in the 

Federal Register

 of May 4, 1981 (46 FR 24950).

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule; reopening of comment period. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This notice announces the reopening of the comment period on the proposed rule we published in the 

Federal Register

 on February 22, 1994 concerning Medicare intermediary and carrier functions.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On February 22, 1994 (59 FR 8446), we published a proposed rule in the 

Federal Register

, that would revise the list of mandatory functions included in agreements with Medicare fiscal intermediaries pursuant
to section 1816 of the Social Security Act. We would require that the intermediary agreements include, as functions,
the statutory requirements that intermediaries determine proper payment amounts and pay bills. All other functions
would be optional. We proposed that all functions included in contracts with Medicare carriers be optional, since
section 1842 of the Act does not list mandatory functions. These changes would provide us with the flexibility to transfer
functions from one intermediary or carrier to another or to otherwise limit the functions an intermediary or carrier
performs when we determine to do so would result in more effective and efficient program administration. The comment
period for the February 22, 1994 proposed rule ended on April 25, 1994. We are extending the comment period and will
consider comments if we receive them at the appropriate address, as provided in the February 22, 1994 proposed notice,
by October 11, 1994. All comments received between April 26, 1994, and the date of publication of this notice will be
accepted.

Equal Access Obligations of Commercial Mobile Radio Service Providers; Interconnection Obligations of Local Exchange
Carriers to Commercial Mobile Radio Service Providers; Interconnection Obligations of Commercial Mobile Radio
Service Providers


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Federal Communications Commission.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of Proposed Rule Making; Notice of Inquiry.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This Notice of Proposed Rule Making (NPRM) initiates a rule making proceeding to examine whether equal access obligations
should be imposed on commercial mobile radio service (CMRS) providers, and whether the interconnection arrangements
between local exchange carriers (LECs) and CMRS providers should be tariffed. The Notice of Inquiry (NOI) initiates
a broad inquiry into whether the Commission should impose interconnection obligations on CMRS providers. The NOI
also explores resale obligations and asks parties to address the extent to which those obligations should be imposed
on CMRS providers.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

This is a synopsis of the Commission's Notice of Proposed Rule Making and Notice of Inquiry (

Notice

) in CC Docket No. 94-54, FCC 94-145, adopted June 9, 1994, and released July 1, 1994.


The complete text of this Notice is available for inspection and copying during normal business hours in the FCC Dockets
Branch (Room 230), 1919 M Street, NW., Washington, DC, and also may be purchased from the Commission's copy contractor,
International Transcription Service, Inc. (ITS, Inc.), at (202) 857-3800, 1919 M Street, NW., Room 246, Washington,
DC 20554.


Synopsis of Notice


1. The 

Notice

 tentatively concludes that the Commission has authority under Section 201 of the Communications Act to order equal
access when it is in the public interest. The Notice also tentatively concludes that the public interest evaluation
depends upon an analysis of market power, as well as other important factors such as customer choice, increased end
user access to networks, access to a wider array of IXC service offerings, and elimination of the different regulatory
treatment of the Bell Operating Company affiliated cellular carriers. The 

Notice

 seeks comment on these tentative conclusions regarding the relevant legal standard and public interest criteria,
and invites parties to suggest other relevant factors or policy goals that should be included in the public interest
analysis under Section 201.
2. This 

Notice

 proposes to require that cellular licensees provide equal access to interexchange carriers (IXCs) and seeks comment
on whether equal access obligations should be imposed on other CMRS providers, including resellers of CMRS. Currently,
the Commission does not require CMRS providers to provide equal access.
3. The 

Notice

 notes that the Commission has a more fully developed record on the issue of equal access for cellular service than for
any other CMRS provider and observes that cellular service is an established, rapidly growing service that provides
many customers with alternate access to networks and services. Because of the limited record as to the service characteristics
of other CMRS providers, such as those that will provide PCS, specialized mobile radio service or improved mobile
telephone services, the 

Notice

 reaches no tentative conclusions for other CMRS providers. Rather, it seeks comment on whether the public interest
would be served if equal access obligations were extended to CMRS providers other than cellular providers.
4. The 

Notice

 tentatively concludes that the Commission should adopt a service area boundary definition for purposes of the equal
access obligation, and seeks comment on the circumstances under, or point at which, a cellular carrier must hand off
a call to an interexchange carrier.
5. The 

Notice

 also tentatively concludes that any equal access obligation should be implemented on a gradual, phased-in basis
and seeks comment on the method that should be employed. In addition, it seeks comment on service characteristics
and other technical issues related to the implementation of equal access and related cost issues.
6. The 

Notice

 seeks comment on whether the Commission should require LECs to offer interconnection under tariff, or whether the
Commission should retain its current requirement that LECs establish, through good faith negotiations with CMRS
providers, the rates, terms and conditions of interconnection.
7. The 

Notice

 also seeks comment on whether in lieu of imposing a tariff filing obligation, the Commission should revise the good
faith negotiation requirement by adding two new safeguards against unreasonably discriminatory rates or conditions.
8. The NOI portion of the 

Notice

 asks for comment on the issue of whether the Commission should require CMRS providers to furnish interconnection
to other mobile service providers. The NOI states that if the Commission determines that imposing interconnection
obligations would be in the public interest, Section 201(a) of the Communications Act gives the Commission the authority
to order CMRS providers to establish physical connections with other carriers. The NOI seeks comment on whether there
are public interest concerns that would justify imposing interstate interconnection obligations regardless of
whether CMRS providers control bottleneck facilities. Further, the NOI seeks comment on whether, if the Commission
concludes that imposition of CMRS interconnection obligations is not necessary at this time, it should examine the
future need for such obligations as part of an effort to monitor the CMRS marketplace. The NOI requests parties to comment
on the nature and scope of interconnection obligations the Commission should establish if the Commission decides
to impose such obligations. The NOI also seeks comment on whether some or all CMRS providers other than cellular licensees
should be required to resell service to facilities-based or non-facilities based CMRS competitors.


Ex Parte Rules


9. This is a non-restricted notice and comment rule making proceeding. Ex parte presentations are permitted, except
during the Sunshine Agenda period, provided they are disclosed as provided in the Commission's Rules.





Regulatory Flexibility Act


10. As required by Section 603 of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C.  601 

et. seq.

 (1981), the Commission has prepared an Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis (IRFA) of the expected impact of
the policies and rules proposed in this Notice on small entities. The IRFA is contained in Appendix B to the 

Notice.

 The Secretary shall cause a copy of this 

Notice

, including the IRFA, to be sent to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration in accordance
with Section 603(a) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.


Authority


11. This action is taken pursuant to Sections 1, 4(i), 4(j), 201, 202, 208, 332, and 403 Communications Act as amended;
47 U.S.C. 154(i), 201, 202, 208, 332, and 403.
12. Accordingly, it is ordered that notice is hereby given of the proposed regulatory changes described above, and
that comment is sought on these proposals.
13. It is further ordered that pursuant to applicable procedures set forth in   1.415 and 1.419 of the Commission's
Rules, 47 CFR 1.415 and 1.419, comments shall be filed with William F. Caton, Acting Secretary, Federal Communications
Commission, Washington, DC 20554 on or before August 30, 1994, and reply comments shall be filed with the Secretary
on or before September 29, 1994. To file formally in this proceeding, parties must file an original and five copies
of all comments, reply comments, and supporting comments. Parties wishing each Commissioner to receive a personal
copy of their comments must file an original plus nine copies.

SUMMARY: 

 This 

Order and Further Notice Proposed Rulemaking

 seeks comments on issues relating to the filing of applications for new Instructional Television Fixed Service (ITFS)
facilities, applications for major changes in existing facilities, and major amendments to pending applications.
Earlier in this proceeding, the Commission solicited comments on a proposal to institute a window filing procedure
for such applications, in order to stem the processing backlog. The 

Order and Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking

 seeks comment on how the Commission's Rules might be revised to enhance the efficiency of a window filing system. It
also lifts the freeze on the filing of applications of major changes to licensed facilities. The

Synopsis of Order and Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking



1. This 

OFNPRM

 further considers amending the Commission's rules to alter the procedures governing the acceptance of applications
for new Instructional Television Fixed Service (ITFS) stations, major amendments to such applications, or major
changes in existing stations. We also seek comment on several additional proposals put forth by the commenters and
on our motion intended to increase the efficiency and curtail potential abuse of our application processes. Finally,
we modify the freeze on the filing of major change applications, which we adopted earlier in this proceeding, to permit
the filing of major change applications and any competing applications thereto.

2. Our goal in this proceeding is to enhance the efficiency of our processing of ITFS applications. The 

Notice 

asserted that changes in the ITFS service in the last decade have fostered a substantial increase in the rate of applications
filed for new ITFS stations or major changes in existing stations, creating a significant backlog. The 

Notice 

tentatively concluded that the existing cut-off filing system, which requires each application to be processed
twice, significantly exacerbates the backlog. We proposed a window filing procedure for applications for new facilities,
applications for major changes in existing facilities, and major amendments to pending applications. We would accept
such applications only during specific times, or ``windows.'' This would allow us to eliminate the duplicative processing
and control the flow of applications, thereby improving processing efficiency. 

Notice of Proposed Rulemaking 

in MM Docket No. 93-24, 58 FR 12011 (March 2, 1993).
3. While most commenters agree that the current filing system is inefficient and unnecessary, they are divided on
the adoption of a window filing procedure. Supporters of the proposal generally agree that a window filing procedure
will help eliminate the inefficiencies resulting from the A/B cut-off system that were discussed in the 

Notice. 

Under the A/B cut-off system, educators with wireless cable lessees would at times file applications simply to be
mutually exclusive with applicants listed on an ``A'' cut-off list. The proposed window filing procedure would eliminate
this practice.
4. However, several commenters argue that the adoption of a filing window system without concomitant safeguards
against abuse would not increase processing efficiency. According to these parties, a window filing system would
encourage some wireless cable entities to persuade educational institutions to submit excessively large and unrealistic
numbers of applications, thereby allowing the wireless cable entity to warehouse spectrum. They assert that such
wireless cable entities do not intend to construct, but rather seek a profitable bargaining position with allegedly
``legitimate'' wireless cable developers. The commenters add that a wireless cable operator that plans to construct
may not be ready during a filing window to associate with schools and prepare its applications. Alternatively, they
assert that wireless cable operators that do intend to construct would have to file applications in every market in
which they hope eventually to operate, in order to protect themselves from spectrum speculators, diminishing processing
efficiency.
5. Some parties argue that a window filing system is inappropriate for educational applicants not associated with
a wireless cable lessee, because they require up to 18 months to approve the project and authorize the funds needed
for construction. Thus, NIA states that such institutions would not be able to respond in time to a Public Notice of
a window. Also, several parties assert that any window filing procedure must account for the annual January grant
application deadline of the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA).





6. 

Discussion 

Under the existing cut-off filing system, each application must undergo a substantive engineering analysis upon
filing, simply to allow the release of an ``A'' cut-off list. No applications are granted or denied in this stage of
processing. Subsequently, each application undergoes a second technical analysis in order to determine whether
it is grantable. Because each of these analyses requires significant resources, the elimination of the duplicative
step would substantially improve processing efficiency. Moreover, a window filing procedure would deny frequency
speculators with no intention to construct the opportunity to file against applications on an ``A'' cut-off list.
These benefits would significantly improve the Commission's workflow management.
7. In addition, the record reflects that educators would be able to prepare adequately for each subsequent filing
period, due especially but not solely to the significant involvement of wireless cable operators in financing and
constructing the facilities. Most of these wireless cable operators have substantial experience in filing for Commission
licenses. The record reflects no reason why educators without excess capacity leases will not be able to prepare as
before for the financing and construction of an ITFS facility. An ongoing series of filing windows will still ensure
an opportunity for such educators to file when they are ready. Indeed, because ``A'' cut-off lists are not announced
in advance or released pursuant to a formal schedule, these educators would be in the same position under the window
system as they are now. Consequently, educators that do not rely on excess capacity lessees will not be disadvantaged
by the change to a window filing system. for the same reason, the consequences are identical as under the existing system
for parties simply not prepared to file during a window.
8. Also, in order not to obstruct NTIA grants, we propose allowing each December the tendering of applications that
rely upon NTIA funding. We would consider such applications, if filed outside a window period, as having been filed
during the immediately following window.
9. Accordingly, we are inclined to adopt the window filing procedure. We also acknowledge the concerns of the commenters
that the window filing procedure may not by itself alleviate the problems faced by applicants and the Commission.
Thus, as discussed further below, we seek comment on how we can achieve the significant benefits of a window filing
system while minimizing filing practices that impede efficient processing.


Proposals To Improve the Application Process


10. 

Financial Qualifications 

To deter a significant number of ITFS speculators, some commenters advocate requiring applicants or their proposed
wireless cable lessees to submit with their applications proof of their financial ability to construct.
 Moreover, they propose requiring separate financial documentation for each station applied for, and making the
wireless cable lessee submit the documentation when it is paying for construction of the facilities.




11. We request comment on this proposal. We believe that its adoption may deter a significant number of speculative
applications. However, we recognize that adoption would entail significant costs. Compiling the necessary documentation
could impose a significant burden on educational institutions, especially those not leasing their excess capacity.
Further, any enhanced efficiency might be eviscerated by our having to allocate substantial staff resources to the
analysis of each financial submission. In addition, the requirement could become a basis for the filing of frivolous
petitions, further delaying the grant of applications. We seek comment on how to balance these costs and benefits.
Moreover, we note that wireless cable lessees are not parties to ITFS applications. Thus, we ask commenters to address
whether it would be appropriate to require lessees to routinely submit demonstrations of their financial ability.
Commenters should also address whether our existing rules and policies on misrepresentation sufficiently prohibit
parties from falsely certifying their financial ability to construct.

12. 

Application Caps 

Next, we turn to two related proposals by the Educational Parties. The first is a cap of three to five applications that
an individual nonlocal ITFS entity could file during a window. Such applicants, according to the Educational Parties,
often work with frequency speculators and, backed by these wireless cable entities, submit a number of applications
simply to bargain with other wireless cable entities seeking to construct a viable wireless cable system. Second,
they propose an additional cap of 25 applications associated with the same wireless cable entity, including any entity
with direct or indirect common ownership or control. According to the Educational Parties, wireless cable lessees
should have to file with their associated ITFS applications information detailing who has any direct or indirect
interest in the wireless cable lessee, including any interests as an owner, officer, or director.

13. We invite comments on whether circumstances at this time warrant inquiry into either of the proposed measures.
Adoption of either proposal might diminish the number of applications submitted, thereby easing the processing
burden substantially. In addition, it would likely limit multiple filings by frequency speculators and their affiliated
applicants. However, wireless cable operators require a minimum number of channels with which to operate a viable
wireless cable system. Thus, stringent caps could obstruct the rapid development of robust wireless cable systems
that can vigorously compete in the rapidly expanding video marketplace. They could also retard the development of
ITFS systems, which often obtain funding from the wireless cable lessees. Also, commenters should address how to
justify the proposed discrimination against nonlocal applicants. We note that such entities establish eligibility
through letters of intended use from an official of each receive site, and through the service on a local programming
committee of an official of each receive site. Thus, we invite commenters to address whether and what kinds of limitations
would promote both ITFS and wireless cable development. How can we balance the efficiencies of such limitations with
the costs they might impose? If an application ceiling would serve the public interest, how many applications associated
with one entity should we allow per window? How would we define common control for the purpose of either ITFS or wireless
cable? Should we base our definition on actual control, or on attribution of ownership?

14. 

Expedited Consideration of Applications 

The Educational Parties and WCA propose that, under certain circumstances, we give expedited consideration to ITFS
applications in return for the applicant's agreeing to an accelerated construction schedule. WCA suggests that
a wireless cable lessee be able to request and obtain expedited consideration of an application with which it is associated,
if the lessee has access to a certain minimum number of channels in the area.
 In return, grantees would be required to order their equipment within 21 days of Public Notice of the grant, and construct
the facilities within six months. Extensions would be granted only under compelling circumstances, such as the inability
of the manufacturer to deliver timely ordered equipment, or accidental damages to essential equipment. WCA claims
that adoption of the proposal would accelerate the development of both ITFS and wireless cable systems. In addition,
the Educational Parties propose that educators without excess capacity leases also have access to such expedited
consideration.





15. While we do not now view the implementation of the proposal as practical, we invite comments on the proposal and
how it might be implemented. The staff may have to expend substantial resources determining which applications were
eligible for expedited consideration, enforcing the requirement for ordering equipment, and enforcing the construction
deadline, thereby delaying service to the public. Also, would the public be served if we denied an extension request
when construction is nearly complete at the end of the six months? Finally, the likely substantial number of applicants
requesting expedited consideration could defeat the purpose of the proposal. In the alternative, would processing
efficiency be adequately improved by a stricter enforcement of the existing requirements for extensions of time?

16. 

Assignment of Construction Permits 

We now turn to a related proposal to diminish the incentive of frequency speculators to submit applications for permits
that they intend to later assign for profit. We propose to formalize our current practice of limiting the allowable
consideration for unbuilt ITFS facilities to out-of-pocket expenses, as is now applied to the sale of broadcast construction
permits. We seek comment on the proposal.

17. 

Application of the Four-Channel Rule 

Section 74.902(d) of the Commission's Rules generally limits an ITFS licensee to four channels for use in a single
area of operation. However, we have not clearly defined what constitutes an ``area of operation'' for the purpose
of the rule. A clear benchmark would make the standard easier for applicants to comply with and would also increase
the speed of processing.

18. The staff has considered a single area of operation for this purpose to extend no farther than 20 miles from the transmitter
site. We seek comment on whether we should adopt that figure as a rule. Commenters should address whether an educational
institution is likely to routinely serve an area extending beyond that radius. Alternatively, should we instead
define an area of operation in terms of interference, rather than of distance? Specifically, we seek comment on whether
we should consider two sites to be in different areas of operation, as long as one could operate at maximum authorized
power on the same channel at each site without co-channel interference.

19. 

Offset 

We next turn to our policies toward offset.
 Currently, we apply the 28dB D/U ratio standard to determine co-channel interference. However, we do not require
offset if an objection is raised by one of the affected parties. Instead, we have encouraged privately negotiated
agreements to use offset to resolve interference. Consequently, we must decide between two mutually exclusive applications
when, if the applicants used offset, both could serve the public without objectionable co-channel interference.
To require offset between otherwise grantable mutually exclusive ITFS applicants would help maximize the number
of educational entities that can avail themselves of the service. Thus, we propose requiring the use of offset in such
circumstances when all affected transmitters are capable of handling frequency offset stability requirements.
Such a requirement, we believe, would both accelerate the granting of applications and allow for a greater number
of ITFS licensees, thereby increasing service to the public. Also, although we currently require new applicants
to use equipment capable of utilizing offset, we have not always done so. Accordingly, we would not apply the proposed
rule to facilities predating the requirement that lack offset capability.

20. 

Protected Service Areas. 

In addition to receive site protection, ITFS applicants can request interference protection for a service area.
 We provide such protection only at an applicant or licensee's request. Generally, such protection benefits the wireless
cable lessee, because the protected service area ensures interference protection within an area where receive sites
are not specified, or extended protection over an area where receive sites are not currently located. Moreover, the
protection is afforded only during the hours that the wireless cable entity is using the channels.





21. Protected service areas are intended to provide a measure of protection to wireless cable lessees, in order to
promote the inauguration of new or improved wireless cable service. However, the protected service area has frequently
been used in ways that we had not contemplated. Specifically, applicants for new facilities often request and receive
interference protection that restricts an existing licensee from seeking certain modifications to its facilities.
In addition, otherwise grantable ITFS applications in adjacent communities often obtain interference protection,
causing them to become mutually exclusive with a previously filed application. At the same time, an existing facility
that has not requested such protection often, upon learning that an application for a nearby operation has been filed,
requests interference protection and thereby obstructs the new applicant. We believe that these practices may be
an abuse of our processing system driven by certain wireless cable lessees, designed to prevent or dilute competition.
Further, this practice significantly impacts our processing and delays the inauguration of new or improved service
to the public. Moreover, such practices unfairly disrupt existing operations and already-proposed facilities.

22. In order to hasten service to the public, then, we propose to modify our application of interference protection.
Specifically, we propose to apply such protection only prospectively. Thus, it would be effective only with regard
to applications filed after the protection request. Commenters are invited to address whether our proposal would
sufficiently diminish the disruption and delay resulting from the current method of granting interference protection.
We also seek comment on a particular application of the proposed rule. Specifically, if two applications submitted
during the same filing window, otherwise grantable, are mutually exclusive only because both applicants request
a protected service area, we propose to consider them as mutually exclusive. We invite comments on this proposal.

23. 

Receive-Site Interference Protection. 

Pursuant to  74.903 (d) and (e) of the Commission's Rules, an ITFS licensee, permittee, or applicant may request
interference protection for its receive sites. The rule does not expressly limit the distance a receive site may be
from the transmitter in order to receive such protection. As a result, we have received numerous applications in which
interference protection has been requested for receive sites that appear to be beyond the reasonable coverage ability
of an educational institution. We believe that such requests are an abuse of our processes, designed to increase artificially
the service area of the wireless cable lessee. We also believe that the elimination of this practice would significantly
increase the efficiency of our processing of applications, thereby hastening service to the public.

24. Given an ITFS facility's height, power, frequency, and mode of transmission, our experience suggests that it
is generally unlikely that an educational institution would reasonably serve a receive site that is more than 35 miles
from the transmitter. Thus, absent a showing of unique circumstances, we propose to provide protection only for those
receive sites 35 miles or less from the transmitter. Further, we propose that an applicant not be able to claim eligibility
for a license by use of any receive site more than 35 miles from the transmitter. Applicants are invited to address this
proposal.

25. 

Major Modifications. 

We classify applications to modify an existing ITFS facility or to amend a pending application as either major or minor,
attaching different procedural rules to each.
 We generally define major modifications as those that significantly impact an existing or proposed facility. Pursuant
to the window proposal, the Commission will accept major amendments and applications for major modifications only
during an open window period.





26. However, the current definition of minor changes, we believe, does not realistically take into account the impact
that the proposed change would have on the facility in question, nearby facilities, or proposed facilities.
 Applicants frequently submit applications for changes that would substantially affect the operations of such facilities,
yet we now treat many of these changes as minor. Accordingly, we propose to reclassify certain changes as major. Consequently,
we would accept amendments and applications for such changes only during a window filing period. We believe that this
action would more accurately reflect the impact of a proposed change.





27. We have had an informal policy of considering proposals to relocate a facility's transmitter site by 10 miles or
more as a major change. We now propose to modify our rules to make this policy formal. In addition, we propose to reclassify
as a major change any application or amendment involving: (1) Any polarization change; (2) the addition of any receive
site that would experience interference from any licensee or applicant on file prior to the submission of the amendment;
(3) an increase in the EIRP in any direction by more than 1.5 dB;
 (4) an increase of 25 feet or more in the transmitting antenna height; or (5) any change that would cause interference
to any previously proposed application or existing facility. We note that by limiting the opportunity to file the
above types of applications, adoption of the proposal would appear to somewhat diminish a licensee or applicant's
flexibility to respond to changing needs and circumstances. At the same time, however, we believe that adoption of
the proposed rules would make our classification of changes more consistent. By doing so, we believe, we would enhance
the efficiency of the window filing system. Thus, it appears that the benefits gained from the rule would outweigh
the costs. We seek comment on our analysis. Finally, we propose to exempt from the new rule any change that resolves
mutually exclusive applications without creating new frequency conflicts.

28.

 FAA Authorization.

 Pursuant to Section 17.4 of the Commission's Rules, we do not grant or modify a license until the Federal Aviation Administration
(FAA) has determined that the proposed transmitter site will not pose a hazard to air navigation. Applicants now state
in their applications that they have applied for FAA clearance. However, once that clearance is obtained, applicants
are not required to inform the Commission. To hasten the time that our staff learns of the FAA's hazard determinations,
we propose to require the applicant to inform the Commission of the FAA's determination. We believe that this would
accelerate service to the public. Commenters are invited to address the costs and benefits of adopting the proposal.


29.

 Interference Studies

. Applicants often claim that their proposed facilities will cause no harmful interference, based either on their
being beyond the radio horizon or on their signal being blocked by nearby terrain. However, such applicants frequently
provide no terrain profiles to support such claims. Furthermore, whenever an applicant files a proposal claiming
that no interference will be cause due to the signal's being blocked by the surrounding terrain, a question almost
always arises as to the amount of signal that will be blocked. Many applicants conclude that any terrain obstruction,
regardless of degree, completely blocks the signal. Our experience has demonstrated that this conclusion is not
necessarily true.

30. Accordingly, we propose to amend the rules to require the submission of terrain profiles and a quantitative analysis
of any additional signal loss calculated by using the Longley-Rice propagation model, Version 1.2.2, in the point-to-point
mode. Adoption of the proposal would make mandatory a technical analysis that many applicants already use. The Longley-Rice
model was derived from NBS Technical Note 101 and updated in 1982 by G. A. Hufford. Version 1.2.2 incorporated modifications
described in a memorandum by Hufford in 1985. Terrain elevations used as input to the model should be from the United
States Geological Survey three-second or 30-second digitized terrain databases. Further, we propose to disregard
any claim of signal blockage caused by artificial structures. Such claims usually make impossible any quantitative
analysis. Accordingly, we seek comment on these proposals. 

31.

 Reasonable Assurance of Receive Sites

. We have received a number of applications in which some of the schools listed as receive sites have subsequently informed
us that they had, in fact, not agreed to participate in the proposed ITFS system. This practice forces the Commission
to allocate its scarce resources processing an inaccurate application, then reprocessing it (and related mutually
exclusive applications) when the information is corrected. Such duplicative processing significantly delays
the final disposition of all ITFS applications. Therefore, we seek comment on how an applicant should demonstrate
reasonable assurance of a receive site's legitimacy. We propose requiring a letter of assurance from the applicant,
listing the receive sites' contact people, titles, and telephone numbers. With regard to noncompliance with any
new requirement, should we automatically decline to consider any proposed receive site without adequate assurance?
32. 

Accreditation of Applicants 

Currently, pursuant to Section 74.932 of the Commission's Rules, an applicant to construct new facilities must report
whether it, its members, or the receive sites it serves are accredited. The application form does not require the educator
to specify whether it is the applicant or its members that are accredited. This ambiguity has opened the door to abuse
of our procedures. Consequently, we have received applications in which the applicant is an accredited organization,
but it proposes receive sites at non-accredited institutions. Applicants often evade the intent of the rule by having
only one receive site out of many accredited, thereby defeating the fundamental purpose of the service, which is to
serve the educational needs of accredited institutions. 
33. Thus, we propose to require applicants to state whether and by whom each school listed as a receive site in accredited.
We also propose not to consider in a tie-breaking proceeding a receive site that lacks this accompanying information,
or that is unaccredited, as that would allow it unwarranted comparative consideration. Commenters are invited to
address other ways we should utilize the additional information. Should we require a majority of receive sites to
be accredited in order for the application to be grantable? Should we deny interference protection for any unaccredited
receive site? We invite commenters to address any or all of the above proposals. However, we do not wish to limit the
range of comments in this area. Thus, we welcome other proposals besides those discussed above that would safeguard
both the efficiency of a window filing system and the integrity of our processes. 



Freeze of New Applications

34. In the 

Notice

 we announced that, for a period of time, we would not accept applications for new ITFS facilities or for major changes
to existing facilities. We expressed our concern that potential applicants would inundate the Commission with applications
while the old cut-off rule was still in effect, thereby defeating the purpose of the proposed rulemaking. However,
we stated that we would continue to accept (but not process) applications in which the applicant relies on NTIA for
construction funds. We have also continued to accept major change proposals where they are filed in the same market
to accommodate settlement agreements among applicants that have previously achieved cut-off status and where the
settlement resolves mutually exclusive applications.
35. Upon publication of this 

Order and Further Notice

 in the 

Federal Register,

 we shall instruct the staff to begin accepting applications for major changes to existing facilities, and any mutually
exclusive applications thereto. Such applications will be processed under the existing A/B cut-off rules. We believe
that this will ease the burden that the freeze has caused to educational institutions that seek to alter their existing
facilities. Licensees and those filing competing applications may file such applications until the effective date
of any window filing rules. We note that this 

Order and Further Notice

 contemplates modifying our definition of a major change. For the purposes of modifying the freeze, we shall use the
existing definition of the term. Any pending major modification application not cut off as of the adoption of this


Order and Further Notice

 will be considered in conjunction with the newly submitted applications. 


Administrative Matters


Pursuant to applicable procedures set forth in   1.415 and 1.419 of the Commission's Rules, 47 C.F.R.
1.415 and 1.419, interested parties may file comments on or before August 29, 1994, and reply comments on or before
September 28, 1994. To file formally in this proceeding, you must file an original and five copies of all comments,
reply comments, and supporting comments. If you want each Commissioner to receive a personal copy of your comments,
you must file an original plus nine copies. You should send comments and reply comments to the Office of the Secretary,
Federal Communications Commission, Washington, DC 20554. Comments and reply comments will be available for public

Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards; Seat Belt Assembly Anchorages 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), DOT. 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of Proposed rulemaking. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This notice proposes to amend Standard No. 210 to require the installation of anchorages for either a Type 1 or a Type
2 seat belt assembly at any seating position for which Standard No. 208 requires the installation of a Type 1 or a Type
2 seat belt. Anchorages required by Standard No. 210 must meet the strength, location and other performance requirements
of that standard. Currently, S4.1.2 of Standard No. 210 requires the installation of an anchorage for a Type 1 or a Type
2 seat belt assembly for all designated seating positions, except positions already required by section 4.1.1 of
Standard No. 210 to have an anchorage for a Type 2 seat belt assembly and except passenger seats in buses. The practical
effect of Standard No. 210's not requiring anchorages for the bus passenger seats is that the anchorages for the Type
1 seat belt assemblies required at passenger seats in small buses are not currently required to comply with the performance
requirements of that Standard. This notice will correct this oversight. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On November 2, 1989, NHTSA published a final rule amending Standard No. 208, 

Occupant Crash Protection,

 to require the installation of Type 2 (lap/shoulder) seat belts at all forward-facing rear outboard seating positions
in all vehicles with a gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR) of 10,000 pounds or less, other than school buses (54 FR 46257).
The final rule also required Type 2 seat belts at all front outboard seating positions in small buses and Type 1 (lap)
seat belts at all other seating positions in small buses. 



In the preamble to the final rule, effective September 1, 1991, the agency stated that it did not need to amend Standard
No. 210, 

Seat Belt Assembly Anchorages,

 to require the installation of anchorages for Type 2 seat belt assemblies at the affected seating positions because
S4.1.1 already required the installation of anchorages for a Type 2 seat belt assembly whenever Standard No. 208 required
the installation of a Type 2 seat belt. 

In making this statement, the agency overlooked the exceptions in S4.1.2 of Standard No. 210. That section requires
the installation of anchorages for a Type 1 or a Type 2 seat belt assembly for all designated seating positions, except
positions required to have an anchorage for a Type 2 seat belt assembly and except for passenger seats in buses. Thus,
the anchorages for the Type 1 seat belt assemblies required at passenger seats in small buses by the November 2, 1989
final rule are not currently required to comply with Standard No. 210. To correct this oversight, this notice proposes
to amend Standard No. 210 to require the installation of anchorages for either a Type 1 or a Type 2 seat belt assembly
at any seating position for which Standard No. 208 requires the installation of a Type 1 or a Type 2 seat belt. 

Since NHTSA believes that the anchorages currently being installed by the manufacturers comply with the requirements
of Standard No. 210, NHTSA is proposing that if this proposal is adopted as a final rule, it would become effective 30
days after publication.

The agency proposes to simplify the language of S4.1 and to reword it to eliminate the possibility of similar oversights
in the future. The proposed regulatory language in this notice combines the requirements of current S4.1.1 and S4.1.2
into one section. Further, it makes clear that anchorages for either a Type 1 or a Type 2 seat belt assembly are required
whenever Standard No. 208 requires either a Type 1 or a Type 2 seat belt assembly. This change will eliminate the need
for further amendment of Standard No. 210 if the seat belt requirements of Standard No. 208 are amended in the future.




Rulemaking Analyses and Notices 



Executive Order 12866 and DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures 



This rulemaking document was not reviewed under E.O. 12866, ``Regulatory Planning and Review.'' NHTSA has considered
the impact of this rulemaking action under the Department of Transportation's regulatory policies and procedures
and determined that the action is not ``significant'' under those policies and procedures. While these anchorages
are not currently required to comply with Standard No. 210, NHTSA believes that manufacturers do design these anchorages
to comply with these requirements. Thus, NHTSA does not expect any impact from this proposed rule. Therefore, preparation
of a full regulatory evaluation is not warranted. 



Regulatory Flexibility Act 



NHTSA has also considered the impacts of this notice under the Regulatory Flexibility Act. I hereby certify that this
proposed rule would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. As explained
above, NHTSA does not anticipate any impact from this proposed rule. 



Paperwork Reduction Act



In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (P.L. 96-511), there are no requirements for information
collection associated with this proposed rule. 




National Environmental Policy Act 



NHTSA has also analyzed this proposed rule under the National Environmental Policy Act and determined that it would
not have a significant impact on the human environment. 



Executive Order 12612 (Federalism) 



NHTSA has analyzed this proposal in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in E.O. 12612, and has determined
that this proposed rule would not have significant federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism
Assessment. 



Civil Justice Reform 



This proposed rule would not have any retroactive effect. Under 49 U.S.C. 30103, whenever a Federal motor vehicle
safety standard is in effect, a State may not adopt or maintain a safety standard applicable to the same aspect of performance
which is not identical to the Federal standard, except to the extent that the state requirement imposes a higher level
of performance and applies only to vehicles procured for the State's use. 49 U.S.C. 30161 sets forth a procedure for
judicial review of final rules establishing, amending or revoking Federal motor vehicle safety standards. This
section does not require submission of a petition for reconsideration or other administrative proceedings before
parties may file suit in court. 



Submission of Comments 



Interested persons are invited to submit comments on the proposal. It is requested but not required that 10 copies
be submitted. 


All comments must not exceed 15 pages in length. (49 CFR 553.21). Necessary attachments may be appended to these submissions
without regard to the 15-page limit. This limitation is intended to encourage commenters to detail their primary
arguments in a concise fashion. 


If a commenter wishes to submit certain information under a claim of confidentiality, three copies of the complete
submission, including purportedly confidential business information, should be submitted to the Chief Counsel,
NHTSA, at the street address given above, and seven copies from which the purportedly confidential information has
been deleted should be submitted to the Docket Section. A request for confidentiality should be accompanied by a cover
letter setting forth the information specified in the agency's confidential business information regulation.
49 CFR Part 512.

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM). 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 In response to a petition for rulemaking submitted by Sealco Air Controls, Inc., this notice proposes to amend the
control line pressure differential requirements in Standard No. 121, 

Air Brake Systems, 

for converter dollies and trailers designed to tow another vehicle equipped with air brakes. The agency has tentatively
concluded that the proposed amendments would improve the braking compatibility of such vehicles by allowing the
use of a relay valve known as a spool-type low opening valve. The agency does not anticipate any adverse safety consequences
resulting from amending the pressure differential requirements. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Standard No. 121, 

Air Brake Systems

, establishes performance and equipment requirements for braking systems on vehicles equipped with air brakes,
including requirements for pneumatic timing. For purposes of compliance testing, the pneumatic timing tests for
trailers, including trailer converter dollies, are conducted with the trailer connected to a test rig rather than
an actual tractor. The test rig delivers air to, and releases air from, the trailer during the timing test. The timing
tests for vehicles designed to tow trailers are conducted with a 50 cubic inch reservoir connected to rear control
line coupling. This reservoir represents the control line volume of the control trailer used in the compliance testing.

On August 21, 1992, NHTSA published a final rule amending the pneumatic timing requirements of Standard No. 121 with
respect to the control signal pressure balance for tractor trailer combinations. (57 FR 37902). The agency added
S5.3.5 which specifies a new test procedure for determining the control line pressure differential in converter
dollies and trailers designed to tow another trailer equipped with air brakes. Specifically, the rule requires that
the pressure differential between the control line input coupling and a 50 cubic inch test reservoir shall not exceed
1 psi at all input pressures between 5 psi and 20 psi and 2 psi at all input pressures greater than 20 psi. Agency research
indicates that input pressures below 20 psi represent routine braking applications, input pressures between 20
psi and 40 psi represent moderate to heavy braking applications, and input pressures above 40 psi represent severe
braking applications. As explained below, NHTSA is proposing to modify the limit above 40 psi to allow a 5 percent differential
(which at higher pressures exceeds the current limit of 2 psi) based on the Society of Automotive Engineer's (SAE's)
Recommended Practice SAE J1505, 

Brake Force Distribution Test Code Commercial Vehicles. 
The agency explained that the amendment is designed to ensure that the control signal ``passes'' through a towing
trailer or dolly without being altered along the way. Since the control signal passes through unaltered, each vehicle
in a combination unit receives the same brake control signal. This serves to increase the braking compatibility of
combination vehicles since each vehicle in a combination has comparable braking performance. 


Sealco Petition 


On June 18, 1993, Sealco Air Controls, Inc. (Sealco), a valve manufacturer, submitted to NHTSA a rulemaking petition
to amend Standard No. 121 with respect to the control line pressure differential requirements in S5.3.5. Specifically,
it requested that NHTSA amend these requirements to permit the manufacture of its low opening valves that serve to
adjust air flow in control lines. These valves are used as control line relay valves and service line relay valves in
trailers and converter dollies. The petitioner stated that unlike other relay valves that use a common poppet,

1

 the low opening valves have a balanced spool technology

2

 that incorporates a low pressure at which the valve initially opens (i.e., crack pressure) of 1.5 psi. According to
Sealco, the spool technology enables the valve to track closer between the input control air pressure and the output
delivered air pressure. As a result, it claimed that hysteresis

3

 is not so prevalent with low operating valves as with the high crack pressure poppet design valves. 






Hysteresis in a valve may cause the valve not to track (i.e., follow closely) the control line pressure properly, which
may cause the brakes in the trailer to lag behind the control signal. For example, when the driver applies the brakes,
the valve's hysteresis may not allow the same pressure to be applied to the trailer brakes, which will cause less braking
in the trailer and cause the trailer to ``push'' the tractor. Similarly, when the driver releases the brake, the hysteresis
in the valve may not allow the brakes in the trailer to be released quickly enough and will still have the brakes applied
while the driver is trying to accelerate, causing the kingpin to jerk on the inside of the fifth wheel. On more extreme
conditions where the driver goes through several fast brake applications and releases in rapid succession, the jerking
and pushing of the trailer or trailers could be difficult to control. 
Sealco stated that the use of low operating valves would further NHTSA's goal of ensuring balanced braking in combination
vehicles. However, the petitioner claimed that while its valve meets the amendment's application requirements,
it does not meet the provision requiring release at high pressure ranges, given the valve's mechanics. To comply with
the amendment, Sealco has drilled a hole in the valves' piston, thereby allowing pressure to bleed to the supply side.
This action prevents the valves from cracking open when tested according to S5.3.5. Sealco believes that this modification
to allow compliance with the amendment has reduced the valves' effectiveness. Sealco also criticized the test procedure
which it believed did not simulate actual braking conditions. It stated that slow and fast ascending and descending
control line pressures should be used to check the valves' ability to respond appropriately. 


Agency's Decision To Issue Proposal 


After reviewing the petition, NHTSA has decided to propose an amendment to Standard No. 121 to permit the use of low
operating valves. Specifically, the agency is proposing to amend S5.3.5 to account for input pressures over 40 psi.
Under the proposal, the pressure differential would not be permitted to exceed 2 psi at any input pressure between
20 psi and 40 psi and it would not be permitted to exceed 5 percent at any pressure over 40 psi. In other words, the pressure
differential requirements would remain the same, except for applications resulting in pressures over 40 psi. The
agency requests comments about whether the modification to pressure levels over 40 psi is appropriate.

NHTSA is proposing the value of 40 psi based on SAE J1505, 

Brake Force Distribution Test Code Commercial Vehicles. 

The agency has tentatively determined that the safety problem addressed by the requirement in S5.3.5, i.e., slow
heat build up and brake fade caused by long gradual down hill runs at relatively low air pressure, is not a problem for
severe brake applications over 40 psi. In formulating this proposal, NHTSA contacted all the major valve manufacturers.
Other than Sealco, no other valve manufacturer stated that they had to drill holes in the valve or otherwise modify
the valve in a way that might adversely affect their real-world dynamic braking performance in order to comply with
the test in S5.3.5. Aside from Sealco, the valve manufacturers believed that the existing test was a realistic, reasonable
assessment of low pressure differential performance. 

NHTSA has tentatively determined that this amendment would facilitate the use of spool valve technology, while not
being detrimental to safety. The agency's primary concern in these rulemakings addressing control line pressure
differentials is brake performance in the low end of the air pressure range since the vast majority of stopping occurs
there. Specifically, in the August 1992 rule, the agency sought to improve low end brake performance with respect
to slow heat build up and brake fading brought about by relatively low brake applications during long gradual downhill
descents. 

After further review, the agency now believes that the current requirement may unnecessarily extend the 2 psi requirement
into the higher pressure ranges where it is not necessary for safety. As noted above, the requirement is designed to
prevent brake fade during relatively low brake applications below 20 psi and is not applicable to hard brake applications,
i.e., those exceeding 40 psi. Accordingly, the agency has tentatively decided to modify the differential requirements
at levels over 40 psi. Notwithstanding the agency's tentative conclusion, the agency request comments about whether
this amendment poses any risk of adverse safety consequences. 

However, NHTSA disagrees with Sealco's statements that the test procedure in S5.3.5 does not simulate actual braking
conditions. The agency notes that this test procedure was based on the agency's own testing and extensive test data
and recommendations by trailer manufacturers in response to previous agency proposals. Specifically, the agency
disagrees with Sealco's statement that ``Slow and fast ascending and descending control line pressures should be
used to check CLV performance.'' As discussed in earlier notices, NHTSA sought pressure rises and decays that were
neither too fast nor too slow. As trailer manufacturers and other commenters to the earlier proposal stated, if the
pressure rise were too slow, test personnel would waste time waiting for the event to occur, and if the pressure rise
were too rapid, pressure differentials could not be read quickly enough. In addition, pressure surges from a fast
rate would likely result in a loss of normal valve hysteresis and subsequent errors in crack pressure readings. Accordingly,
the agency believes that the test accurately evaluates real-world dynamic braking without creating any significant
negative safety effects. 



Rulemaking Analyses and Notices 



1. Executive Order 12866 (Federal Regulatory Planning and Review) and DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures 



This proposal was not reviewed under E.O. 12866. NHTSA has analyzed this proposal and determined that it is not ``significant''
within the meaning of the Department of Transportation's regulatory policies and procedures. A full regulatory
evaluation is not required because the rule, if adopted, would have no mandatory effects. Instead, the proposal would
permit spool valve technology. Therefore, this rulemaking would not have any cost impacts. 



2. Regulatory Flexibility Act 



In accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act, NHTSA has evaluated the effects of this action on small entities.
Based upon this evaluation, I certify that the proposed amendment would not have a significant economic impact on
a substantial number of small entities. Vehicle and brake manufacturers typically would not qualify as small entities.
This amendment would affect small businesses, small organizations, and small governmental units to the extent that
these entities purchase vehicles. However, this amendment would not have any cost impact on vehicles. For these reasons,
vehicle manufacturers, small businesses, small organizations, and small governmental units which purchase motor
vehicles would not be significantly affected by the proposed requirements. Accordingly, no regulatory flexibility
analysis has been prepared. 



3. Executive Order 12612 (Federalism) 



This action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612,
and it has been determined that the proposed rule would not have sufficient Federalism implications to warrant preparation
of a Federalism Assessment. No State laws would be affected. 



4. National Environmental Policy Act 



Finally, the agency has considered the environmental implications of this proposed rule in accordance with the National
Environmental Policy Act of 1969 and determined that the proposed rule would not significantly affect the human environment.




5. Civil Justice Reform 



This proposed rule would not have any retroactive effect. Under section 103(d) of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle
Safety Act (49 U.S.C. 30111), whenever a Federal motor vehicle safety standard is in effect, a state may not adopt or
maintain a safety standard applicable to the same aspect of performance which is not identical to the Federal standard.
Section 105 of the Act (49 U.S.C. 30161) sets forth a procedure for judicial review of final rules establishing, amending
or revoking Federal motor vehicle safety standards. That section does not require submission of a petition for reconsideration
or other administrative proceedings before parties may file suit in court. 



Public Comments 



Interested persons are invited to submit comments on the proposal. It is requested but not required that 10 copies
be submitted. 

All comments must not exceed 15 pages in length. (49 CFR 553.21). Necessary attachments may be appended to these submissions

Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants; Proposed Endangered Status for the Jaguar in the United States 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Fish and Wildlife Service, Interior. 


 

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule. 


 


</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) announces a 12-month finding on a petition to extend endangered status
to the jaguar (

Panthera onca

) throughout its range under the authority of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act). The Service finds
that the petitioned action is warranted. The jaguar is currently listed as endangered from Mexico southward to Central
and South America. In the United States the primary threat to this species is from shooting. Loss and modification
of the jaguar's habitat may have also contributed to its decline. While no breeding population of the jaguar is known
to survive in the U.S., the species is present in northern Mexico, and wandering individuals occasionally cross the
border. A minimum of 64 jaguars have been killed in Arizona since 1900. The most recent was in 1986. This proposal, if
made final, will extend Federal protection provided by the Act for such dispersing animals. Critical habitat is not
being proposed. The Service seeks data and comments from the public on this proposal.

 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Background 



The jaguar (

Panthera onca

) is the largest species of cat native to the Western Hemisphere. Jaguars are muscular cats with relatively short,
massive limbs and a deep-chested body. They are cinnamon-buff in color with many black spots. Their range in North
America includes Mexico and portions of the southwestern United States (Hall 1981). A number of records of jaguars
are known for Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas. Additional reports exist for California and Louisiana. Records of the
jaguar in Arizona and New Mexico have been attributed to the subspecies 

Panthera onca arizonensis

. The type specimen of this subspecies was collected in Navajo County, Arizona, in 1924 (Goldman 1932). Nelson and
Goldman (1933) described the distribution of this subspecies as the mountainous parts of eastern Arizona north to
the Grand Canyon, the southern half of western New Mexico, northeastern Sonora, and, formerly, southeastern California.
The records for Texas have been attributed to 

P. o. veraecrucis

. Nelson and Goldman (1933) described the distribution of this subspecies as the Gulf slope of eastern and southeastern
Mexico from the coast region of Tabasco, north through Vera Cruz and Tamaulipas, 
to central Texas.

Swank and Teer (1989) indicated the historical range of the 
jaguar included portions of the states of Arizona, New Mexico, and 
Texas. These authors consider the current range to occur from 
central Mexico through Central America and into South America as far 
as northern Argentina. They stated that the United States no longer 
contains established breeding populations, which probably disappeared 
from the United States in the 1960s. They also maintained that the 
jaguar prefers a warm tropical climate, is usually associated with 
water, and is only rarely found in extensive arid areas. 
Brown (1983) presented an analysis suggesting there was a 
resident breeding population of jaguars in the southwestern United 
States at least into the 20th century. The Service (U.S. Fish and 
Wildlife Service 1990) recognized that the jaguar continues to occur 
in the American Southwest as an occasional wanderer from Mexico. 


Previous Federal Action 


The jaguar is listed as endangered from the U.S. and Mexico 
border southward to include Central and South America (37 FR 6476, 
March 30, 1972; 50 CFR 17.11, July 15, 1991). The species was 
originally listed as endangered in accordance with the Endangered 
Species Conservation Act of 1969 (ESCA). Pursuant to the ESCA, two 
separate lists of endangered wildlife were maintained, one for 
foreign species and one for species native to the United States. The 
jaguar appeared only on the List of Endangered Foreign Wildlife. In 
1973, the Endangered Species Act superseded the ESCA. The foreign 
and native lists were replaced by a single ``List of Endangered and 
Threatened Wildlife,'' which was first published in the Federal 
Register on September 26, 1975 (40 FR 44412-44429). 
On July 25, 1979, the Service published a notice (44 FR 43705) 
stating that, through an oversight in the listing of the jaguar and 
six other endangered species, the United States populations of these 
species were not protected by the Act. The notice asserted that it 
was always the intent of the Service that all populations of the 
seven species deserved to be listed as endangered, whether they 
occurred in the United States or in foreign countries. Therefore, 
the notice stated that the Service intended to take action as quickly 
as possible to propose inclusion of the United States portions of the 
species' range for listing. 
On July 25, 1980, the Service published a proposed rule (45 FR 
49844-49847) to list the jaguar and four of the other species 
referred to above in the United States. The proposal for listing the 
jaguar and three other species was withdrawn on September 17, 1982 
(47 FR 41145). The notice issued by the Service stated that the Act 
mandated withdrawal of proposed rules to list species that have not 
been finalized within 2 years of the proposal. 
On August 3, 1992, the Service received a petition from the 
instructor and students of the American Southwest Sierra Institute 
and Life Net to list the jaguar (

Panthera onca

) as endangered in the 
United States. The petition was dated July 26, 1992. Two subspecies 
of jaguar (

P. o. arizonensis

 and 

P. o. veraecrucis

) are recognized as 
occurring in the United States. Therefore both subspecies are 
encompassed by this proposed rule to revise the listed range of 


Panthera onca

. 
On April 13, 1993 (58 FR 19216-19220), the Service published a 
finding that the petition presented substantial information 
indicating that the petitioned action may be warranted and requested 
public comments and biological data on the status of the jaguar. 
Section 4(b)(3) of the Act requires the Secretary of the Interior to 
reach a final decision on any petition accepted for review within 12 
months of its receipt. This proposal constitutes the final finding 
on the petitioned action.

Summary of Factors Affecting the Species 


Section 4(a)(1) of the Endangered Species Act (16 U.S.C. 1531 


et seq

.) and regulations (50 CFR Part 424) promulgated to implement 
the listing provisions of the Act set forth the procedures for adding 
species to the Federal ``List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife 
and Plants.'' A species may be determined to be an endangered or 
threatened species due to one or more of the five factors described 
in Section 4(a)(1). These factors and their application to the 
jaguar (

Panthera onca

) are as follows: 



A. The Present or Threatened Destruction, Modification, or 
Curtailment of Its Habitat or Range 



Within the United States, jaguars have been recorded most commonly from Arizona, but there are also records from California,
New Mexico, and Texas, and reports from Louisiana. Currently there is no known resident population of 
jaguars in the United States, though they still occur in northern Mexico. 



Arizona 



Goldman (1932) believed that the jaguar was a regular, but not 
abundant, resident in southeastern Arizona. Hoffmeister (1986) 
considered the jaguar an uncommon resident species in Arizona. He 
concluded that the reports of jaguars between 1885 and 1965 indicated 
that a small but resident population once occurred in southeastern 
Arizona. Brown (1983) suggested that the jaguar in Arizona ranged 
widely throughout a variety of habitats from Sonoran desertscrub 
upward through subalpine conifer forest. Most of the records were 
from Madrean evergreen-woodland, shrub-invaded semidesert grassland, 
and along rivers. 

The most recent records of jaguars in the United States are 
from Arizona. In 1971, a jaguar was taken east of Nogales and, in 
1986, one was taken from the Dos Cabezas Mountains. The latter 
individual reportedly had been in the area for about a year before it 
was killed (Ronald M. Nowak, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, pers. 
comm., 1992). 

The Arizona Game and Fish Department (AGFD) (1988) cited two 
recent reports of jaguars in Arizona. The individuals were 
considered to be transients from Mexico. One of the reports was from 
1987 from an undisclosed location. The other report was from 1988, 
when tracks were observed for several days prior to the treeing of a 
jaguar by hounds in the Altar Valley, Pima County. An unconfirmed 
report of a jaguar at the Coronado National Monument was made in 1991 
(Ed Lopez, Coronado National Monument, pers. comm., 1992). 

Finally, there is a report of a jaguar sighted in December, 
1993, on the Buenos Aires National Wildlife Refuge in the Baboquivari 
Mountains of southern Arizona. Refuge personnel believe that the 
chances are ``very good'' that this was a reliable sighting. 



California 


Merriam (1919) summarized several accounts of jaguars, from 
various locations in California, which were obtained from documents 
published between 1814 and 1860. Strong (1926) provided evidence 
that the Cahuilla Indians of the Coachella Valley and San Jacinto and 
Santa Rosa Mountains of southern California were familiar with the 
jaguar. Nowak (1975) mentioned reports of jaguars in the Tehachapi 
Mountains from 1855, and the last known individual from California 
was killed near Palm Springs in 1860 (Strong 1926). Nowak speculated 
that the animal may have been a breeding individual. 



Louisiana 



Nowak (1973) speculated on the occurrence of jaguars east of 
Texas. Several early accounts mentioned jaguars and tigers. He 
cited Baird (1859) who believed that specimens had been taken from 
Louisiana. Nowak also discussed the killing of what was probably a 
jaguar near New River, Ascension Parish, Louisiana in 1886. Lowery 
(1974) mentioned this killing and included the jaguar in the fauna of 
Louisiana on a provisional basis. 



New Mexico 



Barber (1902) speculated that jaguars made their way into the 
Mogollon Mountains of New Mexico by ascending the Gila River. Bailey 
(1931) suggested that jaguars seemed to be native in southern New 
Mexico, but were regarded as wanderers from across the United States-Mexico border. He listed nine reports of jaguars
in New Mexico from 
1855 to 1905. Brown (1983) stated that the last record from New 
Mexico was from 1905. Nowak (1975) mentioned reports of jaguars 
along the Rio Grande from as late as 1922. Halloran (1946) reported 
that dogs ``jumped'' a jaguar in the San Andres Mountains in 1937. 
Findley 

et al

. (1975) stated that jaguars once occurred as far north 
as northern New Mexico. 


Texas

Bailey (1905) stated that the jaguar was once reported as 
common in southern and eastern Texas but had become extremely rare. 
Nowak (1975) believed that an established population once occurred in 
the dense thickets along the lower Nueces River and northeast to the 
Guadalupe River. He suggested that jaguars probably continued to 
wander from Mexico into the brush country of the southernmost part of 
the State. However, brush clearing has possibly reduced chances for 
reestablishment of the species in Texas. 



Mexico 



Leopold (1959) believed the distribution of the jaguar in 
Mexico included the tropical forests of southeastern Mexico, the 
coastal plains to the mouth of the Rio Grande on the Gulf of Mexico 
side, and the Sonoran foothills of the Sierra Madre Occidental on the 
Pacific side. The highest densities of jaguars were found along 
heavily forested flatlands and foothills of southern Sinaloa, the 
swamps of coastal Nayarit, the remaining uncut forests along the Gulf 
coast as far east as central Campeche, and the great rain forests of 
northern Chiapas. He indicated that occasional wandering individuals 
were found far from these areas; some followed tropical gorges far 
into mountains. He believed that jaguars followed big rivers on 
their northern movements; they traveled up the Brazos, Pecos, Rio 
Grande, Gila, and Colorado Rivers. He mentioned a 1955 record of a 
jaguar near the southern tip of the San Pedro Martir range, Baja 
California. Leopold asserted that this individual was 500 miles from 
regularly occupied jaguar habitat. 

Swank and Teer (1989) described the distribution of the jaguar 
in North America as a broad belt from central Mexico to Central 
America. They found that the most northerly established populations, 
as reported by Mexican officials, were in southern Sinaloa and 
southern Tamaulipas. 

Brown (1991) did not believe that the jaguar was extirpated 
from northern Mexico. Although jaguars were considered relatively 
common in Sonora in the 1930s and 1940s, he cited the most northern 
officially reported population as about 800 miles south of the United 
States-Mexico border. However, Brown suggested that there may be 
more jaguars in Sonora than are officially reported. He mentioned 
reports of two jaguars that were killed in central Sonora around 
1970. He also discussed assertions by the local Indians that both 
male and female jaguars still occurred in the Sierra Bacatete. Brown 
speculated that if a reproducing population of jaguars is still 
present in these mountains, it may be the source of individuals that 
travel northward through the Sierra Libre and Sierra Madera until 
they reach Arizona. Nowak (pers. comm., 1992) reiterated that as 
late as 1987 the species was still considered common in the Sierra 
Bacatete near Guaymas, Sonora, which is about 200 miles south of 
Arizona. 

Brown (1989) reported that biologists from Mexico have stated 
that at least two jaguars have been killed in Chihuahua. In 1987, 
Nowak (pers. comm., 1992) claimed that jaguars were still regularly 
present along the Soto la Marina River of central Tamaulipas, which 
is about 150 miles from the southern tip of Texas. He also 
hypothesized that jaguars may be entering Arizona from Mexico as a 
result of habitat destruction in Sonora. Large stretches of natural 
forest have been cleared in central Tamaulipas. In Arizona, by 
contrast, jaguar prey populations have increased, and large tracts of 
brush and canyon woodland are still available to provide cover for 
jaguars. Listing will provide protection for individuals, which may 
lead to recolonization of currently unoccupied habitat and 
reestablishment of the species in portions of its historical Arizona 
range in the United States. 

Clearing of habitat, destruction of riparian areas, and 
fragmentation or blocking of corridors may prevent jaguars from 
recolonizing previously inhabited areas. Although there is currently 
no known resident population of jaguars in the United States, 
wanderers from Mexico may cross the border and take up residency in 
available habitat. 



B. Overutilization for Commercial, Recreational, Scientific, 
or Educational Purposes 



In Arizona, the jaguar's gradual decline was concurrent with predator control associated with the settlement of
land and the development of the cattle industry (Brown 1983, Service 1990). Lange (1960) summarized the jaguar records
from Arizona known up to that time. Between 1885 and 1959, the reports 
consisted of 45 jaguars killed, 6 sighted, and 2 recorded by sign. 

Brown (1991) related that the accumulation of all known records 
indicated a minimum of 64 jaguars were killed in Arizona after 1900. 
When plotted at ten-year intervals, records of jaguars reported 
killed in Arizona and New Mexico between 1900 and 1980 demonstrated 
``a decline characteristic of an over-exploited resident population'' 
(Brown 1983). Brown (1983) argued that if the jaguars killed during 
this period originated in Mexico, the numbers of killings should not 
suggest a pattern but should rather be irregular and erratic. 

Bailey (1905) listed seven reports of jaguars killed in Texas 
between 1853 and 1903. Schmidly (1983) reported another jaguar shot 
in Mills County in 1904. Taylor (1947) mentioned a jaguar killed 
near Lyford, Willacy County, in 1912. Brown (1991) indicated jaguars 
were common in Texas until 1870. The last reports from Texas were of 
individuals killed in 1946 (San Benito, Cameron County) and 1948 
(Kleburg County). Nowak (1975) identified killing of jaguars for 
commercial sale of their furs as a factor in the extermination of a 
substantial resident population in central Texas during the late 19th 
century. 

Although the demand for jaguar pelts has diminished, it still 
exists along with the business of hunting jaguars. In 1992, AGFD 
personnel infiltrated a ring of wildlife profiteers. That operation 
resulted in the March, 1993, seizure of three jaguar specimens, one 
of which was allegedly taken from the Dos Cabezas Mountains in 
Arizona in 1986. Two of the specimens had been covertly purchased 
from the suspects. During the investigation, several ties to Mexico 
jaguar hunting were discovered. Hounds bred and trained in the 
United States were sold to Mexican nationals for the purpose of 
hunting jaguars. Also, Mexican nationals prosecuted by the Service 
in 1989 for illegally importing jaguar pelts into the United States 
were continuing the practice of providing jaguar hunts in Mexico 
(Terry B. Johnson, Arizona Game and Fish Department, 

in litt., 

1993).

C. Disease or Predation 



The Service is unaware of any known 
diseases or predators that threaten the jaguar at this time. 



D. The Inadequacy of Existing Regulatory Mechanisms



State Regulations 



Jaguars are listed as endangered by the State of Arizona. In 
general, violations of Arizona Game and Fish Laws (AGFD 1991) are 
class 2 misdemeanors. The Arizona Game and Fish Commission may, 
through civil action, seek to recover a minimum of $750 for each 
endangered species unlawfully taken, wounded or killed. Special 
permits may be issued for taking depredating wildlife. The AGFD 
offered a reward of $4,000 for information leading to a conviction 
for the reported killing of a jaguar in 1986. However, a conviction 
has yet to be obtained for that incident. 

Under the California Code of Regulations, it is prohibited to 
import, transport, or possess jaguars. In Louisiana the jaguar 
receives no official protection from the State (Fred Kimmel, 
Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries, pers. comm., 1993). 
The jaguar is not listed as an endangered species, a game animal, or 
a fur-bearing animal by the State of New Mexico; it receives no 
official protection from New Mexico (Sartor O. Williams III, New 
Mexico Department of Game and Fish, 

in litt., 

1992). 

The jaguar is listed as endangered by the State of Texas (Texas 
Parks and Wildlife Department 1987). It is unlawful to take, 
possess, transport, export, process, sell or offer for sale, or ship 
jaguars in Texas. However, some of the above actions may be allowed 
for zoological gardens, and scientific, commercial, and propagation 
purposes with the proper permits. A first violation of the 
regulations or a permit is a Texas Parks and Wildlife Code C 
misdemeanor, which carries a fine of $25 to $500 (Capt. Harold Oates, 
Texas Parks and Wildlife, pers. comm., 1994). 

In summary, although some States provide limited protection to 
the jaguar, illegal taking continues to occur. Listing the species 
under the Act would result in protective measures beyond those 
provided by the States. 



Federal Protection 



The jaguar is currently listed under the Act as an endangered 
species only in Mexico and southward to include Central and South 
America. Jaguars that may occur in, or immigrate into, the United 
States are not currently protected by the Act. The jaguar is on 
Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered 
Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). However, that listing does 
not prohibit the act of taking, possessing or transporting a jaguar 
within the United States and its territories. 

The subspecies 

Panthera onca veraecrucis, 

with historical range 
in Texas and eastern Mexico, is designated by the United States 
government as a peripheral animal of concern in a provisional list 
for the Annex of the Convention on Nature Protection and Wildlife 
Preservation in the Western Hemisphere (Nowak, pers. comm., 1992). 


Panthera onca arizonensis 

is not so designated. This Convention, as 
implemented by sections 2 and 8(A) of the Act, does not require the 
protection of species listed only on a provisional basis. Therefore, 
neither 

P. o. veraecrucis 

nor 

P. o. arizonensis 

are currently 
protected. 



E. Other Natural or Manmade Factors Affecting Its Continued 
Existence 



M-44 ejector devices with cyanide capsules used in Animal 
and Plant Health Inspection Service animal damage control programs to 
accommodate concerns of livestock owners over predator losses may be 
a threat to the jaguar (Terry B. Johnson, 

in litt

., 1993). Jaguars 
may also be victims of traps targeted for other predators such as 
bears and cougars. 

The Service has carefully assessed the best scientific and 
commercial information available regarding the past, present, and 
future threats faced by this species in determining to propose this 
rule. Based on this evaluation, the preferred action is to propose 
the jaguar (

Panthera onca

) as endangered throughout its range. The 
lack of protection under the Act for jaguars in the United States is 
due to an uncorrected technicality, rather than to any scientific 
information that jaguars do not require protection in the U.S. A 
decision to take no action would exclude the jaguar in the U.S. from 
needed protection pursuant to the Act. A decision to propose only 
threatened status would not adequately express the drastic 
distributional decline of the species and the continued jeopardy of 
any individuals in the U.S. Therefore, no action or listing as 
threatened would be contrary to the intent of the Act. Critical 
habitat is not being proposed at this time for the jaguar for reasons 
discussed in the ``Critical Habitat'' section of this proposal.

Critical Habitat 


Section 4(a)(3) of the Act, as amended, requires that, to the 
maximum extent prudent and determinable, the Secretary propose 
critical habitat at the time the species is proposed to be endangered 
or threatened. The Service finds that designation of critical 
habitat is not presently prudent or determinable for this species. 
Specific habitat used by jaguars in the United States is unknown. It 
would be possible to delineate some general areas that the species 
would be most likely to use. However, the lack of knowledge on the 
species' habitat use makes critical habitat undeterminable. 
The Service's regulations (50 CFR 424.12(a)(1)) state that 
designation of critical habitat is not prudent when one or both of 
the following situations exist: (1) The species is threatened by 
taking or other human activity, and identification of critical 
habitat can be expected to increase the degree of such threat to the 
species; or (2) such designation of critical habitat would not be 
beneficial to the species. As discussed in factor ``B'' above, the 
jaguar is highly threatened by taking. Jaguars are still in demand 
for hunts and as trophies and pelts. The last verified jaguar in 
Arizona was hunted and killed in 1986 approximately one year after it 
was known to be in the area. Publication of detailed critical 
habitat maps and descriptions in the 

Federal Register

 would likely 
make the species more vulnerable to activities prohibited under 
section 9 of the Act. In addition, since the primary threat to the 
species in the United States is direct taking rather than habitat 
destruction, designation of critical habitat would not lessen, and 
may increase, the primary threat to the jaguar. Therefore, it would 
not be prudent to propose critical habitat for the jaguar at this 
time. 


Available Conservation Measures 


Conservation measures provided to species listed as endangered 
or threatened under the Act include recognition, recovery actions, 
requirements for Federal protection, and prohibitions against certain 
practices. Recognition through listing encourages and results in 
conservation actions by Federal, State, and private agencies, groups, 
and individuals. The Act provides for possible land acquisition and 
cooperation with the States and authorizes recovery plans for all 
listed species. The protection required of Federal agencies and the 
prohibitions against taking and harm are discussed, in part, below. 
Section 7(a) of the Act, as amended, requires Federal agencies 
to evaluate their actions with respect to any species that is 
proposed or listed as endangered or threatened and with respect to 
its critical habitat, if any is being designated. Regulations 
implementing this interagency cooperation provision of the Act are 
codified at 50 CFR Part 402. Section 7(a)(4) requires Federal 
agencies to confer informally with the Service on any action that is 
likely to jeopardize the continued existence of a proposed species or 
result in destruction or adverse modification of proposed critical 
habitat. If a species is listed subsequently, Section 7(a)(2) 
requires Federal agencies to ensure that activities they authorize, 
fund or carry out are not likely to jeopardize the continued 
existence of such a species or to destroy or adversely modify its 
critical habitat. If a Federal action may affect a listed species or 
its critical habitat, the responsible Federal agency must enter into 
formal consultation with the Service. Federal actions that may 
affect the jaguar include clearing of habitat, destruction of 
riparian areas, fragmentation or blocking of corridors that jaguars 
may use to cross from Mexico to the United States, and any trapping 
or animal control activities designed to target the jaguar or other 
large predators. 
The Act and its implementing regulations found at 50 CFR 17.21 
set forth a series of general prohibitions and exceptions that apply 
to all endangered wildlife. These prohibitions, in part, make it 
illegal for any person subject to the jurisdiction of the United 
States to take (includes harass, harm, pursue, hunt, shoot, wound, 
kill, trap, or collect, or to attempt any of these), import or 
export, ship in interstate commerce in the course of commercial 
activity, or sell or offer for sale in interstate or foreign commerce 
any listed species. It also is illegal to possess, sell, deliver, 
carry, transport, or ship any such wildlife that has been taken 
illegally. Certain exceptions apply to agents of the Service and 
State conservation agencies. 
Permits may be issued to carry out otherwise prohibited 
activities involving endangered wildlife species under certain 
circumstances. Regulations governing permits are at 50 CFR 17.22 and 
17.23. Such permits are available for scientific purposes, to 
enhance the propagation or survival of the species, and/or for 
incidental take in connection with otherwise lawful activities. In 
some instances, permits may be issued for a specified time to relieve 
undue economic hardship that would be suffered if such relief were 
not available. Permits may be sought since there are some zoos that 
have jaguars on display. 
On July 1, 1975, the jaguar was included in Appendix I of the 
Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna 
and Flora (CITES). The effect of this listing is that both export 
and import permits are generally required before international 
shipment may occur. Such shipment is strictly regulated by CITES 
party nations to prevent effects that may be detrimental to the 
species' survival. Generally, import or export cannot be allowed if 
it is for primarily commercial purposes. Requests for copies of the 
regulations on protected wildlife and inquiries regarding them may be 
addressed to the Office of Management Authority, U.S. Fish and 
Wildlife Service, 4401 North Fairfax Drive, room 420C, Arlington, 
Virginia 22203-3507 (703/358-2104). 


Public Comments Solicited 


The Service intends that any final action resulting from this 
proposal will be as accurate and as effective as possible. 
Therefore, comments or suggestions from the public, other concerned 
governmental agencies, the scientific community, industry, or any 
other interested party concerning this proposed rule are hereby 
solicited. Comments particularly are sought concerning: 
(1) Biological, commercial trade, or other relevant data 
concerning any threat (or lack thereof) to this species;

(2) The location of any additional populations of this species 
and the reasons why any habitat should or should not be determined to 
be critical habitat as provided by Section 4 of the Act; 
(3) Additional information concerning the range, distribution, 
and population size of this species; and 
(4) Current or planned activities in the subject area and 
their possible impacts on this species. 
Final promulgation of the regulation on this species will take 
into consideration the comments and any additional information 
received by the Service, and such communications may lead to a final 
regulation that differs from this proposal. 
The Endangered Species Act provides for a public hearing on 
this proposal, if requested. Requests must be received within 
45 days of the date of publication of the proposal. Such requests 
must be made in writing and addressed to the Arizona State Supervisor 
(See 

ADDRESSES

 section). 


National Environmental Policy Act 


The Fish and Wildlife Service has determined that an 
Environmental Assessment, as defined under the authority of the 
National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, need not be prepared in 
connection with regulations adopted pursuant to Section 4(a) of the 
Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended. A notice outlining the 
Service's reasons for this determination was published in the 

Federal 
Register

SUMMARY:

 This proposed rule would add a new subpart F to the Department's regulations at 24 CFR part 941, which govern public
housing development by public housing agencies. The new subpart F would set forth the requirements and procedures
applicable to the major reconstruction of obsolete public housing (MROP) projects. This proposed rule also would
implement the provisions of section 111 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 which pertain to MROP
projects. The specific provisions that would comprise subpart F are discussed in the Supplementary Information
section of this document.

<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

I. Paperwork Reduction Act Statement 



The information collection requirements contained in part 941 have been previously approved by the Office of Management
and Budget under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, and assigned the stated OMB approval numbers: 






II. Background 



Sections 4 and 5 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437b, 1437c and 1437g) (the Act) authorize the Department
to provide technical and financial assistance to public housing agencies (PHAs) for the development of low income
housing projects, including the major reconstruction of obsolete public housing projects. The Department's regulations
at 24 CFR part 941 establish: the requirements and procedures for the development of low-income housing (excluding
Indian housing) by PHAs; development methods to be utilized for public housing projects; PHA eligibility requirements;
the application and proposal procedures and other program requirements, which include a number of Federal statutory
and administrative requirements applicable to public housing development. 

The Department will in the future publish under a separate proposed rule comprehensive changes to part 941 that reflect
the Department's redesign of the public housing development program. 

This proposed rule is more limited and would only add a new subpart F to the existing part 941 to address the requirements
and procedures applicable to the major reconstruction of obsolete public housing (MROP) projects. Section 111(a)
of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 (Pub. L. 102-550, approved October 28, 1992) (the 1992 Act)
amends section 5(j)(2) of the Act regarding MROP projects. Section 5(j)(2), among other things, provides a definition
for ``obsolete public housing project or building''; specifies that funding for MROP will be distributed on the basis
of competition; and lists the criteria by which PHAs will be awarded funds. In accordance with sections 111(c) and
191 of the 1992 Act, which provide for rulemaking to implement section 111, this proposed rule would implement the
provisions of section 111(a). The regulatory sections that would comprise subpart F are as follows: 

Section 941.601. This section would provide that subpart F sets forth the basic policies and general requirements
applicable to MROP projects. With respect to applicability, this section would provide that, unless otherwise stated,
subpart F would apply to all MROP projects funded in Federal Fiscal Year 1995 and thereafter. 

Section 941.602. This section would address MROP funding by providing that any notice of funding availability (NOFA)
issued under 24 CFR part 941, subpart F, will reflect the current statutory requirements applicable to MROP projects.


Section 941.603. This section would describe the criteria a project must meet to be eligible for MROP funding. Some
of the eligibility requirements, listed in this section, include the following: the project must be a rental project,
and not a homeownership project; the project must have been financed under section 5 of the Act and be under an Annual
Contributions Contract (ACC), or be a section 23 bond financed leased housing project which meets certain conditions;
the existing project must have had an approved actual development cost certificate (ADCC) for five years before the
application submission deadline; and the project must be determined to be obsolete. With respect to the determination
of obsolete, the requirements of section 5(j)(2) of the Act, as added by section 111 of the 1992 Act are being incorporated.


In accordance with section 5(j)(2)(E) of the Act,  941.603 would prohibit MROP assistance to any project or
building assisted within five years of the MROP application by Comprehensive Improvement Assistance Program (CIAP)
or Comprehensive Grant Program (CGP) modernization funds under section 14 of the Act (through inclusion in an approved
``annual statement of work''). A proposed MROP which received emergency modernization funding within the time frame
is excluded from the five-year prohibition stated above. 

Section 941.604. This section would address the limitations imposed on the use of MROP funds. 

Section 941.605. This section would describe the general requirements applicable to the MROP program; these include
(1) those set forth in subpart A of part 941, with the exception that MROP projects may only be developed by: (a) sealed
bid method with award to the lowest responsible bidder; or 
(b) competitive proposal method whereby the PHA would execute a fixed price contract in which the contractor would
be responsible for design of specific work items in the Request for Proposals, soliciting and contracting for construction
work, contract administration and construction administration and construction inspection; the contract would
either provide progress payments, or a lump sum payment after successful completion of all work; and (2) the requirements
set forth in subpart B, with certain exceptions. With respect to the new MROP cost limit system required by section
5(j)(2)(D) of the Act, a methodology is proposed in this section. 

Section 941.606. This section would describe the application submission requirements of the MROP program. 

Section 941.607. This section would address the MROP proposal and would provide that MROP proposals must comply with
the provisions of  941.404.

Section 941.608. This section would address MROP project development and would provide for compliance with the procedures
and requirements of subpart E, except as modified by  941.608. 

In the regulatory text that follows the preamble section ``Other Matters,'' the reader should note that the terms
``Act'' and ``ACC'' are not defined in subpart F, because these terms are defined in subpart A of part 941. The ``Act''
refers, as previously noted, to the United States Housing Act of 1937, and ``ACC'' refers to Annual Contributions
Contract. 



Other Matters 



Environmental Impact 



A Finding of No Significant Impact with respect to the environment has been made in accordance with HUD regulations
at 24 CFR part 50, which implement section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969. The Finding
is available for public inspection between 7:30 a.m. and 5:30 p.m. weekdays in the Office of the Rules Docket Clerk
at the above address. 



Impact on Small Entities 



The Secretary, in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), has reviewed this proposed rule
before publication, and, by approving it, certifies that this proposed rule will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities. The rule's major effect is on public housing agencies (PHAs) which
are state and local governmental entities. The proposed rule adds a new subpart for the major reconstruction of obsolete
public housing projects, as required by the Act, and incorporates provisions requested by industry groups; as such,
it is anticipated that it will be considered beneficial to PHAs. 



Federalism Impact 



The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under section 6(a) of Executive Order No. 12612, 

Federalism,

 has determined that this proposed rule would not have a substantial, direct effect on the States or their political
subdivisions or on the relationship between the Federal government and the States, or on the distribution of power
or responsibilities among the various levels of government. No significant change in the relationships or responsibilities
of the various levels of government will result from this proposed rule. 



Impact on the Family 



The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under Executive Order 12606, 

The Family,

 has determined that this proposed rule would not have a potential for significant impact on family formation, maintenance,
and general well-being and thus is not subject to review under the Order. No significant change in existing HUD policies
or programs will result from promulgation of this rule, as those policies and programs relate to family concerns.




Regulatory Agenda 



This proposed rule was listed as sequence number 1684 in the Department's Semiannual Agenda of Regulations published
on April 25, 1994 (59 FR 20424, 20469) under Executive Order 12866 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act. 



Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance Programs 



The Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance Program title and number is 14.850, Public and Indian Housing. 



List of Subjects in 24 CFR Part 941 



Grant programs_housing and community development, Loan programs_housing and community development, Public housing.

 


Accordingly, 24 CFR part 941 would be amended as follows: 



PART 941_PUBLIC HOUSING DEVELOPMENT 





1. The authority citation for part 941 would continue to read as follows: 







Authority:

 42 U.S.C. 1437b, 1437c, and 1437g; 42 U.S.C. 3535(d). 






2. A new subpart F, consisting of   941.601-941.608, would be added to read as follows:

Scope and applicability. 



(a) 

Scope.

 This subpart F sets forth the basic policies and general requirements for the public housing Major Reconstruction
of Obsolete Public Housing (MROP) projects program originally instituted pursuant to the FY 1986 HUD-Independent
Agencies Appropriations Act, and thereafter covered by section 5(j), as amended by section 111 of the Housing and

 941.602 

MROP funding. 




While section 5(j)(2) of the Act limits MROP funding to no more than 20 percent of available funding, recent Appropriation
Acts have provided that HUD may approve applications for development and/or MROP based on applications submitted,
or pursuant to a statutory funding set-aside. As a result, any notice of funding availability (NOFA) issued pursuant
to 24 CFR part 941 will reflect the applicable statutory requirements. 




 941.603 

MROP eligibility criteria. 




To be eligible for MROP funding, a project must meet the following criteria: 


(a) 

Rental.

 The project must be rental and not homeownership. 


(b) 

Federally assisted PHA-owned.

 The project must have been financed under section 5 of the Act and under ACC; or be a section 23 bond financed leased housing
project which was converted to public housing by ACC amendment and is now covered by a cooperation agreement, has clear
title vested in the PHA, and there are no legal obstacles affecting the PHA's use of the project during the required
additional 40-year term of the ACC. 


(c) 

Five-year ADCC.

 The existing project must have had an approved actual development cost certificate (ADCC) for five years or more prior
to the application submission deadline of the NOFA. 


(d) 

Obsolete project.

 The existing project must be determined to be obsolete; i.e., the project, or that portion designated to comprise
the MROP project, must have design or marketability problems that have resulted in: 


(1) Current vacancies of more than 25 percent of the units available for occupancy; or 


(2)(i) Estimated costs for redesign, reconstruction
