<DOCTITLE>Changes in Hydric Soils of the United States</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Soil Conservation Service, USDA.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of change.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

Pursuant to 7 CFR 12.31(a)(3)(i), the Soil Conservation Service, United States Department of Agriculture gives
notice of a change in the Hydric Soils of the United States as listed in the third edition of the Hydric Soils of the United
States, Miscellaneous Publication 1491, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Soil Conservation Service, June 1991.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The third edition of the Hydric Soils of the United States was published June 1991, and a notice of change published
in the 

Federal Register

, October 11, 1991, Vol. 56, No. 198, page 51371. Changes to this document were made in 1993 and published in the 

Federal Register

, October 6, 1993, Vol. 58, No. 192, page 52078. The changes published herein reflect soils added and deleted since
the 1991 publication.



The national list of hydric soils changes as additional soil series are recognized and defined and/or properties
of existing soil series are updated based on additional data. These changes reflect refinements in knowledge of the
soils of the United States. New soil series are recognized as soils are mapped in previously unmapped areas. These
new series have always met hydric soil criteria, whether recognized as series or not, and thus represent an insignificant
change in acreage of hydric soils. Soils that are removed from the list are mostly dry phases of existing hydric soils.
These dry phases would not have met wetland hydrology criteria, thus represent an insignificant change in acreage
of wetlands.

The list of hydric soils is computer generated using the hydric soil criteria and a database of properties of each soil
series in the United States. The database is also used to generate interpretations of how soils perform for many land
uses. Therefore, some changes in the list of hydric soils result from adding phases for a hydric soil to refine another
interpretation. This split or addition of a hydric phase causes an increase in the number of hydric soils, but does
not affect the acres of the hydric soil. Data for all soil series are in the Soil Interpretations Record and may be reviewed
by contacting a local office of the Soil Conservation Service in the appropriate State.

The National Technical Committee also modified the definition of hydric soils as given in Miscellaneous Publication
1491 to ``A hydric soil is a soil that formed under conditions of saturation, flooding, or ponding long enough during
the growing season to develop anaerobic conditions in the upper part.'' The change in the definition does not affect
the National List of Hydric Soils. The change aligns the definition more closely with 

Soil Taxonomy

 and clarifies that artificially drained phases are hydric soils if the soil in its undisturbed state meets the criteria.

Briefing Paper
National List of Hydric Soils


Prepared by: Maurice J. Mausbach, May 1993



Background


_The National List of Hydric Soils is:
*published by the Soil Conservation Service.
*revised annually and notice is filed in 

Federal Register

.
*generated from Soil Interpretations Records in the National Soil Database.

_The National Technical Committee for Hydric Soils reviews and concurs with changes to the National List of Hydric
Soils.

_The Soil Interpretations Records for soil series are:
*continuously updated as data is collected on soil properties.
*reviewed by the soil survey quality assurance staff at the National Soil Survey Center.
*used in all aspects of the Soil Survey Program 

of which hydric soils are a small part.



Reasons for Changes in the Hydric Soil List


_Addition of new soil series due to:
*newly mapped areas (soils have always been hydric but have not previously been recognized as soil series).
*narrowing of an existing series into two soils. An example being a series that is both hydric and nonhydric being split
into their respective parts.

_Result from new phases being added to an existing soil series. Phases are added for many reasons and include:
*flooding and ponding phases of which some may be hydric and others nonhydric. Many of these changes are made to accommodate
nonhydric interpretations of soil use.
*surface texture or depth phases both of which are not related to change in hydric soil status but are needed for other
interpretations.
*wetness or water table phases of which some may be hydric and others nonhydric. Some of these changes are made to accommodate
other interpretations of soil use.

_Result from change in flooding, ponding, water table, or drainage class as a result of new information. Soils are
added and deleted from the list due to these changes.



Summary of Changes to 1991 National List



_116 entries (soils) added of which
*36 are phases of existing hydric soils. These are new phase names for existing hydric soils.
*61 are new soil series established from new soil mapping. These areas of hydric soils which are given new names are
previously unmapped and thus have no

 affect on acres of hydric soils or acres of wetlands.
*8 series that was split_one part being hydric and the other part nonhydric. The whole series has been considered hydric,
but the nonhydric portion would not have met hydrology criteria. Because only part of the original series met wetland
hydrology criteria, this change has little affect on acres of wetlands.
*1 soil series was changed from nonhydric to hydric because of new information on water table.

_14 entries (soils) were deleted of which
*4 result from new technical data. These have been borderline hydric soils and would not have met wetland hydrology
criteria. The change slightly reduces the acres of hydric soils.
*5 records were dropped because of non use.
*5 series was split and made nonhydric. Other phases were added for the hydric part of the soil.

 The Department of Energy has determined 
in accordance with 10 CFR 600.14(f) that the application submitted by the Materials Technologies of Virginia, Inc.,
is meritorious based on the general evaluation required by 10 CFR 600.14(d) and that the proposed project represents
a unique device for conserving energy by greatly reducing energy costs during fabrication, and by making superior
materials available for use in more efficient devices such as the heat exchangers for construction under this project
which will be submitted as prototypes for third party testing. The use of this device has a strong possibility for future
reductions in the Nation's energy consumption. The proposed project is not eligible for financial assistance under
a recent, current or planned solicitation because the program, the Energy-Related Invention Program (ERIP), has
been structured since its beginning in 1975 to operate without competitive solicitations 
because the authorizing legislation directs ERIP to provide support for worthy ideas submitted by the public. The
program has never issued and has no plans to issue a competitive solicitation.

Notice of Noncompetitive Financial Assistance Grant Award to the University of Arizona.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Department of Energy (DOE) announces that pursuant to 10 CFR 600.7(b)(2)(i) under criteria (a), that it intends
to award a noncompetitive financial assistance (Grant) to the University of Arizona. This award is for continuation
of their research effort entitled ``Regeneration of FGD Waste Liquors: Production of Ammonium and Postassium Sulfate
Mixed Fertilizer''.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 





Grant Number: DE-FG22-93PC92582



Title of Research Effort



``Regeneration of FGD Waste Liquors: Production of Ammonium and Potassium Sulfate Mixed Fertilizer.''

Awardee: University of Arizona.

Term of Assistance Effort: Twelve (12) months.

Grant Estimated Total Value: $73,899.

Objective: Based upon the authority of 10 CFR 600.7(b)(2), the objective of this grant is for Arizona University to
continue research in the regeneration process for treating the waste scrubbing liquor produced by a thiosorbic lime
SO pilot tests and to produce an ammonia and potassium sulfate mixed fertilizer product. This process involves the
precipitation of the N-S compounds followed by their hydrolysis. The magnesium wet scrubbing process is presently
being developed for the simultaneous removal of SO-2 and NO

x

 from the flue gas produced by a coal-fired power plant. In the course of scrubbing, nitrogen-sulfur (N-S) compounds
accumulate and degrade the scrubbing liquor. The primary objective of this project is to develop a regeneration process
through which the N-S compounds in the scrubbing liquors are removed and then converted to a marketable byproduct.
The proposed work is considered to be relevant to the DOE mission in that the program will provide a mechanism for communication,
interaction and research between DOE and Arizona University in the continuous process for the regeneration of waste
scrubber liquors from the combined SO

x

-NO

x

 scrubbing systems. The development of this technology would assist utilities in complying with the 1990 Clean Air
Act, while still encouraging and enhancing the use of coal, which is a major goal of the DOE Flue Gas Cleanup program.

University of Massachusetts, Lowell; Notice of Availability of Environmental Assessment 
 


July 7, 1994. 
 


In accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's
(Commission's) regulations, 18 CFR part 380 (Order 486, 52 F.R. 47897), the Commission's Office of Hydropower Licensing
has reviewed an application for surrender of license for the Lowell Atlantic Hydroelectric Project, No. 5946-007.
The Lowell Atlantic Hydroelectric Project is located on the Lowell Canal System, off the Merrimack River in Middlesex
County, Massachusetts. An Environmental Assessment (EA) was prepared for the application. The EA finds that approving
the application for surrender of license would not constitute a major federal action significantly affecting the
quality of the human environment. 
 
Copies of the EA are available for review in the Public Reference Branch, Room 3104, of the Commission's offices at
941 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426.

<DOCTITLE>El Paso Natural Gas Company, et al.; Natural Gas Certificate Filings </DOCTITLE>



July 6, 1994. 



Take notice that the following filings have been made with the Commission: 



1. El Paso Natural Gas Company 



Docket No. CP94-625-000 



Take notice that on June 23, 1994, El Paso Natural Gas Company (El Paso), P.O. Box 1492, El Paso, Texas 79978, filed a
request with the Commission in Docket No. CP94-625-000 pursuant to Sections 157.205 and 157.212 of the
Commission's Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (NGA) for authorization to construct and operate a delivery point
to provide firm transportation and delivery of natural gas to Southwest Gas Corporation (Southwest) 
under El Paso's blanket certificate issued in Docket Nos. CP82-435-000 and CP88-433-000
pursuant to Section 7 of the NGA, all as more fully set forth in the request which is open to the public for inspection.


El Paso proposes to construct and operate a delivery point on the 20
'
' O.D. Maricopa County Line of its North System Mainline to provide firm transportation of natural gas to Southwest.
El Paso states that Southwest would then deliver the gas to the residential and commercial customers located in the
Garden Lakes area of Maricopa County, Arizona. El Paso estimates the cost of the proposed delivery point would be $93,400
and states that Southwest has agreed to reimburse El Paso for the expenses. 

El Paso reports that it has sufficient capacity to accomplish the proposed deliveries without detriment to its other
existing customers. 



Comment date:

 August 22, 1994, in accordance with Standard Paragraph G at the end of this notice. 



2. Newfield Exploration Company 



Docket No. CP94-636-000 



Take notice that on June 30, 1994, Newfield Exploration Company (Newfield), 363 N. Sam Houston Pkwy E., Suite 2020,
Houston, Texas 77060, filed a petition for declaratory order in Docket No. CP94-636-000 requesting that
the Commission declare that, following Newfield's purchase of certain offshore facilities from Texas Eastern Transmission
Corporation (Texas Eastern), that those facilities are gathering facilities exempt from the Commission's Regulations
pursuant to Section 1(b) of the Natural Gas Act (NGA), all as more fully set forth in the petition which is on file with
the Commission and open to public inspection. 

Newfield states that the facilities consist of one currently-certificated supply line owned by Texas Eastern along
with an associated metering facility. It is indicated that the supply line consists of a 4.8 mile, 8-inch lateral that
connects Newfield's oil and gas production platform in the Eugene Island Block 182-A area to the facilities
of Sea Robin Pipeline Company (Sea Robin) in Eugene Island Block 197 in offshore Louisiana. It is indicated that on
June 16, 1993, Texas Eastern ceased purchasing the Newfield production gathered by the facilities to be purchased,
but did continue transporting Newfield's production through the facilities for redelivery to the transmission
facilities of Sea Robin. 

Newfield asserts that the primary function of the facilities to be acquired is gathering as set forth in 

Farmland Industries, Inc.,

 23 FERC   61,023 (1983), as later modified by 

Amerada Hess Corp.,

 

et al

, 52 FERC   61,268 (1990), (

Amerada Hess

). It is indicated that under that test the Commission applies six criteria to determine the jurisdictional status
of a facility: (1) the diameter and length of a facility; (2) the extension of facilities beyond a central point in the
field; (3) the geographic configuration of the system; (4) the location of compressors and processing plants; (5)
the location of wells along all or part of the facility; and (6) the operating pressure of the line. In 

Amerada Hess,

 the Commission indicated that it would consider other factors, in addition to the 

Farmland

 criteria, especially for offshore facilities, including the changing technical and geographic nature of exploration
and production, the purpose, location and operation of the facility, the general business activity of the facility,
and whether the jurisdictional determination is consistent with the objectives of the Natural Gas Act and the Natural
Gas Policy Act of 1978. 

Newfield asserts that there can be doubt that the primary function of the facilities is gathering. It is stated that
the facilities connect directly to producing wells and were constructed to gather gas produced from those wells for
delivery into transmission facilities currently owned by Sea Robin. Newfield also states that the facilities are
short in length and small in diameter, do not extend beyond the production area, and are located upstream of processing
or dehydration facilities and therefore are gathering facilities. Newfield also points out that an application
of the non-physical factors set out in 

Amerada Hess

 demonstrates that the facilities should be classified as gathering facilities. It is stated that the sole purpose
of the facilities is to gather gas produced by Newfield as the sole working interest owner in the wells for delivery
to transmission facilities owned by Sea Robin. Newfield also states that its general business activity is the exploration
and production of natural gas. 

Newfield requests that the petition be considered contemporaneously with Texas Eastern's application in Docket
No. CP94-567-000 to abandon the facilities to be sold to Newfield.

Charleston, West Virginia 25314-1599, filed in Docket No. CP94-640-000, an abbreviated application
pursuant to Sections 7(b) and (c) of the Natural Gas Act for a certificate of public convenience and necessity authorizing

Specifically, Columbia Gulf proposes to construct and operate approximately 1.2 miles of 30-inch pipeline crossing
the Mississippi River replacing approximately 1.2 miles of duel 24-inch crossing which ruptured in 1993 in East Carroll
Parish, Louisiana. Columbia Gulf states that this river crossing is part of Columbia Gulf's Mainline 200 30-inch
pipeline. Columbia Gulf further states that the Mainline 200 operates as part of a looped system in conjunction with
Columbia Gulf's Mainline 100 30-inch and Mainline 300 36-inch extending from southern Louisiana to northeastern
Kentucky. Columbia Gulf states that the proposed crossing, when operated as part of Columbia Gulf's looped pipeline
system, will have equivalent designed delivery capacity to that of the facilities being replaced. 

Columbia Gulf states that the estimated cost of the proposed construction is $5,747,000. Columbia Gulf states that
it will finance the construction with funds generated from internal sources. 

Columbia Gulf requests that this application be processed pursuant to section 385.802 of the Commission's Rules
of Practice and Procedure and hereby waives oral hearing and the opportunity for filing exceptions to the decision
of the Commission and requests the Commission to omit the intermediate decision procedure. 



Comment date:

 July 27, 1994, in accordance with Standard Paragraph F at the end of this notice. 



4. Columbia Gas Transmission Corporation



Docket No. CP94-641-000 



Take notice that on July 1, 1994, Columbia Gas Transmission Corporation (Columbia), 1700 MacCorkle Avenue, SE.,
Charleston, West Virginia 25314, filed in Docket No. CP94-641-000 an application pursuant to Sections
7(c) and 7(b) of the Natural Gas Act for authorization to construct and operate certain replacement natural gas facilities
and for authorization to abandon the facilities being replaced, all as more fully set forth in the application on file
with the Commission and open to public inspection. 

Columbia proposes to construct and operate approximately 4.9 miles of 12-inch transmission pipeline replacing
approximately 4.9 miles of deteriorating and obsolete 12-inch pipeline (Line A-5) in seven sections in Broome
and Tioga Counties, New York. 

Columbia states that it is not requesting authorization for any new or additional service. Columbia also states that
the sections of pipeline to be constructed will have equivalent designed delivery capacity and that the facilities
being replaced have become obsolete and/or physically deteriorated to the extent that the replacement is deemed
advisable. The estimated cost of the proposed construction is $5,061,000 and the estimated net debit to retirement
associated with the abandonment is $655,000. 



Comment date:

<DOCTITLE>Mississippi Valley Gas Co.; Notice of Petition for Rate Approval </DOCTITLE>



July 7, 1994. 



Take notice that on June 13, 1994, Mississippi Valley Gas Company (Mississippi Valley) filed pursuant to section
284.123(b)(2) of the Commission's regulations, a petition for rate approval requesting that the Commission approve
as fair and equitable a maximum rate of $0.2907 per MMBtu for transportation of natural gas on Mississippi Valley's
system under section 311(a)(2) of the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 (NGPA). Mississippi Valley's entire company
service area is within the State of Mississippi. 

Mississippi Valley states that it does not choose to make an election under Section 284.123(b)(1) and instead applies
for Commission approval of the $0.2907 general system rate proposed herein. Mississippi Valley's current maximum
interruptible transportation rate is also $0.2907 per MMBtu and was approved by letter order dated December 26, 1991
in Docket No. PR91-21-000 for a three-year period ending June 16, 1994. For competitive reasons, Mississippi
Valley seeks to justify continuation of the current rate even though a higher $.506 rate is supported by this filing.


Pursuant to section 284.123(b)(2)(ii), if the Commission does not act within 150 days of the filing date, the rate
will be deemed to be fair and equitable and not in excess of an amount which interstate pipelines would be permitted
to charge for similar transportation service. The Commission may, prior to the expiration of the 150-day period,
extend the time for action or institute a proceeding to afford parties an opportunity for written comments and for
the oral presentation of views, data, and arguments. 

Any person desiring to participate in this rate proceeding must file a motion to intervene in accordance with sections

of the Commission on or before July 22, 1994. The petition for rate approval is on file with the Commission and is available

New York 14203, and Laurel Fields Storage Company (Laurel Fields), a partnership to be formed by National or its affiliate
and other equity participants following the receipt of Securities and Exchange Commission approval, filed in Docket
No. CP94-631-000, a joint application, pursuant to Sections 7(b) and 7(c) of the Natural Gas Act and Subpart
A of Part 157 and Subpart G of Part 284 of the Commission's Regulations, for a certificate of public convenience and
necessity, blanket certificates, and abandonment authorization.
Specifically, Laurel Fields seeks a certificate of public convenience and necessity authorizing: (1) Conversion
of the Callen Run production field, located in Jefferson County, Pennsylvania, to an interstate natural gas storage
field; (2) the acquisition of the Limestone Storage Field (formally the Allegheny State Park storage field) located
in Cattaraugas County, New York, from National; (3) the construction and operation of the necessary facilities to
develop the Callen Run Storage Field and to expand the capacity of the Limestone Storage Field; (4) participation
in a no-fee exchange with National solely for the purpose of maintaining gas service to four retail customers who now
receive gas off production lines in the Callen Run field that will be replaced by new storage pipelines; and (5) the
abandonment of existing pipelines and a compressor facility that will be replaced with new facilities at the Limestone
Storage Field.
Laurel Fields also seeks blanket certificates under Subpart F, Part 157 and Subpart G, Part 284 of the Commission's
Regulations.
Laurel Fields has proposed to develop the Callen Run field into an underground natural gas storage field with 12.1
Bcf of working gas capacity and states that the injection of an estimated 10.3 Bcf of base gas will be required, and that
the field will yield an estimated 130 MMcf per day of peak withdrawal deliverability. The total cost of the Callen Run
facilities is estimated to be $76,043,000. It also has proposed to further develop the Limestone Storage Field and
expand its working gas capacity to 7 Bcf, which will require the injection of an estimated 3.5 Bcf of additional base
gas, and will yield a total peak withdrawal deliverability of 77 MMcf per day. The estimated cost of facilities for
the Limestone Storage Field is $48,687,000. Thus, the entire Laurel Fields Storage Project will have a working gas
storage capacity of 19.1 Bcf with a peak withdrawal rate of approximately 207 MMcf per day with a total estimated cost
of $124,730,000.
Laurel Fields intend to offer firm and interruptible storage services on an open access, non-discriminatory basis
in compliance with the Commission's blanket certificate regulations at Section 284.221. Laurel Fields proposes
two firm storage services, Rate Schedules SS-110 and SS-60, and one interruptible storage service, Rate
Schedule SSI. The rates proposed to be charged are cost-based in nature. Laurel Fields has filed a 

pro forma 

tariff consisting of the aforementioned rate schedules, General Terms and Conditions, and forms of service agreements.
National seeks permission and approval to (1) abandon its interests in the Limestone Storage Field, by assignment
to Laurel Fields; (2) abandon four delivery points and to relocate one delivery point off production pipelines located
in the Callen Run Storage Field that will be abandoned during the development of the field; and (3) to participate in
the no-fee exchange with Laurel Fields; as previously described.
In addition, National and Laurel Fields seek any authorizations required from the Commission to effectuate a lease
of the storage capacity (including injection and withdrawal deliverability) in the Limestone Storage Field from
Laurel Fields to National during the construction phase of the project, which is proposed to commence during the Spring
of 1996. It is also stated that National will require the capacity in the Limestone Storage Field until April 15, 1996,
in order to meet existing contractual service obligations.
The applicants will be conducting an open season beginning August 1, 1994 and ending September 1, 1994, during which
it will accept nominations for firm storage service. The application includes one (1) precedent agreement for 2.5
MMDth of long-term storage service with National Fuel Gas Distribution Corporation.
Any person desiring to be heard or to make any protest with reference to said application should on or before July 28,
1994, file with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20426, a motion to intervene or a protest
in accordance with the requirements of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.211 and 385.214)
and the Regulations under the NGA (18 CFR 157.10). All protests filed with the Commission will be considered by it in
determining the appropriate action to be taken but will not serve to make the protestants parties to the proceeding.
Any person wishing to become a party to a proceeding or to participate as a party in any hearing therein must file a motion
to intervene in accordance with the Commission's Rules.
Take further notice that, pursuant to the authority contained in and subject to jurisdiction conferred upon the Commission
by Sections 7 and 15 of the NGA and the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure, a hearing will be held without further
notice before the Commission or its designee on this application if no motion to intervene is filed within the time
required herein, if the Commission on its own review of the matter finds that a grant of the certificate is required
by the public convenience and necessity. If a motion for leave to intervene is timely filed, or if the Commission on
its motion believes that a formal hearing is required, further notice of such hearing will be duly given.
Under the procedure herein provided for, unless otherwise advised, it will be unnecessary for National and Laurel
Fields to appear or be represented at the hearing.

Background



Projects 



Power from 8 of the 9 projects in the Cumberland Basin Projects (Wolf Creek, Center Hill, Dale Hollow, Old Hickory,
Cheatham, Barkley, J. Percy Priest, Cordell Hull and Laurel) is sold through the transmission system of the Tennessee
Valley Authority (TVA). TVA has contracted to purchase 405,000 KW to preference customers outside the service area
and to firm up the 70,000 KW from the Laurel Project. The Laurel Project is located in the service area of and delivered
to East Kentucky Power Cooperative. Cumberland Basin power not sold to East Kentucky Power for the use of its preference
customers is sold to eight municipalities in the Mississippi Power and Light area via a contract with the Municipal
Energy Agency of Mississippi; seven cooperatives in the Mississippi Power and Light area via a contract with South
Mississippi Electric Power Association; Big Rivers Electric Corporation; the City of Henderson Kentucky; East
Kentucky power Cooperative; Southern Illinois Power Cooperative; and one municipality and two cooperatives in
the western portion of the Carolina Power and Light Company (CP&L) service area via transmission over TVA's and
CP&L's transmission system. Currently 62 MW of the power to be marketed outside the TVA area is temporarily being
marketed to TVA for the use of its preference customers pending completion of arrangements to market the power to preference
customers in the Kentucky Utilities Company area. 
The projects were developed by the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers for the comprehensive development of the Cumberland
River Basin. Project purposes include hydroelectric power, navigation, flood control, recreation, pollution
abatement, and economic development. Collectively the projects provide 5.1 million acre feet of flood control storage
and 380 miles of navigation channel. Each of the 9 projects have specific recreation facilities which attract millions
of visitors annually. Total installed capacity of the projects is 914 MW which generate an average of 3,271,000 MWH
annually. 
The power generated at the projects in operation during fiscal year 1993 was sold to 293 customers. Southeastern cannot
furnish the entire capacity and energy needs of any of its customers. Capacity and energy requirements in excess of
that available from Southeastern's resources must be acquired from other sources. 



Transmission 



Under the Notice of Issuance Final Power Marketing Policy, Cumberland System of Projects 58 FR 41762; August 5, 1993,
475 MW of capacity is made available to SEPA's customers outside the TVA region from the Cumberland Projects. Under
TVA's firm commitment of transmission service provided for in the marketing agreement, TVA makes the amounts SEPA
schedules (as much of the 475 MW as Southeastern indicates) available across the TVA system to the points selected
by Southeastern on the periphery of the system. Under the Power Marketing policy, 405 MW is allocated to TVA for the
benefit of 160 preference customers located on the TVA system. According to the marketing policy, TVA is to receive
a monthly credit for delivering Cumberland system capacity and energy to SEPA's preference customers outside the
TVA region. The credit is applied each month against charges to TVA for Cumberland River system capacity and energy
provided TVA under the marketing agreement. Since 1984 this monthly credit has been $500,000 for 475 MW to be delivered
to the periphery of the TVA system. This monthly credit is reduced for each MW of capacity that Southeastern is unable
to sell to its customers outside the TVA area. Therefore, TVA's monthly credit has been reduced in the past by $80,600
for the 62 MW of capacity that SEPA has been unable to sell due to Kentucky Utilities Company's refusal to wheel such
power to preference customers located in its area. TVA has received an annual credit of approximately $5,032,800
which will increase to $6,032,800 under the negotiated settlement which is described in this document. 



Current Rates 



Power from the Cumberland Basin Projects is presently sold under Wholesale Power Rate Schedules CBR-1-B,
CSI-1-B, CEK-1-B, CC-1-C, CM-1-B, CK-1-B and CTV-1-B.
Wholesale Power Rate Schedules CBR-1-B, CSI-1-B, CEK-1-B, CC-1-C,
CM-1-B, CK-1-B and CTV-1-B were confirmed and approved by the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission by order issued September 16, 1989, for a period beginning July 1, 1989, and ending June 30, 1994. 



Discussion



System Repayment 



An examination of Southeastern's system power repayment study prepared 
in May 1994 for the Cumberland Basin Projects reveals that with an 
annual revenue increase of $2,211,000, over the current revenues shown 
in the previous February 1994 repayment study, all system power costs 
are paid within their repayment life. Wholesale Power Rate Schedules CBR-1-C, CSI-1-C, CEK-1-C,
CC-1-D, CM-1-C, CK-1-C and CTV-1-C are designed to produce adequate
revenue to recover all system power costs on a timely basis. The Administrator of Southeastern has certified that
the rates are 
consistent with the applicable law and that they are the lowest possible rates to customers consistent with sound
business principles. 



Rate Design 



A repayment study was prepared using present contract rates. The repayment study demonstrated that rates were not
high enough to repay all investments within their repayment life. Southeastern proposed a 6 percent rate increase
that would meet repayment criteria. The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) responded by increasing their transmission
charge from $6 to $12.1 million. 
Southeastern held a Public Comment forum on March 10, 1994 to give opportunity for review and comment of proposed rates.
Southeastern announced a revised rate increase of 24 percent for all customers. At the Public Comment Forum TVA asserted
that the rate design used to calculate the 24 percent rate increase failed to compensate TVA for the use of its transmission
facilities and that TVA customers were paying for transmission service twice. 

The 160 preference customers inside TVA are represented by the Tennessee Valley Public Power Association (TVPPA).
The TVPPA is a service organization that, among other duties, negotiates rates with TVA. Power requirements of TVPPA
members are provided exclusively by TVA. 

The TVPPA rates committee questioned the allocation of costs between capacity and energy. Previous rate filings
allocated 40 percent of the generation costs to capacity and 60 percent to energy. The 40/60 allocation was criticized
by TVA for allocating too much of the generation cost to energy. TVPPA felt that more of the cost should be placed on the
capacity component of the rate and that the energy component should cover O&M. Customers outside the TVA system
criticized Southeastern's Cumberland marketing plan for giving too much energy to TVA. 

After the public comment forum Southeastern met with TVA and the outside customers in an attempt to negotiate a settlement.
Southeastern agreed to change the rate design. The new rate design eliminates the capacity/energy split and allocates
the TVA transmission charge to the outside customers. All customers pay a capacity charge that includes 1500 hours
energy with each kilowatt of capacity. Residual energy is sold to TVA with an additional energy charge. This eliminated
the disagreement regarding the 40/60 split. 

Initially TVA proposed a $12.1 million transmission charge. Southeastern and TVA agreed to a negotiated settlement
of $7 million per year for transmission. The settlement results in a 5.1% rate increase to TVA and a 9.5% increase to
outside customers. This amount is reduced further by a $967,200 credit for power that is allocated, but not delivered
to customers in the Kentucky Utilities service area. While neither TVA nor outside customers are completely satisfied
with this settlement, Southeastern does not believe either will intervene against this rate. 

A copy of the Public Comments and Responses (Exhibit A-5 of the Rate Filing) is attached to clarify any issues
that may not be fully addressed in the main body of this document.

presented at the forum and written comments were received prior to May 10, 1994. There were twelve (12) substantive
comments received and all comments were evaluated. Comments and questions from four sources were received at the
Public Comment Forum held in Nashville on March 10, 1994. These are included in the Forum transcripts which are included
as exhibit A-4. Written comments and questions from four sources were received by mail and facsimile during
the comment period and are attached. The comments were received pursuant to 

Federal Register

 Notice 59 F.R. 5581 dated February 7, 1994. The following substantive issues contained in the comments were considered.
A summary of written comments, written responses, and the oral comments follows this discussion of the substantive
issues. 



Comment 1:

 The allocation of the TVA transmission credit does not recognize that the schedules to outside preference customers
cannot be met without the entire TVA transmission system and fails to compensate TVA for the use of its transmission
facilities for the delivery of these schedules. 



Response:

 Lacking its own transmission system, transmission services are required from TVA to deliver capacity and energy
allocations to customers outside the TVA system. Rates that have been in effect since July 1, 1989 allocate some of
the TVA transmission charge to the TVA area customers. This rate design was originally proposed in order to reallocate
what Southeastern viewed as an excess transmission charge by TVA. The rate design was not contested at FERC by TVA.
Southeastern's rate proposal that is effective July 1, 1994 includes a $7,000,000 credit for TVA's transmission
service. TVA area customers will not pay a portion of this transmission charge and the entire amount will be paid by
customers outside the TVA system. This is the amount agreed to by Southeastern and TVA after weeks of negotiations
subsequent to the March 10, 1994 public information and comment forum. This issue is further discussed in the Rate
Adjustment Process and Design section of the Rate Order. 



Comment 2:

 TVA's customers are being charged for service provided by their own system. In effect, they are paying for a portion
of the TVA system twice. 



Response:

 The issue of paying for a portion of the TVA system twice was reconciled in the negotiated settlement. Customers outside
of the TVA system bear the full amount of transmission services provided by TVA. 

 


Comment 3:

 The TVA transmission cost of $12 million which was originally proposed by TVA resulted in a rate of $2 per kilowatt per
month and 1 mill per kilowatt-hour. This rate is too high, not justified, and would not pass FERC scrutiny. 



Response:

 The negotiated settlement between Southeastern and TVA allocated reduced the transmission cost from $12 million
to $7 million. 



Comment 4:

 SEPA should not include TVA's increase in their charge for transmission services in SEPA's rates until preference
customers have had ample opportunity to make comments or intervene in some way. 



Response:

 This objection was addressed in the negotiated rate settlement. 



Comment 5:

 TVA is overcompensated on the amount of energy they get with each KW of capacity they receive. 



Response:

 This comment is understood to address the Cumberland Basin Power Marketing Policy which sets forth, among other things,
capacity and energy allocations in the Cumberland Basin. The Power Marketing Policy is set forth in 58 F.R. 41702 published
August 5, 1993. Cumberland Basin System marketing arrangements provide all customers with 1,500 hours of energy
for each kilowatt of capacity allocated by Southeastern. TVA receives 1,500 hours of energy per KW and is also allowed
to purchase any residual system energy which averages 5,000 hours per KW per year. 



Comment 6:

 Energy should be prorated to all customers and the rate increase should be shared among all customers. 



Response:

 Power allocation is addressed in the power marketing policy for the Cumberland system and was not addressed in this
rate filing. As the result of the negotiated settlement, the transmission charge to outside customers was reduced
from $12 million to $7 million per year. 



Comment 7:

 East Kentucky should not pay TVA wheeling on the portion of its capacity allocation it receives at the Laurel project.




Response:

 The Laurel Project is located in the service territory of East Kentucky Power Cooperative. All of the output of Laurel
is delivered to East Kentucky and therefore no other customer receives any benefit from this project. Even though
TVA does not have an interconnection with the Laurel Project bus bar, TVA has interconnections with East Kentucky
that facilitate the delivery of power from elsewhere in the system to provide firming support.

The Laurel Project was integrated into the Cumberland Basin System for repayment in 1984. While the Laurel Project
is the highest cost project in the Cumberland Basin System, financially integrating the project into the system effectively
lowers capacity and energy charges for East Kentucky and raises the charges for other preference customers. Including
power from the Laurel Project in the allocation of the TVA transmission charge has a similar but opposite impact. The
transmission charge is lowered for other customers and increased for East Kentucky. 
The net impact of these complicated financial and physical arrangements provides the lowest possible rates to all
of the preference customers in the Cumberland Basin system within the meaning of Section 5 of the Flood Control Act
of 1944. 


Comment 8:

 The Corps O&M costs are too high. 


Response:

 The Flood Control Act of 1944 requires Southeastern to recover Corps Operation & Maintenance costs allocated
to power. Such costs are included in this rate. Southeastern agrees that these costs are too high and will continue
to work with the customers and the Corps in an effort to lower the O&M costs on Corps hydropower projects. 


Comment 9:

 Southeastern's deviation from standard allocation method for allocating generation costs places an undue cost
burden on preference customers in the TVA area. 


Response:

 Southeastern believes that a standard allocation method, where fixed costs are charged to capacity and variable
costs are charged to energy, is inappropriate for a hydro system because most of the costs of a hydro system are fixed.
In designing the proposed rates in 1984, Southeastern compared utilities in the TVA area and attempted to emulate
the capacity energy split used in their sales for resale. In 1984 Southeastern determined that, on average, most utilities
in the TVA area charged 40 per cent to capacity and 60 per cent to energy. We continued this arrangement in 1989. The 1994
rate design, agreed to as the result of the negotiated settlement, does not continue the 60/40 split but establishes
a rate for a kilowatt of capacity that includes 1,500 kwh's of energy. Southeastern believes that this new rate design
will eliminate the disagreement between TVA and SEPA on capacity energy split of costs. 


Comment 10:

 Since the resources are used primarily for peaking purposes, a greater portion of the rate should be allocated to the
fixed or demand component. 

 


Response:

 Power is marketed from the Cumberland Basin System for different purposes. In accordance with the Final Power Marketing
Policy for the Cumberland System of Projects adopted August 5, 1993, 58 F.R. 41762, customers outside the TVA system
receive a base of 1,500 hours of energy per kilowatt per year, which makes their allocation peaking power. Similarly,
in accordance with said policy, customers inside the TVA system receive an average of 5,000 additional hours energy
per kw of capacity, which makes their power similar to a combination of peaking and intermediate power. Allocating
all costs on the assumption that all power from the Cumberland Basin System is a peaking resource would have the effect
of shifting costs from the inside customers to the outside customers. Southeastern does not believe that this would
be equitable. As a result of the settlement, Southeastern developed a new rate design which charges customers inside
and outside TVA a base rate for a KW of capacity which includes 1,500 KWH. An excess energy charge is levied on customers
inside TVA that receive residual system energy. 


Comment 11:

 The methodology used by Southeastern in determining the capacity/energy split includes power sales that are not
comparable to the type of sales made by Southeastern from the Cumberland River System. 


Response:

 Southeastern has developed a new rate design which deletes the separate change for capacity and energy and eliminates
this argument.

Environmental Impact 


Southeastern has reviewed the possible environmental impacts of this 
rate adjustment and has concluded that the increased rates would not significantly impact the quality of the human
environment within the meaning of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969. The proposed rate adjustment is
not a major Federal action for which preparation of an Environmental Impact Statement is required.

Energy to be Made Available:

 The Department of Energy shall determine the energy that is available from the projects for declaration in the billing
month. 
To meet the energy requirements of the Department of Energy's 
customers outside the TVA area (hereinafter called Other Customers), 749,400 
megawatt-hours of net energy shall be available annually (including 36,900 
megawatt-hours of annual net energy to supplement energy available at Laurel 
Project) provided, that if additional energy is required to make a marketing 
arrangement viable for other customers which do not own generating facilities 
and which are within service areas of Kentucky Utilities Company and Carolina 
Power & Light Company, Western Division, such additional energy required shall 
be made available from the Cumberland Projects and shall not exceed 300

available in any month shall not exceed 220 hours per kilowatt of total Other 
Customers contract demand, and the minimum amount available in any month shall 
not be less than 60 hours per kilowatt of total Other Customers demand. 
In the event that any portion of the capacity allocated to Other 
Customers is not initially delivered to the Other Customers as of the beginning 
of a full contract year (July through June), the 1500 hours, plus any such 
additional energy required as discussed above, shall be reduced 1/12 for each 
month of that year prior to initial delivery of such capacity. 
The energy scheduled by TVA for use within the TVA System in any 
billing month shall be the total energy delivered to TVA less (1) an adjustment 
for fast or slow meters, if any, (2) an adjustment for Barkley-Kentucky Canal 
of 15,000 megawatt-hours of energy each month which is delivered to TVA under 
the agreement from the Cumberland Projects without charge to TVA, (3) the 
energy scheduled by the Department of Energy in said month for the Other 
Customers plus losses of two (2) percent, and (4) station service energy 
furnished by TVA. 
Each kw of capacity received by TVA includes 1500 kwh of energy. Energy received in excess of 1500 kwh will be subject
to an additional energy charge identified in the monthly rates section of this rate schedule. 


Billing Month:

 The billing month for capacity and energy sold under this schedule 
shall end at 2400 hours CDT or CST, whichever is currently effective, on the 
last day of each calendar month.

declaration of energy that can be generated with the capacity available. 
For such interruption or reduction (exclusive of any restrictions 
provided in the agreement) due to conditions on the Department of Energy's 
system which have not been arranged for and agreed to in advance, the demand 
charge for scheduled capacity made available to TVA will be reduced as to the 
kilowatts of such scheduled capacity which have been so interrupted or reduced 
for each day in accordance with the following formula: 





The agreement capacity related to the 76,000 kilowatts of capacity 
allocated to the Other Customers in the Carolina Power & Light Company and 
Kentucky Utilities service areas shall, irrespective of sale to Other 
Customers, remain in effect in the formula throughout the term of this rate 
schedule. 


Power Factor:

 TVA shall take capacity and energy from the Department of Energy at 
such power factor as will best serve TVA's system from time to time; provided, 
that TVA shall not impose a power factor of less than .85 lagging on the 
Department of Energy's facilities which requires operation contrary to good 
operating practice or results in overload or impairment of such facilities.

<DOCTITLE>Fenoxaprop-ethyl; Extension of a Temporary Tolerance </DOCTITLE>


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 EPA has extended a temporary tolerance for the combined residues of the herbicide fenoxaprop-ethyl and its metabolites
in or on the raw agricultural commodity barley, grain at 0.05 part per million (ppm). 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

  EPA issued a notice under (PP) 1G3927, which was published in the 

Federal Register

 of May 19, 1993 (58 FR 29217), announcing the establishment of a temporary tolerance for the combined residues of the
herbicide fenoxaprop-ethyl ((

#

)-ethyl 2-[4-[(6-chloro-2-benzoxazolyl)oxy]phenoxy] propanoate and its metabolites 2-[4-[(6-chloro-2-benzoxazolyl)oxy]phenoxy]
propanoic acid and 6-chloro-2,3-dihydrobenzoxazol-2-one in or on the raw agricultural commodity barley, grain
at 0.05 part per million (ppm). This tolerance is issued under pesticide petition (PP) 4G3927. Hoechst Celanese Corporation,
Little Falls Center One, 2711 Centerville Rd., Wilmington, DE 19808, submitted both petitions. 



This temporary tolerance has been extended to permit the continued marketing of the raw agricultural commodity named
above when treated in accordance with the provisions of experimental use permit 8340-EUP-13, which is being extended
under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) as amended (Pub. L. 95-396, 92 Stat.
819; 7 U.S.C. 136). 

The scientific data reported and other relevant material were evaluated, and it was determined that the extension
of this temporary tolerance will protect the public health. Therefore, the temporary tolerance has been extended
on the condition that the pesticide be used in accordance with the experimental use permit and with the following provisions:


1. The total amount of the active ingredient to be used must not exceed the quantity authorized by the experimental
use permit. 

2. Hoechst Celanese Corp., must immediately notify the EPA of any findings from the experimental use that have a bearing
on safety. The company must also keep records of production, distribution, and performance and on request make the
records available to any authorized officer or employee of the EPA or the Food and Drug Administration. 

This tolerance expires May 13, 1995. Residues not in excess of this amount remaining in or on the raw agricultural commodity
after this expiration date will not be considered actionable if the pesticide is legally applied during the term of,
and in accordance with, the provisions of the experimental use permit and temporary tolerance. This tolerance may
be revoked if the experimental use permit is revoked or if any experience with or scientific data on this pesticide
indicate that such revocation is necessary to protect the public health. 

The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this notice from the requirements of section 3 of Executive Order
12866.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601-612),
the Administrator has determined that regulations establishing new tolerances or raising tolerance levels or establishing
exemptions from tolerance requirements do not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small
entities. A certification statement to this effect was published in the 

Federal Register

 of May 4, 1981 (46 FR 24950).

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 EPA has received notices of registration of pesticides to meet special local needs under section 24(c) of the Federal
Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA), as amended, from 28 States and Puerto Rico. A registration
issued under this section of FIFRA shall not be effective for more than 90 days if the Administrator disapproves the
registration or finds it to be invalid within that period. If the Administrator disapproves a registration or finds
it to be invalid after 90 days, a notice giving that information will be published in the 

Federal Register

.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 This notice only lists the section 24(c) applications submitted to the Agency. The Agency has 90 days to approve or
disapprove each application listed in this notice. Applications that are not approved are returned to the appropriate
State for action. Most of the registrations listed below were received by the EPA in December of 1993 through March
of 1994. Receipts-of-State registrations will be published periodically. Of the following registrations, nine
involve a changed-use pattern (CUP). The term ``changed use pattern'' is defined in 40 CFR 162.3(k) as a significant
change from a use pattern approved in connection with the registration of a pesticide product. Examples of significant
changes include, but are not limited to, changes from a nonfood to food use, outdoor to indoor use, ground to aerial
application, terrestrial to aquatic use, and nondomestic to domestic use.

ACTION:

 Notice. 


 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The TSCA Interagency Testing Committee (ITC), established under section 4(e) of the Toxic Substances Control Act
(TSCA), transmitted its Thirty-Fourth Report to the Administrator of EPA on May 17, 1994. As noted in this Report,
which is included with this notice, the ITC revised the 

Priority Testing List

 by: (1) changing a recommendation for one chemical, white phosphorus, to a designation, (2) recommending two chemicals,
ethyl tert-butyl ether and tert-amyl methyl ether, and (3) removing eight chemicals from the 

List

. The eight chemicals being removed from the 

List

 are: methyl methacrylate, diethyl phthalate, 

N-

phenyl-1-naphthylamine, acetophenone, phenol, 

N,N-

dimethylaniline, ethyl acetate, and 2,6-dimethylphenol. The Report states the reasons for the removal of these
chemicals from the 

List

. EPA invites interested persons to submit written comments on the Report. 


In addition, EPA is soliciting interested parties for participation in or monitoring of a TSCA section 4 testing consent
agreement development process for white phosphorus that was designated for amphibian, reptile, wild mammal, and
aquatic plant acute toxicity testing; and terrestrial plant uptake and translocation testing. EPA is also inviting
manufacturers and/or processors of white phosphorus who wish to participate in testing negotiations for white phosphorus
to develop and submit testing agreement proposals to EPA. 
EPA has already solicited interested parties in developing testing agreements for ethyl tert-butyl ether and tert-amyl
methyl ether (59 FR 18399, April 18, 1994). 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 EPA has received the TSCA Interagency Testing Committee's Thirty-Fourth Report to the Administrator. 


I. Background 


TSCA (Pub. L. 94-469, 90 Stat. 2003 et seq; 15 U.S.C. 2601 et seq.) authorizes the Administrator of EPA to promulgate
regulations under section 4(a) requiring testing of chemicals and chemical groups in order to develop data relevant
to determining the risks that such chemicals and chemical groups may present to health or the environment. Section
4(e) of TSCA established the Interagency Testing Committee to recommend chemicals and chemical groups to the Administrator
of EPA for priority testing consideration. Section 4(e) directs the ITC to revise the TSCA section 4(e) 

Priority Testing List

 at least every 6 months. The most recent revisions to this 

List

 are included in the ITC's Thirty-Fourth Report. The Report was received by the Administrator on May 17, 1994, and is
included in this Notice. The Report changes a recommendation for one chemical, recommends two chemicals, and removes
eight chemicals from the TSCA section 4(e) 

Priority Testing List

. 


II. Written and Oral Comments 


EPA invites interested persons to submit detailed comments on the ITC's Report. All submissions should bear the identifying
docket number (OPPTS-41041). 
EPA invites interested persons to submit detailed comments on the ITC's new recommendations. The Agency is interested
in receiving information concerning additional or ongoing health and safety studies on the subject chemicals as
well as information relating to the human and environmental exposure to these chemicals. 
A notice will be published at a later date in the 

Federal Register

 adding the substances recommended in the ITC's ThirtyFourth Report to the TSCA section 8(d) Health and Safety Data
Reporting Rule (40 CFR part 716), which requires the reporting of unpublished health and safety studies on the listed
chemicals. 



III. Status of List 


The ITC's Thirty-Fourth Report notes the change of a recommendation for one chemical to a designation, the recommendation
of two chemicals, and the removal of eight chemicals from the 

Priority Testing List

. The current TSCA section 4(e) 

Priority Testing List

 contains 12 chemicals and 12 chemical groups, with 2 chemical groups and 3 chemicals designated for testing. 


IV. Testing Consent Agreements 


1.

 Solicitation of interested parties.

 EPA's procedures for requiring the testing of chemical substances under section 4 of TSCA include the adoption of
enforceable consent agreements and the promulgation of test rules. These processes are found at 40 CFR 790.20. EPA
has on numerous occasions been approached by chemical companies interested in negotiating consent agreements for
testing ITC chemicals or chemical groups. As a result of these requests, EPA is now inviting persons interested in
participating in or monitoring negotiations on the chemical designated in the Thirty-Fourth ITC Report to notify
EPA in writing. Those who respond to this solicitation by the deadline established in this notice will have the status
of ``interested parties'' and will be afforded opportunities to participate in the negotiation process. These ``interested
parties'' will not incur any obligations by being designated ``interested parties.'' 
2.

 Solicitation of testing proposals for consent agreement negotiations.

 EPA is also now soliciting testing proposals for a consent agreement to perform amphibian, reptile, wild mammal,
and aquatic plant acute toxicity testing; and terrestrial plant uptake and translocation testing on white phosphorus.
Following publication of this notice, manufacturers and/or processors have 60 days to develop and submit testing
proposals that they wish EPA to consider as candidates for consent agreement negotiations for white phosphorus.
Testing guidelines for the designated tests include: (1) Lemna Acute Toxicity Test at 40 CFR 797.1160, (2) Plant Uptake
and Translocation Test at 40 CFR 797.2850, (3) Amphibian Acute Toxicity Test, (4) Reptilian Acute Toxicity Test,
(5) Wild Mammal Acute Toxicity Test. These guidelines are available to the public through the TSCA Public Docket Office
and the Environmental Assistance Division listed above. These guidelines should be reviewed before submitting
any testing proposals in response to this notice. 
For additional technical information on these testing guidelines contact Dr. Barnett Rattner, Department of The
Interior, (301) 497-5671. 
All testing proposals submitted should describe the testing to be performed and explain any deviations from the test
protocols. 
EPA will review the submissions and select the most promising submissions as candidates for negotiation. Submissions
that fully address the ITC's concerns will have a higher chance of success than those that do not fully address all data
needs. 
3.

 Negotiation of testing program and development of a testing consent agreement.

 EPA will follow the negotiation procedures under 40 CFR 790.22, and to the extent feasible, the timetable outlined
in 40 CFR part 790, appendix A to subpart B. 
For additional information about process or negotiations contact Frank Kover, Chief, Chemical Testing and Information
Branch, (202) 260-8130.

Thirty-Fourth Report of the TSCA Interagency Testing Committee to the Administrator, U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency 


</SIGNJOB>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This is the 34th Report of the TSCA Interagency Testing Committee (ITC) to the Administrator of the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA). The ITC is revising its 

Priority Testing List

 by changing a recommendation for one chemical, white phosphorus, to a designation for action by the Administrator
within 12 months, recommending two chemicals, ethyl 

tert

-butyl ether and 

tert

-amyl methyl ether and by removing eight chemicals. White phosphorus is being designated to meet the data needs of
the Department of Interior (DOI); discussions are ongoing with the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry
(ATSDR), the Department of Defense (DOD), and EPA to coordinate their data needs with those of DOI. Ethyl 

tert-

butyl ether and 

tert-

amyl methyl ether are being recommended for health effects testing because EPA needs these data for ongoing assessments.
Methyl methacrylate and diethyl phthalate are being removed from the 

List

 because dermal absorption rate data are available that are likely to satisfy the data needs of the Occupational Health
and Safety Administration (OSHA). 

N-

Phenyl-1-naphthylamine is being removed from the 

List

 because studies reviewed by the ITC did not increase concerns for cancer and the ITC's priorities do not include designating
the chemical at this time. Acetophenone, phenol, N,

N-

dimethylaniline, ethyl acetate and 2,6-dimethylphenol are being removed from the 

List

 because EPA proposed the testing designated by the ITC in its 27th Report in a test rule that was published on November
22, 1993 (58 FR 61654). 


I. Background 


The TSCA Interagency Testing Committee (ITC) was established by section 4(e) of the Toxic Substances Control Act
(TSCA): 


 
...to make recommendations to the Administrator respecting the chemical substances and mixtures to which the Administrator
should give priority consideration for the promulgation of a rule for testing under section 4(a).... At least every
six months..., the Committee shall make such revisions in the 

List

 as it determines to be necessary and to transmit them to the Administrator together with the Committee's reasons for
the revisions... 
(Public Law 94-469, 90 Stat. 2003 et seq., 15 U.S.C. 2601 et seq.). 



 

Since its creation in 1976, the ITC has submitted 33 semi-annual Reports to the EPA Administrator transmitting the


Priority Testing List

 and its revisions. These Reports have been published in the 

Federal Register

 (FR) and are available from the ITC. The ITC meets monthly and produces its revisions with the help of staff and technical
contract support provided by EPA. ITC membership and support personnel are listed at the end of this Report. 


Following receipt of the ITC's Report and the addition of chemicals to the 

Priority Testing List

, the EPA's Office of Pollution Prevention and Toxics adds these chemicals to TSCA section 8(a) and 8(d) rules that
require manufacturers, processors, and/or distributors of these chemicals to submit production and exposure data
(8a), and health and safety studies (8d), within 2 months of the rules' effective date. The submissions are indexed
and maintained by EPA. The ITC reviews the 8(a) and 8(d) information and other available data on chemicals and chemical
groups (e.g., TSCA section 8(e) ``substantial risk'' studies, ``For Your Information'' (FYI) submissions to EPA
and published papers) to determine if revisions to the 

Priority Testing List

 are necessary. Revisions can include changing a recommendation to a designation for action by the Administrator
within 12 months, modifying the recommended testing, or removing the chemical or chemical group from the 

List

. 



II. Revisions to the TSCA Section 4(e) Priority Testing List 


The ITC's revisions to its TSCA Section 4(e) 

Priority Testing List

 are summarized in the following Table 1. 


 

III. Rationale for the revisions 


A. ITC's Activities During this Reporting Period 


During the 6 months covered by this Report, November 1993 through April 1994, the ITC reviewed the TSCA section 8(a)
and section 8(d) submissions and other available data for white phosphorus and 

N-

phenyl-1-naphthylamine and dermal absorption data for diethyl phthalate and methyl methacrylate, and made decisions
with respect to their dispositions on the 

Priority Testing List

. 


B. Specific Rationales 


1.

 Designated chemical _ White phosphorus

_a. 

Background.

 Thousands of ducks in wetlands at an artillery impact area have been poisoned by white phosphorus. The Department
of Interior (DOI) is concerned about the persistence of white phosphorus in wetland sediments, the adverse effects
of white phosphorus on wildlife, and the indirect effects of white phosphorus on endangered species that feed on carcasses
of white phosphorus-poisoned wildlife. 
In November 1991, based on DOI's data needs, the ITC recommended testing to determine the persistence of white phosphorus
in surface waters and sediments and the toxicity to migratory birds and other wildlife (see the ITC's 29th Report in
56 FR 67424, December 30, 1991). Since that recommendation, the DOI has considered these and other data needs. Discussions
at ITC meetings, are ongoing with the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR), the Department of
Defense (DOD), and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to coordinate their data needs with those of DOI.
Several Federal Government organizations have past and ongoing activities that could result in the identification
of additional data needs for white phosphorus and more ITC testing designations. Some of these activities are described
below. 
ATSDR is drafting a toxicological profile on white phosphorus. DOD is supporting studies on white phosphorus because
it is detected in wetlands on DOD munitions testing sites. In 1990, EPA published a Drinking Water Health Advisory
for white phosphorus (Ref. 20). In 1992 and 1993, EPA obtained 1991 and 1992 data under the Toxics Release Inventory
(TRI), indicating that during each of these years about 300,000 pounds of white phosphorus were released to land (Ref.
17). These releases are an order of magnitude lower than reported for previous years (56 FR 67424) and reflect, in part,
more accurate record keeping by white phosphorus manufacturers. In 1993, EPA and DOD conducted 4 seminars on ``technologies
for remediating sites contaminated with explosive and radioactive wastes'' (Ref. 21). In 1993, EPA also prepared
a handbook entitled ``Approaches for the Remediation of Federal Sites Contaminated with Explosive and Radioactive
Wastes'' (Ref. 22). White phosphorus was extensively discussed in the seminars and the handbook. EPA is making a determination
of whether there are health effects data needed for white phosphorus under Title III of the Clean Air Act. ITC will coordinate
ATSDR, DOD and EPA data needs with those of DOI and determine if additional testing needs to be designated in a future
ITC report. 
The Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS) has two Registry numbers for white phosphorus: 7723-14-0, as a general
number for white, yellow, black and red phosphorus, and 12185-10-3 specifically for white phosphorus.
The ITC used CAS No. 7723-14-0 in the 29th Report, because it is the most commonly used for white phosphorus.
It is used to record production volume and environmental release data as well as most published and unpublished studies.
In response to the ITC's 29th Report testing recommendations, EPA promulgated TSCA section 8(a) and 8(d) rules for
CAS No. 7723-14-0 on March 12, 1993, and for CAS No. 12185-10-3 on December 27, 1993. The manufacturers,
processors and distributors of white phosphorus submitted section 8(a) reports and section 8(d) studies only for
7723-14-0. Therefore, the ITC is only designating white phosphorus as CAS No. 7723-14-0 and
requesting that EPA remove CAS No. 12185-10-3 from the TSCA section 8(d) rule. 
b.

 Designated testing.

 To meet the data needs of DOI, the ITC is designating white phosphorus for amphibian, reptile, wild mammal and aquatic
plant acute toxicity testing, and terrestrial plant uptake and translocation testing. 
c.

 Rationale for designation

. DOI reviewed the submitted section 8(a) and 8(d) data as well as TSCA section 8(e), FYI, and published papers for white
phosphorus. It continues to be concerned about the persistence of white phosphorus in wetland sediments, adverse
effects on wildlife that feed on white phosphorus-contaminated sediments, and the potential adverse effects on
endangered species that feed on carcasses of wildlife that die from white phosphorus poisoning. Although DOI is working
with DOD to conduct and coordinate testing and field investigations of white phosphorus, DOI has data needs that are
not included in this coordinated, government-funded program. These additional data are needed by DOI to assess the
ecological risks posed by white phosphorus. 
d.

 Supporting information

. DOI nominated white phosphorus to the ITC in 1991 because persistence and ecotoxicity data were needed to assess
the ecological risks posed by white phosphorus. The results of studies submitted under TSCA section 8(d) and section
8(e), other relevant data, and ongoing activities are presented below along with the specific rationales for the
designated tests. 
(1)

 Exposure information_production/use/disposal/exposure/release.

 
In 1990, approximately 700 million pounds of white phosphorus were produced (Ref. 2). Based on 1991 and 1992 TRI data,
about 300,000 pounds are released annually from production facilities (Ref. 17). The amounts of white phosphorus
released during munitions testing, pesticides manufacturing and other uses is unknown to the ITC. 
Every year since 1980, up to 3,000 waterfowl (dabbling ducks), 50 swans, and an undetermined number of shorebirds
appear to have died from white phosphorus poisoning at an artillery impact area in the estuarine wetlands of Eagle
River Flats, Cook Inlet, Alaska. This wildlife mortality continues despite the fact that on September 10, 1991, the
Assistant Secretary of the Army (Installations, Logistics, and Environment) suspended the Army's firing of white
phosphorus munitions in wetland areas. 
White phosphorus has been detected in water samples (0.013-0.069 

m

g/L) from Eagle River Flats (Ref. 10). White phosphorus particles have been visually identified and chemically-confirmed
at concentrations of 10 ppm in sediments (Refs. 11 and 23). White phosphorus has been isolated from the gizzards of
dead mallard ducks, 

Anas platyrhynchos

 (Ref. 11). Exposure of at least a dozen avian species has been documented through chemical detection of white phosphorus
in gizzard, liver, muscle, fat or skin (Refs. 11, 13, and 23). 
White phosphorus contamination at artillery impact areas is currently being investigated by Simmers et al. (Ref.
14). Sampling results from 21 of the 23 DOD installations indicate that white phosphorus was detected (detection
limit of 1 

m

g/kg) at seven of the installations (Ref. 3). 
(2)

 Chemical fate information.

 Degradation rates of white phosphorus solutions have been characterized in an aqueous 

in vitro

 test system (Ref. 4), and appear to be dependent on dissolved oxygen, pH and temperature. Under aerobic conditions,
solutions of white phosphorus are rapidly oxidized (or possibly hydrolyzed or volatilized; Ref. 15) and its concentration
decreases monotonically with time (282 to 1762 

m

g/L yielded a half-life of 3 hours for the initial 24 hour period). However, degradation rates are reduced at temperatures
below 22 
 C and in closed (non-aerated) test systems. Under such conditions, white phosphorus half-life increases from
hours to weeks. When sediments were tested in a modified aqueous 

in vitro

 test system, degradation rates of white phosphorus were slower in sediment than in water (Ref. 5). 
White phosphorus in sediments at the estuarine wetlands of Eagle River Flats, Alaska is often found as particulates,
ranging in diameter from 0.15 to 3.5 mm (corresponding to the size range of food items and gizzard material selected
by many species of waterfowl), and at sediment depths of up to 30 cm (Ref. 10). White phosphorus particles appear to
be quite persistent in the saturated saline sediments of Eagle River Flats, but volatilize as sediments dry below
20 percent moisture (Ref. 23). Factors that affect persistence of white phosphorus in sediments include sediment
porosity, moisture content and temperature, all of which interact to determine the rate of sublimation. Oxygen may
slow sublimation by the formation of oxidation products around the particles that impose a diffusion barrier to white
phosphorus vapor. Using data on the dissolution rate of white phosphorus particles in water (Ref. 15), Walsh (Ref.
23) estimated the dissolution of a 1 mm diameter white phosphorus sphere to be 8 years. The extent of particulate white
phosphorus contamination in the United States remains largely unknown. 
The rate of oxidation of white phosphorus particles in aerated-soil is highly variable depending on environmental
conditions (Refs. 1, 12 and 24). Using a model to estimate the fate of white phosphorus particles in soil, Spanggord
et al. estimated that particles buried in soil could persist for several years, and if an ``oxidized coat'' were formed,
particles could persist for thousands of years (Ref. 15). 
These data demonstrate the persistence of white phosphorus in sediments. Therefore, the ITC is not designating further
chemical fate testing of white phosphorus at this time. 
(3)

 Health effects information

. The ITC's 29th Report summarized available health effects data for white phosphorus. These data indicate that white
phosphorus is highly toxic to humans and laboratory animals (56 FR 67424; December 30, 1991). As noted in the summary
of this 34th Report, discussions are ongoing with ATSDR, DOD and EPA to coordinate their data needs with those of DOI.
The ITC is not designating further health effects testing at this time because those discussions have not been completed.

(4)

 Ecological effects information_ Acute and subchronic effects (short-term).

 The ITC's 29th Report summarized laboratory and field studies for white phosphorus. These studies indicated that
white phosphorus is highly toxic to aquatic organisms (56 FR 67424, December 30, 1991). 
Thirty-day bioassays are currently being conducted by the U.S. Army Environmental Hygiene Agency to measure the
toxicity of white phosphorus contaminated sediments from Eagle River Flats to the crustacean, 

Hyallela azteca

 and the midge larve, 

Chironomus riparius

 (Ref. 10). 
The median lethal dose for adult male and juvenile mallard ducks gavaged with white phosphorus dissolved in corn oil
vehicle was 6.5 mg/kg (Ref. 10). Signs of toxicity include slow rhythmic lateral head shaking, and lethargy, followed
by convulsions. Birds often succumb within 1 to 2 hours, but in other instances may linger for up to 55 hours prior to
death. Concentrations of white phosphorus in dosed mallards exceed 0.25 

m

g/g in fat, skin and liver (Refs. 10 and 11). 
The acute median lethal dose of white phosphorus in female mallards is being estimated by Sparling (Ref. 16). The females
appear to be slightly more tolerant than male and juvenile birds (LD50>10 mg/kg) (Ref. 16). An estimation of the lowest
observable effect level (LOEL) will be determined by Sparling (Ref. 16) using white phosphorus pellets without vehicle,
because a corn oil vehicle may affect absorption and toxicity. 
Increasing evidence suggests the potential for widespread white phosphorus pollution in wetlands. While white
phosphorus toxicity data have been or are being developed for aquatic and avian species that inhabit wetlands. There
are no white phosphorus toxicity data for amphibians, reptiles, and wild mammals that frequent temperate zone wetland
habitats. In addition, some mammals, including furbearers (e.g., mink), frequent wetlands and are known to be far
more sensitive to certain environmental pollutants (e.g., PCBs) than laboratory rodents. For these reasons, DOI
needs amphibian, reptile, and wild mammal acute toxicity test data for its white phosphorus risk assessment. 
Based on limited available data and DOI's data needs, the ITC is designating white phosphorus for amphibian, reptile,
and wild mammal acute toxicity testing. 


Chronic (long-term) effects

. The ITC's 29th Report described laboratory studies that demonstrated the chronic toxicity of white phosphorus
to aquatic organisms (56 FR 67424, December 30, 1991). 
Based on these data and ongoing DOI studies, the ITC is not designating further chronic aquatic toxicity testing at
this time. 


Metabolism and pharmacokinetics

. Data for laboratory mammals were summarized in the ITC's 29th Report (56 FR 67424, December 30, 1991). Recent studies
suggest that acute white phosphorus toxicity in warm-blooded animals may be due to the nonenzymatic metabolism of
white phosphorus to phosphine (Ref. 8). 
A recent publication described the uptake and loss of white phosphorus in American kestrels or sparrow hawks (Falco
sparverius) (Ref. 9). This study indicated that although uptake of white phosphorus was rapid, bioaccumulation
is limited in American kestrels because of chemical or enzymatic degradation. 
Uptake and depuration studies of white phosphorus administered to mallards below the LD50 will be studied by Sparling
(Ref. 16). Pharmacokinetics will be studied by Sparling (Ref. 16) at various intervals for a 10-day period in
breast muscle, gizzard, abdominal fat, skin, liver, pancreas and blood. Sparling (Ref. 16) will also study histopathological
and biochemical biomarkers of exposure. 
Based on these data and ongoing DOI studies, the ITC is not designating further metabolism and pharmacokinetic testing
at this time. 


Reproductive effects.

 In rats, 75 

m

g/kg/day of white phosphorus reduced pregnancy rates (Ref. 6), increased death rates of females in late gestation
(Ref. 7), increased parturition-related difficulties (Ref. 18), and increased the number of dead pups at birth (Ref.
19). The birth defects caused by white phosphorus, and the presence of white phosphorus in herring gull eggs collected
in Eagle River Flats (Ref. 8), suggest the need for reproductive effects studies in birds. DOI is planning preliminary
studies to investigate fertility rates of male and female mallards repeatedly gavaged (chronic exposure) with low
doses of white phosphorus (Ref. 16). 
Based on the studies conducted by Monsanto and planned DOI studies, the ITC is not designating further reproductive
effects testing at this time. 


Other ecological effects

. Predation of ducks poisoned by white phosphorus was systematically monitored at Eagle River Flats in the spring
and fall of 1991 (Ref. 13). Twenty-four instances of predation of sick or dead dabbling ducks by bald eagles (

Haliaetus leucocephalus

), herring gulls (

Larus argentatus

) and common ravens (

Corvus corax

) were observed. Other predators, including northern harrier (

Circus cyaneus

) and coyotes (

Canis latrans

) have been observed to hunt over the Flats. Many decaying bald eagle carcasses have been found at or near Eagle River
Flats, and the single carcass tested was positive for white phosphorus in fatty tissues (Refs. 10 and 13). Based on
these observations, and the risk assessment of Roebuck et al. (Ref. 13), there is considerable potential for secondary
poisoning of predators, including endangered species. 
DOI will investigate secondary poisoning of predators (raptors and other scavengers) using captive American kestrels
fed northern bobwhite quail chicks (Colinus virginianus) that had been gavaged with 1 mg/kg pelletized white phosphorus
for a 10-day period (Ref. 16). Mortality, biochemical and histopathological biomarkers of toxicity, and white
phosphorus burdens in kestrels will be studied (Ref. 16). 
Based on data published by Racine (Ref. 10) and Roebuck (Ref. 13) and planned DOI studies, the ITC is not designating
other ecological effects testing at this time. 


Bioconcentration and food chain transport

. The 29th ITC Report noted that bioconcentration of white phosphorus was studied in three species of fish, six species
of invertebrates and in two species of seaweed (56 FR 67424; December 30, 1991). Fish and invertebrates have been collected
at Eagle River Flats by Racine for determination of white phosphorus uptake (Ref. 10). 
A recent study suggested that large predators such as bald eagles, that have the ability to ingest whole gizzards of
prey birds, could bioaccumulate white phosphorus because the amount ingested could exceed the degradation capacity
(Ref. 9). 
Few data are available on bioconcentration and food chain transport of white phosphorus by plants. This data need
concerns DOI because white phosphorus has been detected in or on the roots of salt marsh plants at Eagle River Flats
(Ref. 10), and because many herbivorous wildlife species could be exposed to, and be adversely affected by, white
phosphorus as a result of uptake and bioconcentration by plants. 
Based on DOI's data needs, the ITC is designating white phosphorus for aquatic plant toxicity and terrestrial plant
uptake and translocation testing. 
2.

 Recommended chemicals _ Ethyl tert-butyl ether and tert-amyl methyl ether_

 a.

 Background

. The ITC designated methyl 

tert-

butyl ether (MTBE) for health effects testing in its 20th Report because of concerns for widespread human exposure
to low level fugitive emissions of MTBE at gasoline pumps and the need for chronic health effects data (52 FR 19020;
May 20, 1987). In response to the ITC's designation, EPA and MTBE manufacturers negotiated a TSCA section 4 enforceable
consent agreement to develop pharmacokinetics, genotoxicity, subchronic toxicity, reproductive effects, developmental
toxicity, neurotoxicity, and oncogenicity data (53 FR 10391, March 31, 1988). EPA is evaluating the data from the
completed MTBE testing program. 
EPA needs health effects data for two other fuel oxygenates, ethyl 

tert-

butyl ether (ETBE) and 

tert-

amyl methyl ether (TAME) and is soliciting interest in developing testing agreements for these chemicals (59 FR 18399,
April 18, 1994). 
b.

 Recommended testing

. Ethyl 

tert-

butyl ether and 

tert-

amyl methyl ether are being recommended for health effects testing because EPA needs these data for ongoing assessments.

c.

 Rationale for recommendation

. The use of ETBE and TAME to augment or substitute for MTBE as fuel oxygenates and the health effects data needs of ETBE
and TAME are of concern to EPA and the ITC. Therefore, the ITC is recommending testing to obtain TSCA section 8(d) health
and safety data on ETBE and TAME to support EPA's ongoing assessments of the potential hazards/risks posed by these
two chemical substances. The ITC will share the data with EPA and other interested U.S. Government organizations
represented on the ITC and will review these data to determine whether ETBE and TAME should be designated for testing
or removed from the 

Priority Testing List

. The ITC is also requesting data on acute toxicity of gasoline mixtures containing ETBE and/or TAME. The ITC's process
of recommending ETBE and TAME and then making decisions following data review is consistent with the process used
for MTBE. MTBE was recommended in ITC's 19th Report (51 FR 41417, November 14, 1986) and designated in ITC's 20th Report,
following ITC's review of voluntarily submitted and TSCA section 8(d) data. 
d.

 Supporting information

. EPA's recent 

Federal Register

 notice provides supporting information (59 FR 18399, April 18, 1994). 


 

The requirements of the Clean Air Act (CAA), 42 U.S.C. 7401-7671q, along with reports of adverse human health
effects associated with the use of MTBE in winter-blend gasoline, have contributed to the need for health effects
testing of ETBE and TAME. 
MTBE, ETBE, and TAME are fuel oxygenates which may be used to satisfy the 
following requirements under the CAA. Under section 211(m) of the CAA, 42 
U.S.C. 7545, States which have certain attainment areas for carbon monoxide (CO) must require that any gasoline sold
or dispensed to ultimate customers in a specified portion of the nonattainment area be blended, during wintertime,
to contain not less than 2.7 percent oxygen by weight (or applicable percentage to meet the national primary air quality
standard for CO by the established attainment date). Under section 211(k), reformulated gasoline must be used in
nonattainment areas in nine major metropolitan areas that are designated as ozone nonattainment areas as well as
various nonattainment ``opt-in'' areas by 1995 and the oxygen content of this gasoline 
must be equal to or exceed 2 percent by weight. See Final Rule, Regulation of Fuels and Fuel Additives: Standards for
Reformulated and Conventional Gasoline, February 16, 1994 (59 FR 7716). In addition, a proposed regulation [by EPA's
Office of Air and Radiation] would require that at least 30 percent of the oxygen content of reformulated gasoline
come from renewable oxygenates, which would include ETBE. See OAR/EPA Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, regulation
of Fuels and Additives: Renewable Oxygenate Requirement for Reformulated Gasoline, December 27, 1993 (58 FR 68343).

Recently, there have been reports from the State of Alaska and several areas in the lower 48 states of adverse human
health effects [(e.g., headache, nausea, general malaise)] associated with the use of MTBE in winter-blend gasoline.
(See Assessment of Potential Health Risks of Gasoline Oxygenated with MTBE, Office of Research and Development,
U.S. EPA, November 1993.) 
EPA believes that additional health effects test data on fuel oxygenates are needed to allow government agencies
and industry to compare the health risks associated with the use of these substances to augment or substitute for MTBE
as a fuel oxygenate....

 Exposure information_production/use/disposal/exposure/release.

 Estimates published in 1991 indicate that by 1995, annual production volumes of ETBE and TAME are expected to exceed
26 million pounds (Refs. 29 and 30) and 6 billion pounds (Ref. 35), respectively. Estimates published in 1994 indicate
that by 1995, about 335,000 barrels per day (32 billion pounds per year) of oxygenates will be needed to meet oxygenated-and
reformulated-fuel mandates (Ref. 28). Consumer, occupational or environmental exposures to ETBE or TAME could
be substantial based on their use as fuel oxygenates.

 Removal of chemicals from the Priority Testing List_

 a.

Methyl methacrylate and diethyl phthalate.

 In its 32nd Report, the ITC designated methyl methacrylate (CAS No. 80-62-6) and diethyl phthalate (CAS
No. 84-66-2) for dermal absorption testing to meet the data needs of the Occupational Safety and Health
Administration (OSHA) (58 FR 38490, July 16, 1993). These chemicals were added to the 

Priority Testing List

 as members of a 34-chemical group that had inadequate dermal absorption rate data. OSHA nominated these chemicals
to the ITC to obtain data for OSHA to determine whether skin notations should be assigned to these chemicals. 
The ITC obtained dermal absorption rate data for methyl methacrylate (Ref. 37) and diethyl phthalate (Ref. 36) that
are likely to meet OSHA's data needs. As a result, the ITC is removing methyl methacrylate and diethyl phthalate from
the 

Priority Testing List

 and making the data publicly available by including the references in the EPA docket for this 34th Report and transmitting
the data to OSHA and other interested U.S. Government organizations. As a result of finding that these data are likely
to meet OSHA's data needs, the ITC requested EPA to remove these chemicals from its TSCA section 8(a) and/or section
8(d) rules before the May 10, 1994 reporting deadline. EPA removed methyl methacrylate and diethyl phthalate from
these TSCA section 8 rules on May 2, 1994 (59 FR 22519, May 2, 1994). 

b.

 N-

Phenyl-1-naphthylamine. In its 27th Report, the ITC recommended 

N-

phenyl-1-naphthylamine (CAS No. 90-30-2) for carcinogenicity testing to meet the data needs of OSHA
and for chemical fate and ecological effects testing, because of ITC concerns for environmental persistence and
aquatic toxicity (56 FR 9534, March 6, 1991). 
OSHA was concerned about potential occupational exposures to 

N-

phenyl-1-naphthylamine in hydraulic fluids and other mixtures, and the potential carcinogenicity of this 

N-

substituted aromatic amine. As noted in ITC's 27th Report, OSHA's exposure concerns were based on 1981-1983
National Occupational Exposure Survey estimates that 96,478 workers were potentially exposed to 

N-

phenyl-1-naphthylamine almost exclusively through trade name products. After reviewing the TSCA section 8(a)
production and exposure data, ITC Members met with the U.S. manufacturer of 

N-

phenyl-1-naphthylamine. At the meeting and during subsequent discussions, the ITC Members were provided with estimates
that 800 to 900 workers were exposed to technical grade 

N-

phenyl-1-naphthylamine during manufacturing and processing, and specifications showing that concentrations
of 

N-

phenyl-1-naphthylamine in formulated lubricants were generally less than four percent (Ref. 39). 
ITC Members also reviewed the TSCA section 8(d) health and safety studies and other toxicity data on 

N-

phenyl-1-naphthylamine that were obtained after the 27th Report was published. Most of these studies were conducted
on formulated products that did not specify the amount of technical grade 

N-

phenyl-1-naphthylamine in the product. The aquatic toxicity studies indicated that formulated products containing


N-

phenyl-1-naphthylamine were several orders of magnitude less toxic than pure 

N-

phenyl-1-naphthylamine, which, as reported in ITC's 27th Report, was highly toxic to aquatic organisms and teratogenic
to frogs (56 FR 9534, March 6, 1991). The biodegradation studies on formulated products containing 

N-

phenyl-1-naphthylamine confirmed its potential environmental persistence. The health effects studies on formulated
products containing 

N-

phenyl-1-naphthylamine did not suggest concerns for carcinogenicity. The results from testing a structurally-related
chemical, 

N-

phenyl-2-naphthylamine (CAS No. 135-88-6) by the National Toxicology Program (NTP) showed it to be noncarcinogenic
in rats and mice (Ref. 40). Based on the available health effects data and structure-activity considerations, there
is no reason to believe that 

N-

phenyl-1-naphthylamine would have a greater carcinogenic potential than 

N-

 phenyl-2-naphthylamine. 
The ITC is removing 

N-

phenyl-1-naphthylamine from the 

Priority Testing List

 because the available data did not increase concern for carcinogenicity, and the changing priorities of the ITC do
not warrant designating the chemical for testing at this time. This decision is consistent with the April 1993 decision
by the German Advisory Committee on Existing Chemicals of Environmental Relevance (BUA) to not conduct priority
carcinogenicity investigations of 

N-

phenyl-1-naphthylamine (Ref. 38). 
The ITC has completed its review of TSCA section 8(d) information for 

N-

phenyl-1-naphthylamine, and requests that EPA remove it from the TSCA section 8(d) rule. 
c.

 Acetophenone, phenol, N,N-

dimethylaniline, ethyl acetate and 2,6-dimethylphenol. In its 27th Report, the ITC designated acetophenone, phenol,
N,

N-

dimethylaniline, ethyl acetate and 2,6-dimethylphenol to meet EPA's data needs (56 FR 9534, March 6, 1991). The ITC
is removing these chemicals from the 

Priority Testing List

 because EPA proposed a test rule on November 22, 1993 to implement the testing (58 FR 61654, November 22, 1993).

<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Proposed consent agreement.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

In settlement of alleged violations of federal law prohibiting unfair acts and practices and unfair methods of competition,
this consent agreement, accepted subject to final Commission approval, would require, among other things, a Pennsylvania-based
subsidiary of Sara Lee Corporation and manufacturer of shoe care products to divest its Esquire and Griffin brands
and related assets to Hickory Industries within one month after the order becomes final. If the sale to Hickory Industries
is not accomplished within one month, the proposed agreement would require Kiwi and Sara Lee to divest the assets to
another Commission approved acquirer within twelve months or else the Commission would be entitled to appoint a trustee
to sell the assets to a Commission approved acquirer in a manner approved by the Commission.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Pursuant to section 6(f) of the Federal Trade Commission Act, 38 Stat. 721, 15 U.S.C. 46 and section 2.34 of the Commission's
Rules of Practice (16 CFR 2.34), notice is hereby given that the following consent agreement containing a consent
order to divest, having been filed with and accepted, subject to final approval, by the Commission, has been placed

by the Commission and will be available for inspection and copying at its principal office in accordance with  4.9(b)(6)(ii)
of the Commission's Rules of Practice (16 CFR 4.9(b)(6)(ii).


Agreement Containing Consent Order


The Federal Trade Commission (``the Commission''), having initiated an investigation of the acquisition by Kiwi
Brands Inc. (``Kiwi''), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Sara Lee Corporation (``Sara Lee''), of certain assets of Knomark,
Inc., at the time of the acquisition a wholly-owned subsidiary of Papercraft Corporation, and of certain assets of
Reckitt and Colman plc, and it now appearing that Kiwi and Sara Lee, hereinafter sometimes referred to as proposed

for the Commission that:

Commission. If this agreement is accepted by the Commission it, together with the draft of complaint contemplated
thereby, will be placed on the public record for a period of sixty (60) days and information in respect thereto publicly
released. The Commission thereafter may either withdraw its acceptance of this agreement and so notify proposed
Respondents, in which event it will take such action as it may consider appropriate, or issue and serve its complaint
(in such form as the circumstances may require) and decision, in disposition of the proceeding.

6. This agreement is for settlement purposes only and does not constitute an admission by proposed Respondents that
the law has been violated as alleged in the draft of complaint here attached, or that the facts as alleged in the draft
complaint, other than jurisdictional facts, are true.

7. This agreement contemplates that, if it is accepted by the Commission, and if acceptance is not subsequently withdrawn
by the Commission pursuant to the provisions of Section 2.34 of the Commission's Rules, the Commission may, without
further notice to proposed Respondents, (1) issue its complaint corresponding in form and substance with the draft
of complaint here attached and its decision containing the following order to divest and to cease and desist in disposition

by statute for other orders. The order shall become final upon service. Delivery by the U.S. Postal Service of the complaint
and decision containing the agreed-to order to proposed Respondents' addresses as stated in this agreement shall
constitute service. Proposed Respondents waive any right they may have to any other manner of service. The complaint
may be used in construing the terms of the order, and no agreement, understanding, representation or interpretation
not contained in the order or the agreement may be used to vary or contradict the terms of the order.

8. Proposed Respondents have read the draft of complaint and order contemplated hereby. Proposed Respondents understand
that once the order has been issued, they will be required to file one or more compliance reports showing that they have
fully complied with the order. Proposed Respondents further understand that they may be liable for civil penalties
in the amount provided by law for each violation of the order after it became final.

pursuant to section 5(

l

) of the Federal Trade Commission Act, 15 U.S.C. 45(

l

), or any other statute enforced by the Commission, Respondents shall consent to the appointment of a trustee in such
action. Neither the appointment of a trustee nor a decision not to appoint a trustee under this Paragraph shall preclude
the Commission or the Attorney General from seeking civil penalties or any other relief available to it for any failure
by Respondents to comply with this order.

to the selection of the proposed trustee. 
2. Subject to the prior approval of the Commission, the trustee shall have the exclusive power and authority to divest
the Griffin and Esquire assets. 
3. The trustee shall have twelve (12) months from the date the Commission approves the trust agreement described in
Paragraph III B. 8. to accomplish the divestiture, which shall be subject to the prior approval of the Commission.
If, however, at the end of the twelve-month period, the trustee has submitted a plan of divestiture or believes that
divestiture can be achieved within a reasonable time, the divestiture period may be extended by the Commission, or,
in the case of a court-appointed trustee, by the court. 
4. The trustee shall have full and complete access to the personnel, books, records and facilities related to the Griffin
and Esquire assets, or to any other relevant information, as the trustee may reasonably request. Respondents shall
develop such financial or other information as such trustee may reasonably request and shall cooperate with the trustee.
Respondents shall take no action to interfere with or impede the trustee's accomplishment of the divestiture. Any
delays in divestiture caused by Respondents shall extend the time for divestiture under this Paragraph in an amount
equal to the delay, as determined by the Commission or, for a court-appointed trustee, by the court. 
5. The trustee shall use his or her best efforts to negotiate the most favorable price and terms available in each contract
that is submitted to the Commission, subject to Respondent's absolute and unconditional obligation to divest at
no minimum price. The divestiture shall be made in the manner and to the acquirer or acquirers as set out in Paragraph
II of this order; provided, however, if the trustee receives bona fide offers from more than one acquiring entity,
and if the Commission determines to approve more than one such acquiring entity, the trustee shall divest to the acquiring
entity or entities selected by Respondents from among those approved by the Commission. 
6. The trustee shall serve, without bond or other security, at the cost and expense of Respondents, on such reasonable
and customary terms and conditions as the Commission or a court may set. The trustee shall have the authority to employ,
at the cost and expense of Respondents, such consultants, accountants, attorneys, investment bankers, business
brokers, appraisers, and other representatives and assistants as are reasonably necessary to carry out the trustee's
duties and responsibilities. The trustee shall account for all monies derived from the divestiture and all expenses
incurred. After approval by the Commission and, in the case of a court-appointed trustee, by the court, of the account
of the trustee, including fees for his or her services, all remaining monies shall be paid at the direction of Respondents,
and the trustee's power shall be terminated. The trustee's compensation shall be based at least in significant part
on a commission arrangement contingent on the trustee's divesting the Griffin and Esquire assets. 

7. Respondents shall indemnify the trustee and hold the trustee harmless against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities,
or expenses arising out of, or in connection with, the performance of the trustee's duties, including all reasonable
fees of counsel and other expenses incurred in connection with the preparation for, or defense of any claim, whether
or not resulting in any liability, except to the extent that such liabilities, losses, damages, claims, or expenses
result from misfeasance, gross negligence, willful or wanton acts, or bad faith by the trustee. 
8. Within ten (10) days after appointment of the trustee, and subject to the prior approval of the Commission and, in
the case of a court-appointed trustee, of the court, Respondents shall execute a trust agreement that transfers to
the trustee all rights and powers necessary to permit the trustee to effect the divestiture required by this order.

9. If the trustee ceases to act or fails to act diligently, a substitute trustee shall be appointed in the same manner
as provided in Paragraph III A. of this order.

of the trustee issue such additional orders or directions as may be necessary or appropriate to accomplish the divestiture
required by this order.

11. The trustee shall report in writing to Respondents and the Commission every sixty (60) days concerning the trustee's
efforts to accomplish divestiture.

Analysis to Aid Public Comment on the Provisionally Accepted Consent Order



The Federal Trade Commission (``the Commission'') has accepted, for public comment, from Kiwi Brands Inc. (``Kiwi'')
and Sara Lee Corporation (``Sara Lee'') an agreement containing consent order. This agreement has been placed on
the public record for thirty days for reception of comments from interested persons. 

Comments received during this period will become part of the public record. After thirty days, the Commission will
again review the agreement and the comments received and will decide whether it should withdraw from the agreement
or make final the agreement's order. 

The Commission's investigation of this matter concerns Sara Lee's and Kiwi's 1987 acquisition of the ``Esquire''
brand of chemical shoe care products and related assets from Knomark, Inc., then a subsidiary of Papercraft Corporation,
and Sara Lee's and Kiwi's 1991 acquisition of the ``Griffin'' brand of chemical shoe care products and related assets
from Reckitt & Colman. 

The agreement containing consent order would, if finally accepted by the Commission, settle charges alleged in the
Commission's complaint that the acquisitions substantially lessened competition in the sale in the United States
of chemical shoe care products used in the maintenance, cleaning, and protection of shoes, through grocery stores,
drug stores, and mass merchandisers, sometimes referred to as the mass market channel, and that Sara Lee undertook
the acquisitions with the intention and effect of restraining, lessening, or eliminating competition, or acquiring
or maintaining market power in the same market. The Commission's complaint further alleges that the acquisitions
had and will have anticompetitive effects and that, in making the acquisitions, Sara Lee and Kiwi violated Section
7 of the Clayton Act and Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act. 

The order accepted for public comment contains provisions that would require that Sara Lee and Kiwi divest the ``Esquire''
and ``Griffin'' brand names and related assets to Hickory Industries, Inc., within one month of the date the order
becomes final. If the transaction with Hickory Industries, Inc., is not consummated within one month of the date the
order becomes final, then the order would require Sara Lee and Kiwi to divest the Esquire and Griffin assets to an acquirer
that receives the prior approval of the Commission and in a manner approved by the Commission within twelve months
of the date the order becomes final. The purpose of the divestiture is to assure the continuing use of the Esquire and
Griffin assets in an ongoing, independent, viable operation engaged in the sale of chemical shoe care products in
the United States, and to remedy the lessening of competition resulting from each of the acquisitions. 

If Sara Lee and Kiwi do not divest the Esquire and Griffin assets within the time periods described above, the Commission
would be entitled to appoint a trustee to effect the divestiture of the Esquire and Griffin assets to an acquirer or
acquirers approved by the Commission and in a manner approved by the Commission. 

For a period of ten years from the date the order becomes final, the order would also prohibit Kiwi and Sara Lee from acquiring,
without prior Commission approval, stock in or assets of an entity engaged in the manufacture of chemical shoe care
products in the United States, or the distribution or sale of chemical shoe care products through the mass market in
the United States. Acquisitions, for investment purposes only, of less than 1 percent of the outstanding stock of
a publicly-traded company would be exempt from the prior approval provision. Acquisitions of certain assets valued
at less than $100,000 would also be exempt from the prior approval provision. 

For acquisitions of stock in or assets of an entity engaged in the manufacture, distribution, or sale of chemical shoe
care products in the United States by Sara Lee or Kiwi for which prior approval would not otherwise be required by the
order, the order would require that Sara Lee and Kiwi give notice to the Commission before consummating the acquisition.
Acquisitions, for investment purposes only, of less than 1 percent of the outstanding stock of a publicly-traded
company would be exempt from the prior notice provision, in addition to being exempt from the prior approval provision.


The purpose of this analysis is to invite public comment concerning the consent order and any other aspect of the acquisition.
This analysis is not intended to constitute an official interpretation of the agreement and order or to modify its
terms in any way.

Announcement of Cooperative Agreement to the Association of State and Territorial Chronic Disease Program Directors




Summary 



The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announces the availability of fiscal year (FY) 1994 funds for
a sole source cooperative agreement with the Association of State and Territorial Chronic Disease Program Directors
(ASTCDPD) to provide State and national leadership to develop programs for the control and prevention of chronic
disease and to prevent the development of behaviors that contribute to the development of chronic disease. Approximately
$200,000 is available in FY 1994 to fund this award. It is expected that the award will begin on or about September 30,
1994, and will be for a 12-month budget period within a project period of up to 5 years. This funding estimate may vary
and is subject to change. Continuation awards within the project period will be made on the basis of satisfactory progress
and availability of funds. 

The purpose of this cooperative agreement is to assist ASTCDPD to periodically determine the status of State and local
chronic disease programs and provide appropriate professional expertise to implement informational and programmatic
activities to enhance the delivery of comprehensive chronic disease prevention and control services. 

The CDC will collaborate in designing survey techniques, analyzing data, and developing informational, educational,
and programmatic approaches to enhance national, State, and local comprehensive chronic disease programming;
designing profiles of ASTCDPD membership and organizational resources available to assist health care agencies
and organizations; developing communications systems; and providing scientific and operational updates in the
areas of categorical and comprehensive chronic disease prevention and control.

The mission of ASTCDPD is to provide State and national leadership to develop programs for the control and prevention
of chronic disease conditions and to prevent the development of behaviors that contribute to the development of chronic
disease conditions. ASTCDPD is uniquely capable of analyzing, advising, and fulfilling liaison responsibilities
for comprehensive chronic disease prevention and control activities among such broad-based specialties as Health
Education/Risk Reduction, Diabetes, Physical Activity and Fitness, Heart Disease and Stroke, Cancer, Nutrition,
and Tobacco. ASTCDPD has served as a policy development and capacity-building organization in public health matters
since 1988 and has as one of its major objectives the sharing of information within and between State health departments.


In collaboration with other national organizations, ASTCDPD accomplishes its mission by disseminating information
on chronic disease program needs and services, recommending and advocating improved policies and programs. ASTCDPD
also provides consultation and guidance to State programs in the establishment of statewide systems of coordinated,
community-based prevention and individual care for persons with chronic or disabling conditions, and for persons
with limited access to services. All of these activities are accomplished through cooperation and collaboration
with national, State, and local partners in the public and private sectors. 

Although other organizations may possess some of these abilities and/or perform some of these roles, no other organization
has ASTCDPD's unique characteristics. ASTCDPD is comprised of State chronic disease program directors, who are
necessary to effectively carry out the activities entailed in this program.

<DOCTITLE>Announcement of Cooperative Agreement to the State of North Carolina Department of Environment, Health, and Natural
Resources </DOCTITLE>


Summary: 

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announces the availability of fiscal year (FY) 1994 funds for
a cooperative agreement program for Diabetes Intervention: Reaching and Educating Communities Together (Project
DIRECT) with the State of North Carolina Department of Environment, Health, and Natural Resources (DEHNR) to further
develop and carryout multi-level, community-based interventions to reduce the burden of diabetes and its complications
in an African-American community. 


Project DIRECT is a multiyear demonstration project of the Division of Diabetes Translation (DDT), National Center
for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion (NCCDPHP), CDC, incorporating the principal translation functions
of the division of: (1) Defining the burden of diabetes, (2) developing innovative approaches to the prevention and
control of diabetes, (3) implementing these approaches through the State-based diabetes control programs, and
(4) coordinating national, State, and local resources for improved diabetes care. 
Approximately $650,000 is available in FY 1994 to fund this program. This funding is to support administrative start-up
costs, to include staffing and awarding competitive subcontracts with community institutions and organizations
conducting specific work related to the execution of the intervention plan. Operational funding for intervention
and evaluation is expected to increase in years 02 through 05. 
It is expected that the award will begin on or about September 30, 1994, and will be made for a 12-month budget period
within a project period of up to 5 years. This funding estimate may vary and is subject to change. 
The purpose of Project DIRECT is to: (1) Improve the health-related quality of life of an African-American community
by reducing the burden of diabetes and its complications through a multilevel, community-based intervention(s),
and (2) develop, carry out, and evaluate strategies that will be incorporated into State-based diabetes control
programs nationwide. The research design of the project is to conduct a baseline population survey of a predominantly
urban and suburban African-American community, implement targeted interventions for at least 5 years, monitor
a longitudinal cohort of persons with diabetes, and conduct a follow-up survey at the end of the intervention phase
to detect and document community level changes. There will also be a comparison community that will be surveyed at
baseline and at follow-up. This multilevel community intervention will be conducted by a consortium of public and
private agencies and organizations with management and leadership provided by the official State health department.

The CDC will assist in the design of interventions and evaluation protocols used in conducting and evaluating the
project, provide technical assistance in the design of demonstration protocols, provide programmatic consultation
and guidance in support of the project, coordinate with DEHNR in sharing and distributing information, data, and
successful strategies and interventions to States and other appropriate organizations, agencies, and institutions.
CDC will also provide DIRECT Intervention Plan guidelines and assist in the development of a plan for Diabetes Care,
Outreach, and Health Promotion interventions. 
The Public Health Service (PHS) is committed to achieving the health promotion and disease prevention objectives
of ``Healthy People 2000,'' a PHS-led national activity to reduce morbidity and mortality and improve the quality
of life. This announcement is related to the priority area of Diabetes and Chronic Disabling Conditions, with particular
attention to populations at disproportionate risk of developing diabetes, including minorities and the elderly.

DEHNR and North Carolina are uniquely situated to conduct this project for the following reasons: 
A. In 1990, following an open competition, a contract for the pilot phase of Project DIRECT was awarded to a research
institution in North Carolina. Developmental activities associated with Project DIRECT have been conducted in
Wake County, North Carolina. Considerable community organization and development have occurred to ensure community
support and involvement in Project DIRECT. A community advisory board of over 30 local representatives have been
actively involved in the project since March 1992. Regular coverage through all media channels that serve this community
has occurred and widespread name recognition of the project has been achieved in this community. 
B. A survey of over 900 randomly sampled households in Wake County, North Carolina, is complete, and over 250 extensive
medical examinations were performed on a subsample of the household respondents. Response rates exceeded 80%, indicating
that expanded survey work is feasible in this community. There is no other community in the United States for which
this type of data exists. Replication of work completed to date in another community could only be achieved at considerable
cost to the government. 
C. The data gathered through the household and medical examinations, along with information from a community resource
analysis for Wake County, provides the database from which a comprehensive, multilevel community intervention
plan has been developed. The intervention strategies match closely with the health care and educational needs of
this community and the resources available to support the interventions in Wake County. 
D. CDC's traditional constituency is State health departments, and the intervention components of Project DIRECT
are intended to serve as model programs for eventual implementation by other official State health departments.
This cooperative agreement with DEHNR allows CDC to evaluate the effectiveness of Project DIRECT in a State health
department, and to identify the additional liaisons that will be required to ensure the viability of diabetes control
programs in State health departments in a reformed health system. DEHNR has expertise, administrative and technical
capacity, and public health orientation represented in State health departments nationally. 
E. DEHNR has collaborated successfully with universities and research institutions in the State. These are important
liaisons for the successful implementation of Project DIRECT. DEHNR presently has established contractual relationships
with these academic institutions: 
 East Carolina University to develop and teach an introductory course in the etiology and management of diabetes
mellitus.

Section 8 Housing Assistance Payments Program_Fair Market Rent (FMR) Schedules for Use in the Rental Certificate
Program, Loan Management and Property Disposition Programs, Moderate Rehabilitation Program and Rental Voucher
Program



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Office of the Secretary, HUD.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice to extend FMR public comment period.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This Notice advises the public that HUD is extending the public comment period for the FMRs until October 14, 1994 in
order to give PHAs in FMR areas with small rental housing inventories the opportunity to use the new survey guide HUD
has recently developed.


HUD is also announcing in this Notice that there will be two final FMR publications again this year. The first publication
will make the proposed FMRs for all areas effective on October 1, 1994. The second publication, to be issued late in
the year, will announce revised final FMRs for the areas for which HUD has made a determination that the rental housing
surveys submitted provided a sufficient basis for such revision.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Section 8(c)(1) of the United States Housing Act of 1937 requires the Secretary to publish FMRs periodically, but
not less frequently than annually, to be effective on October 1 of each year. On June 23, 1994, HUD published the proposed
Fiscal Year (FY) 1995 FMRs with a 60-day public comment period to August 22, 1994.


With this Notice, HUD is extending the public comment period until October 14, 1994 to ensure that PHAs and other interested
parties who wish to use the new rental housing survey guide will have sufficient time to do so.
The guide is intended for PHAs administering Section 8 programs in small FMR areas, for whom the formal Random Digit
Dialing (RDD) methodology would not be cost effective. It enables a PHA to carry out a rental housing survey by itself,
for a fraction of the cost of a formal RDD. The guide provides instruction on how to choose the best, most cost-effective
means of surveying the rental housing stock in the FMR area. It describes survey options and provides specific advice
and guidelines for conducting valid surveys and submitting comments in accordance with statistical requirements.
The simplified methods presented in this guide offer the least costly means of obtaining valid FMR estimates for public
housing agencies that manage under 500 Section 8 units in FMR areas with under 5,000 total rental units. Even the smallest
PHAs might wish to review this guide for its suggestions on how to develop representative samples and conduct statistically
acceptable surveys.
HUD is not mandating use of the new guide for PHAs in small FMR areas or use of the RDD method for larger areas. However,
it is strongly urged that commenters consider these approaches because they are much more likely to result in an end
product that is acceptable to HUD.
Copies of the new survey guide are available from HUD USER, at (800) 245-2691. Questions concerning the guide
may be directed to HUD field office economists.

 Notice of Correction to the Notice of Funding Availability (NOFA) for Fiscal Year (FY) 1994.

 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 On April 1, 1994, HUD published a NOFA that announced FY 1994 funding of $231,978,631 under the Public and Indian Housing
Drug Elimination Program (PHDEP) for use in eliminating drug-related crime. The purpose of this notice is to make
corrections to the section specifying eligible applicants for one of the activities under the NOFA and to the number

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 A Notice of Funding Availability (NOFA) announcing HUD's FY 1994 funding of $231,978,631 under the Public and Indian
Housing Drug Elimination Program (PHDEP) was published on April 1, 1994 (59 FR 15574). Paragraph I.(c)(1)(ii) of
the NOFA, under the heading 

Employment of Housing Authority Police

, which listed housing authorities eligible to apply because they have their own housing authority (HA) police department,
omitted from the list the HA of the City of Waterbury, Waterbury, CT, and the Buffalo HA, Buffalo, NY, and incorrectly
included the Newark Housing Authority, Newark, NJ. In addition, the listing for the New York City Department of Housing
Preservation and Development, NYC, NY, should have read: New York City Public Housing Authority, NYC, NY. This notice
corrects the April 1, 1994 PHDEP NOFA by republishing the entire list of eligible applicants under paragraph I.(c)(1)(ii)
to add the two omitted HAs to the list, to delete the one incorrectly listed, and to amend the listing for the New York
City Public Housing Authority. 


This notice also corrects the number of points that will be awarded under the first selection criterion of the NOFA.
Specifically, five points are added to the subcriteria at sections I.(d)(1) (v) and (vi), raising each to 15 points,
and raising the total number of points to 130.

HA of the City of Waterbury, Waterbury, CT 
HA of the City of Oakland, Oakland, CA

New York City Public HA, NYC, NY 
Philadelphia HA, Philadelphia, PA



 


2. On page 15582, the first full paragraph in the first column, which is a part of paragraph I.(d), is revised to read
as follows: 
The number of points that an application receives will depend on the extent to which the application is responsive
to the information requested in the selection criteria. An application 

must 

receive a score of at least 80 points out of the maximum of 130 points that may be awarded under this competition to be
eligible for funding. 
3. On page 15583, paragraph I.(1)(d)(1)(v), which appears in the first column, is revised to read as follows: 
(v) In awarding points, HUD will evaluate and assign points between zero (0) and fifteen (15) according to the per capita
incidence of robbery and homicide in their community relative to their per capita incidence on a nationwide basis.
Data on robbery and homicide incidence were chosen because of the demonstrated relationship of a substantial portion
of these crimes with drug abuse. The community data will be taken from the Uniform Crime Reports (UCRs) of the U. S. Department
of Justice (FBI crime data) and will be at the city level, when available, or at the county level. The crime incidence
data and the point values will be computed by HUD. (Maximum Points: 15) 

 
4. On page 15583, paragraph I.(1)(d)(1)(vi), which appears in the first column, is revised to read as follows: 
(vi) In awarding points, HUD will evaluate and assign points between zero (0) and fifteen (15) according to the per
capita incidence of drug arrests. In instances where the Department of Justice records do not contain community submission
data, points will be assigned based on state metropolitan and nonmetropolitan averages relevant to such areas. (Maximum
Points: 15)

ACTION: 

Notice of availability.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This notice advises the public that the draft Environmental Assessment (EA) for the issuance of a Special Use Permit
to the Government of Guam for the proposed Ritidian Point Territorial Park on the Guam National Wildlife Refuge, Dededo,
Guam is available for public review.




WRITTEN COMMENTS INFORMATION: 

Interested agencies, organizations, and individuals are encouraged to provide written comments to the Fish and
Wildlife Service within 30 days after publication of this Notice. Address comments to the Field Supervisor as shown
below:



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Field Supervisor, Jerry Leinecke, Hawaiian and Pacific Islands NWR Complex, is the primary author of this document.
The Fish and Wildlife Service, Department of the Interior, has prepared a draft EA on its proposal to issue a Special
Use Permit to the Government of Guam for the proposed Ritidian Point Territorial Park within the Guam National Wildlife
Refuge.




The Government of Guam proposes to establish and operate the Ritidian Point Territorial Park (RPTP) within an approximate
20.24 ha (50 acres) site of the Ritidian Point Unit of the Guam National Wildlife Refuge (NWR). The RPTP would be operated
by the Guam Department of Parks and Recreation with the biological support of the Guam Department of Agriculture,
Division of Aquatic and Wildlife Resources, in coordination with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service). The
proposed RPTP would provide the public with natural history educational and recreational opportunities within
the setting of the Ritidian Point Unit of the Guam NWR. The proposed RPTP would be managed to be compatible with the purposes
for which the Guam NWR was established and in accordance with a Special Use Permit issued by the Service to the Government
of Guam for the use of the approximate 20.24 ha site within the Ritidian Point Unit.

The proposed action is anticipated to have only minimal direct, indirect, and cumulative effects on the human environment.
The establishment, operation and maintenance of the park will occur on a site that has been previously disturbed by
construction of fields, pavilions, shelters and Navy buildings and by the past use of the area for recreational purposes
by the Navy.

The major alternatives under consideration that were analyzed and evaluated during planning are: (A) PREFERRED
ALTERNATIVE, establishment of the proposed RPTP on an approximate 20.24 ha (50 acre) site within the Ritidian Point
Unit by the Guam Department of Parks and Recreation; (Alternative 2) establishment of a Territorial Park at Tarague
Basin, South Finegayan, Falcona Beach, or the Anao Conservation Area at the present time; (Alternative 3) establishment
of a public use area at the Ritidian Point Unit by the Service; (Alternative 4) which is the No Action alternative.

Staffs of the Government of Guam, Department of Parks and Recreation and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service jointly
cooperated to plan, prepare and evaluate the proposals and prepare this draft EA. Detailed information concerning
consultation and coordination is contained in Section VII of the draft EA.

All agencies and individuals are urged to provide comments and suggestions for improving this EA as soon as possible.
All comments received during the designated comment period will be considered in preparation of the final EA for this
proposed action.

<DOCTITLE>Outer Continental Shelf, Western Gulf of Mexico; Notice of Leasing Systems, Sale 150</DOCTITLE>



Section 8(a)(8) (43 U.S.C. 1337(a)(8)) of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (OCSLA) requires that, at least 30
days before any lease sale, a Notice be submitted to the Congress and published in the 

Federal Register

: 

1. identifying the bidding systems to be used and the reasons for such use; and

2. designating the tracts to be offered under each bidding system and the reasons for such designation.

This Notice is published pursuant to these requirements.

1. 

Bidding systems to be used. 

In the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) Sale 150, blocks will be offered under the following two bidding systems as authorized
by section 8(a)(1) (43 U.S.C. 1337(a)(1)): (a) bonus bidding with a fixed 162/3-percent royalty on all unleased blocks
in less than 400 meters of water; and (b) bonus bidding with a fixed 121/2-percent royalty on all remaining unleased
blocks.

a. 

Bonus Bidding with a 162/3-Percent Royalty. 

This system is authorized by section (8)(a)(1)(A) of the OCSLA. This system has been used extensively since the passage
of the OCSLA in 1953 and imposes greater risks on the lessee than systems with higher contingency payments but may yield
more rewards if a commercial field is discovered. The relatively high front-end bonus payments may encourage rapid
exploration.

b. 

Bonus Bidding with a 121/2-Percent Royalty. 

This system is authorized by section (8)(a)(1)(A) of the OCSLA. It has been chosen for certain deeper water blocks
proposed for the Western Gulf of Mexico (Sale 150) because these blocks are expected to require substantially higher
exploration, development, and production costs, as well as longer times before initial production, in comparison
to shallow-water blocks. Department of the Interior analyses indicate that the minimum economically developable
discovery on a block in such high-cost areas under a 121/2-percent royalty system would be less than for the same blocks
under a 162/3-percent royalty system. As a result, more blocks may be explored and developed. In addition, the lower
royalty rate system is expected to encourage more rapid production and higher economic profits. It is not anticipated,
however, that the larger cash bonus bid associated with a lower royalty rate will significantly reduce competition,
since the higher costs for exploration and development are the primary constraints to competition.

2. 

Designation of Blocks. 

The selection of blocks to be offered under the two systems was based on the following factors:

a. Lease terms on adjacent, previously leased blocks were considered to enhance orderly development of each field.

b. Blocks in deep water were selected for the 121/2-percent royalty system based on the favorable performance of this
system in these high-cost areas as evidenced in our analyses.

The specific blocks to be offered under each system are shown on Map 2 entitled ``Western Gulf of Mexico Lease Sale 150_Final
Bidding Systems and Bidding Units.'' This map is available from the Minerals Management Service, Gulf of Mexico Region,
1201 Elmwood Park Boulevard, New Orleans, Louisiana 70123-2394.

13. 

Lease Terms and Stipulations. 

(a) Leases resulting from this sale will have initial terms as shown on the Stipulations, Lease Terms, and Bidding
Systems map applicable to this Notice and will be issued on Form MMS-2005 (March 1986). Copies of the map and lease
form are available from the Gulf of Mexico regional office (see paragraph 14(a)). 

(b) The applicability of the stipulations which follow is as shown on the aforementioned map and as supplemented by
references in this Notice. 



Stipulation No. 1_Protection of Archaeological Resources



(This stipulation will apply to all blocks offered for lease in this sale. Bidders should refer also to paragraph 14(g)
of this Notice for specific survey requirements. See also paragraph 14(i).) 

(a) ``Archaeological resource'' means any prehistoric or historic district, site, building, structure, or object
(including shipwrecks); such term includes artifacts, records, and remains which are related to such a district,
site, building, structure, 
or object (16 U.S.C. 470w(5)). ``Operations'' means any drilling, mining, or construction or placement of any structure
for exploration, development, or production of the lease. 

(b) If the Regional Director (RD) believes an archaeological resource may exist in the lease area, the RD will notify
the lessee in writing. The lessee shall then comply with subparagraphs (1) through (3). 


(1) Prior to commencing any operations, the lessee shall prepare a report, as specified by the RD, to determine the
potential existence of any archaeological resource that may be affected by operations. The report, prepared by an
archaeologist and a geophysicist, shall be based on an assessment of data from remote-sensing surveys and of other
pertinent archaeological and environmental information. The lessee shall submit this report to the RD for review.


(2) If the evidence suggests that an archaeological resource may be present, the lessee shall either: 

(i) Locate the site of any operation so as not to adversely 
affect the area where the archaeological resource may be, or 

(ii) Establish to the satisfaction of the RD that an archaeological resource does not exist or will not be adversely
affected by operations. This shall be done by further 
archaeological investigation, conducted by an archaeologist and a geophysicist, using survey equipment and techniques
deemed necessary by the RD. A report on the investigation shall be submitted to the RD for review. 

(3) If the RD determines that an archaeological resource is likely to be present in the lease area and may be adversely
affected by operations, the RD will notify the lessee immediately. The lessee shall take no action that may adversely
affect the archaeological resource until the RD has told the lessee how to protect it. 

(c) If the lessee discovers any archaeological resource while conducting operations on the lease area, the lessee
shall report the discovery immediately to the RD. The lessee shall make every reasonable effort to preserve the archaeological
resource until the RD has told the lessee how to protect it.

subcontractors, or any of their officers, agents, or employees, being conducted as a part of, or in connection with,
the programs and activities of the command headquarters listed in the table below. 
Notwithstanding any limitation of the lessee's liability in section 14 of the lease, the lessee assumes this risk
whether such injury or damage is caused in whole or in part by any act or omission, regardless of negligence or fault,
of the United States, its contractors or subcontractors, or any of its officers, agents, or employees. The lessee
further agrees to indemnify and save harmless the United States against all claims for loss, damage, or injury sustained
by the lessee; and to indemnify and save harmless the United States against all claims for loss, damage, or injury sustained
by the agents, employees, or invitees of the lessee, its agents, or any independent 
contractors or subcontractors doing business with the lessee in connection with the programs and activities of the
appropriate military installation, whether the same be caused in whole or in part by the negligence or fault of the

(e) 

Affirmative Action. 

Revision of the Department of Labor regulations on affirmative action requirements for Government contractors
(including lessees) has been deferred, pending review of those regulations (see 

Federal Register

 of August 25, 1981, at 46 FR 42865 and 42968). Should changes become effective at any time before the issuance of leases
resulting from this sale, section 18 of the lease form (Form MMS-2005, March 1986) would be deleted from leases
resulting from this sale. In addition, existing stocks of the affirmative action forms described in paragraph 5 of
this Notice contain language that would be superseded by the revised regulations at 41 CFR 60-1.5(a)(1) and
60-1.7(a)(1). Submission of Form MMS-2032 (June 1985) and Form MMS-2033 (June 1985) will not invalidate
an otherwise acceptable bid, and the revised regulations' requirements will be deemed to be part of the existing affirmative
action forms. 

(f) 

Ordnance Disposal Areas. 

Bidders are cautioned as to the existence of two inactive ordnance disposal areas in the Corpus Christi and East Breaks
areas, shown on the map described in paragraph 13(a). These areas were used to dispose of ordnance of unknown composition
and quantity. These areas have not been used since about 1970. Water depths in the Corpus Christi area range from approximately
600 to 900 meters. Water depths in the East Breaks area range from approximately 300 to 700 meters. Bottom sediments
in both areas are generally soft, consisting of silty clays. Exploration and development activities in these areas
require precautions commensurate with the potential 
hazards. 

(g) 

Archaeological Resources. 

Bidders are advised of the Notice to Lessees (NTL) affecting the historic shipwreck requirements published December
20, 1991, in the 

Federal Register

 pages 66076-66082 with an effective date of February 17, 1992. This NTL details the survey methodology, including
a more intensive survey with line spacing 50 meters apart, and report writing requirements. A Letter to Lessees (LTL)
of November 30, 1990, lists those blocks identified as having a high probability for encountering historic shipwrecks.
Copies of the NTL and LTL are available from the MMS Public Information Unit. See paragraph 14(a). 

(h) 

Proposed Rigs To Reefs. 

Bidders are advised that there are OCS artificial reef sites and planning sites for the Gulf of Mexico. These are generally
located in water depths of less than 200 meters. While all existing and proposed sites require a permit from the U.S.
Army Corps of Engineers, this ``Rigs to Reefs'' program is implemented through State sponsorship through the following
State Coordinators:

 




Alabama: 

Mr. Walter M. Tatum (205) 968-7578. 


Louisiana: 

Mr. Rick Kasprzac (504) 765-2375. 


Mississippi: 

Mr. Mike Buchanan (601) 385-5868. 


Texas: 

Ms. Jan Coulbertson (512) 389-4863.

 


For more information on artificial reef sites, prospective bidders should contact the above listed State Artificial
Reef Coordinator for their areas of interest. 

(i) 

Archaeological Surveys and Reports. 

Bidders are advised that a Proposed Rule has been published in the 

Federal Register

 dated Tuesday, October 12, 1993, which proposes to grant specific authority to each MMS Regional Director to require
archaeological surveys and reports (under 30 CFR 250.26). This proposed rule specifically states the authority
of MMS and conditions for requiring lessees or operators to conduct archaeological resource surveys and submit the
reports prior to exploration, development and production, or installation of pipelines. This rule, when adopted,
may apply to all blocks leased in this sale.

may be recognized, preserved, promoted, interpreted, and made available for the benefit of the public.'' Title II,
Sec. 201 of Pub. L. 100-698 provides that the Secretary of the Interior, with the concurrence of the agency having
jurisdiction over such roads, shall designate, by publication in the 

Federal Register

, a vehicular tour route along existing public roads linking historic, cultural, natural, scenic and recreational
sites in southwestern Pennsylvania. Following a period of planning by the Denver Service Center of the National Park
Service with substantial input from the public and the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (herein referred
to as ``PennDOT''), the Secretary has designated, with the concurrence of PennDOT, the Southwestern Pennsylvania
Industrial Heritage Route (herein referred to as the ``Heritage Route''). The Heritage Route encompasses a distance
of approximately 500 miles using existing roads through Bedford, Blair, Cambria, Fayette, Fulton, Huntingdon,
Indiana, Somerset and Westmoreland Counties. The Secretary, in accordance with Pub. L. 100-698, Sec. 201.(a),
and with concurrence of PennDOT and local entities having jurisdiction over the designated roads, shall erect signs
and informational devices displaying the Heritage Route marker, also known as the ``Path of Progress'', along the
designated roads. A list of the designated roads is published in its entirety below. A complete description and map
of the Heritage Route system as well as a description of the ``Path of Progress'' markers is available through the Commission.

Sebacic Acid From the People's Republic of China 



Determination 



On the basis of the record

1

 developed in the subject investigation, the Commission determines,

2

 pursuant to section 735(b) of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C.  1673d(b)) (the Act), that an industry in the United
States is threatened with material injury

3

 by reason of imports from the People's Republic of China of sebacic acid, provided for in subheading 2917.13.00 of
the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States, that have been found by the Department of Commerce to be sold in
the United States at less than fair value (LTFV). 







Background



The Commission instituted this investigation effective January 4, 1994, following a preliminary determination
by the Department of Commerce that imports of sebacic acid from the People's Republic of China were being sold at LTFV
within the meaning of section 733(b) of the Act (19 U.S.C.  1673b(b)). Notice of the institution of the Commission's
investigation and of a public hearing to be held in connection therewith was given by posting copies of the notice in
the Office of the Secretary, U.S. International Trade Commission, Washington, DC, and by publishing the notice in
the 

Federal Register

 of February 9, 1994 (59 F.R. 6044). The hearing was held in Washington, DC, on May 24, 1994, and all persons who requested
the opportunity were permitted to appear in person or by counsel. 

The Commission transmitted its determination in this investigation to the Secretary of Commerce on July 5, 1994.
The views of the Commission are contained in USITC Publication 2793 (July 1994), entitled Sebacic Acid from the People's
Republic of China: Investigation No. 731-TA-653 (Final). 




By order of the Commission.

<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 U.S. International Trade Commission.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of Remand Determination.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Commission hereby gives notice of a final court decision affirming its final negative determinations, made pursuant
to court remand, in the above-identified antidumping duty investigations.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On September 19, 1990, the Commission published its determinations that an industry of the United States was materially
injured by reason of imports of manmade fiber (``MMF'') sweaters from Hong Kong, Korea, and Taiwan. 55 Fed. Reg. 38588
(Sept. 19, 1990); 

Sweaters Wholly or in Chief Weight of Manmade Fibers from Hong Kong, the Republic of Korea, and Taiwan,

 Invs. Nos. 731-TA-448-450 (Final), USITC Pub. 2312 (Sept. 1992). The Hong Kong, Korean and Taiwanese
producers of the subject MMF sweaters sought review of those final determinations in the Court of International Trade
(CIT). 



On July 28, 1992, the CIT issued an Order, finding that the Commission's final injury determinations were unsupported
by substantial evidence and otherwise not in accordance with law, and remanding the determinations to the Commission
for further proceedings. 

Chung Ling Co. v. United States,

 805 F. Supp. 45 (CIT 1992). On November 23, 1992, the Commission submitted its remand determinations to the CIT, finding
on remand that an industry in the United States was not materially injured or threatened with material injury by reason
of imports of the subject MMF sweaters, which the Department of Commerce (``Commerce'') had determined are sold at
less than fair value. 

Sweaters Wholly or in Chief Weight of Manmade Fibers from Hong Kong, the Republic of Korea, and Taiwan,

 Invs. Nos. 731-TA-448-450 (Final) (Remand), USITC Pub. 2577 (Nov. 1992). 

The trade association representing the domestic sweaters producers, the National Knitwear and Sportswear Association
(``NKSA'') challenged the remand determinations before the CIT. On August 11, 1993, the CIT issued an order finding
that the Commission's remand determinations fell within the scope of the remand order, and were supported by substantial
evidence and otherwise in accordance with law. Accordingly, the CIT sustained the Commission's remand determinations.


Chung Ling Co. v. United States,

 829 F. Supp. 1353 (CIT 1993). 

Notice of the CIT's decision was published by Commerce, pursuant to 19 U.S.C. 1516a(c)(1), on November 12, 1993. 58
Fed. Reg. 59987 (Nov. 12, 1992). In accordance with 

Timken Co. v. United States,

 893 F.2d 337 (Fed. Cir. 1990), Commerce stated that it would continue the suspension of liquidation of the subject
merchandise. Commerce's notice also indicated that, if the CIT decision was affirmed on appeal, the antidumping
duty orders would be revoked. 

Thereafter, NKSA appealed the CIT's judgment to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. On June
15, 1994, the Court of Appeals affirmed, without opinion, the CIT's final judgment upholding the Commission's negative
remand determinations. 

Chung Ling Co. v. USITC,

 No. 94-1028 (Fed. Cir. June 15, 1994). On July 6, 1994, the Court of Appeals issued its mandate. The judicial proceedings
having ended and the final court decision having been issued, the Commission now, pursuant to 19 U.S.C. 1516a(e),
publishes notice of the final court decision affirming its negative remand determinations. 




By order of the Commission.

<DOCTITLE>Proposed Modification of Final Judgment</DOCTITLE>



Notice is hereby given that defendant Broadcast Music, Inc. (``BMI'') has filed with the United States District Court
for the Southern District of New York a motion to modify the Final Judgment in 

United States v. Broadcast Music, Inc. et al., 

64 Civ. 3787, and the Department of Justice (``Department''), in a stipulation also filed with the Court, has consented
to modification of the Final Judgment, but has reserved the right to withdraw its consent based on public comments
or for other reasons. The Complaint in this case (filed on December 10, 1964) alleged that BMI and 517 broadcasters
who owned its voting stock constituted a combination to restrain and monopolize, and an attempt to monopolize, the
business of acquiring and licensing to broadcasters copyrighted music rights, in violation of Sections 1 and 2 of
the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. 1 and 2.

The Final Judgment (entered on December 29, 1966) provides, among other things, that any licenses obtained by BMI
from composers for music performance rights must be non-exclusive, that BMI must offer through-to-the-viewer and
per-program licenses to radio and television networks and cable programming services, and that BMI's license rates
and terms must be non-discriminatory. Unlike the similar decree in 

U.S. v. ASCAP 

Civ. No. 13-95 (WCC), however, the BMI Judgment has no provision for court adjudication of license fees for music
performing rights where BMI and a potential licensee are unable to reach agreement.

The Department has filed with the Court a memorandum setting forth the reasons why it believes that modification of
the Final Judgment to provide a rate court for the adjudication of disputed license fees would be in the public interest.
Copies of the Complaint, the Final Judgment, the defendant's motion papers, the Stipulation containing the Government's
tentative consent, the Department's memorandum, and all further papers filed with the Court in connection with this
motion will be available for inspection at Room 3235, Antitrust Division, Department of Justice, 10th Street and
Pennsylvania Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20530 (Telephone: (202) 514-2481), and at the Office of the Clerk
of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, Foley Square, New York, New York 10007. Copies
of any of these materials may be obtained from the Antitrust Division upon request and payment of the copying fee set
by Department regulations.

Interested persons may submit comments to the Department regarding the proposed modification of the Final Judgment.
Such comments must be received within the sixty-day period established by court order, and will be filed with the Court
by the Department. Comments should be addressed to Gail Kursh, Chief, Professions and Intellectual Property Section,
Antitrust Division, Department of Justice, 555 Fourth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20001 (telephone: (202) 307-5799).

<DOCTITLE>United States and State of Florida v. Morton Plant Health System, Inc. and Trustees of Mease Hospital, Inc., No. 94-748-CIV-T-23E
(M.D. Fla., Filed May 5, 1994)</DOCTITLE>



Notice is hereby given pursuant to the Antitrust Procedures and Penalties Act, 15 U.S.C. 16(b)-(h), that a proposed
Final Consent Judgment, Stipulation, and Competitive Impact Statement have been filed with the United States District
Court for the Middle District of Florida in the above-captioned case.

On May 5, 1994, the United States and State of Florida filed a complaint to block the proposed combination of the two
largest general acute care hospitals in North Pinellas County, Florida. Morton Plant Health System, Inc. (``MPHS'')
owns and operates Morton Plant Hospital (``Morton Plant'') in Clearwater, and Trustees of Mease Hospital, Inc. (``TMH'')
owns and operates the Mease hospitals in Dunedin and Safety Harbor (``Mease''). The Complaint alleges that the combination
of Morton Plant and Mease may substantially lessen competition in the provision of acute inpatient hospital services
in North Pinellas County, in violation of Section 7 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. 18.

The proposed Final Consent Judgment prohibits the consolidation of Morton Plant and Mease and requires that they
remain as independent, competing hospitals. It also, however, permits MPHS and TMH to form a partnership in which
they may jointly own and operate certain acute care and administrative services. The partnership would sell its services
at cost to each hospital, which would market and price all of its services_both those owned separately and those jointly
owned and operated through the partnership_independently and in competition with the other. The proposed Judgment
permits MPHS and TMH to achieve substantial efficiencies while preserving the vigorous competition between them
that has restrained their prices to managed care and other health insurance plans.

Public comment is invited within the statutory 60-day period. Such comments will be published in the 

Federal Register

 and filed with the Court. Comments should be addressed to Gail Kursh, Chief, Professions and Intellectual Property
Section, U.S. Department of Justice, Antitrust Division, 555 4th Street, NW., Room 9903, Washington, DC 20001 (phone
202/307-5799).

and to Mease's officers, directors, trustees, administrators, agents, employees, successors and assigns and to
all other persons in active concert or participation with any of them who receive actual notice of this Final Consent
Judgment pursuant to F.R.C.P. 65(d).



IV



Prohibited Conduct



Morton Plant and Mease shall not consummate their agreement to consolidate as set forth in their Letter of Intent,
dated October 19, 1993, or any other agreement to merge, consolidate, or combine, except in accordance with the terms
of this Final Consent Judgment.



V



Bona Fide Partnership



Morton Plant and Mease may enter into a Partnership in which they consolidate and jointly operate certain patient
care services and administrative services under the following conditions:

(A) Morton Plant and Mease may agree to consolidate and jointly operate any Eligible Partnership Patient Care Services
and any Eligible Partnership Administrative Services.

(B) The Partnership may own and operate any Eligible Partnership Patient Care Service and any Eligible Partnership
Administrative Service and may provide such service to Morton Plant and Mease. The Partnership shall sell each service
to Morton Plant and Mease on the same terms and conditions in an amount equal to cost. The Partnership shall conduct
an annual cost accounting.

(C) Morton Plant and Mease may appoint members to a Partnership board, which individuals may be members of each hospital's
board. Executives at Morton Plant and Mease may also serve as executives of the Partnership and on the boards of their
respective hospitals and of the Partnership. The Partnership board will govern the services provided by the Partnership.
The Partnership board and its executives may not discuss Independent Services, managed care contracting for Morton
Plant or Mease, or the marketing or pricing of any services, including Eligible Partnership Patient Care Services
or Eligible Partnership Administrative Services, with the following exception: the Partnership may market and
price those services set out in Paragraph II(A)(10) as long as Morton Plant and Mease continue their present practice
of providing their patients and physicians with information on other providers of these services in the market. The
Partnership board may request Morton Plant and Mease to contribute capital to the Partnership, but each hospital
shall exercise its own independent judgment on how much capital to contribute.


(D) Morton Plant and Mease shall provide plaintiffs with written notification of their intent to consolidate and
jointly operate any additional or new services (such as pediatrics and neonatal level II services) through the Partnership
under the terms of this Final Consent Judgment. Morton Plant and Mease shall also provide any information reasonably
necessary for plaintiffs to assess the competitive impact of adding such services to the Partnership. Morton Plant
and Mease may consolidate and jointly operate the additional or new services unless either plaintiff provides a written
objection within 120 days of receiving the necessary information. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Morton Plant
and Mease may jointly operate through the Partnership any new service not currently provided by Morton Plant or Mease
by providing plaintiffs with at least 90-days' notice, so long as the new service is a specialized inpatient procedure
commonly recognized in the medical community as ``tertiary'' or higher, and is performed only by physician subspecialists
with specialized support staff and expensive equipment.

(E) Morton Plant may lend or grant Mease up to $21 million for Mease's planned expansion under terms preventing Morton
Plant from obtaining any control or leverage over Mease's management or operations.

(F) Morton Plant, Mease and the Partnership may become obligated parties, guarantors or co-makers on debt instruments
and the assets of Morton Plant, Mease and the Partnership may be pledged as security for such debt instruments so long
as all such obligations are approved separately by Morton Plant and Mease. Neither Morton Plant nor Mease shall unreasonably
withhold consent to, impose conditions on, or attempt to influence the use of funds obtained by the other hospital
through such financing for Independent Services. In the event that Morton Plant or Mease believes the other has unreasonably
withheld such consent, the matter shall be submitted to binding arbitration under the American Arbitration Association
Rules.

(G) Nothing in this Final Consent Judgment is intended to prevent Morton Plant, Mease and/or the Partnership from
participating in lawful integrated delivery networks such as accountable health partnerships, physician organizations
and physician networks of their medical staff; provided that participation decisions shall be made independently
by Morton Plant, Mease and the Partnership.

(H) In the event that federal or state legislation enacted subsequent to the entry of the Final Consent Judgment permits
conduct prohibited by this Judgment, Morton Plant and Mease may move for and plaintiffs will reasonably consider
an appropriate modification of the Final Consent Judgment. This provision in no way limits Morton Plant's or Mease's
right to seek any modification of this Final Consent Judgment.

(I) The Partnership shall establish adequate protections to keep information concerning pricing, managed care
contracts, negotiations with managed care plans, and marketing and planning of Morton Plant and Mease separate and
to insure that the information of one hospital is not transmitted to or received by the other hospital directly or indirectly.
Adequate protections shall include, at a minimum, confidentiality agreements for employees with access to such
information and protocols for preparation of separate reports for Morton Plant, Mease, and the Partnership.

(J) The Partnership may make any lawful acquisition of physician practices. However, in the event that a practice
is acquired that admits patients to either hospital for Independent Services, Morton Plant and Mease shall allow
each such physician to determine in his or her sole discretion to which hospital to admit such patients.



VI



Independent Activities



(A) Morton Plant and Mease shall continue as separate and competing corporate entities, with separate Boards of Trustees
and executive management, and shall separately own and operate their respective Independent Services. Marketing,
pricing, and managed care negotiating and contracting decisions shall remain Independent Services to be considered
only in each hospital board's respective meeting. Each board shall adhere to a separate agenda and will record such
meeting in separate minutes.

(B) Morton Plant and Mease shall each price and sell its services, both those owned and operated and operated separately
and those purchased from the Partnership, in active competition with each other. Morton Plant and Mease shall each
exercise its own independent judgment on how to market and price its patient care services and shall not discuss, communicate,
or exchange with each other or any other hospital information relating to the marketing, pricing, negotiating, or
contracting of any patient care services, including those purchased from the Partnership.

(C) Morton Plant or Mease shall be free to offer any patient care service or administrative service provided through
the Partnership independently and in competition with any other provider and may end its provision of any such service
through the Partnership.

(D) Morton Plant and Mease shall negotiate and contract independently with health care purchasers such as Managed
Care Plants. Morton Plant and Mease may contract with the same Managed Care Plan or any other health care purchaser
so long as they do so independently; provided, that Morton Plant and Mease may independently enter into similar but
separate contracts with the same Managed Care Plan.



VII



Compliance Program



Morton Plant and Mease shall maintain an antitrust compliance program, which shall include:

(A) Distributing within 60 days from the entry of this Final Consent Judgment, a copy of the Final Consent Judgment
and Competitive Impact Statement to all officers, directors, trustees and administrators;

(B) Distributing in a timely manner a copy of the Final Consent Judgment and Competitive Impact Statement to any person

Impact Statement have been distributed.

United States of America and State of Florida, Plaintiffs, v. Morton Plant Health System, Inc. and Trustees of Mease
Hospital, Inc., Defendants. Civ. No. 94-748-CIV-T-23E, Judge Steven D. Merryday, June 30,
1994.



Competitive Impact Statement



Pursuant to Section 2(b) of the Antitrust Procedures and Penalties Act, 15 U.S.C. 16 (b)-(h), the United States
submits this Competitive Impact Statement relating to the proposed Final Consent Judgment (or ``the Judgment'')
submitted for entry against Morton Plant Health System, Inc. (``MPHS'') and Trustees of Mease Hospital, Inc. (``TMH'')
in this civil antitrust proceeding.



I 

Nature and Purpose of the Proceeding



The United States of America and the State of Florida, acting under the direction of their respective Attorneys General,
filed this civil antitrust suit on May 5, 1994, alleging that the proposed combination of MPHS and TMH, owners of the
two largest general acute care hospitals in North Pinellas County, Florida, violates Section 7 of the Clayton Act,
15 U.S.C. 18.

MPHS owns and operates Morton Plant Hospital in Clearwater, Florida (``Morton Plant''), the largest general acute
care hospital in North Pinellas County. TMH owns and operates the Mease hospitals in Dunedin and Safety Harbor, Florida
(``Mease''), which together constitute the second-largest general acute care hospital in North Pinellas County.

The Verified Complaint alleges that the combination of these principal competitors under common ownership may substantially
lessen competition in the provision of acute inpatient hospital services in North Pinellas County and likely increase
prices for those services to health care consumers. These higher prices will be paid by health care purchasers, particularly
health insurance plans, employers, and unions and ultimately result in an increase in prices individual consumers
pay for health insurance coverage.

The prayer for relief seeks: (1) A judgment that the proposed consolidation of MPHS and TMH violates Section 7 of the
Clayton Act; (2) preliminary and permanent injunctions preventing defendants from consummating their agreement
to consolidate or from going forward with any other plan by which Morton Plant would be combined with Mease; (3) attorneys
fees; and (4) costs.

II




The Practices and Events Giving Rise to the Alleged Clayton Act Violation




A. Background





Morton Plant and Mease are the two largest general acute care hospitals in North Pinellas County. Morton Plant, with
672 licensed acute care hospital beds, generated about $130 million in net inpatient revenues in fiscal year 1993.
Mease, with a total of 358 licensed acute care hospital beds on two campuses, generated about $75 million in net inpatient
revenues in fiscal year 1993.



Morton Plant and Mease, like other general acute care hospitals, receive the bulk of their revenues from the provision
of acute inpatient hospital services_

i.e.,

 services provided for the diagnosis and treatment of patients who require an overnight hospital stay. Acute inpatient
hospital services include room and board, medical and surgical services, around-the-clock monitoring and observation,
nursing care, and laboratory, x-ray and support services.



Acute inpatient hospital services are sold to a variety of purchasers, including managed care health insurance plans
such as health maintenance organizations and preferred provider organizations (colloquially known as HMOs and
PPOs). These plans contract with a select number of competing hospitals and employ financial incentives to encourage
plan enrollees to use the contracted facilities. Hospitals reduce the prices of services provided to managed care
plan enrollees in return for the plans' commitment to increase the volume of patients hospitals receive.



Managed care plans and other price-sensitive health care purchasers rely on competition among hospitals to obtain
hospital services at competitive rates. This, in turn, permits managed care plans to offer health insurance to consumers
at lower prices. Managed care plans constitute a significant, and growing, percentage of Morton Plant's and Mease's
revenues from patient care.




B. Product Market





The Verified Complaint alleges that the appropriate product market within which to assess the competitive effect
of the proposed combination of Morton Plant and Mease is the provision of acute inpatient hospital services. A relevant
product market consists of those products that are reasonably interchangeable by consumers for the same purpose.
The pivotal question in the determination is whether a small but significant increase in the price of one product would
cause enough buyers to turn to other products so as to make the price increase unprofitable.



It is well established that acute inpatient services constitute a relevant product market for analyzing a merger
of general acute care hospitals. The market for acute inpatient services is separate from the market for outpatient
services, which general acute care hospitals also provide. Patients whose treatment or condition requires an overnight
hospital stay cannot be safely or effectively treated on an outpatient basis. For this reason, health care purchasers,
including managed care plans, do not view outpatient services as substitutes for acute inpatient services. General
acute care hospitals profitably could increase the price of acute inpatient hospital services without causing a
significant number of health care purchasers to switch to outpatient services.








C. Geographic Market





The Verified Complaint alleges that North Pinellas County, the portion of Pinellas County north of Ulmerton Road,
is the relevant geographic market.



Pinellas County is the most densely populated county in Florida. A long, narrow peninsula, surrounded on three sides
by large bodies of water, the Gulf of Mexico and Tampa Bay, Pinellas County is geographically isolated from Tampa,
the area's major city. In addition, because few major highways connect communities in the northern and southern ends
of the County, it is extremely difficult to travel between North and South Pinellas County, a problem which is much
worse during the winter months when the area's population swells with a seasonal influx of tourists and winter residents.



For these reasons, residents of North Pinellas, physicians practicing in North Pinellas, and health care purchasers
such as managed care plans with North Pinellas enrollees strongly prefer to use or contract with general acute care
hospitals in North Pinellas for acute inpatient hospital services. In 1992, over 85 percent of North Pinellas County
residents who were hospitalized were admitted to general acute care hospitals in North Pinellas. Very few physicians
who practice at hospitals in North Pinellas admit patients to hospitals in other areas. Health care purchasers such
as managed care plans do not consider hospitals in other areas to be good substitutes for North Pinellas hospitals.
Therefore, general acute care hospitals in North Pinellas County profitably could increase the price of acute inpatient
hospital services without losing a significant number of patients to hospitals in other areas.




D. Effect of the Combination





As the largest general acute care hospitals in North Pinellas County, Morton Plant and Mease control, respectively,
about 38% and 20% of all general acute care hospital beds in that area. Together, Morton Plant and Mease would dominate
the market for the provision of acute inpatient hospital services with a combined share of 58%. The market is highly
concentrated by any measure of hospital capacity or output, and market concentration would increase substantially
as a result of the proposed combination.



Health care purchasers such as managed care plans have secured competitive rates for acute inpatient hospital services
because Morton Plant and Mease have vigorously competed for their business. A full-fledged merger of Morton Plant
and Mease, in which they would market and price all of their services together, would eliminate that competitive rivalry,
significantly reduce the ability of managed care plans to bargain for competitive rates, and permit the combination
to increase prices for acute inpatient hospital services to the detriment of health care purchasers and consumers.




III





Explanation of the Proposed Final Consent Judgment





The United States, the State of Florida and Morton Plant and Mease have stipulated that the Court may enter the proposed
Final Consent Judgment at any time after compliance with the Antitrust Procedures and Penalties Act, 15 U.S.C. 16
(b)-(h). The Judgment provides that its entry does not constitute any evidence or admission by any party with
respect to any issue of fact or law.



Under the provisions of Section 2(e) of the Antitrust Procedures and Penalties Act, 15 U.S.C.  16(e), the Judgment
may not be entered unless the Court finds entry is in the public interest. Section XII of the proposed Judgment sets
forth such a finding.

A. Terms


The proposed Final Consent Judgment prohibits Morton Plant and Mease from merging and requires them to remain as separate,
competing hospitals. Morton Plant and Mease may, however, enter into a Partnership in which they consolidate and
jointly operate certain general acute care and administrative services under specified terms. The proposed Judgment
is designed to permit Morton Plant and Mease to achieve substantial efficiencies while preserving maximum competition
between them.
The acute care (or ``patient'') services eligible for Partnership operation include: outpatient services; laboratory
services; mental health services; diagnostic and therapeutic radiology services; and certain inpatient services
that are commonly recognized as ``tertiary'' services_

i.e.

, those procedures performed by physician subspecialists with specialized support staff and expensive equipment.
The tertiary services eligible for Partnership operation include: neonatal level III services; open heart surgery
and similar procedures; robotically assisted prosthetic implantation and special spinal instrumentation procedures;
stem cell procedures, HDR brachy therapy and advanced linear accelerator equipment and procedures; and stereotactic
radio therapy. The Partnership also may own and operate home health care, home infusion services, durable medical
equipment, rehabilitative services, skilled nursing, retirement facilities and long-term care. (Section II(A)).

The eligible Partnership administrative services include: human resources (with some exceptions); medical staff
organization and development; information services; telephone and other communication services; accounting,
billing and collection; housekeeping and laundry; medical records; materials management and plant maintenance;
support services for charitable foundations; and certain miscellaneous services. (Section II(B)).





Section V sets forth the conditions under which the Partnership may operate. Morton Plant and Mease may agree to consolidate
and jointly operate any eligible Partnership patient care and administrative service. (Section V(A)). They may
appoint a Partnership board, which may consist of individuals from each hospital's board. (Section V(C)). The Partnership
must sell its services to Morton Plant and Mease on the same terms and conditions in an amount equal to cost. (Section
V(B)).
All services other than those eligible for consolidation through the Partnership are defined as ``Independent Services.''
(Section II(C)). Morton Plant and Mease must continue to operate these services separately. (Section VI(A)). Specifically,
all marketing, managed care contracting and pricing decisions must remain independent. (

Id

.) Each hospital must price and sell all services (both Independent and Partnership Services) in active competition
with the other. (Section VI(B)). The Partnership board may not discuss Independent Services, managed care contracting
for the hospitals, or the pricing of any service with the individual hospital boards with minor exceptions. (Section
V(C)).





Additionally, the Judgment provides that Morton Plant may lend or grant Mease up to $21 million for Mease's planned
expansion under terms preventing Morton Plant from obtaining any control or leverage over Mease's management or
operations. (Section V(E)). Moreover, Morton Plant, Mease and the Partnership may become obligated parties, guarantors
or co-makers on debt instruments and their assets may be pledged as security for such instruments so long as such obligations
are approved separately. Neither Morton Plant nor Mease shall unreasonably withhold consent to, impose conditions
on, or attempt to influence the use of funds obtained by the other hospital through such financing for Independent
Services. (Section V(F)). The Judgment directs Morton Plant and Mease to establish adequate protections to ensure
that the hospitals do not share competitively sensitive information concerning pricing, managed care contracts,
and marketing and planning functions. These protections shall include, at a minimum, confidentiality agreements
for employees with access to such information and protocols for preparation of separate reports for Morton Plant,
Mease, and the Partnership. (Section V(I)). The Judgment also requires Morton Plant and Mease to maintain an antitrust
compliance program and annually certify compliance with the Judgment, and permits plaintiffs access to monitor
compliance. (Sections VII, VIII, and IX).


B. Effect on Competition


The Court's entry of this proposed Judgment would be a ``double win'' for consumers. First, the Judgment preserves
the vigorous competitive rivalry between Morton Plant and Mease, thereby insuring that consumers will continue
to reap the benefits of competition in the form of lower prices and better services. Second, the Judgment permits Morton
Plant and Mease to achieve substantial cost savings by combining and jointly operating certain services through
a Partnership. The preservation of competition between Morton Plant and Mease will insure that these savings will
be passed on to consumers.

<TEXT>
 

The Partnership is unlikely to result in a lessening of competition. The proposed Judgment permits Morton Plant and
Mease to consolidate only those services for which consolidation would pose few, if any, competitive concerns. The
services eligible for inclusion in the Partnership can be roughly grouped into three categories: outpatient, tertiary,
and administrative.

A consolidation of Morton Plant's and Mease's outpatient services would pose no significant competitive risk because
there are a very large number of providers of such services in North Pinellas County. In addition to general acute care
hospitals, other providers of outpatient services include physician offices, clinics, and ambulatory surgery
centers. Furthermore, in North Pinellas County it is relatively easy for new providers of outpatient services to
enter the market.

Nor would a consolidation of certain tertiary services offered by Morton Plant or Mease threaten competition. For
some of these services, a consolidation would have no effect because only one of the hospitals currently provides
that service. For example, open-heart surgery is currently provided by Morton Plant, but not by Mease. Even for services
in which the hospitals currently compete, persons are typically willing to travel greater distances for highly sophisticated,
tertiary-level care than they are for more routine medical care. Therefore, Morton Plant and Mease compete in providing
these services in a geographic market much broader than North Pinellas County. For example, the geographic market
for level III neonatal care includes at least several major hospitals in South Pinellas County, and the same is true
for other tertiary services that the Judgment permits Morton Plant and Mease to consolidate.

Finally, the proposed Judgment protects against anticompetitive harm from the joint ownership and operation of
certain administrative services. Services such as human resources, information services, accounting, billing,
and collection, are only a part of the inputs into Morton Plant's and Mease's provision of acute care services. Currently,
Morton Plant and Mease independently decide how to allocate their administrative costs in pricing their acute care
services to managed care plans and other health care purchasers, and they will continue to do so under the Judgment.

4

 Moreover, the proposed Judgment requires the Partnership to establish protections to ensure that the joint operation
of administrative services does not result in any sharing of information such as pricing or managed care contracting
for Morton Plant and Mease, thus guarding against the risk of ``spillover'' of competitively sensitive information
from the Partnership to the independent hospitals. (Section V(I)).





In addition to these protections, the proposed Judgment requires Morton Plant and Mease to market, price and sell
all of their services_even those jointly owned and operated through the Partnership_in competition with each other
and other hospitals.

5

 This ensures that both hospitals will remain as separate and viable competitors and permits them the maximum flexibility
in competing for managed care contracts in the future.

IV 

Remedies Available to Private Litigants



Section 4 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C.  15, provides that any person who has been injured as a result of conduct
prohibited by the antitrust laws may bring suit in federal court to recover three times the damages suffered, as well
as costs and reasonable attorney's fees. Entry of the proposed Final Consent Judgment will neither impair nor assist
the bringing of such actions. Under the provisions of Section 5(a) of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C.  16(a), the Judgment
has no 

prima facie 

effect in any subsequent lawsuits that may be brought against Morton Plant or Mease in this matter.



V 

Procedures Available for Modification of the Proposed Final Consent Judgment



As provided by the Antitrust Procedures and Penalties Act, any person believing that the proposal Final Consent Judgment
should be modified may submit written comments to Gail Kursh, Chief, Professions and Intellectual Property Section,
U.S. Department of Justice, Antitrust Division, 555 4th Street, NW, Room 9903, Washington, DC 20001, within the 60-day
period provided by the Act. These comments, and the Department's responses, will be filed with the Court and published
in the 

Federal Register

. All comments will be given due consideration by the Department of Justice, which remains free, pursuant to a stipulation
signed by the United States and Morton Plant and Mease, to withdraw its consent to the Judgment at any time prior to entry.
Section X of the Judgment provides that the Court retains jurisdiction over this action, and the parties may apply
to the Court for any order necessary or appropriate for modification, interpretation, or enforcement of the Judgment.



VI 

Determinative Materials/Documents



No materials or documents of the type described in Section 2(b) of the Antitrust Procedures and Penalties Act, 15 U.S.C.
 16(b), were considered in formulating the proposed Final Consent Judgment.



VII 

Alternative to the Proposed Final Consent Judgment



The alternative to the proposed Judgment is a full trial on the merits. While the Department is confident of its ability
to succeed in such a trial, the litigation involves difficult issues of law and fact. A favorable outcome is not a certainty.
Had the Department won a litigated judgment, at most the Court would have barred the combination. The consent judgment
agreed to by the parties achieves the same underlying objective_preserving the vigorous competitive rivalry between
Morton Plant and Mease_by requiring them to continue competing for all general acute care services, including those
consolidated through the Partnership. It has the additional advantage, which a litigated judgment in favor of plaintiffs
would not, of allowing defendants to achieve potential efficiencies and cost savings.

ACTION:

 Grant of Individual Exemptions. 





</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document contains exemptions issued by the Department of Labor (the Department) from certain of the prohibited
transaction restrictions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (the Act) and/or the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986 (the Code). 



Notices were published in the 

Federal Register

 of the pendency before the Department of proposals to grant such exemptions. The notices set forth a summary of facts
and representations contained in each application for exemption and referred interested persons to the respective
applications for a complete statement of the facts and representations. The applications have been available for
public inspection at the Department in Washington, D.C. The notices also invited interested persons to submit comments
on the requested exemptions to the Department. In addition the notices stated that any interested person might submit
a written request that a public 
hearing be held (where appropriate). The applicants have represented that they have complied with the requirements
of the notification to interested persons. No public comments and no requests for a hearing, unless otherwise stated,
were received by the Department. 


The notices of proposed exemption were issued and the exemptions are being granted solely by the Department because,
effective December 31, 1978, section 102 of Reorganization Plan No. 4 of 1978 (43 FR 47713, October 17, 1978) transferred
the authority of the Secretary of the Treasury to issue exemptions of the type proposed to the Secretary of Labor. 




Statutory Findings 




In accordance with section 408(a) of the Act and/or section 4975(c)(2) of the Code and the procedures set forth in 29
CFR Part 2570, Subpart B (55 FR 32836, 32847, August 10, 1990) and based upon the entire record, the Department makes
the following findings: 


(a) The exemptions are administratively feasible; 


(b) They are in the interests of the plans and 
their participants and beneficiaries; and 


(c) They are protective of the rights of the 
participants and beneficiaries of the plans.

Thomas G. Soper, M.D., S.C. Employees' Pension Plan and Trust (the Plan) Located in Evanston, Illinois 


[Application No. D-9703] 


Proposed Exemption 


The Department is considering granting an exemption under the authority of section 4975(c)(2) of the Code and in accordance
with the procedures set forth in 29 CFR Part 2570, Subpart B (55 FR 32836, 32847, August 10, 1990). If the exemption is
granted, the sanctions resulting from the application of section 4975 of the Code, by reason of section 4975(c)(1)
(A) through (E) of the Code, shall not apply to the proposed cash sale (the Sale) of certain real property (the Property)
by the Plan to Thomas E. Soper, a disqualified person with respect to the Plan; provided that (1) the Sale is a one-time
transaction for cash; (2) the Plan does not experience any loss nor incur any expenses in the proposed transaction;
and (3) the Plan receives as consideration the greater of either the fair market value of the Property as determined
by an independent appraiser on the date of the Sale, or receives an amount equal to all the funds expended by the Plan
in acquiring and maintaining the Property. 


Summary of Facts and Representations 


1. The Plan is a defined contribution plan that is designated as a money purchase pension plan. It has one participant,
Thomas G. Soper, M.D., and as of December 31, 1993, it had total assets of $355,000. The fiduciaries of the Plan, who
have investment discretion, are Thomas G. Soper, M.D. and his wife, Julie Kelly Soper. Dr. Soper and his wife are the
parents of Thomas E. Soper, the proposed purchaser of the Property, and are the applicants of the exemption. 
The sponsoring employer of the Plan is an Illinois professional corporation, Thomas G. Soper, M.D., S.C., which is
engaged in the practice of medical surgery in Evanston, Illinois. It is wholly owned by Thomas G. Soper, M.D., who is
its president and sole director.

1

 




2. The Property is located at 2428 Grant Street in Evanston, Illinois and is approximately 150 feet in depth and 49.5
feet in width. The improvements on the Property consist of a one and one-half story frame residence with a detached
garage at the back of the lot. The residence, which is 76 years old, is in need of extensive repairs. Its kitchen and first
floor bathroom are unfinished and unusable. The basement floor has been removed and currently consists of a one-inch
gravel base over clay and soil. There is a need for repairs to the walls of the basement because of recent flooding. 
Eleanor N. Hall of Cyrus Realtors located in Evanston, Illinois represents that she evaluated the Property with the
intent to present the Property for sale and, although she found the Property to be in a good location, amid higher priced
houses, and situated on a well landscaped lot, she determined at this time that without a kitchen the Property is unmarketable.

The Property was purchased by the Plan for the consideration of $167,000 on September 5, 1991, from the conservator
of the estate of an elderly individual, who had no relationship with respect to the Plan or the participant. During
the occupancy of the previous owner, the Property had deteriorated so that by September 1991 the Property was experiencing
foundation and structural faults, unsafe wiring, and roofing defects. The Plan purchased the Property with the understanding
that because of its desirous location it could be rehabilitated and resold for a substantial gain. The Plan has made
no attempt to find tenants for the Property because of the dilapidated condition of the Property; however, rehabilitation
of the Property was commenced upon its purchase by the Plan. Although approximately 85 percent of the repairs are completed,
delays have occurred because of the need for engineering studies and the procurement of permits from regulatory agencies
of the city or county, and because of the additional structural damage to the Property from a broken water main during
January 1994. 
The applicants represent that from September 5, 1991, to June 6, 1994, the Plan incurred expenses of $34,126 from improving
and maintaining the Property. These expenses included (a) Homeowners Insurance, totalling $1,276 for the years
1991 through 1993; (b) Real Estate taxes, totalling $15,375 for the years 1991 through 1993; (c) Drywall in October
1991, totalling $5,150; (d) Landscape expenses, totalling $4,000; (e) Kitchen Cabinets (not installed), totalling
$915; and (f) Electrical expenses, totalling $7,380. 
The Property was appraised by Richard Anselmo, Certified General Appraiser, State Certification 

#

153-000832, of Bulthuis Realty Consultants, Oakbrook, Illinois, who determined the fair market value of the
Property to be $215,000, as of May 28, 1994. 
3. Cognizant that the Property's fair market value represents approximately 60 percent of the total assets of the
Plan,

2

 the applicants propose selling the Property to their son for cash as soon as possible following the issuance of the
requested exemption. Their son, Thomas E. Soper, is unmarried and has recently returned from living in California.
He is presently residing with his parents and intends to finish rehabilitating the Property. 




Thomas G. Soper, M.D., the sole participant of the Plan is planning to retire from his practice by the end of 1994 or early
in 1995. His primary source of retirement income will be from the assets of the Plan and a profit sharing plan, also sponsored
by his professional corporation. 
The applicants represent that it is in the best interests of the Plan and its sole participant to sell the Property in
its present condition as soon as possible in order to avoid additional expenses to the Plan and to generate liquid assets
that can produce earnings for the distribution of benefits to the participant upon his contemplated retirement.

4. In summary, the applicants represent that the proposed transaction will satisfy the criteria of section 4975(c)(2)

of the Code because (a) the Sale of the Property involves a 
one-time transaction for cash; (b) the Plan will not incur any expenses incidental to the Sale; (c) the Plan will receive
as consideration for the Sale the greater of either the fair market value of the Property as determined on the date of
the Sale by a qualified, independent appraiser, or will receive all of the funds expended by the Plan in obtaining and
maintaining the Property; (d) the Sale will permit the Plan to reinvest illiquid assets into income producing, liquid
assets; and (e) the Plan will avoid the expenses and risks involved in retaining and developing the Property.

 


NOTICE TO INTERESTED PERSONS:

General Information 


The attention of interested persons is directed to the following: 
(1) The fact that a transaction is the subject of an exemption under section 408(a) of the Act and/or section 4975(c)(2)
of the Code does not relieve a fiduciary or other party in interest of disqualified person from certain other provisions
of the Act and/or the Code, including any prohibited transaction provisions to which the exemption does not apply
and the general fiduciary responsibility provisions of section 404 of the Act, which among other things require a
fiduciary to discharge his duties respecting the plan solely in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries
of the plan and in a prudent fashion in accordance with section 404(a)(1)(b) of the act; nor does it affect the requirement
of section 401(a) of the Code that the plan must operate for the exclusive benefit of the employees of the employer maintaining
the plan and their beneficiaries; 
(2) Before an exemption may be granted under section 408(a) of the Act and/or section 4975(c)(2) of the Code, the Department
must find that the exemption is administratively feasible, in the interests of the plan and of its participants and
beneficiaries and protective of the rights of participants and beneficiaries of the plan;
(3) The proposed exemptions, if granted, will be supplemental to, and not in derogation of, any other provisions of
the Act and/or the Code, including statutory or administrative exemptions and transitional rules. Furthermore,
the fact that a transaction is subject to an administrative or statutory exemption is not dispositive of whether the
transaction is in fact a prohibited transaction; and 
(4) The proposed exemptions, if granted, will be subject to the express condition that the material facts and representations
contained in each application are true and complete and accurately describe all material terms of the transaction
which is the subject of the exemption. In the case of continuing exemption transactions, if any of the material facts
or representations described in the application change after the exemption is granted, the exemption will cease
to apply as of the date of such change. In the event of any such change, application for a new exemption may be made to the
Department.

Consolidation of 1992, 1993 and 1994 Digital Audio Recording Distribution Proceedings 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Copyright Office, Library of Congress.

 

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of consolidation of proceedings, royalty distribution, and public meeting.



 


</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Copyright Office is granting a motion to consolidate the 1992, 1993, and 1994 digital audio recording (DART) distribution
proceedings which will begin in 1995. In addition, the Office will make distribution of the 1992 and 1993 Nonfeatured
Musicians and Nonfeatured Vocalists DART subfunds in July. The Office will hold a public meeting to discuss the best
evidence for the distribution of DART royalties in September.

 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

I. Background 



On December 17, 1993, Congress passed the Copyright Royalty Tribunal Reform Act of 1993. This legislation dissolved
the Tribunal and established a new system of copyright arbitration royalty panels (CARPs) to be supported by the Library
of Congress and the Copyright Office. 

The first proceeding to be initiated under the new CARP system was the distribution of the 1992 and the 1993 digital
audio recording technology (DART) royalties. The 1992 DART distribution proceeding was begun by the Tribunal but
was suspended when the Tribunal was abolished, and needed to be started anew. The 1993 DART distribution was begun
by the Copyright Office under the new authority conferred by the Copyright Royalty Tribunal Reform Act of 1993. On
March 1, 1994, 59 FR 9773, we began the process of distributing DART royalties by asking the claimants to the 1992 and
1993 DART funds for comments on the following questions: 

(a) Do any controversies exist concerning the distribution of 1992 
and/or 1993 DART royalties? 

(b) If controversies do exist, which subfunds do they exist in? 

(c) If settlements have been reached, which parties have reached settlement and which have not? 

(d) Do the claimants believe it would be advisable to consolidate the 1992 DART proceeding with the 1993 DART proceeding?

In addition, in the March 1, 1994, notice and in a subsequent notice appearing May 16, 1994, 59 FR 25506, the Library
of Congress and the Copyright Office established the initial procedural dates that would apply to the 1992 and 1993
DART proceedings, as follows: 

June 10, 1994_comments from claimants due on whether controversies exist in the distribution of 1992 and 1993 DART
funds, and whether the 1992 and 1993 DART distribution proceedings should be consolidated. 

June 15, 1994_precontroversy motions, and/or objections to any listed arbitrators due from claimants who will be
participating in the 1992 and/or 1993 DART distribution proceedings. 

June 30, 1994_declaration by the Librarian of Congress to be made as to whether any controversies exist in the distribution
of 1992 and 1993 DART royalties, and, if they do, a declaring of the initiation of CARP proceedings. 

August 1, 1994_authorization by the Copyright Office of the distribution of any royalties found not to be in controversy.




II. The Commentators 



We received comments from the following claimants: 




The Alliance of Artists and Recording Companies (AARC) 

Ymistye L. White 

Alicia Carolyn Evelyn 

Eugene (Lambchops) Curry 

James Cannings 

Gear Publishing Company 

Hideout Productions on behalf of Punch Enterprises, Inc. and Bob Seger 

Sword and Stone Publishing, Inc. 

Bopp du Wopp, Inc. 

Jointly, the independent administrator of the Nonfeatured Musicians and the Nonfeatured Vocalists subfund; the
American Federation of Musicians (AFM); the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (AFTRA); and the
Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). 

Jointly, AARC, American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP), Broadcast Music, Inc. (BMI); Copyright
Management, Inc. (CMI), Gospel Music Coalition (GOSPEL); The Harry Fox Agency, Inc. (HFA); SESAC, Inc. (SESAC),
and the Songwriters Guild of America (SGA). 

Jointly, ASCAP, BMI, CMI, GOSPEL, HFA, SESAC, and the SGA. 



III. Motion to Consolidate and Stay Procedural Dates 



The comments indicated that, while many settlements were reached, there still existed some unresolved controversies
in each of the subfunds. Rather than requesting the immediate initiation of a CARP proceeding to resolve these controversies,
a joint motion was filed by AARC, ASCAP, BMI, CMI, GOSPEL, HFA, SESAC, and SGA requesting that the Librarian of Congress
and the Copyright Office consolidate the 1992 and the 1993 DART distribution proceedings with the 1994 DART distribution
proceedings that will start next year, and defer all consideration of DART distributions until 1995. 

As a consequence of their motion to consolidate, the joint commentators also requested that the initial DART procedural
dates of June 15 (precontroversy motions and objections), June 30 (initiation of proceedings), and August 1 (authorization
of distributions) be stayed until after the 1994 claims are filed in 1995. 



A. Justification of Motion to Consolidate and Stay of Procedural Dates 



In support of their motion to consolidate, the joint commentators noted that the 1992 and the 1993 DART funds, which
are the first funds to be collected under the Audio Home Recording Act that took effect on October 28, 1992, are quite
small: a little over $100,000 for 1992, and less than $500,000 for 1993. They anticipate that, because the DART fund
is new, many issues of first impression will have to be resolved, but that the costs of such action will be such as to consume
most, if not all, of the fund. The joint commentators observed that the costs borne by the copyright owners in a DART
proceeding are not only their own costs, but the costs of the Library of Congress, the Copyright Office, and the arbitrators.
In the interest of economy, therefore, the joint commentators requested that the 1992 and 1993 distribution proceedings
be consolidated with the 1994 proceeding. 

In addition, the joint commentators noted that the Library of Congress and the Copyright Office have endeavored to
adopt regulations to govern the new CARP proceedings, but that the current regulations are interim rules. Comments
on the interim rules were due June 15, 1994, and reply comments are due July 15, 1994. The joint commentators would prefer
that a DART proceeding operate under the final rules that result from these latest rounds of comments, rather than
proceed under the interim rules. 

Last, the joint commentators stated that they will endeavor to use the time between now and 1995 to gather the best information
and data relevant to a DART distribution proceeding, and to continue to work for more settlements in each of the subfunds.
To the extent that more settlements are reached, fewer controversies will need to be brought before the arbitrators,
and fewer royalties will have to be spent on the expense of a CARP proceeding. 



 B. Grant of Motion to Stay Procedural Dates and Establishment of Comment Period 



On June 21, 1994, the Library of Congress and the Copyright Office issued an Order finding good cause to grant the motion
to stay the procedural dates of June 15, June 30, and August 1, established in this proceeding. 

Concerning the motion to consolidate the 1992, 1993, and 1994 distribution proceedings, the Order gave those persons
who did not join in the joint motion until June 24, 1994, to respond to it, as provided by  251.45 of the Copyright
Office rules.

C. Responses to the Motion to Consolidate Proceedings 



Responses to the joint motion to consolidate proceedings were filed by James Cannings, Eugene Curry, and Alicia Carolyn
Evelyn. 

Mr. Cannings agreed with the consolidation of the 1992, 1993 and 1994 proceedings provided that the distribution
methodology proposed by Bopp du Wopp, Inc. is considered as one possible method by the claimants. Mr. Cannings urged
diligent and good faith efforts at settlement before 1995. 

Mr. Curry questioned whether the proposed consolidation of 1992, 1993 and 1994 would lead to another consolidation
next year, then the year after that, ad infinitum. Mr. Curry would agree to future years being consolidated, i.e.,
1994, 1995, and 1996, but wanted an immediate distribution of 1992 and 1993 moneys this August. 

Ms. Evelyn stated that she would object to the motion to consolidate so long as public performance royalty issues she
has raised with BMI and ASCAP remain unresolved. She joined with Mr. Cannings in support of Bopp du Wopp, Inc.'s proposed
distribution methodology. 



IV. Grant of Motion to Consolidate 



The Library of Congress and the Copyright Office agree with the arguments made by the joint commentators and hereby
grant the motion to consolidate the 1992, 1993, and 1994 DART royalty distribution proceedings into one proceeding
that will begin in 1995. 

As we discussed in our notice of March 1, 1994, the Audio Home Recording Act established certain statutory deadlines
for the commencement of DART distribution proceedings which, as the agency delegated the responsibility, we were
prepared to meet. However, as observed by the Administrative Conference of the United States, 1 C.F.R. 305.78-3,
there are special circumstances when the meeting of a statutory deadline would not serve the public interest. Here,
the majority of the claimants themselves have asked for a waiving of the statutory dates so that they might realize
the economies that would accrue from a consolidation of proceedings, and so that they might continue settlement talks
that could potentially avoid the cost of a CARP proceeding altogether. Under these circumstances, to initiate a CARP
proceeding immediately will only serve to spend the claimants' royalties needlessly, and will likely result in the
claimants receiving fewer royalties today than if they waited until 1995.

2

 In addition, we see no financial harm in waiting until 1995. The claimants' royalties will remain invested in United
States Treasury securities, and will continue to earn interest. 





The objection of Mr. Curry to consolidation is based on a concern that consolidations will happen every year, and no
moneys will ever be distributed. We do not see that occurring. Our goal, and, we believe that of the moving parties,
is economy, not delay. The moving parties do not want to see their royalties remaining with the government and neither
do we. 

The objection of Ms. Evelyn is tied to her other issues with ASCAP and BMI, and are not relevant to our consideration
here. 

As stated earlier, in our Order, dated June 21, 1994, we granted the joint commentators' motion to stay all previously
announced procedural dates intended to govern a 1992 and 1993 DART royalty distribution proceeding.

3

 Consistent with our ruling today to consolidate the 1992, 1993, and 1994 proceedings, new procedural dates will be
established in 1995, in accordance with our yearly statutory obligation under Chapter 10 of the Copyright Code to
ascertain DART controversies and to initiate DART proceedings. 





V. Inquiry Into Best Evidence 



The concerns expressed by the commentators about the potential for the costs of a DART proceeding to use up most or all
of the DART royalties available for distribution are valid, and are very much shared by the Library and the Copyright
Office. Two scenarios especially concern us. One, there is the possibility of holding extensive hearings for controversies
where the amounts in dispute are ultimately determined to be quite small. Two, even if the amounts in controversy are
sizable, there is the possibility of holding months-long hearings about the validity of the evidence offered by the
parties, which again would ultimately use up the bulk of the royalties in the DART funds, and the time allotted for arbitration.
This is especially likely because DART proceedings have never been held, and there is no precedent concerning what
is the most relevant evidence. We note that at a similar stage in its regulatory history, the issue of the best evidence
for distributing jukebox royalties was the subject of a full evidentiary hearing at the Copyright Royalty Tribunal,
but, nevertheless, resulted in the Tribunal deciding that no distribution determination could be reached without
further efforts at producing better evidence.

4

 This is a situation we should like to avoid. 





Consequently, the Library of Congress and the Copyright Office will hold a public meeting at 10 a.m., Tuesday, September
27, 1994 at the temporary CARP hearing room, Suite 921, 1825 Connecticut Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20009. The
purpose of the meeting is to discuss what would be the best evidence for distribution of the Sound Recordings Fund and
the Musical Works Fund.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940713-2-00114 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940713-2-00064 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

We note that section 1006(c) of the Copyright Code states that the allocation of the Sound Recordings Fund shall be
made according to the extent sound recordings were distributed, and that the allocation of the Musical Works Fund
shall be made according to the extent musical works were distributed or disseminated to the public in transmissions.
We should like, therefore, to know: 

(a) Do industry data exist, or can industry data be produced, that will demonstrate validly the distribution of sound
recordings in the United States? 

(b) Do industry data exist, or can industry data be produced, that will demonstrate validly the dissemination of musical
works to the public in transmissions in the United States? 

(c) How should ``distributed'' be defined given the practice of allowable returns? Should the arbitrators employ
the rule adopted by the Copyright Office with respect to section 115?

5

 





(d) If methodologies exist for the production of data relating to (a) and (b), what are the drawbacks of such methodologies?


(e) If methodologies exist for the production of data relating to (a) and (b), would the data cover all distributions
and all public disseminations so that even the smallest or most specialized claimant can be compared mathematically
to the larger claimants? 

(f) If the methodologies cannot cover the smaller claimants, what measurements can be proposed to cover them? 

(g) If conflicting methodologies exist, how do the parties propose to resolve the conflicts? 

We emphasize that we are not asking these questions to decide distribution issues. Distribution issues are properly
for the CARP arbitrators. But if we can in any way help to focus and sharpen the proceedings, the savings in time and expense
before a CARP panel will far outweigh the cost of this one public meeting. The public meeting will give the parties an
opportunity to explore the positions of each claimant, facilitate concentrating on solving the evidentiary problems,
and reveal what further steps need to be taken. A public record of the meeting will be made for those who do not attend,
and for the benefit of the CARP panel, if one is ultimately convened. 



VI. The Nonfeatured Musicians and the Nonfeatured Vocalists Subfunds 



A. Background_1993 



The Audio Home Recording Act established two funds: the Sound Recordings Fund and the Musical Works Fund. Within the
Sound Recordings Fund, the Act further established four subfunds: the Copyright Owners Subfund, the Featured Artists
Subfund, the Nonfeatured Musicians Subfund, and the Nonfeatured Vocalists Subfund. 

With regard to the Nonfeatured Musicians Subfund and the Nonfeatured Vocalists Subfund, the Act outlined certain
specific procedures. It required that ``25/8 percent of the royalty payments allocated to the Sound Recordings Fund
shall be placed in an escrow account managed by an independent administrator jointly appointed by the interested
copyright parties described in section 1001(7)(A) and the American Federation of Musicians (or any successor entity)
to be distributed to nonfeatured musicians (whether or not members of the American Federation of Musicians or any
successor entity) who have performed on sound recordings distributed in the United States.'' Similarly,``13/8
percent of the royalty payments allocated to the Sound Recordings Fund shall be placed in an escrow account managed
by an independent administrator jointly appointed by the interested copyright parties described in section 1001(7)(A)
and the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (or any successor entity) to be distributed to nonfeatured
vocalists (whether or not members of the American Federation [of] Television and Radio Artists or any successor entity)
who have performed on sound recordings distributed in the United States.'' 17 U.S.C. 1006. 

In 1993, the Copyright Royalty Tribunal adopted a regulation, ultimately reissued by the Library of Congress and
the Copyright Office when the Tribunal was abolished, that required the independent administrator to give notice
to the government of his or her selection by March 31 of each year. 37 C.F.R. 311.4; 58 FR 53822 (1993).

<DOCNO> FR940713-2-00115 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940713-2-00064 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

In the same rulemaking, the Tribunal determined that it did not have the jurisdiction to decide controversies within
the two subfunds that were administered by an independent administrator. The Tribunal reasoned that, according
to the wording of section 1006(a), its authority over the distribution of royalties extended only to ``interested
copyright parties'' and that nonfeatured performers, whether musicians or vocalists, were not defined under the
Audio Home Recording Act as ``interested copyright parties.'' 58 FR 53822, 53824 (Oct. 18, 1993). 

Therefore, the Tribunal concluded that its role in handling the moneys for the two nonfeatured performer subfunds
was simply a ministerial task of distributing the royalties to the independent administrator when a distribution
was ready to be made. 

Id.

 



B. Background_1994 



After the Tribunal's abolition, the Copyright Office began to receive claims for 1993 DART royalties during January-February,
1994. One claimant, Eugene Curry, filed a claim for the Nonfeatured Musicians Subfund. Subsequently, the Office
was informed that Edward Peters had been appointed the independent administrator for both the Nonfeatured Musicians
Subfund and the Nonfeatured Vocalists Subfund. 

The Copyright Office sent a letter to Mr. Curry and Mr. Peters asking three questions: (a) who were the interested copyright
parties that participated in the selection of the independent administrator?; (b) is there any controversy between
Mr. Curry and Mr. Peters about the distribution of Nonfeatured Musicians Subfund?; and (c) if there is a controversy,
how would Mr. Curry and Mr. Peters recommend the resolution of the controversy? Letter, dated May 4, 1994. 

Mr. Curry responded that there was a controversy between him and Mr. Peters on the distribution of the subfund. 

Mr. Peters responded that he was selected by RIAA and AFM

6

; that, according to the Copyright Code and Tribunal precedent, the Copyright Office has no authority to resolve disputes
in the nonfeatured subfunds; that, because the Copyright Office has no authority, Mr. Curry should not have filed
a claim with the Copyright Office nor should the Office have processed his claim; that Mr. Curry will be treated properly
by Mr. Peters; and the fact of his non-union membership will have no relevance whatever in the ultimate distribution
of the subfund. 





Separately, the Copyright Office received a joint comment from Mr. Peters, AFM, AFTRA, and the RIAA arguing in greater
detail that the Audio Home Recording Act and the Tribunal's decision in 1993 support the conclusion that the independent
administrator is to receive the allocated royalties for the two nonfeatured performers subfunds directly, and is
not subject to the authority of the Copyright Office or the CARP panel in resolving disputes in those subfunds.

C. Discussion 



The Library of Congress and the Copyright Office have reviewed the Audio Home Recording Act and the Tribunal's 1993
decision, and agree with the joint commentators, AFM, AFTRA, RIAA and Mr. Peters, that the independent administrator
is to receive the royalties from the two nonfeatured performers subfunds directly from the Copyright Office, and
that disputes as to his (or her) distribution of those funds are not subject to the jurisdiction of a CARP panel. 

Our purpose in sending the May 4 letter to Mr. Curry and Mr. Peters was to facilitate a settlement. The provisions of
the Audio Home Recording Act are unique among other provisions governing statutory royalties in that they open up
the possibility of a dispute in a royalty fund without offering an administrative remedy. How to handle such a dispute
was not a question that was faced by the Tribunal in 1993, because in that year there were no claims filed at all in the
nonfeatured performers subfunds. This year, Mr. Curry's claim, and his subsequent notice that he is in controversy,
presents the issue foursquare. 

Recognizing the plain meaning of the statute, we agree that the royalties in the two nonfeatured performers subfunds
are to be distributed directly to the independent administrator. We also recognize that claimants to those two subfunds
do not file claims with the Copyright Office. They need to contact the independent administrator directly. 

But we believe there is a function for the Copyright Office to perform. Each year, to the extent that the Copyright Office
receives expressions of interest to receive royalties from those two subfunds, we will forward the names to the independent
administrator.

7

 In addition, the Copyright Office will maintain a public file that will consist of (a) the names of those expressing
interest in the subfunds; (b) the notice of the independent administrator; (c) any correspondence concerning the
two subfunds; and (d) any notification of the final disposition of any dispute within the subfunds. The notification
is not required, but is being requested to complete the public record. It is also noted that we are not asking for a notification
of the disposition of all moneys in the subfunds, just those is dispute. We recognize and will continue the Tribunal's
policy of not inquiring into the distribution of 

settled

 claims. 





D. Distribution Notice 



In light of the above discussion, we are ordering a full distribution of the royalties available in the 1992 and 1993
Nonfeatured Musicians and Nonfeatured Vocalists Subfunds to Mr. Edward Peters, the independent administrator,
on July 28, 1994. This distribution will constitute the final distribution in those subfunds, except (a) in the event
that there are any late payments, a subsequent distribution will be made to the independent administrator that represents
those subfunds' share of the late payment; and (b) in the event that any refund is ultimately found to be required, the
independent administrator will need to repay the Office the subfunds' share of the refund.

<USDEPT>NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION</USDEPT>






Arizona Public Service Company; Consideration of Issuance of Amendment to Facility Operating License, Proposed
No Significant Hazards Consideration Determination, and Opportunity for a Hearing



The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an amendment to Facility Operating
License No. NPF-51 issued to Arizona Public Service Company (the licensee) for operation of the Palo Verde Nuclear
Generating Station, Unit 2 located in Maricopa County, Arizona.

The proposed amendment would modify Technical Specification Figure 3.2-1, Reactor Coolant Cold Leg Temperature
Vs. Core Power Level. Specifically, the minimum cold leg temperature for core power levels between 90 percent and
100 percent would be changed to 552
 F, (which is a reduction of 10
 F from the previous TS requirement). This TS change permits reactor operation at full power with a lower reactor
coolant temperature to minimize potential steam generator tube degradation.

Before issuance of the proposed license amendment, the Commission will have made findings required by the Atomic
Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act) and the Commission's regulations.

The Commission has made a proposed determination that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.
Under the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facility in accordance with the
proposed amendment would not (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee
has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below:

1. The proposed change does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated.

This amendment does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated. Peak pressure events were reanalyzed and LOCA events were partially reanalyzed, and these reanalyses
confirmed that the existing safety analysis for cycle 5 for PVNGS Unit 2 remains valid for a 10
 F reduction in RCS temperature. The Unit 2 LOCA and non-LOCA reanalyses were performed to account for additional
steam generator tube plugging (1100 total plugged tubes with no restriction on the number of plugged tubes in each
steam generator for LOCA analysis, and 2000 total plugged tubes with a maximum of 1000 plugged tubes in each steam generator
for non-LOCA analysis).

2. The proposed change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any other previously
evaluated.

This amendment does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated. The reanalyses performed demonstrated that the current licensing basis analyses results remain valid
with a 10
 F reduction in RCS temperature, and that the safety system settings remain unchanged.

3. The proposed changes do not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.
This amendment request will not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. There is no reduction in the
margin of safety since the changes apply only to the reactor coolant cold leg temperature, the safety analyses have
been reevaluated (and reperformed where necessary) using the new temperature, and the results remain valid. All
other safety limits and safety system settings remain unchanged; therefore, there is no reduction in any margin of
safety.
The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.
The Commission is seeking public comments on this proposed determination. Any comments received within 30 days after
the date of publication of this notice will be considered in making any final determination.
Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendment until the expiration of the 30-day notice period. However,
should circumstances change during the notice period such that failure to act in a timely way would result, for example,
in derating or shutdown of the facility, the Commission may issue the license amendment before the expiration of the
30-day notice period, provided that its final determination is that the amendment involves no significant hazards
consideration. The final determination will consider all public and State comments received. Should the Commission
take this action, it will publish in the 

Federal Register

 a notice of issuance and provide for opportunity for a hearing after issuance. The Commission expects that the need
to take this action will occur very infrequently.
Written comments may be submitted by mail to the Rules Review and Directives Branch, Division of Freedom of Information
and Publications Services, Office of Administration, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555,
and should cite the publication date and page number of this 

Federal Register

 notice. Written comments may also be delivered to Room 6D22, Two White Flint North, 11545 Rockville Pike, Rockville,
Maryland, from 7:30 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. Federal workdays. Copies of written comments received may be examined at the
NRC Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555.
The filing of requests for hearing and petitions for leave to intervene is discussed below.
By August 12, 1994, the licensee may file a request for a hearing with respect to issuance of the amendment to the subject
facility operating license and any person whose interest may be affected by this proceeding and who wishes to participate
as a party in the proceeding must file a written request for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene. Requests
for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's ``Rules of Practice
for Domestic Licensing Proceedings'' in 10 CFR Part 2. Interested persons should consult a current copy of 10 CFR 2.714
which is available at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington,
DC 20555 and at the local public document room located at the Phoenix Public Library, 12 East McDowell Road, Phoenix,
Arizona 85004. If a request for a hearing or petition for leave to intervene is filed by the above date, the Commission
or an Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, designated by the Commission or by the Chairman of the Atomic Safety and Licensing
Board Panel, will rule on the request and/or petition; and the Secretary or the designated Atomic Safety and Licensing
Board will issue a notice of hearing or an appropriate order.

As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall set forth with particularity the interest of the
petitioner in the proceeding, and how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding. The petition
should specifically explain the reasons why intervention should be permitted with particular reference to the following
factors: (1) The nature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made party to the proceeding; (2) the nature and
extent of the petitioner's property, financial, or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect
of any order which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest. The petition should also identify
the specific aspect(s) of the subject matter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Any person
who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has been admitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting
leave of the Board up to 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended
petition must satisfy the specificity requirements described above.

Not later than 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file
a supplement to the petition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions which are sought to be litigated
in the matter. Each contention must consist of a specific statement of the issue of law or fact to be raised or controverted.
In addition, the petitioner shall provide a brief explanation of the bases of the contention and a concise statement
of the alleged facts or expert opinion which support the contention and on which the petitioner intends to rely in proving
the contention at the hearing. The petitioner must also provide references to those specific sources and documents
of which the petitioner is aware and on which the petitioner intends to rely to establish those facts or expert opinion.
Petitioner must provide sufficient information to show that a genuine dispute exists with the applicant on a material
issue of law or fact. Contentions shall be limited to matters within the scope of the amendment under consideration.
The contention must be one which, if proven, would entitle the petitioner to relief. A petitioner who fails to file
such a supplement which satisfies these requirements with respect to at least one contention will not be permitted
to participate as a party.

Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subject to any limitations in the order granting leave
to intervene, and have the opportunity to participate fully in the conduct on the hearing, including the opportunity
to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses. 

If a hearing is requested, the Commission will make a final determination on the issue of no significant hazards consideration.
The final determination will serve to decide when the hearing is held. 

If the final determination is that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration, the Commission
may issue the amendment and make it immediately effective, notwithstanding the request for a hearing. Any hearing
held would take place after issuance of the amendment.

If the final determination is that the amendment request involves a significant hazards consideration, any hearing
held would take place before the issuance of any amendment. 

A request for a hearing or a petition for leave to intervene must be filed with the Secretary of the Commission, U.S.
Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Docketing and Services Branch, or may be delivered
to the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555, by the above
date. Where petitions are filed during the last 10 days of the notice period, it is requested that the petitioner promptly
so inform the Commission by a toll-free telephone call to Western Union at 1-(800) 248-5100 (in Missouri
1-(800) 342-6700). The Western Union operator should be given Datagram Identification Number N1023
and the following message addressed to Theodore R. Quay, Director, Project Directorate IV-2: petitioner's
name and telephone number, date petition was mailed, plant name, and publication date and page number of this 

Federal Register

 notice. A copy of the petition should also be sent to the Office of the General Counsel, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,
Washington, DC 20555, and to Nancy C. Loftin, Esq., Corporate Secretary and Counsel, Arizona Public Service Company,
P.O. Box 53999, Mail Station 9068, Phoenix, Arizona 85072-3999, attorney for the licensee.

Nontimely filings of petitions for leave to intervene, amended petitions, supplemental petitions and/or requests
for hearing will not be entertained absent a determination by the Commission, the presiding officer or the presiding
Atomic Safety and Licensing Board that the petition and/or request should be granted based upon a balancing of the
factors specified in 10 CFR 2.714(a)(1)(i)-(v) and 2.714(d). 

For further details with respect to this action, see the application for amendment dated July 1, 1994, which is available
for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington,

<DOCTITLE>Tennessee Valley Authority; Sequoyah Nuclear Plant, Units 1 and 2; Notice of Withdrawal of Application for Amendment
to Facility Operating License</DOCTITLE>



The United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) has granted the request of the Tennessee Valley
Authority (the licensee) to withdraw its November 18, 1992 application for proposed amendments to Facility Operating
License Nos. DPR-77 and DPR-79 for the Sequoyah Nuclear Plant, Units 1 and 2, located in Soddy Daisy, Tennessee.
The proposed changes would have modified the facility technical specifications pertaining to alternate steam generator
tube plugging criteria that was designed to take into account the reinforcing effect that the steam generator tubesheet
has on the external surface of expanded steam generator tubes referred to as Westinghouse Explosive Tube Expansion
(WEXTEX) region. The new criteria was designed to reduce the need for repairing or plugging steam generator tubes
having indications that exceed the current technical specification depth-based plugging limit.
The Commission had previously issued a Notice of Consideration of Issuance of Amendment published in the 

Federal Register

 on February 3, 1993 (58 FR 7006). However, by letter dated June 28, 1994, the licensee withdrew the proposed change.
For further details with respect to this action, see the application for amendment dated November 18, 1992 (which
was supplemented by letter dated January 8, 1993), and the licensee's letter dated June 28, 1994, which withdrew the
application for license amendment. The above documents are available for public inspection at the Commission's
Public Document Room, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC, and at the Chattanooga-Hamilton County Library, 1001 Broad
Street, Chattanooga, Tennessee 37402.

Self-Regulatory Organizations; Notice of Filing of Proposed Rule Change by the Chicago Board Options Exchange,
Inc. Relating to Solicited Transactions


July 6, 1994.


Pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''),
 notice is hereby given that on May 3, 1994, the Chicago Board Options Exchange, Inc. (``CBOE'' or ``Exchange'') filed
with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II,
and III below, which Items have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization. The Commission is publishing
this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons.




I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change


The Exchange proposes to adopt a new Rule 6.9 that would regulate the execution of ``solicited orders,'' as that term
is defined in the rule; would set forth specific priority principles applicable to such orders; and would restrict
trading by members and associated persons possessing knowledge of imminent undisclosed solicited transactions.

The text of the proposal is available at the Office of the Secretary, CBOE and at the Commission.



II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose Of, and Statutory Basis For, the Proposed Rule Change


In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose
of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text
of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The self-regulatory organization has
prepared summaries, set forth in sections (A), (B) and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.


(A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose Of, and Statutory Basis For, the Proposed Rule Change


The purpose of the proposed rule change is to regulate the execution of ``solicited'' transactions in options, 

i.e., 

options transactions having terms that are pre-negotiated prior to the time the orders comprising the transaction
are exposed to the trading crowd on the CBOE floor. The proposed rule change also restricts trading in any class of an
option, as well as trading in the underlying security or any ``related instrument,'' by CBOE members and their associated
persons who have knowledge of an imminent solicited transaction in options of that class. This prohibition applies
until all terms are disclosed to the trading crowd or until execution of the solicited transaction cannot reasonably
be considered imminent given the passage of time since the transaction was agreed upon.
The Exchange believes that it is appropriate to permit solicitation between potential buyers and potential sellers
of options in advance of the time they send actual orders to the trading crowd on the Exchange. The Exchange states that
complex options orders, such as spreads, straddles and combination orders, as well as stock-option orders, often
require the ``advance shopping'' that is characteristic of a solicited transaction. The Exchange believes that
such interactions between buyers and sellers and the resulting solicited transactions can enhance liquidity and
depth at the CBOE by bringing orders to the floor that might otherwise be difficult to effect.
Nevertheless, if the orders that comprise a solicited transaction are not suitably exposed to the order interaction
process on the CBOE floor, the execution of such orders would not be consistent with CBOE rules designed to promote
order interaction in an open-outcry auction. For example, Rule 6.43 requires bids and offers to be made at the post
by public outcry, and Rule 6.74 imposes specific order exposure requirements on floor brokers seeking to cross buy
orders with sell orders. Solicited transactions by definition entail negotiation, and if the orders that comprise
a solicited transaction are not adequately exposed to the floor auction, the crowd cannot have sufficient time to
digest and react to those orders' terms. The pre-negotiation inherent in the solicitation process thus can enable
the parties to a solicited transaction to preempt the crowd to an execution at the pre-negotiated price.
Proposed Rule 6.9 is intended to preserve the right to solicit orders in advance of submitting a proposed trade to the
crowd, while at the same time assuring that original orders that are the subject of a solicitation are exposed to the
auction market in a meaningful way. For instance, the proposed rule change would require a member representing an
original order that is the subject of a solicitation to disclose the terms of the original order to the crowd before
the original order can be executed. CBOE believes that such disclosure would eliminate the unfairness that can be
associated with pre-negotiated transactions and would subject the order that is the subject of the solicitation
to full auction interaction with other orders in the crowd.
To promote disclosure at the inception of a solicitation period, rather than later, and to encourage solicited persons
to bid or offer at prices that improve the current market, CBOE's rule change would establish a series of priority principles
for solicited transactions. Priority would be accorded depending on whether the original order is disclosed throughout
the solicitation period; whether the solicited order improves the best bid or offer in the crowd; and whether the solicited
order matches the original order's limit. Thus, when the original order is disclosed in advance of the solicitation
and the solicited order both matches the disclosed original order's limit and improves the market, the solicited
order will have priority over other orders in the crowd and may trade with the original order at the improved bid or offered
price, subject to the customer limit order book priorities set forth in Rule 6.45. When a solicited order does not match
the original order's limit and does not improve the market, however, it will not have priority over other bids and offers
represented in the crowd even if the original order was disclosed to the crowd for the full solicitation period. A responsive
solicited order will not have priority to trade with the original order even if the solicited order improves the market;
instead, in that instance, others in the crowd may trade ahead of the solicited person at the improved price.
In addition to requiring disclosure of original orders and clarifying the priority principles applicable to solicited
transactions, proposed Rule 6.9(e) would make it prohibited conduct, inconsistent with just and equitable principles
of trade, for any member or associated person who has knowledge of all the material terms of an original order and a solicited
order that matches the original order's price, to enter an order to buy or sell an option of the same class as any option
that is the subject of the solicitation prior to the time the original order's terms are disclosed to the crowd or the
execution of the solicited transaction can no longer reasonably be considered imminent. This prohibition would
extend to orders to buy or sell the underlying security or any ``related instrument,'' as that term is defined in the
Rule. The CBOE believes that these prophylactic requirements are necessary to prevent members and associated persons
from using undisclosed information about imminent solicited option transactions to trade the relevant option or
any closely-related instrument in advance of persons represented in the relevant options crowd.
The CBOE believes that proposed Rule 6.9 will improve the CBOE auction by clarifying the requirements applicable
to solicited transactions and by enabling the Exchange to initiate enforcement proceedings in appropriate cases
under specific rules. The Exchange believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with section 6(b) of the Act
in general and section 6(b)(5) in particular in that it is designed to promote just and equitable principles of trades
and to protect investors and the public interest.


(B) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition


CBOE does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any burden on competition.


(C) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants,
or Others


Written comments on the proposed rule change were neither solicited nor received.


III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action


Within 35 days of the date of publication of this notice in the 

Federal Register

 or within such longer period: (i) As the Commission may designate up to 90 days of such date if it finds such longer period
to be appropriate and publishes its reasons for so finding or (ii) as to which the self-regulatory organization consents,
the Commission will:
(a) By order approve such proposed rule change, or
(b) Institute proceedings to determine whether the proposed rule change should be disapproved.

 notice is hereby given that on June 30, 1994, the Midwest Clearing Corporation (``MCC'') filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change (File No. SR-MCC-94-08) as
described in Items I, II, and III below, which Items have been prepared primarily by MCC. The Commission is publishing

Trade Recording


In addition, a discount of $0.15 per trade side recorded will be applied to the trade recording fees for trades of 1,000

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Midwest Securities Trust Company; Order Approving a Proposed Rule Change Relating
to Limited Purpose Participants</DOCTITLE>


July 6, 1994.


I. Introduction


On February 3, 1994, the Midwest Securities Trust Company (``MSTC'') filed a proposed rule change (File No. SR-MSTC-94-04)
with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') pursuant to Section 19(b) of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934 (``Act'').
 Notice of the proposal was published in the Federal Register

 on April 1, 1994, to solicit comments from interested persons.
 No comments were received. As discussed below, this order approves the proposal.





II. Description of the Proposal


The purpose of the proposed rule change is to create a Limited Purpose Participant Program. On October 8, 1993, the
Commodity Futures Trading Commission (``CFTC'') issued an order approving the Chicago Mercantile Exchange's (``CME'')
proposal to revise the program whereby the CME accepts stock as clearing house performance bond margin. Under the
revised program, all stock pledged as performance bond margin is maintained at MSTC.
 In order to carry out the revised program, the CME became a pledgee participant at MSTC.
 Clearing members of the CME that are also participants at MSTC have been able to take advantage of this program by utilizing
MSTC's existing Automated Pledge Loan Program. Because futures commission merchants (``FCMs'') who are not registered
as broker-dealers (``BDs'') do not meet MSTC's existing qualifications to be MSTC participants, they have been unable
to participate in the current CME program. MSTC is establishing the Limited Purpose Participant Program to accommodate
those CME clearing members registered solely as FCMs.





Limited purpose participants will be limited to FCMs that are clearing members of a futures exchange. The activities
at MSTC for which a limited purpose participant will be eligible will be limited to making or receiving free depository
delivery instructions (``DDIs'') of securities, maintaining segregated positions for the purpose of effecting
free pledges of securities to a specified pledgee participant (

i.e.

, the futures exchange of which they are a clearing member), receiving a return of the securities from that pledgee
participant, and receiving credits from MSTC for any cash dividends received on those securities. Limited purpose
participants will not be able to make physical deposits or physical withdrawals of securities. Limited purpose participants
will not be eligible for any other service offered by MSTC.
In order to deposit securities in the limited purpose program, custodial banks or broker-dealers, acting on behalf
of limited purpose participants, will transfer book-entry positions to the participants' limited purpose accounts
at MSTC. Movements of positions from limited purpose accounts into the CME's pledge accounts will only occur by order
of the limited purpose participants, and only the CME may release positions from its pledge accounts to the limited
purpose accounts. If limited purpose participants no longer wish to pledge securities held in the limited purpose
accounts, such participants will instruct MSTC to move the positions out of their limited purpose accounts to their
designated bank or broker-dealer account at MSTC for further disposition.
In creating the CME clearing member stock pledge program,
 CME and MSTC entered into an agreement clarifying certain points not covered in either MSTC's Automated Pledge Loan
Program Agreement or in MSTC's Rules.
 In general, MSTC acknowledges the following.





(1) MSTC will comply with any instructions received from CME related to the pledged securities, notwithstanding
any conflicting instructions received from any clearing member or in any pending proceeding under the Bankruptcy
Code except to the extent that there is an effective written order issued by a court of competent jurisdiction.
(2) MSTC will not permit a limited purpose participant to pledge to a CME pledge account (a) Any security not on the list
of eligible securities that CME will provide to MSTC; (b) any security whose closing price on the day preceding the
day of the attempted pledge was not at least $10.00; (c) any security with respect to which MSTC has actual knowledge
of an existing encumbrance at the time of the attempted pledge; or (d) any security against which MSTC may assert a lien.
(3) MSTC has been advised by the CME that customer securities in the CME pledge account are required to be segregated
in accordance with the provisions of the Commodity Exchange Act and that prior to the first pledge of customer securities,
MSTC will execute an agreement that the funds and securities in the segregated customer pledge account will not be
subject to any lien or offset or liability owing to MSTC by the CME or any other person and that such funds shall not be
applied by MSTC to any such indebtedness or liability.

<TEXT>
 

(4) MSTC acknowledges the provisions dealing with MSTC's rights and obligations set forth in CFTC's order approving
the CME's stock pledge program.

To accommodate the proposed rule change, MSTC added to Article I (``Definitions and General Provisions'') of its
rules definitions of Limited Purpose Participants and Limited Purpose Account, added to Article II (``Settlement
Services'') Rule 7 which describes the Limited Purpose Participant Program, and added to Article V (``Participants'')
Rule 1 (``Qualifications of Applicants to Become a Participant'') paragraph (i) which sets forth the qualifications
of a limited purpose participant.



III. Discussion



The Commission believes the proposal is consistent with the purposes and requirements of Section 17A of the Act.
 In particular, the Commission believes the proposal meets the requirement of Sections 17A(b)(3) (A) and (F) that
a clearing agency be organized and have the capacity to safeguard securities and funds in its custody or control or
for which it is responsible.







In approving MSTC's rule change creating a limited purpose participant, the Commission recognizes the desire of
market participants, even in the CFTC regulated futures market, to meet their margin requirements with assets other
than cash or government securities. The MSTC proposal extends the use of equity securities as margin to FCM's that
are also clearing members of a board of trade.
 MSTC has structured the proposal to limit the services available to limited purpose participants so that only those
services necessary to pledge securities to CME's pledge account may be accessed. In addition, the CME has agreed to
indemnify MSTC for and from all claims, losses, liabilities, and expenses arising from any actions MSTC takes or does
not take in accordance with the instructions received from CME.






The Commission believes that the structure of the program and the safeguards that MSTC has built into the program should
reduce the risk to MSTC in holding securities pledged to CME. In light of the fact that the CME clearing house, not MSTC,
bears the risk of loss on the futures positions creating the performance bond requirements, the Commission believes
the proposed rule change satisfies MSTC's obligation to safeguard securities and funds in its custody or control
or for which it is responsible.



IV. Conclusion


For the reasons stated above, the Commission finds that MSTC's proposal is consistent with Section 17A of the Act.





It is therefore ordered, pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act,
 that MSTC's proposed rule change (File No. SR-MSTC-94-04) be, and hereby is, approved.



For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Filing of Proposed Rule Change by the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. Relating to Amendments
to the Allocation Policy and Procedures</DOCTITLE>


July 7, 1994.


Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C.  78s(b)(1), notice
is hereby given that on May 26, 1994, the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (``NYSE'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (``Commission'' or ``SEC'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II and III below,
which Items have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization. The Commission is publishing this notice to
solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons.


I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change


The proposed rule change consists of amendments to the Exchange's Allocation Policy and Procedures.





II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change


In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose
of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text
of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The self-regulatory organization has
prepared summaries, set forth in Sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.


A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change


(1) Purpose


The intent of the Exchange's Allocation Policy and Procedures (``Policy'') is to ensure that each security is allocated
in the fairest manner possible to the best specialist unit for that security. In order to enhance its stock allocation
decisions, the Exchange conducts a periodic review of its allocation process. As the result of the Exchange's most
recent review, a number of changes to the Policy, discussed below, are being proposed.
The Exchange proposes to change the composition of the Allocation Committee (the committee that determines which
specialist unit will specialize in a particular security). The Committee, which consists of nine members, would
include three broker Governors
 (one of whom may be an independent/two-dollar broker),
 four other Floor brokers from the Allocation Panel (one of whom must be an independent/two-dollar broker), and two
allied members
 from the Market Performance Committee or the Panel. For options allocations, only one Governor would sit on the Committee.
Currently, only one Governor sits as a member of the Allocation Committee, and the policy does not require that one
member of the Committee be an independent/two-dollar broker.






The Exchange is proposing to change the quorum requirement for the Allocation Committee to require that at least two
Floor Broker Governors be present out of the seven member quorum. For options allocations, a quorum would include
one Governor. Currently, only one Governor is required for a quorum.
The Exchange is proposing to allow Governors to serve as chairman of the Allocation Committee. Currently, they are
not eligible to serve. The Policy would also be amended to require all candidates for chairman to have prior experience
on the Allocation Committee.
The Exchange proposes to amend the Policy to state that all incoming Allocation Committee members are expected to
observe as many Committee meetings as possible prior to beginning their terms as Committee members.
The Exchange is proposing to change the composition of the Allocation Panel (the 36 member group from which the Allocation
Committee is drawn). The panel would be composed of 36 members, including 28 Floor brokers and eight allied members,
plus the eight broker Governors and four allied members serving on the Exchange's Market Performance Committee.
Currently, the four allied members of the Market Performance Committee do not serve on the Panel.
Selection to the Allocation Panel currently occurs through an annual appointment process which utilizes input from
the membership. The Exchange is proposing to amend the Policy to require Panel members to be nominated by the Exchange
membership.
To be eligible to serve on the Allocation Panel, the Exchange currently requires Floor brokers to have five years of
trading Floor experience. The Policy also states that to the maximum extent possible, the Panel should consist of
a core group of experienced, senior professionals, such as former Allocation Committee chairmen, senior Floor Officials,
and current and former Floor Governors. In the case of allied members, the member organization is appointed to the
Panel and it selects a representative to serve. The Exchange is proposing to amend the Policy to require that the allied
members chosen to serve have at least five years of experience in trading listed equities and have a senior position
on the trading desk. The Policy would also be amended to permit allied members to designate one alternate who meets
the Panel qualifications, subject to approval by the Floor Directors.
The Exchange is proposing to amend the Policy to provide for a four month term of service on the Allocation Committee
for all members, including Governors. The current terms are six months for non-Governor members and two months for
Governors. The Exchange is also proposing to codify the existing practice of permitting Panel members to serve a maximum
of six consecutive one year terms and to stagger terms so that every two months four or five members would rotate from
the Allocation Committee.
Finally, the Exchange is proposing to codify its practice on the allocation of merging listed companies. The Policy
would be amended to state that when two listed companies merge, the new entity would be assigned to the specialist in
the company determined to be the surviving/dominant company. If no surviving/dominant company could be identified,
the entity would be referred to the Allocation Committee for allocation. Currently, the Market Performance Committee,
with the assistance of Exchange Counsel and the Marketing Division, makes the determination of which company is the
surviving/dominant company.


(2) Statutory Basis


The basis under the Act for this proposed rule change is the requirement under Section 6(b)(5) that an Exchange have
rules that are designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to remove impediments to and perfect the
mechanism of a free and open market and a national market system and in general, to protect investors and the public
interest. The proposed amendments are consistent with these objectives in that they enable the Exchange to further
enhance the process by which stocks are allocated to ensure fairness and equal opportunity in the process.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Filing of Amendment Nos. 2 and 3 to Proposed Rule Change by the Pacific Stock Exchange,
Inc. Relating to the Listing and Trading of SCOR Securities on the Exchange</DOCTITLE>


July 7, 1994.


Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby
given that on June 2, 1994
 and July 7, 1994 the Pacific Stock Exchange, Inc. (``PSE'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission (``Commission'') Amendment Nos. 2 and 3 to File No. SR-PSE-92-42
 as described in Items I, II and III below, which Items have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization. The
Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the amendment to the proposed rule change from interested
persons.





I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change


The PSE is amending its proposal to list and trade Small Corporate Offering Registration (``SCOR'') securities on
the Exchange.


II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change


In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose
of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text
of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The self-regulatory organization has
prepared summaries, set forth in Sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.


A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change


1. Purpose


The Exchange is amending its proposal to list securities under the SCOR designation. The amendment is partly based
upon discussions the Exchange has held, subsequent to the initial filing, with committees of the North American Securities
Administrations Association, Inc. (``NASAA''),

3

 the California Department of Corporations, and leaders from the small business community. The Exchange believes
that the proposal, as amended, satisfactorily addresses the mutual concerns of these individuals and organizations.




Inclusion of Preferred Stock


The Exchange notes that many companies, particularly in the high-technology sector, have a capital structure consisting
of two classes of capital stock, 

i.e.

, a single class each of common and preferred. The class of common stock is privately held by insiders and, generally,
is not transferable, while the preferred stock is issued to qualified public investors. Under this structure, holders
of preferred stock have preference over common shareholders in the event of liquidation. The Exchange has determined,
accordingly, that it would consider listing a company's preferred stock under the SCOR program if the company's overall
capital structure and corporate governance policies were sufficiently designed to protect the interests of public
investors.


Initial Listing Requirements


The Exchange's initial filing proposed that each issuer of a SCOR security have a public float of at least 200,000 shares
and a market capitalization of $1 million. Since the $1 million market capitalization requirement also represents
the maximum offering amount allowable under Rule 504, the Exchange is proposing to lower the effective market capitalization
threshold to $750,000, with a corresponding reduction in public float to 150,000 shares and in net worth to $750,000.
This reduction would provide a viable range of $750,000 to $1 million for SCOR offerings, making allowances for potential
costs associated with the offering. The Exchange believes that, with these modifications, the SCOR listing program
will be more viable in enabling bona fide companies to raise capital pursuant to Rule 504. The Exchange also believes
that these proposed changes to the initial listing requirements for SCOR securities will continue to ensure adequate
public distribution, and will not inhibit the growth of the trading markets or negatively influence specialists'
abilities to maintain fair and orderly markets. The public float requirement of 150,000 shares exceeds the NASDAQ
Small Cap initial listing standard of 100,000 shares. Moreover, the Exchange's calculation of public float is more
stringent than that of the NASD in that it excludes any concentrated holdings of 5% or more.

4

 Finally, because certain SCOR offerings may be ``integrated,''

5

 it is conceivable that the applicant issuer may have a greater public distribution than initially expected and, therefore,
would further exceed the minimum requirements.





Net Worth and Net Tangible Assets


To prevent a company that has no tangible assets net of liabilities from being listed, the Exchange will apply both
net worth and net tangible assets as a test. Accordingly, proposed Rule 3.2(t)(2) would require that a company have
both net tangible assets of at least $500,000 and a total net worth of at least $750,000.


Audited Financial Statements


Proposed Rule 3.2(t)(4) provides that, at the time of its application, the issuer must provide the Exchange with audited
financial statements for the most recent fiscal year-end (and unaudited interim financial statements), and that
such statements must be prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.


Qualitative Listing Requirements


Proposed Rule 3.2(t)(6) sets forth additional qualitative requirements in determining a company's listing eligibility.
The fact that an applicant may meet the numerical requirements does not mean that its application will be approved.
The Exchange recognizes the potential for investor risk in SCOR securities; however, the Exchange is confident that
through a rigorous merit review process, it can attain the mutual goals of supporting small business capital formation
while providing sufficient protection for the investing public.


Preferred Stock_Anti-Dilution Clause


The Exchange is proposing in Commentary .04 to Rule 3.2(t) to provide that it will not list convertible preferred issues
containing a provision that permits the company, at its discretion, to reduce the conversion price of its stock other
than in accordance with the terms of the company's articles of incorporation or any amendments thereof made contemporaneously
with the offering under which the issuer is applying for listing.


Representations of Approval for Listing


The Exchange has added language that clearly prohibits a company or broker-dealer from misrepresenting SCOR securities
as having been approved for Exchange listing when, in fact, they have not been approved. Accordingly, the Exchange
is proposing to add Commentary .05 to Rule 3.2(t) stating that any reference to this Exchange made either by the issuer
or the underwriter of the issuer in any prospectus, offering circular, or similar document that reasonably implies
endorsement or listing approval by the Exchange, and which is made without the prior consent to the Exchange, is prohibited.

6






Delisting


Proposed Rule 3.5(r), Commentary .01, has been revised to incorporate specific times required for compliance with
certain maintenance requirements once a deficiency has occurred. The commentary now states that a company with a
deficiency in either market value of public float or minimum bid price for ten consecutive business days shall have
90 days thereafter in which to comply with the maintenance requirements. It further states that, should the deficiency
continue beyond the prescribed period, the Exchange shall delist the security.


2. Statutory Basis


The proposal is consistent with Section 6(b) of the Act, in general, and Section 6(b)(5), in particular, in that it
is designed to facilitate transactions in securities, to promote just and equitable principles of trade, and to protect
investors and the public interest.

B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition


The Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any burden on competition that is not necessary
or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act.


C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants
or Others


The Commission published the Exchange's rule proposal to list SCOR securities in July 1993.
 Several comment letters were received by the Commission, including comments from the California Department of Corporations
 and NASAA's Small Business Capital Formation Committee.
 While these comment letters generally supported the Exchange's overall policy objectives to facilitate capital
formation for small companies and to provide public investors in those securities with more liquidity, the agencies
recommended that revisions be made to the Exchange's rule proposal to strengthen the qualitative listing requirements
in order to ensure adequate investor protection. They also suggested that more precise language be incorporated
to assure that the listings requirements would not be waived.







In the months that followed (September 1993 through May 1994) the Exchange consulted extensively with the California
Department of Corporations and NASAA
 to resolve the above-mentioned comments as well as other questions that were subsequently raised during this time
interval. After careful review and consideration of all the information received from the aforementioned parties,
the Exchange incorporated new language into the rules that the Exchange Staff believes satisfactorily addresses
these comments. A number of minor changes have been made throughout the filing for stylistic and clarification purposes.




The most substantive comments received by the Exchange that precipitated this amendment are categorically discussed
below.


Representations of Approval for Listing


In the original proposal, NASAA was troubled by the lack of a definitive enforcement standard precluding companies
(or underwriters) from falsely claiming in a prospectus that the securities being offered were approved for listing
on the Exchange. The Exchange appreciated NASAA's concerns that a company or broker-dealer may employ such a scheme
to defraud any prospective investor by misrepresenting that SCOR securities have been approved for listing. To address
this concern, the Exchange has added more precise language that clearly prohibits this practice.






Qualitative Listing Requirements


As mentioned above, the California Department of Corporations and NASAA suggested that the Exchange incorporate
additional qualitative factors that would be evaluated in determining a company's listing eligibility. Therefore,
the Exchange expanded and provided further specificity to the guidelines to be considered in the review of any listing
application. The standards set forth in proposed Rules 3.2(a) and 3.2(t)(6) are intended to provide guidelines that
will be strictly enforced. The fact that an applicant may meet the numerical requirements does not mean that its application
will be necessarily approved.


Compliance with Listing Requirements for Minimum Price and Market Capitalization


In a letter dated March 21, 1994, the California Department of Corporations questioned how and when the initial listing
requirement for market capitalization would be calculated. In order to eliminate any potential confusion in determining
whether the issuer satisfies the initial price per share and market capitalization requirements, the Exchange decided
to provide further specificity to the pricing guidelines.
 The Exchange felt that any direct reference to the term ``market value'' as proposed in the original rule filing would
be inappropriate because there is no practical means to establish how and when market value is calculated.




Trading Environment


The Exchange received comment letters from the California Department of Corporations and NASAA, dated March 21 and
April 13, 1994, respectively, which expressed similar concerns regarding the role and obligations of the specialist
in trading SCOR securities. On May 2, 1994, the Exchange provided the California Department of Corporations with
a formal response to their inquiry and cited specific provisions of Exchange regulations governing a specialist's
trading obligations, capital requirements, and performance standards. In this letter, the Exchange made a strong
commitment toward ensuring that their SCOR listing policies and trading procedures would be effectively applied
and well administered.


III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action


Within 35 days of the publication of this notice in the 

Federal Register

 or within such other period: (i) As the Commission may designate up to 90 days of such date if it finds such longer period
to be appropriate and publishes its reasons for so finding or (ii) as to which the self-regulatory organization consents,
the Commission will:
(A) by order approve the proposed rule change, or
(B) institute proceedings to determine whether the proposed rule change should be disapproved.


IV. Solicitation of Comments


Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public

Notice of Intent.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The FHWA is issuing this notice to advise the public that an environmental impact statement will be prepared for proposed
highway improvements on Interstate Route 66 in Prince William County, Virginia. These improvements will provide
access to transportation facilities and related development in the area including the proposed Disney development.
The pending FHWA action is a decision on a VDOT proposal for (1) a new interchange access to I-66 west of the existing
I-66/Route 15 interchange, (2) modifications to the existing I-66/Route 15 interchange and (3) modifications
to the existing I-66/Route 29 Interchange. There are no federal funds involved in the proposed transportation
improvements at these sites.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The FHWA, participating with the Virginia Department of Transportation (VDOT), will prepare an environmental impact
statement (EIS) on the federal actions which include modifications to the existing I-66/Route 15 interchange,
modifications to the existing I-66/Route 29 interchange and a new access point to I-66 west of Route 15
interchange. In addition, the EIS will include a discussion of: (1) The widening of I-66 from Route 234 to approximately
2 miles west of the existing interchange with Route 15, a distance of approximately 8.5 miles (the proposed improvements
are considered necessary to improve traffic flow along the I-66 corridor, accommodate current and projected
traffic demands, to serve existing and future access needs in the region and to improve transportation safety); (2)
the widening of Route 15 and (3) the relocation of portions of Routes 55 and 681 near the I-66 interchange.



Alternatives under consideration include, but are not limited to: (1) Taking no action (no build); (2) Transportation
System Management Activities (improving present systems); (3) transit options; (4) upgrading existing roadways
and build alternatives based on variations of typical section, grade and alignment and (5) combinations of alternatives.

The subject areas to be studied in the EIS process will include, but are not limited to: traffic and transportation
service, air quality, noise, surface and groundwater resources, soils and geology, wetlands, vegetation and wildlife,
farmlands, visual, community impacts, historic sites and structures and archaeological resources, parks, wildlife
refuges and recreational areas, construction impacts, secondary impacts of the proposed transportation project
and cumulative impacts.

Information describing the proposed action and study will be provided to appropriate Federal, State, and local agencies
and to private organizations and citizens who have previously expressed or are known to have an interest in this project
to solicit their comments. An extensive public and interagency involvement process will be maintained throughout
the EIS process. Public meetings will be held at a number of locations. In addition, a formal public hearing will also
be held after the issuance of the draft EIS. The draft EIS will be available for public and agency review and comment
prior to the formal public hearing. Public notice will be given of the time and place of these meetings and of the hearing.
A decision has been made to conduct scoping for this project and following publication of this Notice of Intent, the
FHWA and VDOT will begin the scoping process in accordance with 40 CFR 1501.7. Times and locations of the scoping meetings
have not yet been set. To ensure that the full range of issues related to this proposed action are addressed and all significant
issues are identified, comments and suggestions are invited from all interested parties. Comments or questions
concerning this proposed action and the EIS should be directed to the FHWA or to the VDOT at the addresses provided above.

<DOCTITLE>Sentencing Guidelines for United States Courts </DOCTITLE>


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 United States Sentencing Commission.

 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of priority areas for Commission research and amendment study. Request for public comment. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 As part of its continuing analysis of sentencing issues, including the operation of the federal sentencing guidelines,
the Commission has identified certain priorities as the principal focus of its work in the coming year and, in some
cases, beyond. Following the practice of past years, the Commission invites comment on the identified priorities
(including the scope and manner of study, particular problem areas and possible solutions, and any other matters
relevant to an identified priority). The Commission also invites comment on any other aspect of guideline application
that it should address during the coming year.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The United States Sentencing Commission, an independent commission in the judicial branch of the United States Government,
is empowered under 28 U.S.C. 994(a) to promulgate sentencing guidelines and policy statements for federal sentencing
courts. The statute further directs the Commission to review and revise promulgated guidelines periodically and
authorizes it to submit guideline amendments to the Congress not later than the first day of May each year. See 28 U.S.C.
994(o), (p). 


As in previous years, by this announcement the Commission begins the amendment cycle by soliciting formal and informal
comment regarding certain areas upon which the Commission expects to concentrate its attention during the coming
year. This notice provides interested persons with an early opportunity to inform the Commission of legal, operational,
or policy concerns within the identified areas relating to the guidelines and to suggest specific solutions and alternative
approaches. In late 1994 or early 1995, the Commission expects to publish in the 

Federal Register

 a formal notice of proposed amendments and amendment issues and will invite comment on those proposals. 
Following are the priority areas for amendment study, research, or other planned actions identified by the Commission.
Where possible, a general timeframe for the initiative is indicated. These timeframes should be considered subject
to change as the Commission deems necessary. 
 Implementation of the 1994 crime bill directives_Implementation of the crime bill (expected to be finalized
by Congress in the summer of 1994) will be the Commission's most time-sensitive project. A substantial number of provisions
in the bill can be expected to require Commission attention, some involving proposed guideline amendments and others
entailing study, e.g., a study of crack and powder cocaine. The Commission expects these implementation efforts
to be its top priority, with an anticipated completion date of December 1, 1994, or as directed by the statute. 
 Comprehensive review and revision of the drug offense guidelines_Based on Commission discussion of amendments,
continuing issues in the courts, and debate on the 1994 crime bill, it is clear that the sentences of drug offenders,
who represent nearly 50 percent of defendants in federal courts, remain a major issue of concern. In particular, the
appropriate weight to assign to drug quantity in relation to other factors, such as role and violence, remains a critical
issue for Commission investigation in the upcoming amendment cycle. 
 Symposium on organizational guidelines_At Commission direction, a staff working group is creating an agenda
for a symposium/workshop on organizational guidelines. The completed agenda with proposed program participants
will be submitted to the Commission at its September meeting. 
 Implementation of the new ASSYST and Automated Order of Judgment in a Criminal Case computer programs_These
programs will reach the field implementation stage in the coming year. Field testing of the Automated Order of Judgment
in a Criminal Case began in June 1994. An updated version of ASSYST (a computer program to help users apply the guidelines)
will be ready for field distribution in October 1994. 
 Real offense conduct data collection_The 1994 Annual Report will include information from the Commission's
newly developed real offense conduct module now undergoing final testing and development.

 Substantial assistance working group_This ongoing working group will proceed immediately with the data
collection portion of its study effort. A preliminary report should be submitted to the Commission in December 1994.

 Comprehensive guideline simplification_A long-term staff working group will focus on simplification of
the guidelines. The working group will develop a plan for Commission consideration by December 1, 1994. 
 Plea bargaining_The Commission's Office of Policy Analysis will design a follow-up study of the results reported
by Commissioner Ilene H. Nagel and Professor Stephen Schulhofer, examining changes that have occurred since the
conclusion of their study. This new study, in combination with the Commission's guideline evaluation work and the
Nagel/Schulhofer findings, should form the basis for a reassessment of the initial policy statements in Chapter
Six of the Guidelines Manual. The research design should be complete by January 1, 1995. 
 Just punishment study_Data collection for the Commission's statutorily directed study of the just punishment
purpose of sentencing has been completed. The complete report should be received by the Commission by January 1, 1995.

 Crime mix study_A crime mix study by the Commission's research staff examined the nature of offenses occurring
over the past several years. The research question asks whether criminal offenses and offenders have become more
serious over time, thus providing additional explanation for the increase in incarceration rates. Data collection
is complete, and the report is in the drafting stage. The Commission expects to receive a final draft of the report by
September 30, 1994. 
 Review of policy statements for revocation of probation and supervised release (Chapter Seven of the Guidelines
Manual)_Anticipating the passage of legislation as part of the crime bill to address a number of problem areas affecting
revocation of probation and supervised release, the Commission expects to begin a review of the revocation policy
statements to determine whether they should be promulgated as guidelines. Toward that end, the Commission expects
to increase efforts during the coming year to collect data from all districts and assess how the policy statements
are operating. 
 Joint Bureau of Prisons/Administrative Office/Federal Judicial Center/Sentencing Commission group to
study retroactivity issues_The Judicial Conference Criminal Law Committee, at its June meeting, authorized Federal
Judicial Center staff to convene an interagency group to examine a broad spectrum of issues related to retroactivity
of amended guidelines and resentencing, undoubtedly bringing policy issues to the Commission and the Criminal Law
Committee for consideration at some future date. 
 Departures_In the summer of 1994 Commissioners Ilene Nagel and Michael Gelacak are expected to submit a preliminary
analysis of departure decisions involving six judicial circuits. 
 Commission operating rules and procedures_As authorized by statute and recommended by a number of groups,
the Commission intends to develop, publish for comment, and adopt additional internal rules of procedure governing
such matters as the conduct of Commission meetings, the amendment process, and operation of advisory committees.
Preliminary work on these rules will begin immediately. 
 Geriatric offenders_Preliminary work is underway on issues related to sentencing and sentence administration
of geriatric offenders. The Commission's Policy Analysis group will complete preliminary data analysis within
the next several months, and the Commission will continue to work cooperatively with the Bureau of Prisons on these
issues. 
 Criminal history_Considerable research related to criminal history currently is underway by the Commission
to assist in reevaluating original policy choices reflected in the criminal history guidelines. Commission staff
will report the results of various relevant studies over the course of the coming year. The criminal history guidelines
will also be studied for ways to simplify them. 
 Organizational guidelines for environmental and food and drug offenses_Guideline development for organizational
defendants convicted of environmental and food and drug offenses will proceed deliberately pending appointment
of a full slate of Commissioners. 
The Commission welcomes comment about the aforementioned issues as well as any other aspect of guideline application
or implementation of the Sentencing Reform Act.

<USDEPT>DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION</USDEPT>



<DOCTITLE>Cooperative Demonstration Program (Correctional Education) </DOCTITLE>


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Department of Education.

 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of final priorities, required activities, selection criteria, and other requirements for grants to be made
in fiscal year 1995.

 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Secretary announces priorities for awards to be made in fiscal year (FY) 1995 using funds appropriated in FY 1994
under the Cooperative Demonstration Program, which is authorized by the Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Applied Technology
Education Act (Perkins Act). Under the absolute priority, funds under this competition would be reserved for applications
proposing to demonstrate successful cooperation between the private sector and public agencies in vocational education
programs that serve criminal offenders under the supervision of the justice system. In addition, the Secretary particularly
invites applications that, within the absolute priority on correctional education, incorporate one or more of the
following invitational priorities: (1) advanced technologies; (2) community-based correctional education;
and (3) juvenile justice education. The Secretary also imposes requirements related to the priorities and other
matters, and will use new selection criteria in evaluating applications submitted for this competition only. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Cooperative Demonstration Program provides financial assistance for, among other things, model projects that
demonstrate successful cooperation between the private sector (including employers, consortia of employers,
labor organizations, building trade councils, and private agencies, organizations, and institutions) and public
agencies in vocational education (including State boards for vocational education, State or local corrections
or correctional education agencies, or eligible recipients as defined in 34 CFR 400.4). This program can help further
the purposes of the National Education Goals; specifically, the correctional education priority directly supports
the Goal that, by the year 2000, every adult American will be literate and will possess the knowledge and skills necessary
to compete in a global economy and exercise the rights and responsibilities of citizenship. 



The designation of correctional education as a priority under the Cooperative Demonstration program is based on
the critical problems of illiteracy and recidivism pervading our Nation's adult and juvenile corrections population.
The U.S. Department of Education's National Adult Literacy Survey Report, ``Literacy Behind Prison Walls'' described
a 70 percent illiteracy rate among a sample of prisoners as follows: 




About seven in ten prisoners * * * are apt to experience difficulty in performing tasks
that require them to integrate or synthesize information from complex or lengthy texts or to perform quantitative
tasks that involve two or more sequential operations and that require the individual to set up the problem (1993, p.
vi). 




Additionally, a recent study, ``Vocational and Academic Indicators of Parole Success,'' published in the 

Journal of Correctional Education

, found that inmates who had received academic and vocational training while in prison were more likely to be employed
and less likely to commit crimes after their release than other inmates (Schumacker, et al., 1990). 

Academic and vocational training is also critical for probationers and parolees, since the majority of the Nation's
criminal offenders are serving sentences within community corrections settings. According to the Bureau of Justice
Statistics, there were about 3.5 million adults under correctional supervision in the United States at the beginning
of 1993. Of these, 2.6 million, or 74 percent, were under active probation or parole supervision within the community.

Educational programs for criminal offenders that use applied learning strategies to teach life skills, job skills,
and literacy can reduce the likelihood that the offenders will return to the criminal justice system. After completing
their sentences, ex-offenders often have limited opportunities for meaningful employment and lack necessary basic
life skills, including the job-seeking and job-retention skills needed to obtain and maintain employment. Without
basic literacy and job skills, it is unlikely that these persons will become fully productive members of society.

On April 6, 1994, the Secretary published a notice of proposed priorities, required activities, selection criteria,
and other requirements for the Cooperative Demonstration Program (Correctional Education) in the 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 16192).

 




Note: 

This notice of final priorities does 

not

 solicit applications. A notice inviting applications under this competition is published in a separate notice in
this issue of the 

Federal Register

. 


Analysis of Comments and Changes 


In response to the Secretary's invitation in the notice of proposed priority, 18 parties submitted comments. An analysis
of the specific comments follows: 


Absolute and Invitational Priorities 




Comments: 

One commenter recommended that priority be given to programs that build on correctional education projects previously
funded under the Cooperative Demonstration Program. 


Discussion: 

The Secretary intended that previously funded correctional education demonstration grants, awarded in September
1992, include plans for continuing after Federal funding ends, as demonstrated by the selection criteria used in
the earlier competition. The Secretary believes that while expanding previously funded programs may indeed be worthwhile,
other projects should be afforded the opportunity to compete for these limited Federal funds. Nevertheless, previously
funded projects are eligible to apply for funds under this competition on the same basis as other projects. 



Changes: 

None. 



Comments: 

Several commenters made suggestions for more comprehensive services to be identified under the proposed priorities,
including: pre-vocational assessment, individual training plans for students, case management as an approach
to providing social services for released offenders, student retention as an outcome measure, use of support systems
in the community, and the availability of non-traditional vocational training programs for female offenders. One
commenter recommended that invitational priorities be created for offenders with special learning needs and histories
of substance abuse. One commenter also recommended that the coordination of the academic, vocational, and substance
abuse treatment components be an integral feature of the funded projects.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940713-2-00158 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940713-2-00095 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 



Discussion: 

The Secretary acknowledges that all of these components would provide more comprehensive services and, under the
existing priority, they may be included in an application at the applicant's discretion. The priority has been designed
to allow an applicant flexibility and creativity to meet the needs that exist in its own institution or community.



Changes: 

None. 


Comments: 

One commenter suggested that eligibility be expanded to include those who are not former offenders. This commenter
also proposed that Federal funds be used to pay for internships in for-profit institutions. 


Discussion: 

The Secretary believes that this competition should be limited to projects that will serve criminal offenders under
the supervision of the justice system, including those on probation and parole. As discussed elsewhere in this notice,
this priority was chosen based on the critical problems of literacy and recidivism pervasive among the adult and juvenile
corrections population. 
With respect to the comment concerning the use of Federal funds to pay for internships in for-profit institutions,
the Secretary does not believe that this type of assistance is necessary for the successful completion of projects
that address the absolute priority established in this notice. 


Changes: 

None. 


Comments: 

One commenter suggested aligning the priority with the School-to-Work Opportunities Act and national skill standards.
In addition, the commenter recommended that the priority reflect current U.S. Department of Labor policy regarding
education and workforce development. 


Discussion: 

The Secretary believes the priority is consistent with the School-to-Work Opportunities Act and the Goals 2000:
Educate America Act. For example, the priority includes such components as work-based and school-based learning,
transition activities, and partnerships between public and private agencies, required in the School-to-Work Opportunities
Act. The priority also targets the National Education Goals of adult literacy and life long learning. 
The Goals 2000: Educate America Act established a Skills Standards Board. A primary responsibility of the Board will
be to coordinate the development of voluntary national skill standards. At this time, national skill standards do
not exist; therefore, applicants are encouraged to use common standards that have been developed by trade and professional
associations, such as the National Occupational Competency Testing Institute and the Vocational-Technical Education
Consortium of States, or other standards that are being utilized in current training programs, including those being
developed by organizations under contract with the Departments of Education and Labor. 


Changes: 

None. 


Comments: 

One commenter stated that, as currently written, the absolute priority rendered them ineligible because their State
legislature mandates that instruction be separate from custody.

<DOCNO> FR940713-2-00159 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940713-2-00095 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 



Discussion:

 The Secretary acknowledges the unique circumstances surrounding education and vocational training programs for
incarcerated and detained individuals. This competition, however, is specifically designed to include all criminal
offenders including those in community corrections settings and, therefore, does not exclude State systems that
separate custody from instruction, as long as a private sector entity is involved in the proposed project as well.



Changes:

 None. 


Definitions 




Comments:

 One commenter requested that the definition of ``community corrections'' be expanded to include individuals who
may not be under the supervision of a parole or probation officer and are in the community, e.g., halfway house residents,
pre-release residents, or work release program participants. 



Discussion:

 Under the absolute priority, individuals under the supervision of the criminal justice system, including halfway
house residents, pre-release residents and work release program participants, are eligible to be served. (34 CFR
400.4 defines ``criminal offender'' as any individual who is charged with, or convicted of, any criminal offense,
including a youth offender or a juvenile offender and ``correctional institution'' as any prison, jail, reformatory,
work farm, detention center, or halfway house, community-based rehabilitation center, or any other similar institution
designed for the confinement or rehabilitation of criminal offenders.) Only invitational priority 2_community
corrections is limited to criminal offenders under the supervision of a parole or probation officer. 



Changes:

 None. 


Comments:

 One commenter suggested that the definition of ``life skills'' be aligned with the recommendations in a report issued
by the Department of Labor, the Secretary's Commission on Achieving Necessary Skills (SCANS). The commenter suggested
that the life skills definition be expanded to include a number of basic, thinking, interpersonal, and resource management
skills including moral, social and religious values, managing personal finances, and human resources management.



Discussion:

 The definition of ``life skills'' is consistent with many of the workplace competencies identified in SCANS. In this
notice, ``life skills'' is broadly defined to include self-development, communication, job development, and education;
however, certain limitations do exist. For example, ``life skills'' does not include moral, social and religious
values, personal finances, and human resource management because these activities are not the types of assistance
that are necessary for the success of projects that address the absolute priority established in this notice. Therefore,
these are not included in the definition of ``life skills.'' 


Changes:

 None. 


Selection Criteria 




Comments:

 One commenter believed the State's colleges would be ineligible for assistance under the priority because the ``Program
Factors'' selection criterion rewards correctional education programs that provide learning situated at worksite
locations outside of institutions and requires interdisciplinary staff in-service education that includes security
personnel. 


Discussion:

 The purpose of this competition is to demonstrate successful cooperation between the private sector and public agencies
in vocational education programs, and to provide transition from correctional education programs to productive
employment. This includes, among other things, work experience or employment based learning programs. The priority
and selection criteria, however, do not stipulate where the work experience is to occur or how it may be accomplished,
thus allowing the applicant creativity and flexibility in developing a model. 
Interdisciplinary staff in-service education involving security personnel is an important component found in
comprehensive correctional education programs already funded by the Department of Education and, for this reason,
is reflected in the selection criteria. Such interaction supports team building and an education system that is mutually
beneficial to both education and corrections staff. 


Changes:

 None. 


Other Requirements 




Comments:

 Two commenters expressed concern regarding the requirement that projects funded under this competition not spend
more than 10 percent of their grant funds for equipment. The commenters indicated that the Secretary's invitational
priority for applications that incorporate the use of interactive instructional technologies, such as distance
learning, in the context of both student learning and staff in-service training, would require a substantial investment
in equipment. 


Discussion:

 The Secretary believes that limiting the amount of Federal funds used to purchase equipment to a maximum of 10 percent
is appropriate for this competition. The Secretary also emphasizes that, while the use of Federal funds for equipment
is limited to not more than 10 percent, matching funds may be used for this purpose. 
The primary purpose of this competition is to enhance, expand, and demonstrate successful training programs. If
more than 10 percent of the Federal funds were to be used to purchase equipment, the intended purpose of the projects
would be diminished. This restriction will help ensure that the funds available are used where they are needed most
to train students. Projects funded under the Cooperative Demonstration Program must be capable of wide replication.
If a large percentage of Federal funds are used to purchase equipment, the possibilities for replication become limited.
The Secretary therefore, believes it is necessary to limit the use of Federal funds for equipment purchases, to ensure
that project replication is possible and to improve accountability of funds for direct training of students. 


Changes:

 None.

Absolute Priority 


Under 34 CFR 75.105(c)(3), the Secretary gives an absolute preference to applications that meet the following priority.
The Secretary will fund under this competition only model projects that demonstrate ways in which public agencies
in vocational education and the private sector can work together effectively to assist vocational education students
who are criminal offenders under the supervision of the justice system to attain the advanced level of skills they
need to make a successful transition from correctional education programs to productive employment including_
(a) Work experience or apprenticeship programs; 
(b) Transitional worksite job training for vocational education students that is related to their occupational
goals and closely linked to classroom and laboratory instruction provided by an eligible recipient; 
(c) Placement services in occupations that the students are preparing to enter; 
(d) If practical, projects that will benefit the public, such as the rehabilitation of public schools or housing in
inner cities or economically depressed rural areas; or 
(e) Employment-based learning programs. 


Required Activities 


The Secretary requires that any projects funded under this competition_
(a) Coordinate with community agencies that furnish transitional supportive services to criminal offenders such
as individual and family counseling, housing assistance, transportation, and social and cultural activities;

(b) Include a well-designed staff inservice education component to insure the effective implementation of the program;

(c) Address the special learning needs of offenders; 
(d) Use applied learning strategies to teach life skills, jobs skills, and literacy; 
(e) If applicable, provide for a transition from institutional environments to community settings; 
(f) Address State and local labor shortages and consult the State Occupational Information Coordinating Committee
or State Labor Market Information Unit in making this determination; and 
(g) Must submit proof of committed partnerships between public agencies and the private sector. The definitions
of ``private'' and ``public'' contained in 34 CFR 77.1 do not include entities under the supervision or control of
the Federal Government; thus, Federal entities, including Federal prisons, are not eligible members of the partnerships
required by 34 CFR 426.4(b). 
This program activity is authorized by section 420A(a)(2) of the Perkins Act (Pub. L. 101-392, 104 Stat. 753
(1990)). 


Invitational Priorities 


Within the absolute priority specified in this notice, the Secretary is particularly interested in applications
that meet one or more of the following invitational priorities. However, under 34 CFR 75.105(c)(1), an application
that meets these invitational priorities does not receive competitive or absolute preference over other applications:



Invitational Priority 1_Advanced Technologies 


Projects that incorporate the use of interactive instructional technologies, such as distance learning, in the
context of both student training and staff inservice training. 


Invitational Priority 2_Community Corrections 


Projects that provide integrated vocational and academic education to individuals on probation or parole in community
corrections. 


Invitational Priority 3_Juvenile Justice Education 


Projects that provide integrated vocational and academic education to students in the juvenile justice system.
This may include youth placed in detention centers, training schools, boot camps, or community-based programs.



Definitions 


As used in this notice_
``Applied learning'' is actively student-oriented, characterized by lively classroom discussions, absorbing
group projects, meaningful homework assignments, laboratory experiments, live and videotaped presentations,
and other hands-on activities. The purpose of applied learning is to create an environment that actively engages
students and teachers in a collaborative learning process. 
``Community corrections'' refers to programs serving probationers and parolees.

The program narrative will comprise the largest portion of your application. This part is where you spell out the who,
what, when, where, why, and how of your proposed project.
Although you will not have a form to fill out for your narrative, there is a format. This format is the 

selection criteria.

 Because your application will be reviewed and rated by a review panel on the basis of the selection criteria, your narrative
should follow the order and format of the criteria.
Before preparing your application, you should carefully read the legislation and regulations of the program, eligibility
requirements, information on any priority set by the Secretary, and the selection criteria for this competition.
Your program narrative should be clear, concise, and to the point. Begin the narrative with a one page abstract or summary
of your proposed project. Then describe the project in detail, addressing each selection criterion in order.
The Secretary strongly requests you limit the program narrative to no more than 30 double-spaced, typed pages (on
one side only), although the Secretary will consider your application if it is longer. Be sure to number consecutively


ALL

 pages in your application.
You may include supporting documentation as appendices. Be sure that this material is concise and pertinent to this
program competition.
You are advised that:
(a) The Department considers only information contained in the application in ranking applications for funding
consideration. Letters of support sent separately from the formal application package are not considered in the
review by the technical review panels. (EDGAR Sec. 75.217)
(b) The technical review panel evaluates each application solely on the basis of the established technical review
criteria. Letters of support contained in the application will strengthen the application only insofar as they contain
commitments which pertain to the established technical review criteria, such as commitment and resources.

Appendix B 



Potential applicants frequently direct questions to officials of the Department regarding application notices
and programmatic and administrative regulations governing various direct grant programs. To assist potential
applicants the Department has assembled the following most commonly asked questions. 

Q. Can we get an extension of the deadline? 

A. No. A closing date may be changed only under extraordinary circumstances. Any change must be announced in the 

Federal Register

 and apply to all applications. Waivers for individual applications cannot be granted regardless of the circumstances.


Q. How many copies of the application should I submit and must they be bound? 

A. Our new policy calls for an original and six copies to be submitted. The binding of applications is optional. 

Q. We just missed the deadline for the XXX competition. May we submit under another competition? 

A. Yes, however, the likelihood of success is not good. A properly prepared application must meet the requirements
of the competition to which it is submitted. 

Q. I'm not sure which competition is most appropriate for my project. What should I do? 

A. We are happy to discuss any questions with you and provide clarification on the unique elements of the various competitions.


Q. Will you help us prepare our application? 

A. We are happy to provide general program information. Clearly, it would not be appropriate for staff to participate
in the actual writing of an application, but we can respond to specific questions about application requirements,
evaluation criteria, and the priorities. Applicants should understand that this previous preapplication consultation
is not required, nor will it in any way influence the success of an application. 

Q. When will I find out if I'm going to be funded? 

A. You can expect to receive notification within 3 to 4 months of the application closing date, depending on the number
of applications received and the number of competitions with closing dates at about the same time. 

Q. Once my application has been reviewed by the review panel, can you tell me the outcome? 

A. No. Every year we are called by a number of applicants who have legitimate reasons for needing to know the outcome
of the review prior to official notification. Some applicants need to make job decisions, some need to notify a local
school district, etc. Regardless of the reason, because final funding decisions have not been made at that point,
we cannot share information about the review with anyone. 

Q. Will my application be returned if I am not funded? 

A. We no longer return unsuccessful applications. Thus, applicants should retain at least one copy of the application.


Q. Can I obtain copies of reviewers' comments? 

A. Upon written request, reviewers' comments will be mailed to unsuccessful applicants. 

Q. Is travel allowed under these projects? 

A. Travel associated with carrying out the project is allowed. Because we will request the project directors and evaluators
of funded projects to attend an annual project directors meeting, you should include annual trips for each to Washington,
DC., in the travel budget. Travel to conferences is sometimes allowed when it is for purposes of dissemination. 

Q. If my application receives high scores from the reviewers, does that mean that I will receive funding? 

A. Not necessarily. It is often the case that the number of applications scored highly by the reviewers exceeds the
dollars available for funding projects under a particular competition. The order of selection, which is based on
the scores of all the applications and other relevant factors, determines the applications that can be funded. 

Q. What happens during negotiations? 

A. During negotiations technical and budget issues may be raised. These are issues that have been identified during
the panel and staff reviews that require clarification. Sometimes issues are stated as ``conditions.'' These are
issues that have been identified as so critical that the award cannot be made unless those conditions are met. Questions
may also be raised about the proposed budget. Generally, these issues are raised because there is inadequate justification
or explanation of a particular budget item, or because the budget item seems unimportant to the successful completion
of the project. If you are asked to make changes that you feel could seriously affect the project's success, you may
provide reasons for not making the changes or provide alternative suggestions. Similarly, if proposed budget reductions
will, in your opinion, seriously affect the project activities, you may explain why and provide additional justification
for the proposed expenses. An award cannot be made until all negotiation issues have been resolved. 

Q. How do I provide an assurance? 

A. Except for SF-424B, ``Assurances_Non-Construction Programs,'' simply state in writing that you are meeting
a proscribed requirement. 

Q. Where can copies of the 

Federal Register

, program regulations, and Federal statutes be obtained? 

A. Copies of these materials can usually be found at your local library. If not, they can be obtained from the Government
Printing Office by writing to: Superintendent of Documents, U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, DC. 20402.
Telephone: (202) 783-3238. When requesting copies of regulations or statutes, it is helpful to use the specific
name, public law number, or part number. The material referenced in this notice should be referred to as follows: 

(1) Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Applied Technology Education Act (Perkins Act) (Public Law 101-392, 104
Stat. 753 (1990)). 

(2) State Vocational and Applied Technology Education Programs and National Discretionary Programs of Vocational
Education Final Regulations, 34 CFR Parts 400 and 426. 

(3) Education Department General Administrative Regulations, 34 CFR Parts 74, 75, 77, 79, 80, 81, 82, 85, and 86. 

Q. What are the Department of Education's Program Effectiveness Panel and National Diffusion Network? 

A. The Program Effectiveness Panel (PEP) is the Department of Education's primary mechanism for validating the effectiveness
of educational programs developed by schools, universities, and other agencies. The National Diffusion Network
(NDN) is a Federally funded dissemination system that helps public and private schools, colleges, and other educational
institutions improve by sharing successful education programs, products, and processes. 
Regulations governing PEP and NDN are codified at 34 CFR Parts 785-789. For information about PEP, prospective
applicants may wish to read 

Making the Case: Evidence of Effectiveness in Schools and Classrooms

, which contains criteria and guidelines for submitting project results to PEP. This publication, as well as information
about NDN, is available from RMC Research Corporation, 1000 Market Street, Portsmouth, New Hampshire 03801. Telephone
1-800-258-0802. RMC Research Corporation can also provide information about consultants who
have conducted evaluations that have been approved by PEP.

PRIORITY:

 Under 34 CFR 75.105(c)(3) the Secretary proposes to give an absolute preference to applications that meet the following
priority. The Secretary proposes to fund under this program only applications that meet this absolute priority:



Priority: International Exchange of Information and Experts 



Background



Since 1973, NIDRR has had statutory authority to conduct international research and development and to exchange
rehabilitation and special education experts with other nations. International research and development activities
significantly can change the perspectives of service providers and researchers, provide data for the evaluation
of domestic programs, and offer new insights and new practices that can solve some of the old rehabilitation problems.
Learning about the technical and cultural aspects of other countries' rehabilitation practices may assist U.S.
rehabilitation practioners to improve the effectiveness of the services they provide, especially for minority
and immigrant populations.

In the past, NIDRR approached international activities in two ways. NIDRR funded two projects to facilitate fellowships
of non-governmental experts to other countries to gather data on practices, legislation, and policy. NIDRR also
engaged in international activities on a government-to-government basis, participating in international policy
and data generation through international organizations such as the U.N., Federal agencies such as the Department
of State and the Peace Corps, direct grants to foreign research agencies, participation in foreign research consortia
and conferences, and facilitation of site visits and study tours for foreign visitors.

In order to enhance the impact of international activities on the U.S. rehabilitation field, NIDRR now seeks to fund
a single project that will facilitate the exchange of both domestic and foreign experts in rehabilitation research
and technical assistance; facilitate international conferences; disseminate useful information to rehabilitation
personnel and researchers, independent living centers, and families; assist in relevant site visitations by foreign
government officials; and develop training modules that increase participation in international activities by
rehabilitation practitioners, policymakers, and individuals with disabilities.



Priority



A project on the international exchange of information and experts shall_

 Gather information on international rehabilitation issues, legislation, and programs, and maintain a database
of such information that is available to relevant research projects and training projects, including those supported
by NIDRR, the Office of Special Education Programs (OSEP), and the Rehabilitation Services Administration (RSA);


 Include individuals with disabilities to the maximum extent possible in all project activities;

 Facilitate small annual conferences to explore international issues or to share rehabilitation information
and data with other governments;

 Assist foreign and domestic professionals or consumers to plan trips by identifying potential sites and contact
persons at each site;

 Establish an international exchange of research and technical assistance experts between foreign nations
and the U.S.;

 Share information with other Federal government agencies in order to assist them in the development of their
research priorities in the area of disability;

 Publish and disseminate data and information to relevant target audiences on relevant policy issues and legislation,
which are identified in conjunction with NIDRR;

 Develop training activities and materials to sensitize rehabilitation personnel, including special education
personnel, to cultural differences that can affect rehabilitation needs and approaches; and

 Develop training activities and materials on comparative research techniques, bilateral consultation
and technical assistance, utilizing the different international and cultural perspectives.




APPLICABLE PROGRAM REGULATIONS: 

34 CFR Parts 350 and 355. Program Authority: 29 U.S.C. 760-762.

Appendix_Analysis of Comments and Changes



The Department received 12 letters in response to the Notice of Proposed Priority. This Appendix contains an analysis
of the comments and of the changes in the priority since the publication of the Notice of Proposed Priority. The Appendix
does not address technical changes, suggested changes the Secretary is not legally authorized to make under applicable
statutory authority, and comments that are outside the scope of the proposed priority such as the size of the award,
the length of the project period, or the number of projects that will be awarded.



Comment:

 One commenter suggested that the project research employment systems in the other countries.



Discussion:

 The Secretary believes that applicants may propose to address employment systems that are related to rehabilitation
issues, legislation, and programs. The Secretary believes that applicants should be given the discretion to propose
issues that the project will address.



Changes:

 None.



Comment:

 One commenter suggested that the project should work in collaboration with other countries.



Discussion:

 The Secretary agrees and points out that the priority requires the project to ``Establish an international exchange
of research and technical assistance experts between foreign nations and the U.S.'' The Secretary does not believe
any further requirements are necessary.



Changes:

 None.



Comment:

 Three commenters observed that the requirement to maintain a library was a significant expense that would consume
a disproportionate amount of the project's resources. The commenters suggested requiring that the project maintain
a database instead of a library.



Discussion:

 The Secretary agrees that maintaining a library may be beyond the resources available to the project. The Secretary
also agrees with the suggestion to require the project to maintain a database instead of a library.



Changes:

 The project is required to maintain a database instead of a library.



Comment:

 Two commenters suggested that the project's various activities address policy as well as programmatic issues.



Discussion:

 The Secretary believes that the priority provides the project with the authority to address policy and programmatic
issues. The Secretary does not believe that any further requirements are necessary.



Changes:

 None.



Comment:

 Two commenters observed that the requirement to ``Assist both foreign and domestic professionals or consumers to
plan trips * * * through the development and listing of potential sites'' was a significant expense
that would consume a disproportional amount of the project's resources.



Discussion:

 The Secretary believes that the requirement to 

develop

 (emphasis added) and list potential sites may be interpreted to require the project to undertake activities that
are beyond the resources that will be available to the project. The Secretary believes that the project should assist
professionals and consumers to plan trips by identifying potential sites and contact persons at each site.



Changes:

 The project is required to assist foreign and domestic professionals or consumers to plan trips by identifying potential
sites and contact persons at each site.



Comment:

 One commenter recommended that the priority be revised to require that the majority of people who are exchanged be
individuals with disabilities. A second commenter observed that project activities that are directed by individuals
with disabilities are the most effective.



Discussion:

 The Secretary believes that the project should include individuals with disabilities to the maximum extent possible
in all aspects of the project.



Changes:

 The priority has been revised to require that the project include individuals with disabilities to the maximum extent
possible in all project activities.



Comment:

 One commenter suggested that the project provide training to mainstream international educational exchange programs
on equalizing opportunities for young persons with disabilities to participate in existing international educational
opportunities.



Discussion:

 The Secretary recognizes the need to increase opportunities for young persons with disabilities to participate
in existing international educational opportunities. However, the Secretary believes that such an activity is
outside the scope of the priority.



Changes:

 None.



Comment:

 One commenter suggested that the international exchange of experts and technical assistance should address skills
needed for creating policy and writing and passing legislation.



Discussion:

 The Secretary believes that the priority authorizes an applicant to address creating policy and writing and passing
legislation that bears upon rehabilitation issues. The Secretary does not believe that any further requirements
are necessary.



Changes:

 None.



Comment:

 One commenter suggested that special emphasis should be given to activities that teach technical skills and provide
employment opportunities for individuals with disabilities and that produce assistive technology that will improve
access for individuals with disabilities. The commenter also suggested that special emphasis should be given to
leadership training activities for individuals with disabilities and to women with disabilities in exchanges of
information and expertise.



Discussion:

 The Secretary believes that the areas of special emphasis suggested by the commenter are authorized by the priority.
However, the Secretary believes that applicants should have the discretion to propose a special emphasis on one or
more selected issues.



Changes:

 None.

Comment:

 One commenter suggested revising the priority to clarify whether the primary purpose of the project is to acquire
knowledge which can be applied to the U.S., and not to disseminate knowledge from the U.S. to other countries.



Discussion:

 The Secretary points out that the Background statement indicates that the purpose of this project is to ``assist U.S.
rehabilitation practioners to improve the effectiveness of the services they provide * * *''
and ``enhance the impact of international activities on the rehabilitation field.'' The Secretary agrees there
is a need to clarify that the reference to the rehabilitation field is to the U.S.



Changes:

 The Background statement has been revised to clarify that the purpose of the project is to enhance the impact of international
activities on the U.S. rehabilitation field.



Comment:

 One commenter suggested that the project should use the potential for continued relationships at the institutional
level as a criterion for selecting individuals for an exchange. The same commenter suggested that ``provision should
be made'' for funding joint projects of mutual benefit to U.S. and foreign institutions, ``taking advantage of previous
contacts made through earlier study visits.''



Discussion:

 The Secretary believes that on-going relationships at the institutional level and joint projects would be desirable
outcomes. However, the Secretary believes that applicants should be given the discretion to propose the process
and the criteria that will be used to select projects and individuals for an exchange.



Changes:

 None.



Comment:

 One commenter suggested revising the priority to encourage ``greater integration of the international program
with NIDRR's domestic program.''



Discussion:

 The Secretary believes that the project should make its database available to domestic research projects and training
projects, including those supported by NIDRR, OSEP, and RSA.



Changes:

 The priority has been revised to require the project to make its database on international rehabilitation issues,
legislation, and programs available to relevant research projects and training projects, including those supported
by NIDRR, the Office of Special Education Programs (OSEP), and the Rehabilitation Services Administration (RSA).

Appendix 


Application Forms and Instructions 


Applicants are advised to reproduce and complete the 
application forms in this Section. Applicants are required to 
submit an original and two copies of each application as provided 
in this Section. 



Frequent Questions


1. Can I Get an Extension of the Due Date? 


No! On rare occasions the Department of Education may 
extend a closing date for all applicants. If that occurs, a 
notice of the revised due date is published in the 

Federal 
Register

. However, there are no extensions or exceptions to the 
due date made for individual applicants. 



2. What Should be Included in the Application?


The application should include a project narrative, vitae of 
key personnel, and a budget, as well as the Assurances forms 
included in this package. Vitae of staff or consultants should 
include the individual's title and role in the proposed project, 
and other information that is specifically pertinent to this 
proposed project. The budgets for both the first year and 
subsequent project years should be included. 

If collaboration with another organization is involved in 
the proposed activity, the application should include assurances 
of participation by the other parties, including written 
agreements or assurances of cooperation. It is 

not 

useful to 
include general letters of support or endorsement in the 
application. 

If the applicant proposes to use unique tests or other 
measurement instruments that are not widely known in the field, it 
would be helpful to include the instrument in the application.

Many applications contain voluminous appendices that are not 
helpful and in many cases cannot even be mailed to the reviewers. 
It is generally not helpful to include such things as brochures, 
general capability statements of collaborating organizations, 
maps, copies of publications, or descriptions of other projects 
completed by the applicant. 



3. What Format Should be Used for the Application? 


NIDRR generally advises applicants that they may organize 
the application to follow the selection criteria that will be 
used. The specific review criteria vary according to the 
specific program, and are contained in this Consolidated 
Application Package. 



4. May I Submit Applications to More Than One NIDRR Program 
Competition or More Than One Application to a Program? 


Yes, you may submit applications to any program for which 
they are responsive to the program requirements. You may submit 
the same application to as many competitions as you believe 
appropriate. You may also submit more than one application in 
any given competition. 



5. What is the Allowable Indirect Cost Rate?


The limits on indirect costs vary according to the program 
and the type of application. 

Applicants in the FIR, and Innovation grants programs should 
limit indirect charges to the organization's approved rate. If 
the organization does not have an approved rate, the application 
should include an estimated actual rate. 



6. Can Profitmaking Businesses Apply for Grants? 


Yes. However, for-profit organizations will not be able to 
collect a fee or profit on the grant, and in some programs will 
be required to share in the costs of the project. 



7. Can Individuals Apply for Grants? 


No. Only organizations are eligible to apply for 

grants 


under NIDRR programs. 



8. Can NIDRR Staff Advise Me Whether My Project Is of Interest 
to NIDRR or Likely To Be Funded? 


No. NIDRR staff can advise you of the requirements of the 
program in which you propose to submit your application. 
However, staff cannot advise you of whether your subject area or 
proposed approach is likely to receive approval. 



9. How Do I Assure That My Application Will be Referred to the 
Most Appropriate Panel for Review? 


Applicants should be sure that their applications are 
referred to the correct competition by clearly including the 
competition title and CFDA number, including alphabetical code, 
on the Standard Form 424, and including the title of the priority 
to which they are responding. 



10. How Soon After Submitting My Application Can I Find Out if It Will be Funded? 


The time from closing date to grant award date varies from 
program to program. Generally speaking, NIDRR endeavors to have 
awards made within five to six months of the closing date. 
Unsuccessful applicants generally will be notified within that 
time frame as well. For the purpose of estimating a project 
start date, the applicant should estimate approximately six 
months from the closing date, but no later than the following 
September 30. 



11. Can I Call NIDRR to Find Out If My Application is Being 
Funded? 


No! When NIDRR is able to release informat
