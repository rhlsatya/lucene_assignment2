ACTION:

 Final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 On July 20, 1993 (58 FR 38666), the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (``NRC'' or ``Commission'') published a final rule
as a result of the U.S. Court of Appeals decision dated March 16, 1993. The final rule changed the method of allocating
low-level waste costs for FY 1993 in response to the court's decision. In its FY 1993 final rule, the NRC indicated that
it was adopting the FY 1993 approach for FY 1991 and FY 1992 and would separately publish a final rule revising the FY
1991 and FY 1992 surcharges. This final rule establishes those revised surcharges for NRC licensees for FY 1991 and
FY 1992. The NRC will make refunds to certain materials licensees based on the amounts of the revised surcharges.

I. Background


On March 16, 1993, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit decided 

Allied-Signal, Inc., 

v. 

U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the United States of America, 

988 F.2d 146 (D.C. Cir. 1993). The court questioned the NRC's decision to allocate generic costs associated with low-level
waste (LLW) disposal by classes of licensees, rather than by individual licensee. The Court remanded only the FY 1991
rule; however, the FY 1992 rule raised identical questions and a challenge to that rule was subsequently remanded
by the court.
In response to the Court's opinion, the NRC, in its final fee rule for FY 1993 published on July 20, 1993 (58 FR 38669),
changed its method of allocating LLW costs to NRC licensees after providing for notice and comment on four alternative
methods of LLW cost allocation and possible variations of those alternatives. Based on the comments received, the
NRC, for FY 1993, created two groups_large waste generators and small waste generators. Licensees within each group
are charged a uniform flat fee. In its final FY 1993 rule, the NRC also adopted this approach for FY 1991 and FY 1992, indicating
that it would publish separately final revised FY 1991 and FY 1992 surcharge schedules resulting from changes in the
allocations of NRC LLW budgeted generic costs. This rulemaking notice completes agency action on the proposed rule
issued for public comment on April 23, 1993 (58 FR 21662) and implements the ministerial calculations called for in
the July 20, 1993 final rule.
The agency workpapers that support these final changes to 10 CFR part 171 for FY 1991 and FY 1992 are available in the
Public Document Room at 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC, in the lower level of the Gelman Building.


II. Final Action_Revised FY 1991 and 1992 Fee Surcharges


This final rule establishes the revised FY 1991 and FY 1992 surcharges for NRC licensees based on the allocation method
of low-level waste costs described and used in the FY 1993 final rule.

The revised method of allocation, described in detail in the FY 1993 final rule published on July 20, 1993 (58 FR 38669),
allocates the LLW costs between two groups: large generators (power reactors and large fuel facilities), and small
generators (all other LLW-producing licensees). Waste generators in the large group are each expected to generate
more than 1,000 cubic feet of LLW per year. The allocation of LLW costs to the two groups is based on the historical average
amount of waste disposed by the two groups. The result is that 82 percent and 18 percent of the costs are allocated to
the large and small generator groups, respectively. Within each of the two groups, all licensees pay the same LLW fee
(surcharge).
The amounts of the surcharges for the two groups using the revised method for FY 1991 are shown in   171.15(c)(3)
and 171.16(f) of this final rule. For FY 1992, the amounts of the surcharges for the various fee categories using the
FY 1993 method are shown in   171.15(c)(4) and 171.16(g) of this final rule. The revised LLW surcharges
for small generators of LLW are $1,400 for FY 1991 and $1,500 for FY 1992. The surcharge for FY 1991 is the same for small
generators ($1,400) as that assessed in FY 1991. For FY 1992, the LLW surcharge of $1,500 is $100 less than the $1,600
paid by the small generators in FY 1992. The revised surcharges for large generators of LLW for FY 1991 and FY 1992 are
$62,300 and $61,700, respectively. These surcharges are lower than the $143,400 and $155,100 paid in FY 1991 and FY
1992, respectively, by some large fuel facilities. Based on the FY 1993 LLW allocation method, the revised surcharges
for FY 1991 and FY 1992 for operating power reactors and small fuel facilities (fee Category 1.A.(2)) are greater than
those paid in FY 1991 and FY 1992. The increase will not be assessed because no additional charges established under
this final rule (i.e., a later enacted rule) can be retroactively assessed due to applicable judicial precedent.
However, refunds will be made for certain large generators because their fee burden is lower under the revised allocations.
The amount of the refund for individual licensees will represent the difference between the amount paid under the
previous rules and the revised amounts for FY 1991 and FY 1992. The NRC expects the refunds to the large generators to
be made by June 30, 1994. For the approximately 1,000 small generators who paid a FY 1992 LLW surcharge, each will receive
a $100 credit on their FY 1994 bill for cost effectiveness reasons. The total amount of the refunds and credits for both
fiscal years is estimated to be approximately $2.2 million. If any entity no longer holds an NRC license, but is eligible
for a refund or credit, it should write to the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Office of the Controller, License
Fee and Debt Collection Branch, Washington, DC 20555.


III. Administrative Procedure Act: Waiver


No additional charges will be assessed for FY 1991 and FY 1992; instead certain licensees are eligible to receive either
refunds or credits based on the difference in the amount of the revised surcharges and the amounts initially paid in
FY 1991 and FY 1992. To expedite the issuance of refunds and credits, the NRC has determined that good cause exists to
waive the 30-day deferred effective date provisions of the Administrative Procedures Act (5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3)).
This final rule will therefore become effective immediately upon publication.


IV. Environmental Impact: Categorical Exclusion


The NRC has determined that this final rule is the type of action described in categorical exclusion 10 CFR 51.22(c)(1).
Therefore, neither an environmental assessment nor an environmental impact statement has been prepared for the
final regulation.


V. Paperwork Reduction Act Statement


This final rule contains no information collection requirements and, therefore, is not subject to the requirements
of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq.

).

VI. Regulatory Analysis 


With respect to 10 CFR Part 171, on November 5, 1990, the Congress passed Public Law No. 101-508, the Omnibus Budget
Reconciliation Act of 1990 (OBRA-90). OBRA-90, as amended, requires that for FYs 1991 through 1998 approximately
100 percent of the NRC's budget authority be recovered through the assessment of fees. To accomplish this statutory
requirement for FY 1991 and FY 1992, the NRC on July 10, 1991 (56 FR 31472), and on July 23, 1992 (57 FR 32691), in accordance
with  171.13, published in the 

Federal Register

 schedules of the FY 1991 and FY 1992 annual fees for operating reactor licensees, fuel cycle licensees, materials
licensees, holders of Certificates of Compliance, registrations of sealed source and devices and QA program approvals,
and Government agencies. 
In FY 1991 and FY 1992, the NRC allocated low-level waste (LLW) costs by the amount of waste disposed per class of licensee,
dividing the costs equally within each class. This method of cost allocation was challenged in court. 
On March 16, 1993, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit decided 

Allied-Signal, Inc., 

v. 

U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the United States of America,

 988 F.2d 146 (DC Cir. 1993). The court questioned the Commission's decision to allocate generic costs associated
with low-level waste (LLW) disposal by classes of licensees, rather than by individual licensees. The Court remanded
only the FY 1991 rule; however, the FY 1992 rule raised identical questions. The same petitioners who challenged the
FY 1991 rule in court also brought a judicial challenge to the FY 1992 rule. 
In response to the court decision, the NRC in its proposed FY 1993 annual fee rule published on April 23, 1993 (58 FR 21662),
requested comments on four alternative methods of LLW cost allocation and possible variations of those alternatives.
A number of comments were received. There was no consensus among the commenters regarding a preferred option. 
In response to the Court's directive, the NRC, in its final fee rule for FY 1993, published on July 20, 1993 (58 FR 38669),
changed its method of allocating LLW costs to NRC licensees. The NRC, for FY 1993, created two groups_large waste generators
and small waste generators. Licensees within each group are charged a uniform flat fee. In the final FY 1993 rule, the
NRC also adopted this approach for FY 1991 and FY 1992, indicating that it would separately publish a final rule revising
the FY 1991 and FY 1992 surcharges resulting from the changed allocation of NRC LLW budgeted generic costs. This final
rule establishes the revised surcharges for FY 1991 and FY 1992. 


VII. Regulatory Flexibility Analysis


As required by the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Commission certifies that this final rule as adopted
does not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This final rule establishes
revised surcharges for FY 1991 and FY 1992. These revised surcharges will not impose new financial burdens on any class
of licensees for FY 1991 and FY 1992. Rather, certain licensees will be eligible for either refunds or credits based
on the differences between the amount of the revised surcharges and the amounts initially paid in FY 1991 and FY 1992.



VIII. Backfit Analysis 


The NRC has determined that the backfit rule, 10 CFR 50.109, does not apply to this final rule and that a backfit analysis
is not required for this final rule. The backfit analysis is not required because these amendments do not require the
modification of or additions to systems, structures, components, or design of a facility or the design approval or
manufacturing license for a facility or the procedures or organization required to design, construct or operate
a facility. 


List of Subjects in 10 CFR Part 171

National Credit Union Administration (NCUA).



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
action: 

Final amendments.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
summary: 

The final amendments change the amount of nonmember and public unit accounts that a credit union may maintain, without
a waiver, to 20 percent of total shares or $1.5 million, whichever is greater. Credit unions accepting nonmember and
public unit accounts in excess of 20 percent of total shares are still required to develop a written plan and send it
to the Regional Director. However, prior NCUA approval is required only for amounts exceeding 20% of total shares
and $1.5 million.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

A. Background



The NCUA Board, as part of its ongoing program of regulatory review, is revising the regulation under which federally
insured credit unions maintain nonmember and public unit accounts. Federal credit unions (FCUs) are authorized
by section 107(6) of the Federal Credit Union Act [12 U.S.C. 1757(6)] to receive nonmember shares from other credit
unions, from certain governmental entities (``public units'') and, if the credit union has a ``low-income'' designation
from NCUA, from other outside sources. These nonmember accounts, and equivalent accounts authorized for federally
insured state credit unions under state law are defined by section 101(5) of the Act [12 U.S.C. 1752(5)] as ``accounts''
and ``member accounts'' for purposes of the various provisions of the FCU Act, including those establishing insurance
coverage by the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund (NCUSIF). 

Prior to these final amendments, NCUA's regulation on nonmember accounts has required any federally-insured credit
union that wishes to accept nonmember accounts in excess of 20 percent of total shares to submit to NCUA a plan setting
forth the intended use of the funds and obtain NCUA approval. On February 28, 1994, the NCUA Board issued proposed amendments
to change the amount of nonmember and public unit accounts that a credit union may maintain without a waiver, to 20 percent
of total shares or $1.5 million, whichever is greater (See 59 FR 10334, March 4, 1994). The Board is now adopting these
proposed amendments, without substantive change from the proposal.



B. Comments



Thirteen comments were received. Six were received from FCUs, one from a state-chartered credit union, one from a
state credit union league, three from national trade associations, and two from bank trade organizations. Six commenters
expressed complete approval of the proposed amendments. Most of these commenters believe the amendments will not
have an effect on safety and soundness and will greatly reduce paperwork requirements. Five commenters expressed
general support. The bank trade organizations opposed the proposed amendments.



C. Discussion



The Board proposed that a credit union be able to maintain permissible nonmember accounts up to 20 percent of total
shares or $1.5 million, whichever is greater, before a waiver by the regional director is required. Eleven commenters
supported this rule change. They believe that this amendment would generally benefit smaller credit unions by allowing
them to receive significant amounts of nonmember deposits without the administrative delay caused by the current
regulation. However, two of these commenters would go further and remove all limitations on the use of nonmember deposits.

One commenter recommended that the final rule provide for an annual automatic increase of $250,000 in the $1.5 million
nonmember threshold. The Board has determined that it will not increase the $1.5 million threshold until it has an
opportunity to assess the impact of this final rule.

As under the current rule, all credit unions accepting nonmember accounts in excess of 20 percent of total shares will
be required to have a plan for the use of such deposits. The plan must describe how nonmember accounts will be used to
serve the credit union's membership, e.g., by providing loans to its members or through increased earnings. The credit
union must submit the plan to the regional director, prior to receiving nonmember accounts in excess of 20 percent,
for NCUA's information and monitoring. However, under the change, NCUA approval will not be required unless the aggregate
amount exceeds both 20 percent of shares and $1.5 million. Three commenters objected to the production of a written
plan by credit unions with nonmember deposits exceeding 20 percent of total shares but less than $1.5 million. They
believe the requirement for a written plan in such circumstances generates needless paperwork. These commenters
suggest a written plan should only be required in connection with a waiver request. The Board disagrees. Although
the requirement for a written plan may disproportionately affect small credit unions, the plan is a necessary component
to the successful management of nonmember deposits.


One commenter recommended that in addition to the written plan, the credit union should also provide details on how
the credit union plans to be completely self sustaining with regard to member deposits. This commenter believes that
these credit unions need to eventually become independent from all public unit and nonmember deposits. While this
is a worthy goal for all credit unions, it fails to recognize the reality that many low-income credit unions will have
long term needs for, and legitimate uses of, nonmember funds. The Board declines to adopt this recommendation.


One commenter recommended in those cases where a waiver is required, that the rule specify that the business plan must
be approved by NCUA before the waiver is granted. This is implicit in the waiver decision. The regional director will
only grant a waiver if the business plan is acceptable.



D. Request for Comments




The Board requests comment on whether periodic reporting on the sources and uses of nonmember shares, in excess of
20 percent of total shares, should be established. The Board considered a monthly or quarterly reporting requirement
or alternatively, revisions to the NCUA Call Report (NCUA Form 5300), to gather additional information on sources
and uses of nonmember funds. Five commenters objected to the suggestion that credit unions submit monthly or quarterly
reports on the use of nonmember deposits. These commenters believe a new reporting requirement would be contrary
to the intent of the higher dollar limit and would increase regulatory burden on small credit unions. Two of these commenters
suggested the regional director exercise oversight of troubled credit unions as appropriate. One commenter supported
the use of quarterly periodic reporting on the sources and uses of nonmember deposits in excess of 20 percent. This
commenter believes such a requirement will give NCUA the ability to determine whether or not a credit union is adhering
to its written plan as well as protect the NCUSIF. Three commenters supported a revision of the Call Report to gather
additional information on nonmember accounts but two of these commenters objected to reporting on the sources and
uses of nonmember deposits. The Board agrees that increased reporting may be burdensome to small credit unions and
therefore will not require any additional reporting. However, NCUA will allot more time for additional on-site examiner
review.


The Board also specifically requested comment on the length of an approved waiver in those cases where a waiver request
and approval are still required. The regulation currently states in  701.32(b)(2) that the waiver request
will normally be for a two year period. Three commenters believe that the current two year period is appropriate. One
commenter stated that the regional director should have full discretion to set the length of the waiver. Two commenters
stated that the length of the waiver should be open-ended but could be terminated at any time by the regional director.
Three commenters suggested the waiver period should be for three years. Two of these commenter stated the wavier should
be routinely renewed unless a credit union seeks a waiver for an expanded amount or an examiner determines that a renewal
of the waiver would present safety and soundness concerns. One commenter suggested that the waiver should be granted
for five years.





The Board believes the current language provides the regional director with sufficient discretion to approve waivers
for shorter or longer periods, especially since the number of waivers should decrease with the adoption of these amendments.
Furthermore, the Board is not inclined to permit an automatic renewal of the waiver. An automatic renewal would make
the timeframe meaningless and may tend to actually promote a continuing dependence on nonmember deposits. Therefore
the Board is not making any changes to the length of the waiver.





Two commenters stated that the nonmember limitations should not be applied to any funds received in connection with
the proposed new federal community Development Banking and Financial Institutions program or enterprise zone grants.
The Board will consider such action if and when such legislation is established.





The Board has adopted the proposed amendments in final with only a minor technical change. Language has been added
to  701.32(b)(2) to clarify that a copy of the credit union's plan must be forwarded to the Regional Director.
The Board believes that the final amendments remove burdens on small credit unions as well as provide them with greater
flexibility in the maintenance of nonmember deposits without significantly increasing the risk to the NCUSIF.





The Board has also made a technical change to  741.6(a), which references the limitation on nonmember deposits.
The change is made to conform this section to the amendments in  701.32. The change deletes the term ``20%''.

Paperwork Reduction Act



The final amendments do not change paperwork requirements.



Regulatory Flexibility Act



The Regulatory Flexibility Act requires the NCUA to prepare an analysis to describe any significant economic impact
a proposed regulation may have on a substantial number of small credit unions (primarily those under $1 million in
assets). The revised rule is generally less restrictive than the current regulation. Overall, the NCUA Board expects
the change to benefit credit unions by permitting them to maintain a larger amount of nonmember accounts before requesting
a waiver from the Regional Director. Accordingly, the Board determines and certifies that this final rule does not
have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small credit unions and that a Regulatory Flexibility
Analysis is not required.



Executive Order 12612



Executive Order 12612 requires NCUA to consider the effect of its actions on state interests. The amendment applies
to federally-insured state-chartered credit unions that accept public unit and nonmember accounts. The final rule
would make it possible for a federally-insured credit union to accept a larger amount of nonmember deposits without
requesting an exemption.

Airworthiness Directives; Boeing Model 707/720 Series Airplanes


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Federal Aviation Administration, DOT.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to certain Boeing Model 707/720 series airplanes,
that requires certain structural inspections of older airplanes. This amendment is prompted by reports of incidents
involving fatigue cracking and corrosion in transport category airplanes that are approaching or have exceeded
their economic design service goal. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent degradation of the structural
capabilities of the affected airplanes. This amendment relates to the recommendations of the Airworthiness Assurance
Task Force assigned to review Model 707/720 series airplanes, which indicate that, to assure long term continued
operational safety, various structural inspections should be accomplished.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations to include an airworthiness directive (AD) that is
applicable to certain Boeing Model 707/720 series airplanes was published in the 

Federal Register

 on October 18, 1993 (58 FR 53678). That action proposed to require inspections of certain structural components on
older airplanes for cracks, corrosion, and other discrepancies, and repair or correction of discrepancies, if necessary.


Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration
has been given to the comments received.
One commenter supports the proposed rule. One commenter requests that the structural inspections and modifications
referenced in section A.3 and section A.4 of appendix A of Boeing Document Number D6-54996, ``Aging Airplane
Service Bulletin Structural Modification and Inspection Program_Model 707/720,'' Revision D, dated January 23,
1992, be combined and addressed as a single AD action, rather than in two separate actions, as proposed by the FAA in
this notice. This commenter points out that the FAA previously issued AD 94-06-08, Amendment 39-8856
(59 FR 13446, March 22, 1994), which requires the accomplishment of a certain structural modification of the wing
front spar lower chord in accordance with section A.3 of appendix A of the Boeing Document. This commenter contends
that by issuing a single AD to cover both sections of the Boeing Document, the FAA will contribute to reducing the cost
and complexity of publishing and tracking multiple AD's, while maintaining the same level of safety.
The FAA does not concur with this commenter's request, specifically because of the nature of the requirements of the
rules. The requirements contained in AD 94-06-08 address a single structural modification applicable
to Model 707 series airplanes listed in Appendix A.3 of the Boeing Document. The compliance time for accomplishing
that modification is based on either the number of flight cycles on the airplane or a specific calendar time. The requirements
of this AD, however, address structural inspections for both Model 707 and Model 720 series airplanes listed in section
4 and appendix A.4 of the Boeing Document. The compliance times for implementation of these various inspections vary,
as do the repetitive inspection intervals. The FAA considers that combining the requirements for these dissimilar
actions into one complex AD would create unnecessary confusion for affected operators. Therefore, the FAA finds
it appropriate to issue one AD addressing the modification and another AD addressing ``inspections only.'' This
method of issuance will ease tracking of and facilitate compliance with the requirements of these two separate AD's.
Since the issuance of the proposal, the FAA has reviewed and approved Revision E of Boeing Document Number D6-54996,
``Aging Airplane Service Bulletin Structural Modification and Inspection Program_Model 707/720,'' dated March
8, 1994. The inspections described in this revision are identical to those described in Revision D, which was referenced
in the proposal as the appropriate source of service information. The only change effected by Revision E is that it
excludes the inspections of the upper skin on the wing center section described in Boeing Service Bulletin 2590. The
actions specified in Boeing Service Bulletin 2590 currently are the subject of AD 68-18-03, Amendment
39-2056. In light of this, the final rule has been revised to reference Revision E of the Boeing Document as the
appropriate source of service information in order to eliminate these redundant inspection requirements. The applicability
of the final rule has also been revised to reference those airplanes listed in Revision E of the Boeing Document in order
to exclude those airplanes that are subject to the requirements of Boeing Service Bulletin 2590. Additionally, the
economic impact information, below, has been revised to reflect the deletion of these inspections from the required
number of work hours for accomplishment of the actions required by this final rule.
Upon further review of the inspection actions required by this AD, the FAA has revised the final rule to extend the proposed
15-month compliance time to 18 months (for airplanes that have surpassed the specified compliance threshold in terms
of accumulated flight cycles or time-in-service). The FAA has determined that increasing the compliance time by
an additional three months will not adversely affect safety, and will allow the inspections to be performed during
regularly scheduled maintenance at a main base where special equipment and trained maintenance personnel will be
available if necessary. Moreover, this is the compliance time currently recommended by the manufacturer in the latest
revision to the Boeing Document, which is referenced in the final rule.
After careful review of the available data, including the comments noted above, the FAA has determined that air safety
and the public interest require the adoption of the rule with the changes previously described. The FAA has determined
that these changes will neither increase the economic burden on any operator nor increase the scope of the AD.
There are approximately 416 Model 707/720 series airplanes of the affected design in the worldwide fleet. The FAA
estimates that 82 airplanes of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, that it will take approximately 691 work hours
per airplane to accomplish the required actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Based on these
figures, the total cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $3,116,410, or $38,005 per airplane.

The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the
requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not
adopted.
The FAA recognizes that the obligation to maintain aircraft in an airworthy condition is vital, but sometimes expensive.
Because AD's require specific actions to address specific unsafe conditions, they appear to impose costs that would
not otherwise be borne by operators. However, because of the general obligation of operators to maintain aircraft
in an airworthy condition, this appearance is deceptive. Attributing those costs solely to the issuance of this AD
is unrealistic because, in the interest of maintaining safe aircraft, most prudent operators would accomplish the
required actions even if they were not required to do so by the AD.
A full cost-benefit analysis has not been accomplished for this AD. As a matter of law, in order to be airworthy, an aircraft
must conform to its type design and be in a condition for safe operation. The type design is approved only after the FAA
makes a determination that it complies with all applicable airworthiness requirements. In adopting and maintaining
those requirements, the FAA has already made the determination that they establish a level of safety that is cost-beneficial.
When the FAA, as in this AD, makes a finding of an unsafe condition, this means that this cost-beneficial level of safety
is no longer being achieved and that the required actions are necessary to restore that level of safety. Because this
level of safety has already been determined to be cost-beneficial, a full cost-benefit analysis for this AD would
be redundant and unnecessary.
The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive
Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February
26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small
entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been prepared for this action
and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under

Airworthiness Directives; Boeing Model 747-100, -200, and -300 Series Airplanes Equipped With
Pratt & Whitney JT9D Series Engines


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to Boeing Model 747-100, -200,
and -300 series airplanes, that requires modification of the thrust reverser control system by installing
a solenoid-operated shut-off valve. This amendment is prompted by incidents of deployment of the engine fan thrust
reverser during flight. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent such deployment, which could result
in reduced controllability of the airplane. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) to include an airworthiness directive
(AD), applicable to Boeing Model 747-100, -200, and -300 series airplanes equipped with Pratt &
Whitney JT9D series engines, was published in the 

Federal Register

 on December 7, 1993 (58 FR 64386). That action proposed to require modification of the thrust reverser control system
by installing a solenoid-operated shut-off valve.


Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration
has been given to the comments received.
One commenter supports the proposal.
Several commenters contend that the proposed modification is not necessary and the proposed rule should be withdrawn.
These commenters state that the high reliability of both the Thrust Reverser Sequencing Mechanism (TRSM) and the
thrust reverser system preclude the need for the proposed shut-off valve installation. These commenters note that
the manufacturer's service bulletin referenced in the proposal does not clearly state that the shut-off valve will
prevent an in-flight deployment of the thrust reversers. The FAA does not concur. The reliability of the TRSM or the
thrust reverser system does not affect the requirement for the solenoid-operated shut-off valve. An in-flight deployment
of a thrust reverser can occur even with a fully functioning thrust reverser system with all components (including
the TRSM) operating within maintenance limits, if the pneumatic signal line vent on the Directional Control Valve
(DCV) becomes plugged. The installation of the shut-off valve prevents this single malfunction from causing such
a deployment.

Further, the design of the thrust reverser control system is such that there is a 
constant supply of pneumatic signal air to the DCV. When the thrust levers are in the 
``idle'' or ``forward thrust'' position, air flows through the DCV to the stow port of the gear 
switching actuator. Signal air leakage from the stow chamber to the deploy chamber 
occurs even with an actuator that is within overhaul limits. The signal air that leaks into 
the deploy chamber is designed to be vented through the actuator deploy port and the 
deploy signal line to the DCV, where it exits through the DCV vent. If this vent path 
becomes plugged, the pressure in the deploy chamber will rise. Pressurization of the 
deploy chamber of the gear switching actuator can cause the gear switching actuator to 
move to the ``deploy'' position. 
Additionally, drive air is supplied to the thrust reverser Pneumatic Drive Unit 
(PDU) through a Pressure Regulator Shut-off Valve (PRSOV). The PRSOV opens when 
it receives pneumatic signal air from the DCV. This signal is received whenever the thrust 
levers are moved to the idle position, either in flight or on the ground. If the DCV vent, 
deploy signal line, or gear switcher actuator deploy chamber port becomes plugged and 
causes the gear switcher actuator to move to the ``deploy'' position, the thrust reverser will 
deploy when the thrust lever is moved to the ``idle'' position. Plugging of this vent path 
has caused approximately 30 (of 31) known events of in-flight deployment of the thrust 
reversers on Model 747 airplanes. Such plugging has been caused by improper 
deactivation procedures, pieces of air filter media, and ice formed during flight. 
The installation of the solenoid-operated shut-off valve required by this AD will 
prevent the flow of pneumatic drive air to the PDU, unless the airplane is on the ground 
and the reverse thrust levers are in the ``reverse thrust'' position. The shut-off valve is 
installed between the PRSOV and the thrust reverser PDU. The shut-off valve opens only 
when the airplane air/ground logic is in the ground mode and ``reverse thrust'' is selected. 
Therefore, the shut-off valve is designed to prevent in-flight deployment of the thrust 
reverser by preventing the flow of drive air to the PDU (unless the airplane is on the 
ground and ``reverse thrust'' is selected). 
There has been only one reported in-flight deployment of a thrust reverser on a 
Model 747 involving an engine that was equipped with the solenoid-operated shut-off 
valve. However, this incident was determined to have been caused by a maintenance crew 
that disconnected the PDU drive shafts to the thrust reverser in order to deactivate the 
thrust reverser, and inadvertently did not lock the reverser sleeve. By disconnecting the 
two drive shafts, the two reverser locking devices were disconnected. Thus, the improper 
deactivation of the reverser contributed to the in-flight deployment incident. By 
disconnecting the PDU drive shafts, the pneumatic drive was taken out of the system; 
therefore, the shut-off valve had no effect on the deployment. 
None of the other 30 incidents of in-flight deployments of the thrust reversers on 
Model 747's have occurred on engines equipped with the subject solenoid-operated shut-off valve. The FAA considers
that all of those events could have been prevented if the 
shut-off valve had been installed. 
For these reasons, the FAA has determined that installation of the solenoid-operated shut-off valve is appropriate
and warranted. 
Several commenters do not support the need for the issuance of the proposed rule. 
These commenters state that the Model 747 has been shown to be controllable following 
all incidents of in-flight deployment of the thrust reversers. They contend that these 
incidents of deployment occurred at idle thrust, and that the proposed modification would 
only help in preventing uncommanded deployments at idle thrust or where improper 
lockout of the reverser sleeve had been performed. The FAA does not concur with these 
commenters' inference that issuance of the rule is not necessary. The FAA acknowledges 
that, in all of the known events of in-flight thrust reverser deployments, the flight crews 
were able to control the airplanes and land safely. At the time this rule was proposed, 
there was insufficient data to demonstrate that the airplane would be controllable in all 
phases of flight following deployment of a thrust reverser. Recently, however, Boeing has 
presented the results of a study it conducted on the controllability of the airplane following 
an in-flight deployment event in several phases of flight. The results of this study revealed 
that these airplanes could experience certain control problems in the event of a thrust 
reverser deployment occurring during high speed climb or possibly during cruise. This 
additional information on the controllability of the airplane following deployment of an 
outboard thrust reverser further demonstrates the need to install the solenoid-operated 
shut-off valve. For example, if the thrust lever is moved rapidly to the ``idle'' position from 
a high power setting, and the DCV vent is plugged (e.g., by ice), the thrust reverser could 
deploy at a high thrust level as the engine decelerates. The installation of the shut-off 
valve is designed to prevent pneumatic drive air from powering the PDU, unless the 
airplane is on the ground and ``reverser thrust'' is selected, thereby preventing in-flight 
deployments. 
Several commenters request that the proposed rule be revised to allow the 
accomplishment of certain revised maintenance practices, in lieu of installation of the shut-off valve. These commenters
point out that the majority of the incidents of in-flight 
deployments of thrust reversers have involved improper or outdated maintenance practices 
relative to deactivating the reverser. The Model 747 Maintenance Manual has been 
revised to delete all deactivating procedures except one, which involves disconnecting the 
PDU drive shafts and then ensuring that the reverser sleeve is locked in the stowed 
position. The commenters contend that, with such procedures now deleted from normal 
maintenance practices, circumstances that previously would have led to a deployment 
incident will now be eliminated. The FAA does not concur. Although this new 
maintenance procedure may serve to preclude in-flight deployments caused by improper 
deactivating procedures, the FAA finds that no maintenance procedure can prevent in-flight deployments caused
by blocking of the DCV vent (by ice, foreign objects, etc.). 
Additionally, the FAA points out that several revisions had been made previously to the 
Model 747 Maintenance Manual in an attempt to prevent in-flight deployments of the 
thrust reverser, yet deployments have continued to occur. As stated elsewhere in this 
preamble, the FAA considers that the installation of the subject shut-off valves would have 
prevented 30 of the 31 known incidents of in-flight deployments on Model 747's, since 
those incidents involved blocking of the DCV vent. 
Numerous commenters request that the proposed compliance time of 24 months 
for modification be extended to between 36 months and 5 years. Several of these 
commenters point out that there is a 300- to 400-day lead time necessary for purchasing 
and obtaining necessary parts. This lengthy lead time for parts delivery would seriously 
hamper affected operators' ability to comply with the proposed rule within a 24-month 
deadline, and would cause major scheduling problems, delays, and flight cancellations. 
Other commenters request an extension to in order to allow the modification to be 
accomplished during a regularly scheduled ``heavy'' maintenance visit (``D'' check) at a 
main base, where required equipment and trained personnel would be available. The FAA 
agrees that the compliance time can be extended somewhat. Based on information 
provided by the commenters concerning parts availability, the FAA has determined that a 
compliance time of 36 months is appropriate in order to accommodate the time necessary 
for affected operators to order, obtain, and install the modification; and will not 
compromise safety. The final rule has been revised accordingly. 
Certain commenters request that the proposed rule be revised to permit the 
installation of unmodified engines after the effective date of the AD and until the 
compliance time for modification. These commenters point out that proposed paragraph 
(b) would require that, as of the effective date of the rule, no operator install an 
unmodified engine on any airplane. However, to comply with this paragraph, operators 
would have to modify all spare engines prior to the effective date of the AD; this would be 
impossible, due to the lead time necessary to obtain parts, and would impose an economic 
burden on operators. The FAA concurs. The final rule has been revised to permit 
installation of an unmodified engine up to 18 months after the effective date of the rule. 
This compliance time of 18 months is based on a 1-year period that would be necessary to 
obtain parts, plus a 6-month period to modify all spare engines. 
One commenter requests that the proposed rule be revised to require the 
installation of a new PDU to prevent the back driving of the thrust reverser. This 
commenter has installed such a unit in accordance with Boeing Service Bulletins 
747-78-2084 and 747-78-2090, and Garrett Service Bulletins 126712-78-1432
and 
126236-78-1332. Since installation, this commenter has not experienced any in-flight 
deployments of the thrust reverser. The commenter recommends this installation in lieu of 
the shut-off valve that would be required the proposed AD. The FAA does not concur. 
The modification referred to by the commenter entails the installation of a reversible PDU 
in place of the gear-driven PDU that was installed on earlier Model 747 airplanes equipped 
with Pratt & Whitney JT9D engines. The pneumatic control system used with the 
reversible PDU is similar to the control system used with the gear-driven PDU. One 
difference is that a ``directional switcher actuator'' is used with the reversible PDU, in place 
of the ``gear switcher actuator'' used with the gear-driven PDU; however, both actuators 
are similar in design, and their deploy chamber vent paths are the same. Therefore, if the 
DCV vent, deploy signal line, or the directional switcher actuator deploy chamber port 
becomes plugged, the directional switcher actuator could move to the ``deploy'' position. 
If this occurs, the thrust reverser will deploy when the thrust lever is moved to the ``idle'' 
position, just as is the case for the gear-driven PDU configuration. Installation of the 
subject shut-off valve will prevent this from occurring. In light of this, the FAA has 
determined that installation of the shut-off valve is necessary, regardless of the type of 
PDU that is installed.

Other commenters request that the proposed rule be revised to allow alternative approaches, in lieu of the modification,
to address the identified unsafe condition. The commenters state that the cost of the specific proposed modification
is an unnecessary burden on operators, and consider that improved maintenance procedures are all that are necessary
to ensure safety of the system. For the reasons previously described in this preamble, the FAA does concur with these
commenters' specific suggestions for ``alternative approaches.'' At this time, based on all available data to date,
the FAA has determined that the modification required by the AD is the only action that will prevent in-flight deployments
of the thrust reverser caused by blockage of the DCV vent. No maintenance action or acceptable alternative modification
has yet been presented to the FAA that will prevent a deployment caused by this single modification. However, under
the provisions of paragraph (c) of the final rule, operators may request approval of the use of alternative methods
of compliance, provided that sufficient data is presented to the FAA to justify the request. 
Numerous commenters request that the economic impact information presented in the preamble to the notice be revised
to provide updated costs. These commenters state that the costs indicated in the preamble to the proposed rule were
greatly underestimated. The FAA concurs. The estimated modification costs that were presented in the preamble to
the proposal were based on information provided by the airplane manufacturer at the time the proposed rule was being
developed. The manufacturer has now provided updated costs for the parts and labor necessary to modify affected airplanes,
and the economic impact information, below, has been revised accordingly. 
The economic impact information has also been revised to update the current number of airplanes that will be affected
by this AD. 
After careful review of the available data, including the comments noted above, the FAA has determined that air safety
and the public interest require the adoption of the rule with the changes previously described. The FAA has determined
that these changes will neither increase the economic burden on any operator nor increase the scope of the AD. 
There are approximately 221 Model 747-100, -200, and -300 series airplanes of the affected design
in the worldwide fleet. The FAA estimates that 124 airplanes of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, that it will
take approximately 128 work hours per airplane to accomplish the required actions, and that the average labor rate
is $55 per work hour. Required parts will cost approximately $75,356 per airplane. Based on these figures, the total
cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $10,217,104, or $82,396 per airplane. 
The number of required work hours, as indicated above, is presented as if the accomplishment of the modification required
by this AD were to be conducted as a ``stand alone'' action. However, the 36-month compliance time specified in paragraph
(a) of this AD allows ample time for the modification to be accomplished coincidentally with scheduled major airplane
inspection and maintenance activities, thereby minimizing the costs associated with special airplane scheduling.

The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the
requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not
adopted. 
The FAA recognizes that the obligation to maintain aircraft in an airworthy condition is vital, but sometimes expensive.
Because AD's require specific actions to address specific unsafe conditions, they appear to impose costs that would
not otherwise be borne by operators. However, because of the general obligation of operators to maintain aircraft
in an airworthy condition, this appearance is deceptive. Attributing those costs solely to the issuance of this AD
is unrealistic because, in the interest of maintaining safe aircraft, most prudent operators would accomplish the
required actions even if they were not required to do so by the AD. 
A full cost-benefit analysis has not been accomplished for this AD. As a matter of law, in order to be airworthy, an aircraft
must conform to its type design and be in a condition for safe operation. The type design is approved only after the FAA
makes a determination that it complies with all applicable airworthiness requirements. In adopting and maintaining
those requirements, the FAA has already made the determination that they establish a level of safety that is cost-beneficial.
When the FAA, as in this AD, makes a finding of an unsafe condition, this means that this cost-beneficial level of safety
is no longer being achieved and that the required actions are necessary to restore that level of safety. Because this
level of safety has already been determined to be cost-beneficial, a full cost-benefit analysis for this AD would
be redundant and unnecessary. 
The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive
Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February
26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small
entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been prepared for this action
and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under

Amendment of Interpretation Regarding Substantive Repossession of Collateral



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Securites and Exchange Commission.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Interpretive release.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This interpretive release amends the interpretive guidance contained in Financial Reporting Release No. 28 (FR
28) that addresses the accounting for substantive repossessions of collateral. This release conforms the interpretive
guidance in FR 28 to the requirements of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 114, ``Accounting by Creditors
for Impairment of a Loan'' (SFAS 114), which was issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) in May 1993.




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 



I. Amendment of Interpretation Regarding Substantive Repossession of Collateral




In 1977, The FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 15, ``Accounting by Debtors and Creditors
for Troubled Debt Restructurings'' (SFAS 15), which addressed, among other things, the accounting for substantive
repossessions of collateral for restructured loans. Paragraph 34 of SFAS 15 required a troubled debt restructuring
that is in substance a repossession or foreclosure by the creditor to be accounted for by the creditor by recognizing
the fair value of the collateral as an asset, even if that collateral is not formally repossessed. However, SFAS 15
did not identify any criteria to determine when a loan restructuring was considered a substantive repossession of
collateral.

The Commission found that, under SFAS 15, there was inconsistency in practice concerning the accounting for substantive
repossessions of collateral. So, in 1986, to ensure more consistent application of substantive repossession accounting,
the Commission issued FR 28, which concludes, among other things, that a loan should be accounted for as being an in-substance
repossession of collateral if certain criteria are met.
 These criteria focus on whether the primary risks and rewards of collateral ownership have passed from the debtor
to the creditor.





In 1993, the FASB issued SFAS 114, which addresses, among other things, the accounting for substantive repossession
of collateral. SFAS 114 amends SFAS 15 to clarify that substantive repossession accounting applies in the circumstances
in which the debtor surrenders the collateral to the creditor and the creditor receives physical possession of the
debtor's assets (the collateral).
 Consequently, the accounting guidance relating to the accounting for substantive repossessions of collateral
in FR 28 is not consistent with the account requirements for substantive repossession accounting in SFAS 114.





Because SFAS 114 clarifies the accounting literature that addresses the accounting for substantive repossessions
of collateral, the portion of FR 28 that addresses substantive repossession accounting no longer is necessary once
a registrant adopts SFAS 114.
 Accordingly, registrants that have adopted SFAS 114 should not apply the portion of FR 28 that addresses the accounting
for substantive repossessions of collateral. Registrants that have not adopted SFAS 114 should continue to apply
all portions of FR 28, including the portion that addresses the accounting for substantive repossessions of collateral.






II. Codification Update





The ``Codification of Financial Reporting Policies'' announced in Financial Reporting Release No. 1 (April 15,
1982 (47 FR 21028) is updated to:

1. Add a new  401.09.c.1, entitled ``Amendment of Interpretation Regarding Substantive Repossession of Collateral,''
consisting of the last two paragraphs of section I of this release.

The Codification is a separate publication of the Commission. It will not be published in the

Presriptions_Transmission by Facsimile



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), Justice.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The DEA amends its regulations to allow for the transmission of controlled substance prescriptions between the prescriber
and the dispenser via facsimile. This change will facilitate the delivery of medication in situations where medication
needs change quickly and physicians' orders need to be communicated rapidly.




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

A notice of proposed rulemaking was published in the 

Federal Register

 on September 23, 1993 (58 FR 49453). This rule allows for the transmission of written prescriptions by a practitioner
to the dispensing pharmacy by facsimile. All conditions specified under 21 CFR 1306.05 regarding the manner in which
a prescription must be prepared, shall apply to prescriptions generated via facsimile.




By virtue of this rule, DEA recognizes the practice of transmitting a Schedule II prescription from the prescriber
to the pharmacy by means of facsimile, but requires that the original written prescription be presented and verified
against the facsimile at the time the substances are actually dispensed, and that the original document be properly
annotated and retained for filing. Two exceptions to this requirement are granted.


The first exception involves pharmacies providing home infusion/intravenous (I.V.) pain therapy. Prescriptions
for home infusion/I.V. pain therapy may be transmitted by the practitioner or the practitioner's agent to the home
infusion pharmacy by facsimile and they may be considered ``written prescriptions'' as required by 21 U.S.C. 829(a).
In other words, in the case of home (or hospice) infusion/I.V. pain therapy, it is not necessary for the original prescription
to be delivered to the pharmacy either prior to or subsequent to the delivery of the medication to the patient's home.
The facsimile copy of the prescription shall be retained as the original document by the home infusion pharmacy and
it must contain all information required by 21 CFR 1306.05(a) including the date issued, full name and address of the
patient, name, address, DEA registration number and signature of the practitioner.


The exception to the regulations for home infusion/I.V. therapy is intended to facilitate the means by which home
infusion pharmacies obtain prescriptions for patients requiring the frequently modified parenteral controlled
release administration of narcotic substances, but does not extend to the dispensing of oral dosage units of controlled
substances. By facilitating the process by which such prescriptions are communicated, the need to treat them as ``emergency
prescriptions'' as defined by 21 CFR 1306.11(d), which presently requires that a Schedule II emergency prescription
be limited to an amount for the duration of the emergency, will be substantially eliminated. This exception will also
facilitate the delivery of medication to the terminally ill in non-hospital settings were medication needs change
quickly and physicians' orders need to be communicated rapidly.


The second exception applies to Schedule II prescriptions written for patients in Long Term Care Facilities (LTCF)
which are filled by and delivered to the facility by a pharmacy. A prescription for any controlled substance in Schedule
II written for a patient in a LTCF may be transmitted by facsimile by the practitioner or the practitioner's agent to
the dispensing pharmacy and may be considered ``written prescriptions'' as required by 21 U.S.C. 829(a). The facsimile
copy of the prescription shall be retained as the original document by the dispensing pharmacy and it must contain
all information required by 21 CFR 1306.05(a) including the date issued, full name and address of the patient (the
address shall indicate that the location is a LTCF), name, address, DEA registration number and signature of the practitioner.
By facilitating the process by which prescriptions are communicated, the need to treat them as ``emergency prescriptions''
as defined by 21 CFR 1306.11(d), which presently requires that a Schedule II emergency prescription be limited to
an amount for the duration of the emergency, will be substantially eliminated. This exception will also facilitate
the delivery of medication to patients in LTCF settings where medication needs change quickly and physicians' orders
need to be communicated rapidly.


Under current regulations, a pharmacist bears the responsibility for ensuring that prescriptions for controlled
substances have been issued for a legitimate medical purpose by an individual practitioner acting in the usual course
of this professional practice pursuant to 21 CFR 1306.04(a). Orders purporting to be prescriptions, which are not
issued in the usual course of professional treatment, are not considered prescriptions within the meaning and intent
of the Controlled Substances Act and a person who issues or fills such an order shall be subject to penalties provided
by law. That responsibility applies equally to an order transmitted by facsimile. Therefore, this rule should not
constitute an increased potential for the diversion of controlled substances. In exercising professional judgment,
a pharmacist must take adequate measures to guard against the diversion of controlled substances through prescription
forgeries. Some measures to be considered in authenticating prescriptions received via facsimile equipment would
include maintenance of a practitioner's facsimile number reference file, verification of the telephone number
of the originating facsimile equipment and/or telephone verification with the practitioner's office that the prescription
was both written by the practitioner and transmitted by the practitioner or the practitioner's agent. Although such
measures parallel efforts currently employed in verifying the authenticity of prescriptions transmitted by traditional
means, the requirement of this rule places an additional responsibility on the pharmacist to take efforts to ensure
that the facsimile has been initiated by the prescriber.

DEA received 26 comments on the proposed rule. Of these, seven support the proposed rule as written and 19 support the
proposed rule with clarification or minor change. Commentors expressed concern in the following general areas.
Seven comments were concerned with the problem of allowing the facsimile prescription to be dispensed only by a ``consulting''
pharmacy as proposed in 21 CFR 1306.11(f) and suggested that other categories of pharmacies also be allowed to dispense
controlled substances based upon facsimile prescriptions. Six submitted alternatives: (1) Consulting or provider
pharmacy, (2) provider pharmacy, (3) dispensing or provider pharmacy, (4) pharmacy with which the facility has a
contract or agreement, (5) pharmacy dispensing medications to the facility and (6) providing pharmacy.

DEA has changed ``consulting'' pharmacy to ``dispensing'' pharmacy in the final rule. It was found that many facilities
utilize more than one pharmacy on a regular basis. Although some state laws require that each facility must have a consultant
pharmacist, the individual may not be affiliated with the pharmacy actually dispensing medications. Restricting
the process to consulting pharmacies would not facilitate the process for those facilities whose dispensing pharmacy
and consulting pharmacy are different.

DEA received three comments on the definition of LTCF. One commentor suggested including facilities such as nursing
homes or facilities, residential care facilities and mental and correctional institutions in the definition. Another
commentor suggested including the term ``or hospice setting''. The third commentor suggested including skilled
nursing homes, personal care homes and adult care facilities as closed system environments in the definition. DEA
maintains that the existing definition of lTCF, currently found in 21 CFR 1306.02(e), adequately addresses the facilities
that should be included. The definition includes a nursing home, retirement care, mental care or other facility or
institution which provides extended health care to resident patients.

One commentor pointed out a lack of consistency concerning the use of the terms physician, practitioner, prescriber,
and prescribing practitioner throughout the proposed rule. It was further suggested that DEA standardize or clarify
the term prescribing practitioner by mentioning physicians and mid-level practitioners.

DEA acknowledges the inconsistency. The term practitioner will be used in the final rule. Pursuant to 21 U.S.C. 823(f),
DEA registers practitioners which includes Mid-Level Practitioners (MLPs) if the applicant is authorized to dispense
controlled substances by the state in which he/she practices. No further clarification is warranted. This term is
defined in 21 U.S.C. 802(21) and 21 CFR 1304.02 (d) and is consistently used throughout the statutes and regulations
of Title 21 of the Controlled Substances Act.

Two commentors suggest adding information on the prescription prior to faxing such as: ``faxed to'' to void the prescription
for reuse. This was considered prior to publishing the proposed rule. While DEA agrees with and encourages this practice
as a deterrent to sending the same document several times, the ease of getting around the requirement does not justify
its addition to the rule. If such information were required but was not transmitted in the facsimile, the dispensing
pharmacist would be forced to seek the information before dispensing the controlled substance, thus adding delay
to the process, which is contrary to the intent of the regulation.

Four comments concern the Schedule II restriction of only allowing oral prescription under emergency situations
pursuant to the conditions set forth in 21 CFR 1306.11(d). Two commentors state that no schedule II's should be faxed.
Two commentors disagree with the Schedule II restriction, one of these two commentors suggests that the prescription
could be delivered within 5 days after the faxed original.

Since Schedule II controlled substances have the highest potential for abuse, extra care and diligence must be employed
with these substances. The diversity in the comments received, both positive and negative, reflect the dichotomy
between availability and adequate controls. Having studied the comments, DEA feels that the original proposal struck
an appropriate balance for Schedule II prescriptions and provides the necessary controls while still allowing for
the rapid delivery of the controlled substances.
Three comments address the issue of what administration methods should be permitted for purposes of the proposed
definition of ``home infusion pharmacy'' and of the proposed exception which allows a Schedule II facsimile to serve
as the original written prescription pursuant to 21 CFR 1306.02(h) and 1306.11(e). One commentor suggests including
intramuscular and oral dosage unit. A second commentor suggests allowing oral dosage unit dispensing in the same
manner as Schedule III and IV prescriptions. The third commentor suggests oral dosage unit for terminally ill regardless
of the care setting. Dispensing of oral dosage forms for the terminally ill has been previously addressed in 21 CFR
1306.13. However, intramuscular has been added to the final rule. DEA was advised by health care professionals that
intramuscular administration is one form of administration utilized when repeated doses are required.
Four comments addressed the issue of expanding the term prescriber to include a prescriber's ``agent'' for purposes
of defining who is allowed to transmit a facsimile prescription under 21 CFR 1306.11(a). Two suggest using ``practitioner's
agent'' instead. Two suggest including ``prescriber'' or ``agent''. DEA agrees with the commentors that the proposal
unintentionally implied that every practitioner would have to personally fax the prescription. Therefore, the
language has been amended to include the faxing by the practitioner's agent.
One commentor suggests that due to fading of certain types of facsimile paper DEA should allow copying. DEA is concerned
about the quality of the copy and its durability. It is the intent of this rule that if a facsimile copy is retained as
the original record it must satisfy the same record-keeping requirements as an original paper record. The facsimile
copy must be maintained as a complete and accurate record for the record-keeping time limit of two years pursuant to
21 CFR 1304.04(a). A facsimile which can fade and deteriorate before the record-keeping time limit is reached would
not be acceptable as the original record.
Two comments suggested that the phrase ``administer and dispense (but not prescribe)'' be changed by deleting the
prohibition against prescribing by the institutional practitioner as proposed in   1306.21(c) and
1306.31(c). The proposed regulations address the situations where an individual practitioner or his agent (as opposed
to an institutional practitioner such as a hospital) transmits a written instrument, a facsimile or an oral order.
Hence, it would be confusing to delete the phrase ``(but not prescribe)'' because it would indicate that the institutional
practitioner had the authority to prescribe based upon a prescription already issued by an individual practitioner.
The current regulations do address the general circumstances under which practitioners and exempted persons are
allowed to dispense, administer or prescribe in 21 CFR 1301.24. A proposal will be drafted in the near future to amend
 1301.24 which should clarify any current ambiguities in   1306.21(c) and 1306.31(c).
One comment was received concerning an inconsistency in the use of the phrases ``transmitted from'', ``transmitted
directly by'', and ``transmitted by''. DEA realized that there was an inconsistency. In section 1306.11, as proposed,
``transmitted from'' and ``transmitted directly from'' were used and in   1306.21 and 1306.31, as proposed,
``transmitted directly by'' was used. For clarity and consistency ``transmitted by'' will be used for the final rule.
The Deputy Assistant Administrator, Office of Diversion Control, hereby certifies that this rule will have no significant
impact upon entities whose interests must be considered under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq.

 This rule is not a significant regulatory action and therefore has not been reviewed by the Office of Management and
Budget pursuant to Executive Order 12866.

Seiad Valley Viticultural Area (93F-022P) 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF); Treasury. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule, Treasury decision.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This final rule establishes a viticultural area in 
Siskiyou County, California, named ``Seiad Valley.'' The 
petition was filed by Brian J. Helsaple of Seiad Valley 
Vineyards. The establishment of viticultural areas and the 
subsequent use of viticultural area names as appellations of 
origin in wine labeling and advertising allows winemakers to 
distinguish their products from wines made in other areas and 
enables consumers to better identify the wines they may 
purchase.


 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

Background 



On August 23, 1978, ATF published Treasury Decision 
ATF-53 (43 FR 37672, 54624) revising regulations in 27 CFR 
part 4. These regulations allow the establishment of definite 
American viticultural areas. The regulations also allow the 
name of an approved viticultural area to be used as an 
appellation of origin in the labeling and advertising of wine. 

On October 2, 1979, ATF published Treasury Decision 
ATF-60 (44 FR 56692) which added a new part 9 to 27 CFR, 
providing for the listing of approved American viticultural 
areas. Section 4.25a(e)(1), Title 27, CFR, defines an 
American viticultural area as a delimited grape-growing region 
distinguishable by geographical features, the boundaries of 
which have been delineated in subpart C of part 9. Section 
4.25a(e)(2) outlines the procedure for proposing an American 
viticultural area. Any interested person may petition ATF to 
establish a grape-growing region as a viticultural area. The 
petition should include: 

(a) Evidence that the name of the proposed viticultural 
area is locally and/or nationally known as referring to the 
area specified in the petition; 

(b) Historical or current evidence that the boundaries 
of the viticultural area are as specified in the petition; 

(c) Evidence relating to the geographical features 
(climate, soil, elevation, physical features, etc.) which 
distinguish the viticultural features of the proposed area 
from surrounding areas; 

(d) A description of the specific boundaries of the 
viticultural area, based on features which can be found on 
United States Geological Survey (U.S.G.S.) maps of the largest 
applicable scale; and 

(e) A copy of the appropriate U.S.G.S. map(s) with the 
boundaries prominently marked. 



Petition 



ATF received a petition from Brian J. Helsaple of Seiad 
Valley Vineyards to establish a viticultural area in Siskiyou 
County, California, to be known as ``Seiad Valley.'' The 
viticultural area is located in northwestern California, about 
15 miles south of the Oregon border. It contains 
approximately 2,160 acres, of which approximately 2.5 acres 
are planted to vineyards. Seiad Valley Vineyards is the only 
commercial grower and the only wine producer currently active 
within the viticultural area. 



Notice of Proposed Rulemaking 



In response to Mr. Helsaple's petition, ATF published a 
notice of proposed rulemaking, Notice No. 787, in the 

Federal 
Register

 on January 11, 1994 (59 FR 1510), proposing the 
establishment of the Seiad Valley viticultural area. The notice requested comments from all interested persons
by March 14, 1994. 



Comments on Notice of Proposed Rulemaking 



Nine comments were received concerning the proposal to 
establish the Seiad Valley viticultural area. All nine 
commenters stated that they fully support the proposed area as 
delineated in Notice 787. United States Senator Barbara Boxer 
noted in her comment that ``[d]esignating this distinct region 
as a viticultural area will help to spark economic growth in a 
community that has been hard-hit by the disappearance of 
timber and mining-based industries.'' One commenter, Barbara 
Holder, Forest Supervisor, Klamath National Forest, United 
States Department of Agriculture Forest Service, addressed a 
question asked in the notice of proposed rulemaking. ATF had 
asked for comments concerning the extension of the area to the 
south of the Klamath River. She stated ``[t]he area proposed, 
including lands south of the Klamath River along Grider Creek, 
does comprise a distinctive zone with regard to geographical 
features, topography, soil and climate.'' 



Evidence of Name 



Evidence that the name of the area is locally and/or 
nationally known as referring to the area specified includes:

(a) The U.S.G.S. map used to show the boundaries of the 
area (the Seiad Valley Quadrangle 7.5 minute series map) uses 
the name ``Seiad Valley'' to describe the area immediately 
surrounding Seiad Creek, corresponding to the portion of the 
area which is north of the Klamath River. The map also shows 
the town of Seiad Valley within this area. The map shows no 
separate designation for the portion of the area south of the 
Klamath River, which is drained by Grider Creek. 

(b) Excerpts from the 1957 issue of Siskiyou Pioneer, an 
annual publication of the Siskiyou County Historical Society, 
discuss the history of the name Seiad Valley, and local 
understanding of the extent of the area known as Seiad, or 
Seiad Valley. ``Sciad,'' by Betty Livingston and Hazel Davis, 
states the name Seiad was originally spelled Sciad, and the 
creek and valley were called that by the trappers ``before the 
prospectors came in 1850.'' Sometime after 1871, the spelling 
of the name changed to Seiad. In ``Gold Mining from Scott Bar 
to Happy Camp,'' by J.B. Grider, the following description 
appears:

 


Seiad is a small valley two miles long and one mile 
wide * * *. There are two large creeks in Seiad, Grider 
Creek and Seiad Creek. Grider Creek flows north into the 
Klamath from the Marble Mountain territory. Seiad creek 
flows south into the Klamath from the Siskiyous and Red 
Mountain.''

 


(c) The petitioner also provided a copy of a claim 
document dated August 26, 1942, which states the Grider Creek 
mining claim is ``situate in the Seiad Mining District.'' 



Evidence of Boundaries 



The area is defined primarily by its elevation, using the 
1,600 and 1,800 foot contour lines. The petitioner states that 
the vegetation within and outside the area provides a dramatic 
contrast. Within the area, cottonwood, oak and willow trees 
and wild blackberries and grapes grow in addition to the 
cultivated crops. Outside the area, on the higher slopes of 
the surrounding mountains, conifers such as cedar, Douglas fir 
and Ponderossa pine predominate in the thin, eroded soils with 
scant summer moisture. 



Geographical Features 



The viticultural area consists of the valleys drained by 
Seiad Creek and Grider Creek, which both flow into the Klamath 
River in northwestern California. These valleys and an 
expanse of land along the Klamath River which connects them 
share characteristics of topography, soil composition and 
climate which distinguish the viticultural area from the 
surrounding areas. 



Topography 



The U.S.G.S. topographic map of the Seiad Valley 
Quadrangle shows the area is a relatively flat area varying 
in elevation from 1,400 to 1,600 feet, with a small portion as 
high as 1,800 feet, surrounded by steeply rising terrain. 
Outside the area, the elevation ranges from 2,000 to 2,800 
feet, with peaks exceeding 3,000 feet on all sides, and some 
peaks as high as 3,900 feet. Snow melt, runoff, and erosion 
from these higher areas into the valley create a contrast in 
both the quality of soils and the availability of water within 
and outside the area. The lower elevation within the area 
also contributes to more moderate temperatures there. 



Soil 



The petitioner describes the valley floor as ``composed of 
deep fertile soil mixtures of loam, sand, clay and rocks 
eroded from the surrounding mountain slopes.'' According to a 
draft environmental impact report prepared in 1975 by the 
California Department of Transportation, the valley floor is 
``mostly alluvium deposits which were widely dredged and 
hydraulically mined for gold. Chromite was also mined within 
the Seiad Valley area.'' Dredging left ``tailings,'' or piles of 
rounded rocks, wherever the dredge operated. The petitioner 
states that these granite-dominated rock tailings store heat 
during the day and provide protection against frost in spring 
and fall.

Climate 


An article in the Pioneer Press of September 16, 1992, titled ``Rock-pile grapevines surprising all experts,'' contrasted
Siskiyou County growing conditions with those in Seiad Valley vineyard: ``What's stopped the area from becoming
a wine-producing area are the erratic late spring freezes in the zone where elevations are low enough to even make it
possible. And in some of the county's lowest elevation areas, the precipitation levels are too high.'' The article
stated the rock tailings in the vineyard ``may give Helsaple just the edge he needs to be the county's first successful
longterm wine grape grower.''



Boundary 


The boundary of the Seiad Valley viticultural area may be found on one United States Geological Survey (U.S.G.S.)
map with a scale of 1:24000. The boundary is described in  9.148. 



Miscellaneous 


ATF does not wish to give the impression by approving the Seiad Valley viticultural area that it is approving or endorsing
the quality of wine from this area. ATF is approving this area as being distinct from surrounding areas, not better
than other areas. By approving this area, ATF will allow wine producers to claim a distinction on labels and advertisements
as to origin of the grapes.
Any commercial advantage gained can only come from consumer acceptance of wines from Seiad Valley.


Executive Order 12866 


It has been determined that this rule is not a significant regulatory action because: 
(1) It will not have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy,
a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local
or tribal governments or communities; 
(2) Create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; 
(3) Materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees or loan programs or the rights and obligations
of recipients thereof; or 
(4) Raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles
set forth in Executive Order 12866. 


Regulatory Flexibility Act 


It is hereby certified that this regulation will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of
small entities. Any benefit derived from the use of a viticultural area name is the result of the proprietor's own efforts
and consumer acceptance of wines from a particular area. No new requirements are imposed. Accordingly, a regulatory
flexibility analysis is not required. 


Paperwork Reduction Act 


The provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, Public Law 96-511, 44 U.S.C. Chapter 35, and its implementing
regulations, 5 CFR part 1320, do not apply to this final rule because no requirement to collect information is imposed.

ACTION:

 Final rule; technical amendment.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 On January 14, 1993 at 58 FR 4462, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) published a final rule
on Permit-Required Confined Spaces, 29 CFR 1910.146 in the 

Federal Register

. On June 29, 1993 at 58 FR 34844, OSHA published a corrections document for that final rule which contained corrections
to the regulatory text and to several appendices of the final rule. This document adds a metric equivalent in paragraph
(k)(3)(ii) and further revises the ``Atmospheric monitoring'' section of appendix E, ``Sewer System Entry'', of
the final rule. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 OSHA published its final rule on Permit-Required Confined Spaces, 29 CFR 1910.146, on January 14, 1993 at 58 FR 4462.
Corrections to the regulatory text and several appendices were published on June 29, 1993 at 58 FR 34844. 



Amendment to 29 CFR 1910.146 



The last sentence of  1910.146(k)(3)(ii) requires that a mechanical device be used to retrieve personnel from
vertical type permit spaces more than 5 feet deep. OSHA failed to include the metric equivalent of 5 feet in this provision.
Since it is the policy of the U.S. Government and OSHA to include metric equivalents of U.S. units wherever possible,
OSHA is correcting  1910.146(k)(3)(ii) by adding the metric equivalent (1.52 meters) of 5 feet. 



Amendment to Appendix E 



In the correction notice of June 29, 1993 (58 FR 34844), OSHA removed all reference to ``broad range sensor instruments''
from the ``Atmospheric monitoring'' section of non-mandatory appendix E (see 58 FR 34845) because the Agency felt
that it was inappropriate to suggest a particular type of sensor instrument for all sewer entries. However, it appears
that, by removing the reference to the broad range sensor, OSHA inadvertently created the impression that the Agency
now favored the use of substance-specific sensors over the use of broad range sensors for atmospheric monitoring
in sewer systems. This was not the Agency's intent. As stated in the preamble to the final rule, the choice of sensors
or other monitoring equipment will, in general, depend on the extent to which the employer has been able to identify
the atmospheric hazards present or potentially present in the sewer. Where the employer has already identified those
hazards, substance-specific sensors are preferable, because they accurately indicate the concentrations of the
identified air contaminants. By contrast, where the employer has not been able to identify the specific atmospheric
hazards present or potentially present in the sewer, broad range sensors are preferable because they indicate that
the hazardous threshold of a class (or classes) of contaminants (i.e., hydrocarbons) in the sewer have been exceeded.


Sewer permit spaces generally cannot be isolated from adjacent sections of the sewer. This means that air contaminants
arising or introduced elsewhere in a sewer system can enter a sewer permit space, without warning, during entry operations.
This, in turn, may make it difficult for employers to anticipate the potential atmospheric hazards of a sewer permit
space. OSHA expects employers to consider the predictability of sewer permit space's atmosphere when selecting
the appropriate equipment for atmospheric testing and monitoring. 

Accordingly, OSHA is revising the information in  1910.146, appendix E, pertaining to atmospheric testing
and monitoring in sewers. The reference to broad range sensors is restored and the advantages and limitations of both
the oxygen sensor/broad range sensor instrument and the substance-specific device are more clearly stated. However,
no preference is expressed for either type of meter. Instrument selection is left up to the employer, who is in a position
to decide what type of testing instrument is appropriate for a particular sewer entry. 



Exemption From Notice and Comment Procedures 



With regard to this action, OSHA has determined that it is not required to follow procedures for public notice and comment
rulemaking under either section 4 of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553) or under section 6(b) of the Occupational
Safety and Health Act (29 U.S.C. 655(b)). This action does not affect the substantive requirements or coverage of
the standards themselves. This technical amendment does not modify or revoke existing rights or obligations, nor
does it establish new ones. This action simply provides additional information on the existing regulatory burden.
OSHA, therefore, finds that notice and public procedure are impracticable and unnecessary within the meaning of
5 U.S.C. 553(b)(3)(B). For the same reasons, OSHA also finds that, in accordance with 29 CFR 1911.5, good cause exists
for dispensing with the public notice and comment procedures prescribed in section 6(b) of the Occupational Safety
and Health Act. 



Exemption From Delayed Effective Date Requirement 



Under 5 U.S.C. 553, OSHA finds that there is good cause for making this technical amendment effective upon publication
in the 

Federal Register

. This technical amendment simply provides additional information on the existing regulatory burden without increasing
that burden.

2. The last sentence of paragraph (k)(3)(ii) of  1910.146 is amended by adding ``(1.52 m)'' between the words
``feet'' and ``deep.'' 

3. Section (2), 

Atmospheric monitoring,

 of Appendix E of  1910.146 is revised to read as follows:




(2) 

Atmospheric monitoring.

 Entrants should be trained in the use of, and be equipped with, atmospheric monitoring equipment which sounds an audible
alarm, in addition to its visual readout, whenever one of the following conditions are encountered: Oxygen concentration
less than 19.5 percent; flammable gas or vapor at 10 percent or more of the lower flammable limit (LFL); or hydrogen
sulfide or carbon monoxide at or above 10 ppm or 35 ppm, respectively, measured as an 8-hour time-weighted average.
Atmospheric monitoring equipment needs to be calibrated according to the manufacturer's instructions. The oxygen
sensor/broad range sensor is best suited for initial use in situations where the actual or potential contaminants
have not been identified, because broad range sensors, unlike substance-specific sensors, enable employers to
obtain an overall reading of the hydrocarbons (flammables) present in the space. However, such sensors only indicate
that a hazardous threshold of a class of chemicals has been exceeded. They do not measure the levels of contamination
of specific substances. Therefore, substance-specific devices, which measure the actual levels of specific substances,
are best suited for use where actual and potential contaminants have been identified. The measurements obtained
with substance-specific devices are of vital importance to the employer when decisions are made concerning the measures
necessary to protect entrants (such as ventilation or personal protective equipment) and the setting and attainment
of appropriate entry conditions. However, the sewer environment may suddenly and unpredictably change, and the
substance-specific devices may not detect the potentially lethal atmospheric hazards which may enter the sewer
environment. 

Although OSHA considers the information and guidance provided above to be appropriate and useful in most sewer entry
situations, the Agency emphasizes that each employer must consider the unique circumstances, including the predictability
of the atmosphere, of the sewer permit spaces in the employer's workplace in preparing for entry. Only the employer
can decide, based upon his or her knowledge of, and experience with permit spaces in sewer systems, what the best type
of testing instrument may be for any specific entry operation. 

The selected testing instrument should be carried and used by the entrant in sewer line work to monitor the atmosphere
in the entrant's environment, and in advance of the entrant's direction of movement, to warn the entrant of any deterioration
in atmospheric conditions. Where several entrants are working together in the same immediate location, one instrument,
used by the lead entrant, is acceptable.

During the 1994-95 and 1995-96 academic years, a program of pilot grants is being initiated with an annual
competition for grants held during the spring of each year. Grants to institutions will complement NSEP scholarship
and fellowship programs. NSEP encourages the development of programs and curricula which:

(1) Improves the quality and infrastructure of international education;

(2) Addresses issues of national capacity; and

(3) Defines innovative approaches to issues not addressed by NSEP scholarship and fellowship programs.

(b) The NSEP Grants Program is designed to address a number of important objectives critical to the United States:

(1) To equip Americans with an understanding of less commonly taught languages and cultures and enable them to become
integrally involved in global issues.

(2) To build a critical base of future leaders in the marketplace and in government service who have cultivated international
relationships and worked and studied along-side foreign experts.

(3) To develop a cadre of professionals with more than the traditional knowledge of language and culture who can use
this ability to help the U.S. make sound decisions and deal effectively with global issues; and

(4) To enhance institutional capacity and increase the number of faculty who can educate U.S. citizens toward achieving
these goals.

(c) Grants will be awarded for initial 1- or 2-year periods. Potential follow-on commitments will be based on a rigorous
evaluation and assessment process. Between 15 and 25 awards are expected to be made in the first year ranging from approximately
$25,000 to $250,000. These are only estimates and do not bind the NSEP to a specific number of grants or to the amount
of the grant.

(d) The following key characteristics will be emphasized in the NSEP Institutional Grants Program:

(1) 

Programmatic in emphasis.

 The purpose of the grants is to address weaknesses and gaps in programs and curricula. The grants should be used to strengthen
the national capacity in international education. While ``operational'' support for already existing centers
and projects may be a component of a grant, NSEP emphasizes commitment of its limited resources to projects that establish
and improve educational programs available to students and teachers.

(2) 

Demand and requirements oriented.

 Grants are designed to address national needs. These needs must be clearly articulated and defended in a grant proposal.
It must be clear that the following questions are addressed:

(i) Who will benefit from the program funded by the grant?

(ii) What need does the program address?

(iii) How will this program augment the capacity of the Federal Government or of the field of education in areas consistent
with the objectives of the NSEP? How does it fit the national requirement?

(3) Cooperation and collaboration among institutions is mandated in order to ensure that a wider cross-section of
colleges and universities benefit from a program funded under NSEP. NSEP is committed to providing opportunities
to the widest cross-section of the higher education population as is feasible. Cooperation can be in the form of formal
consortia arrangements or less formal but equally effective agreements among institutions. Both vertical (among
different types of institutions) and horizontal (among similar institutions across functional areas) integration
are encouraged. Outreach to institutions that do not normally benefit from such programs is also strongly favored.

(4) Complementary to other Federal programs such as Title VI of the Higher Education Act. NSEP is designed to address
gaps and shortfalls in Higher Education and to build and expand national capacity. NSEP recognizes that base capacity
currently exists in some foreign languages and area studies. It also recognizes that funding shortfalls and other
factors have contributed to tremendous gaps and weaknesses. Funding for expansion of the international education
infrastructure remains limited. Duplication of effort is not affordable. NSEP encourages new initiatives as well
as expansion of existing programs to increase supply in cases where the demand cannot be met and encourages efforts
that increase demand.

(5) NSEP encourages proposals that address two categories of issues relating to the mission of NSEP:

(i) Programs in specific foreign languages, countries or areas; and/or

(ii) Programs addressing professional, disciplinary and/or interdisciplinary opportunities involving international
education.

(6) NSEP views student funding as portable and hopes that universities will develop ways to move students to programs
and to provide credit with these programs. NSEP believes that programs need to be developed that are available to a
wider cross-section of students. Thus, they need to be ``open'' to students from other institutions. Programs might
also be ``transportable'' from one institution to another.

(7) NSEP emphasizes leveraging of funds and cost-sharing in order to maximize the impact of NSEP funding. It encourages
institutions to seek other sources of funding to leverage against NSEP funding and to commit institutional resources
in support of the program as well. NSEP also emphasizes burden sharing between the institution and the Program. NSEP
encourages institutions to demonstrate a commitment to international education and to present a plan for how funding
for the proposed program will be achieved over a 3-5 year period so that NSEP can reduce its financial commitment
to programs. The funds requested from NSEP should minimize costs allocated to unassigned institutional ``overhead.''
NSEP institutional grants are assumed to be for training programs. Consequently, university/college indirect
costs associated with training programs should be used as a general benchmark for determining appropriate overhead
rates. 

(8) NSEP encourages creativity and is responsive to the needs of higher education to expand the capacity to provide
more opportunities for quality international education. We do not suggest that the guidelines presented in the grant
solicitation will cover all problems and issues. Quite to the contrary, we encourage careful consideration of issues
confronting international education in the U.S. and thoughtful proposals that address these issues, consistent
with the overall mission of the NSEP.



 206.2 

Eligibility.



Any accredited U.S. institution of higher education, as defined by section 1201(a) of the Higher Education Act of
1965 (20 U.S.C. 1141(a)), may apply for and receive a grant. This includes 2- and 4-year colleges and universities,
both public and private. Other organizations, associations, and agencies may be included in proposals but may not
be direct recipients of a grant. Foreign institutions may also be included in a proposal but may not be direct recipients
of a grant. Only U.S. citizens and U.S. institutions may receive funds through a grant awarded by the NSEP.



 206.3 

Overall program emphasis.



(a) The NSEP grants to institutions program focuses on two broad program areas that reflect the challenges to building
the infrastructure for international education in U.S. higher education:

(1) Development and expansion to quality programs in overseas locations.

(i) Programs that offer important opportunities for U.S. students, both undergraduate and graduate, to study in
critical areas under-represented by U.S. students, and

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940719-0-00032 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940719-0-00009 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(ii) Development of meaningful competencies in foreign languages and cultures.

(2) Development and implementation of programs and curricula on U.S. campuses that provide more opportunities for
study of foreign languages and cultures and the integration of these studies into overall programs of study.

(b) 

Addressing the need for improving study abroad infrastructure. 

The NSEP encourages the study of foreign cultures and languages typically neglected or under-represented in higher
education. In the foreign language field these are generally referred to as less commonly taught languages. In area
studies, these are generally defined as non-Western European in focus. An integral part of any student's international
education is a quality study abroad experience that includes a significant portion devoted to gaining functional
competence in an indigenous language and culture. Unfortunately, there are only limited opportunities to study
abroad in many foreign areas. In addition, many programs lack a quality foreign language component as well as significantly
experiential components. Historically, more attention has been paid to the development of programs in Western Europe
where the student demand has been greater. NSEP hopes to encourage, through institutional grants, the development
and/or expansion of infrastructure for study abroad in critical areas of the world where capacity does not currently
exist. Programs are encouraged that:

(1) Expand program opportunities in critical countries where limited opportunities currently exist.

(2) Establish program opportunities in critical countries where no opportunities exist.

(3) Enhance meaningful opportunities for foreign language and foreign culture acquisition in conjunction with
study abroad.

(4) 

Create and expand study abroad opportunities for students from diverse disciplines. 

In all cases, grants to develop study abroad infrastructure must address issues of demand (how to increase demand
for study in the proposed countries or regions) and diversity (how to attract a diverse student population to study
in the proposed countries or regions). Grants may support start-up of programs or the expansion of a program's capacity
to benefit more and/or different student or to improve the quality of study abroad instruction. Proposals can address
issues concerning either or both issues of undergraduate and graduate education.

(c) 

Addressing the infrastructure for international education in U.S. higher education. 

While studying abroad is an integral part of becoming more proficient in one's understanding of another culture and
in becoming more functionally competent in another language, the NSEP also emphasizes the development and expansion
of programs that address serious shortfalls that provide a stronger domestic program base in areas consistent with
the NSEP mission. The NSEP encourages grant proposals that address infrastructure issues. While not limited to these
areas, programs might address the following issues:

(1) 

Enhancing foreign language skill acquisition through innovative curriculum development efforts. 

Such efforts may involve intensive language study designed for different types of students. Less traditional approaches
should be considered as well as ways to provide foreign language instruction for the student who may not otherwise
have an opportunity to pursue such instruction. Functional competency should be stressed but defined as meaningful
for the particular discipline or field.

(2) 

Expanding opportunities for international education in diverse disciplines and fields and in issues that are cross-area
or cross-national in character. 

Efforts are encouraged that offer opportunities for meaningful international education for those in fields where
opportunities are not generally available. There are many fields and disciplines that are rapidly becoming international
in scope, yet the educational process does not include a meaningful international component. In many cases this is
due to a rigid structure in the field itself that cannot accommodate additional requirements, such as language and
culture study. There are also issues that involve cross-area or cross-national education or are studied in comparative
terms. Students in these areas also need quality opportunities in international education.

(3) 

Provide opportunities for programmatic studies throughout an undergraduate or graduate career. 

Students frequently study a foreign language or pursue study abroad opportunities as adjuncts to their overall program
of study. Innovations in curriculum are needed to more thoroughly integrate aspects of international education
into curriculum throughout a student's undergraduate or graduate career. The NSEP encourages institutions to address
these overall international education curriculum issues in their proposals.

(4) 

Provide opportunities to increase demand for study of foreign areas and languages. 

Efforts to develop educational programs that offer innovative approaches to increasing demand to include a meaningful
international component are encouraged. Proposals are encouraged to address issues of diversity: how to attract
students who have historically not pursued opportunities involving international education. Diversity includes
geographical, racial, ethnic, and gender factors.

(5) 

Improve faculty credentials in international education. 

Efforts to create more opportunities for teachers to become competent in foreign cultures and languages are encouraged.
While NSEP is a higher education program, it is interested in the potential dynamics of collaborative efforts that
recognize the shared responsibility of all educational levels for promoting international education.

(6) 

Uses of new technologies. 

During the last decade tremendous advances have been made in the application of new educational technologies. Such
technologies have enhanced our capacity to improve instruction, broaden access, and assess student learning. NSEP's
objective is not to support large technology oriented projects. However, NSEP encourages efforts that integrate
innovative uses of technology emphasizing how proposed programs will have significance beyond a local setting.
Proposals that include proposed uses of technology will be required to demonstrate detailed knowledge of the technology,
how it is to be developed and applied and how student learning will be impacted.



 206.4 

Proposal development and review.



The purpose of this section is to explain the NSEP review process. [

Note:

 A number of important approaches to proposal development and review have been adapted from guidelines developed
by the Department of Education's Office of Postsecondary Education for its ``Fund for the Improvement of Postsecondary
Education (FIPSE)''.] This information if intended to aid institutions in the development of proposals and to provide
guidance concerning the criteria that may be used in reviewing and evaluating proposals.

(a) The grants to institutions program will be administered by the National Security Education Program Office (NSEPO).
However, the NSEPO will function as an administrative office much in the same manner as the Institute of International
Education and the Academy for Educational Development function in administering NSEP scholarship and fellowship
programs, respectively. The NSEPO will not review or evaluate proposals. The proposals will be reviewed and evaluated
by national screening panels.

<DOCNO> FR940719-0-00033 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940719-0-00009 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(b) The NSEP will use a two-stage review process in order to evaluate a broad range of proposal ideas. In the first stage,
applicants will submit a five-page summary [double-spaced] of their proposal. An institution may submit more than
one proposal, but each proposal should be submitted and will be evaluated separately and independently.

(c) NSEP expects competition for grants to be intense. By implementing a two-stage process, potential grantees are
given an opportunity to present their ideas without creating a paperwork burden on both the proposal authors and the
reviewers.

(d) 

The preliminary review process

. The review of preliminary proposals will be undertaken by panels of 

external

 reviewers, 

not

 members of the NSEPO. Panels of not less than three will be assembled to review preliminary proposals. Panel members
will be drawn primarily from faculty and administration in higher education but might also include representatives
from the research, business, and government communities. Every effort will be made to ensure balance (geographical,
ethnic, gender, institutional type, subject matter) across the entire competition.

(e) Panel members will reflect the nature of the grants program. Each panel will include a recognized expert in a field
of international education. Other panelists may include experts in area studies, foreign language education, and
other fields and disciplines with an international focus.

(f) Preliminary proposals will be reviewed according to a set of criteria developed in consultation with representatives
from higher education, and provided to the panels. The applicant shall, at a minimum, deal with the following issues
in the preliminary proposal:

(1) How the proposal addresses issues of national capacity in international education.

(2) What area(s), language(s), and discipline(s) the proposal addresses and the importance of these to U.S. national
capacity.

(3) What the applicant is proposing to do.

(4) How the proposal deals with the key characteristics of the NSEP.

(5) Demonstration of thorough knowledge of the state of the art in the particular area of the proposal and how this proposal
develops or builds capacity, not duplicates existing capacity.

(g) The applicant must also include a budget estimate. This budget estimate, for the first year of the proposal, must
include the following:

(1) A summary of anticipated direct costs including professional salaries, funds for students, travel, materials
and supplies, consultants, etc., and how or why these costs are needed.

(2) An estimate of institutional indirect costs. The budget estimate must also indicate whether funding is also being
requested for a second year and, if so, an estimate of the amount to be requested.

(h) Panelists will review and rank proposals and forward their recommendations to the NSEPO. NSEPO will review and
analyze these recommendations and inform all applicants of decisions.



 206.5

Final proposal process.



NSEPO will provide detailed comments on proposals to all applicants who are invited to prepare a final proposal.

(a) Final proposals should be limited to no more than 25 double-spaced pages. Proposals will be reviewed by national
panels constructed similarly to those designed to review preliminary proposals. In addition to a field review process,
panelists will be assembled in Washington D.C. to discuss and review the independent and competing merits of proposals.


(b) Proposals will be evaluated in two basic categories:

(1) Proposals that address study abroad infrastructure and 

(2) Proposals that address domestic infrastructure. Should proposals deal with both of these issues, they will be
evaluated in a third category. This grouping of proposals will ensure that all categories of proposals receive funding
consideration.

(c) In general, final proposals will be considered on the following selection criteria:

(1) 

Importance of the problem

. Each proposal will be evaluated according to the merit of how it addresses issue(s) of national capacity. The proposal
must articulate the importance of the problem it addresses, how the proposal addresses issues of national capacity
in international education, and how it is consistent with the objectives of the NSEP.

(2) 

Importance of proposed foreign language(s), foreign area(s), field(s) or discipline(s)

. The proposal will be evaluated according to how well it articulates the need for programs in the proposed areas, languages,
fields, or disciplines.

(3) 

Identification of need and gaps/shortfalls

. The proposal will be evaluated according to its persuasiveness in identifying where the needs exist and where serious
shortfalls exist in the capacity to fill the need. The proposal should clearly identify why these gaps exist and provide
a strong indication of familiarity with the state of the field in the proposal area.

(4) 

Cost effectiveness

. Proposals will be evaluated on the basis of ``educational value for the dollar.'' NSEP is interested in funding proposals
in areas where other funding is limited or in areas where NSEP funding can significantly augment or complement other
sources. NSEP is not interested in replacing funds available from other sources or in duplicating other efforts.
Also, NSEP is interested in projects whose dollar levels and long-range budget plans provide for realistic continuation
by the grantee institution and adaptation by other institutions. NSEP is interested in proposed approaches to leveraging
other funds against the proposed project.

(5) 

Evaluation plans

. Proposals will be evaluated on their approach to measuring impact. What impact will the proposed program have on
national capacity? How will the proposed program deal with assessing language and foreign cultural competency?
In the case of study abroad programs, how will the success and impact of study abroad experiences be assessed. Proposals
should not defer the consideration of these issues to a latter stage of the effort. Evaluation and assessment should
be an integral part of the entire proposal effort.

(6) 

Prospects for wider impact

. Proposals must address national needs and will be evaluated according to how well they are likely to address these
needs. What component of the higher education community does the proposal address? How diverse a student population
will the proposed program address? What applications to other institutions will be made available, either directly
or indirectly, because of the proposed program?

(7) 

Capacity and commitment of the applicant

. The proposal will be evaluated according to the evidence provided on the commitment of the institution, and other
institutions, to the proposed project. What other institutions are involved and what is their commitment. If there
are commitments from foreign institutions, what is the evidence of this commitment? Are their plans for the institution
to integrate the efforts of the proposed program into the educational process? What plans are there for eventual self-support?
As with many other similar programs, NSEP is particularly interested in the degree to which the institution is willing
to bear a reasonable share of the direct and indirect costs of the proposed project. 

(d) Applicants should also indicate if they currently receive or are seeking support from other sources. Applicants
should indicate why support from NSEP is appropriate, if other sources are also being sought.

SUMMARY: 

This notice implements special local regulations for the Blackbeard Pirate Jamboree to be held on the Elizabeth River
at Town Point Park, Norfolk and Portsmouth, Virginia. The regulations are needed to control vessel traffic within
the immediate vicinity of the event due to the confined nature of the waterway and the expected congestion at the time
of the event. The regulations restrict general navigation in the area for the safety of life and property on the navigable
waters during the event.

Discussion of Regulation



Norfolk Festevents, Ltd. submitted an application to hold the Blackbeard Pirate Jamboree on the Elizabeth River
at Town Point Park, Norfolk and Portsmouth, Virginia. The event will consist of a parade of sail followed by an orchestrated
water drama with cannon fire between two vessels. Since many spectator vessels are expected to be in the area to watch
the jamboree, the regulations in 33 CFR 100.501 are being implemented for the safety of life and property. The waterway
will not be closed for an extended period; therefore, commercial traffic should not be severely disrupted.

In addition to regulating the area for the safety of life and property, this notice of implementation also authorizes
the Patrol Commander to regulate the operation of the Berkley drawbridge in accordance with 33 CFR 117.1007, and authorizes
spectators to anchor in the special anchorage areas described in 33 CFR 110.72aa. 33 CFR 110.72aa establishes the
spectator anchorages in 33 CFR 100.501 as special anchorage areas under Inland Navigation Rule 30, 33 U.S.C. 2030(g).
33 CFR 117.1007 closes the draw of the Berkley Bridge to vessels during and for one hour before and after the effective
period under 33 CFR 100.501, except that the Coast Guard Patrol Commander may order that the draw be opened for commercial
vessels.

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
summary: 

This notice implements special local regulation for Norfolk Harborfest 1994, an annual event to be held in the Waterside
area of the Elizabeth River between Norfolk and Portsmouth, Virginia. These special local regulations are needed
to control vessel traffic within the immediate vicinity of Waterside due to the confined nature of the waterway and
the expected vessel congestion during the Norfolk Harborfest 1994 activities. The effect will be to restrict general
navigation in the regulated area for the safety of participants and spectators.

Discussion of Regulation



Norfolk Harborfest, Inc. submitted an application to hold Norfolk Harborfest 1994 on June 3, 4, and 5, 1994, in the
Waterside area of the Elizabeth River. This area is covered by 33 CFR 100.501 and generally includes the waters of the
Elizabeth River between Town Point Park, Norfolk, Virginia, the mouth of the Eastern Branch of the Elizabeth River,
and Hospital Point, Portsmouth, Virginia. Since this event is of the type contemplated by this regulation and the
safety of the participants and spectators viewing this event will be enhanced by the implementation of special local
regulations for the Elizabeth River, 33 CFR 100.501 will be in effect during Norfolk Harborfest 1994. Norfolk Harborfest
1994 will consist of aerobatic demonstrations, an air/sea rescue demonstration, fireworks, lighted boat parade,
and numerous other water events, to include a parade of sailboats and several boat and raft races. Because commercial
vessels will be permitted to transit the regulated area between events, commercial traffic should not be severely
disrupted. In addition to regulating the area for the safety of life and property, this notice of implementation also
authorizes the Patrol Commander to regulate the operation of the Berkley drawbridge in accordance with 33 CFR 117.1007,
and authorizes spectators to anchor in the special anchorage areas described in 33 CFR 110.72aa.

Safety Zone Regulation: Cambridge Triathlon, Hambrooks Bay Section of the Choptank River, Cambridge, MD



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Coast Guard, DOT.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Temporary final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Coast Guard Marine Safety Office Baltimore is establishing a safety zone for the purpose of the ``Cambridge Triathlon''
event to be held in the Hambrooks Bay section of the Choptank River, Cambridge, Maryland. The event will consist of
participants swimming a two mile loop around Great Marsh Point and support vessels monitoring the participants.
This safety zone is necessary to control small craft and commercial vessel traffic and to provide for the safety of
life and property on U.S. navigable waters during this event. Entry into this zone is prohibited unless authorized
by the Captain of the Port.




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 553, a Notice of Proposed Rule Making has not been published for this regulation and good
cause exists for making it effective in less than 30 days from the date of publication. The application to hold this
event was not received until February 16, 1994 and there was not sufficient time remaining to publish proposed rules
in advance of the event or to provide for a delayed effective date.




Background and Purpose



The Columbia Triathlon Association filed an application with the U.S. Coast Guard, Group Baltimore requesting a
safety zone for the ``Cambridge Triathlon'' event to take place June 5, 1994. As part of their application, the Columbia
Triathlon Association requested the Coast Guard provide control of spectator and commercial traffic during the
swimming event.



Discussion of Regulations



This regulation is necessary to ensure the safety of spectator craft, recreational vessels as well as swimmers participating
in the event, and to provide for the safety of life and property on U.S. navigable waters during the event. Since Hambrooks
Bay will not be closed for an extended period, vessel traffic should not be severely disrupted.

This regulation is issued pursuant to 33 U.S.C. 1231 as set out in the authority citation for all of part 165.



Drafting Information



The drafters of this regulation are Timothy P. Ryan, Chief Warrant Officer, project officer for the Captain of the
Port, Baltimore, Maryland and Christopher A. Abel, Lieutenant Commander, project attorney, Fifth Coast Guard District
Legal Staff.



Regulatory Evaluation



This rule is not a significant regulatory action under Executive Order 12866 and is not significant under the Department
of Transportation Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979). The Coast Guard expects the
economic impact of this rule to be so minimal that a Regulatory Evaluation is unnecessary.



Small Entities



Because it expects the impact of this rule to be minimal, the Coast Guard certifies under 5 U.S.C. 605(b) that this rule
will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.



Environmental Assessment



The Coast Guard has considered the environmental impact of this proposal consistent with Section 2.B.2.C. of Commandant
Instruction M16475.1B, and actions to protect public safety have been determined to be categorically excluded from
further environmental documentation.



Federalism Assessment



This action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612,
and it has been determined that this rule will not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant preparation
of a Federalism Assessment.

Technical Amendments 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Panama Canal Commission.

 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Panama Canal Commission is today amending its regulations in title 35, Code of Federal Regulations in order to
reflect mailing address changes, both for the agency headquarters located in the Republic of Panama and the Office
of the Secretary located in Washington, DC.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 In compliance with changes in the military APO postal system, the Panama Canal Commission's correspondence address
in the Republic of Panama has been modified to include: A four-digit unit number, the letters ``AA'' after the APO,
and the addition of a four-digit number to the zip code. The new correspondence address is: Panama Canal Commission,
Unit 2300, APO AA 34011-2300. Also, because the Office of the Secretary has relocated from 2000 L Street, NW.,
suite 550, Washington, DC 20036-4996 to a new address at International Square, 1825 I Street, NW., Suite 1050
Washington, DC 20006-5402, it is necessary to amend title 35, Code of Federal Regulations so that correspondence,
publications and other documents will be addressed to both new mailing addresses. 


The Commission has been exempted from Executive Order 12866 and, accordingly, the provisions of that directive do
not apply to this rule. Even if the Order were applicable, this rule would not have a significant economic impact on
a substantial number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act. 
Further, the agency has determined that implementation of the rule will have no adverse effect on competition, employment,
investment, productivity, innovation, or on the ability of the United States-based enterprises to compete with
foreign based enterprises in domestic or export markets. 
Because a notice of proposed rulemaking and an opportunity for public comment are not required to be given for this
rule by section 553 of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553), or by any other law, under sections 603(a) and
604(a) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, no initial or final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis has to be or will be
prepared. 
Finally, the Administrator of the Panama Canal Commission certifies that these changes in regulations meet the applicable
standards provided in sections 2(a) and 2(b)(2) of Executive Order No. 12778.

Approval and Promulgation of Title V, Section 507, Small Business Stationary Source Technical and Environmental
Compliance Assistance Program for Connecticut




<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).




</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.





</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 EPA is approving a State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision submitted by the State of Connecticut for the purpose
of establishing a small business stationary source technical and environmental compliance assistance program.
The SIP revision was submitted by the State to satisfy the Federal mandate to ensure that small businesses have access
to technical assistance and regulatory information necessary to comply with the Clean Air Act (CAA). The rationale
for the approval is set forth in this action.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

I. Background


Implementation of the provisions of the CAA, as amended in 1990, will require regulation of many small businesses
so that areas may attain and maintain the National ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) and reduce the emission of
air toxics. Small businesses frequently lack the technical expertise and financial resources necessary to evaluate
such regulations and to determine the appropriate mechanisms for compliance. In anticipation of the impact of these
requirements on small businesses, the CAA requires that States adopt a Small Business Stationary Source Technical
and Environmental Compliance Assistance Program (PROGRAM), and submit this PROGRAM as a revision to the federally
approved SIP. In addition, the CAA directs the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to oversee these small business
assistance programs and report to Congress on their implementation. The requirements for establishing a PROGRAM
are set out in section 507 of title V of the CAA. In February 1992, EPA issued 

Guidelines for the Implementation of Section 507 of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments

, in order to delineate the Federal and State roles in meeting the new statutory provisions and as a tool to provide further
guidance to the States on submitting acceptable SIP revisions.

The State of Connecticut has submitted a SIP revision to EPA in order to satisfy the requirements of section 507. In
order to gain full approval, the State submittal must provide for each of the following PROGRAM elements: (1) The establishment
of a Small Business Assistance Program (SBAP) to provide technical and compliance assistance to small businesses;
(2) the establishment of a State Small Business Ombudsman to represent the interests of small businesses in the regulatory
process; and (3) the creation of a Compliance Advisory Panel (CAP) to determine and report on the overall effectiveness
of the SBAP. 



II. Analysis


Connecticut has met all of the requirements of section 507 by submitting a SIP revision that implements all required
PROGRAM elements.


1. Small Business Assistance Program


Section 507(a) sets forth six requirements

1

 that the State must meet to have an approvable SBAP. The first requirement is to establish adequate mechanisms for
developing, collecting and coordinating information concerning compliance methods and technologies for small
business stationary sources, and programs to encourage lawful cooperation among such sources and other persons
to further compliance with the Act. 





The SBAP will act as an information clearing house by referring small businesses to technical experts, specifically
trained to handle specific questions relevant to achieving compliance with the CAA. The State has further met this
requirement through proactive and reactive components. The proactive component involves adequate communication
with and information outreach to small businesses on technical and compliance issues. The reactive component involves
the establishment of a clearinghouse for handling incoming inquiries from small businesses regarding methods for
achieving compliance with air pollution control requirements under the CAA.

The second requirement is to establish adequate mechanisms for assisting small business stationary sources with
pollution prevention and accidental release detection and prevention, including providing information concerning
alternative technologies, process changes, products and methods of operation that help reduce air pollution. 

The State has met this requirement by including mechanisms to provide assistance which allows the SBAP to coordinate
information relating to pollution prevention and accidental release detection with Federal, state and local agencies
and by allowing the SBAP clearinghouse to disseminate information on pollution prevention and accidental release
prevention and detection. Furthermore, a contact directory will be developed and made available which will include
a list of technical experts in the areas of pollution prevention, accidental release prevention and detection and
familiarity with pollution prevention technologies and alternatives to reduce pollution. 

The third requirement is to develop a compliance and technical assistance program for small business stationary
sources which assists small businesses in determining applicable requirements and in receiving permits under the
Act in a timely and efficient manner. 

The State's SBAP will utilize several mechanisms to provide compliance and technical assistance to small businesses.
These include developing industry-specific information packets, providing training to educate small business
owners on conducting self-inspections and understanding the compliance requirements, and communicating changes
in regulations and policy to small businesses through workshops, flyers and presentations. The SBAP will develop
a data base that includes small business stationary sources and associations to attempt to notify affected sources
of potential changes or rules that affect them. Additionally, the SBAP will work with trade associations, local agencies,
educational facilities, and community leaders to establish environmental partnerships to bring about voluntary
compliance with regulations under the CAA through participation and educational activities. 

The fourth requirement is to develop adequate mechanisms to assure that small business stationary sources receive
notice of their rights under the Act in such manner and form as to assure reasonably adequate time for such sources to
evaluate compliance methods and any relevant or applicable proposed or final regulation or standards issued under
the Act. 

The State has met this requirement by listing three possible methods. As stated above the SBAP will develop a data base
that includes small business stationary sources and associations and will coordinate with appropriate agency staff
to attempt to notify affected sources of potential changes or rules that affect them. Additionally, formal public
notification procedures will be developed and implemented agency-wide that will attempt to insure timely notice
of small businesses of their rights and obligations under the CAA. Finally, as stated earlier, the SBAP will work with
trade associations, local agencies, educational facilities, and community leaders to establish environment partnerships
to bring about voluntary compliance with regulations under the CAA through participation and educational activities.

The fifth requirement is to develop adequate mechanisms for informing small business stationary sources of their
obligations under the Act, including mechanisms for referring such sources to qualified auditors or, at the option
of the State, for providing audits of the operations of such sources to determine compliance with the Act. 

The State has met this requirement by identifying various mechanisms in the SIP revision. Some of these mechanisms
include visits to small businesses, public service announcements, seminars conducted by the CT DEP and the establishment
of a clearinghouse to handle inquiries from small businesses. These methods may be utilized to inform small businesses
of their obligations under the CAA. Furthermore, the State is designing a program for referring sources to qualified
auditors to determine if they are meeting the requirements of the CAA.

The sixth requirement is to develop procedures for consideration of requests from small business stationary sources
for modification of: (A) Any work practice or technological method of compliance; or (B) the schedule of milestones
for implementing such work practice or method of compliance preceding any applicable compliance date, based on the
technological and financial capability of any such small business stationary source. 
The SIP revision states that the DEP will establish approved procedures to provide for the review of requests from
small businesses for modification of work practice or technical methods of compliance based on financial and technological
capability. A system will be provided for collecting and coordinating information on compliance methods and technologies.
Data bases and experts in different areas will provide definitive guidance information. No such modification may
be granted unless it is in compliance with the applicable requirements of the CAA. Additionally, the CT DEP will establish
approval procedures for modification requests based on financial and technological capability.



2. Ombudsman 


Section 507(a)(3) requires the designation of a State office to serve as the Ombudsman for small business stationary
sources. The State has met this requirement by placing the office in the Office of the Commissioner of Environmental
Protection, fully independent of the Bureau of Air Management. This office will be funded and adequately staffed
to carry out its duties. A specific list of Ombudsman duties are listed in the SIP revision. Some of the duties the Ombudsman
office will perform includes conducting evaluations of all the programs elements, facilitating and promoting the
participation of small businesses in the development of new regulations that impact small businesses, aiding in
the dissemination of information to small businesses, participating in and sponsoring meetings and conferences
for small businesses, arranging for and assisting in the preparation of guideline documents by the SBAP and interfacing
with regional and state offices of the Small Business Administration, the Department of Commerce, and/or state and
Federal agencies. The Ombudsman will also be a member of the Compliance Advisory Panel. The Ombudsman will serve as
the Secretariat for the development and dissemination of panel reports and advisory opinions.



3. Compliance Advisory Panel 


Section 507(e) requires the State to establish a Compliance Advisory Panel that must include two members selected
by the Governor who are not owners or representatives of owners of small businesses; four members selected by the State
legislature who are owners, or represent owners, of small businesses; and one member selected by the head of the agency
in charge of the Air Pollution Permit Program. The State has met this requirement by including the ombudsman as a panel
member and therefore, establishing an eight member CAP. The CAA requires a minimum of 7 individuals on the Panel. Selection
of the panel members is consistent with the CAA requirements and the addition of the ombudsman does not change the overall
makeup of the panel.



In addition to establishing the membership of the CAP, the State PROGRAM delineates four responsibilities of the
Panel: (1) To render advisory opinions concerning the effectiveness of the SBAP and the difficulties encountered;
(2) to periodically report to EPA concerning the SBAP's adherence to the principles of the Paperwork Reduction Act,
the Equal Access to Justice Act, and the Regulatory Flexibility Act

2

; (3) to review and assure that information for small business stationary sources is easily understandable to the
layperson; and (4) the Ombudsman may serve as the Secretariat for the development and dissemination of panel reports
and advisory opinions.





4. Eligibility



Section 507(c)(1) of the CAA defines the term ``small business stationary source'' as a stationary source that:



(A) Is owned or operated by a person who employs 100 or fewer individuals; 
(B) Is a small business concern as defined in the Small Business Act; 
(C) Is not a major stationary source; 
(D) Does not emit 50 tons per year (tpy) or more of any regulated pollutant; and 
(E) Emits less than 75 tpy of all regulated pollutants. 
 The SIP revision's eligibility requirements for the PROGRAM is consistent with the CAA.

The State has also provided for the exclusion from the small business stationary source definition, after consultation
with EPA and the SBA and upon notice and opportunity for public hearing, those categories of small businesses that
the State has determined to have sufficient technical and financial capabilities to comply with the requirements
of the CAA. While the State was not clear in the January 12, 1993 SIP revision that the SBA would be consulted, the State
submitted a letter to Region I on April 6, 1994 clarifying that EPA and the SBA would be consulted if the State excluded
source categories from the small business stationary source definition. 



III. Final Rulemaking Action



The State of Connecticut has submitted a SIP revision implementing each of the required PROGRAM elements required
by section 507 of the CAA. The State expects all the elements of the PROGRAM to be fully operational by November 15, 1994.
EPA is therefore approving the SIP revision submitted by the State of Connecticut.



Final Action


EPA is approving the SIP revision implementing each of the required PROGRAM elements required by section 507 of the
CAA. The State expects to appoint all the members of the CAP by July 1994 and have a fully operational small business
assistance program by November 15, 1994.

 Because EPA considers this final rule noncontroversial and routine, we are approving it today without prior proposal.
This action will become effective on July 18, 1994 unless by June 20, 1994, notice is received that adverse comments
will be submitted.

If such notice is received, this action will be withdrawn before the effective date by publishing a subsequent document.
That document will simultaneously withdraw the final action and begin a new rulemaking by announcing a proposal of
the action and establishing a comment period. If no such comments are received, the public is advised that this action
will be effective July 18, 1994.

Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for revision to any SIP. Each request for revision to the SIP shall be considered separately in light of specific technical,
economic, and environmental factors, and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements.

Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 

et seq.

, EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities.
5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial
number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government
entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000.

By this rule, EPA is approving a State program created for the purpose of assisting small businesses in complying with
existing statutory and regulatory requirements. The program being approved today does not impose any new regulatory
burden on small businesses; it is a program under which small businesses may elect to take advantage of assistance
provided by the State. Therefore, because EPA's approval of this program does not impose any new regulatory requirements
on small businesses, I certify that it does not have a significant economic impact on any small entities affected.

This action has been classified as a Table 2 action by the Acting Regional Administrator under the procedures published
in the 

Federal Register

 on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214-2225) as revised by an October 4, 1993, memorandum from Michael H. Shapiro, Acting
Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. On January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived
Table 2 and 3 SIP revision (54 FR 222) from the requirements of section 3 of Executive Order 12991 for a period of 2 years.
The EPA has submitted a request for a permanent waiver for Table 2 and 3 SIP revisions. The OMB has agreed to continue
the waiver until such time as it rules on EPA's request. This request is still applicable under Executive Order 12866
which superseded Executive Order 12291 on September 30, 1993.
 
 Under section 307(b)(1) of the CAA, petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed in the United States
Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by July 18, 1994. Filing a petition for reconsideration by the Administrator
for this final rule does not affect the finality of this rule for the purposes of judicial review, nor does it extend
the time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed, and shall not postpone the effectiveness of such
rule or action. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements. (See section 307(b)(2)
of the CAA.)

Clean Air Act Approval and Promulgation of PM-10 Implementation Plan for Colorado; Designation of Areas for
Air Quality Planning Purposes



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 In this action, the EPA is approving the State implementation plan (SIP) submitted by the State of Colorado for the
purposes of bringing about the attainment of the national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) for particulate
matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than or equal to a nominal 10 micrometers (PM-10). The SIP was submitted
by the State on February 24, 1993 and December 9, 1993 to satisfy certain Federal requirements for an approvable nonattainment
area PM-10 plan for Pagosa Springs, Colorado. EPA is also approving the PM-10 contingency measures for
the Pagosa Springs nonattainment area, which were included in the State's December 9, 1993 submittal.



In addition, EPA is amending the nonattainment area boundary for the Pagosa Springs nonattainment area to include
some of the surrounding suburban area of Pagosa Springs. The revised boundary is based on information submitted with
the SIP which provided a SIP equivalent demonstration showing that the revised boundary more accurately represents
the Pagosa Springs airshed.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Pagosa Springs, Colorado was designated nonattainment for PM-10 and classified as moderate under sections
107(d)(4)(B) and 188(a) of the Clean Air Act (Act) upon enactment of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990.

1

 (See 56 FR 56694, November 6, 1991; 40 CFR 81.306 (specifying nonattainment designation for Pagosa Springs.)) The
air quality planning requirements for moderate PM-10 nonattainment areas are set out in subparts 1 and 4 of part
D of title I of the Act. The EPA has issued a ``General Preamble'' describing EPA's preliminary views on how EPA intends
to review SIPs and SIP revisions submitted under title I of the Act, including those State submittals containing moderate
PM-10 nonattainment area SIP requirements (see generally 57 FR 13498 (April 16, 1992) and 57 FR 18070 (April
28, 1992)). Because EPA is describing its interpretations here only in broad terms, the reader should refer to the
General Preamble for a more detailed discussion of the interpretations of title I advanced in this final action and
the supporting rationale.





Those states containing initial moderate PM-10 nonattainment areas (i.e., those areas designated nonattainment
for PM-10 under section 107(d)(4)(B) of the Act) were required to submit, among other things, the following
provisions by November 15, 1991:

1. Provisions to assure that reasonably available control measures (RACM) (including such reductions in emissions
from existing sources in the area as may be obtained through the adoption, at a minimum, of reasonably available control
technology_RACT) shall be implemented no later than December 10, 1993;

2. Either a demonstration (including air quality modeling) that the plan will provide for attainment as expeditiously
as practicable but no later than December 31, 1994 or a demonstration that attainment by that date is impracticable;

3. Quantitative milestones which are to be achieved every 3 years and which demonstrate reasonable further progress
(RFP) toward attainment by December 31, 1994; and

4. Provisions to assure that the control requirements applicable to major stationary sources of PM-10 also
apply to major stationary sources of PM-10 precursors except where the Administrator determines that such
sources do not contribute significantly to PM-10 levels which exceed the NAAQS in the area. See sections 172(c),
188, and 189 of the Act.

Some provisions were due at a later date. States with initial moderate PM-10 nonattainment areas were required
to submit a permit program for the construction and operation of new and modified major stationary sources of PM-10
by June 30, 1992 (see section 189(a)). Revisions to satisfy these requirements were submitted by the State on January
14, 1993, and EPA will be taking action on these requirements in a separate 

Federal Register

 notice. Such States were also required to submit contingency measures by November 15, 1993 which become effective
without further action by the State or EPA, upon a determination by EPA that the area has failed to achieve RFP or to attain
the PM-10 NAAQS by the applicable statutory deadline. (See section 172(c)(9) of the Act and 57 FR 13543-13544.)
The State adopted PM-10 contingency measures for the Pagosa Springs PM-10 nonattainment area in November
of 1993, and those measures were included in the State's December 9, 1993 SIP submittal.

On March 9, 1994, EPA announced its proposed approval of the Pagosa Springs, Colorado moderate PM-10 nonattainment
area SIP as meeting those moderate PM-10 nonattainment area requirements due on November 15, 1991 (see 59 FR
11012-11018). EPA also announced in that 

Federal Register

 notice its proposed approval of the PM-10 contingency measures for Pagosa Springs as meeting the requirements
of section 172(c)(9) of the Act due on November 15, 1993. In that proposed rulemaking action and related Technical
Support Document (TSD), EPA described in detail its interpretations of title I and its rationale for proposing to
approve the Pagosa Springs moderate nonattainment area PM-10 SIP and PM-10 contingency measures, taking
into consideration the specific factual issues presented. EPA requested public comments on all aspects of the proposed
rulemaking pertaining to Pagosa Springs (see 59 FR 11017). No comments were received on the proposed rulemaking.




This Action



Section 110(k) of the Act sets out provisions governing EPA's review of SIP submittals (see 57 FR 13565-13566).
On February 24, 1993 and on December 9, 1993, the Governor of Colorado submitted revisions to the SIP which were intended
to satisfy those moderate PM-10 nonattainment area SIP requirements due for Pagosa Springs on November 15,
1991 and the PM-10 contingency measure requirements of section 172(c)(9) of the Act due on November 15, 1993.
As described in EPA's proposed approval of these SIP submittals, the Pagosa Springs moderate PM-10 nonattainment
area plan includes, among other things: (1) A comprehensive and accurate emissions inventory; (2) control measures
that satisfy the RACM requirement; (3) a demonstration (including air quality modeling) that attainment of the PM-10
NAAQS will be achieved in Pagosa Springs by December 31, 1994 and maintained through December 31, 1997; (4) provisions
for meeting the November 15, 1994 quantitative milestone and RFP requirements; (5) enforceability documentation;
and (6) control measures that satisfy the contingency measures requirement of section 172(c)(9) of the Act. Further,
EPA proposed to determine that major sources of precursors of PM-10 do not contribute significantly to PM-10
levels in excess of the NAAQS in Pagosa Springs. Lastly, EPA proposed to amend the Pagosa Springs moderate PM-10
nonattainment area boundary to include some of the surrounding suburban area of Pagosa Springs based on a SIP equivalent
demonstration submitted by the State which showed that the revised boundary more accurately represents the Pagosa
Springs airshed. Please refer to EPA's notice of proposed rulemaking (59 FR 11012) and the TSD for that action for a
more detailed discussion of these elements of the Pagosa Springs plan. 

In this final rulemaking, EPA announces its approval of those elements of the Pagosa Springs, Colorado moderate nonattainment
area PM-10 SIP that were due on November 15, 1991 and submitted on February 24, 1993 and December 9, 1993, as well
as the PM-10 contingency measures that were due on November 15, 1993 and submitted on December 9, 1993. In this
final action, EPA is also announcing its approval of section I. of the Colorado Regulation entitled ``Nonattainment
Areas,'' which contains the PM-10 control measures and contingency measures for the Pagosa Springs moderate
PM-10 nonattainment area. 

EPA finds that the State of Colorado's PM-10 SIP for the Pagosa Springs moderate PM-10 nonattainment area
meets the Reasonably Available Control Measures (RACM), including Reasonably Available Control Technology (RACT),
requirement. One source category was identified as the major contributor to the PM-10 nonattainment problem
in Pagosa Springs and, therefore, was targeted for control in the SIP. The State has demonstrated that, by applying
control measures to the area source of re-entrained road dust from paved roads, Pagosa Springs will be in attainment
by December 31, 1994. It does not appear that applying further control measures to these or other sources would expedite
attainment. EPA views the following measures as reasonable, enforceable, and responsible for significant PM-10
emissions reductions in Pagosa Springs: (1) Section I.C. of the State regulation entitled ``Nonattainment Areas,''
which limits the percent fines to 1 percent in any street sanding material used on the major State highways in the Pagosa
Springs moderate PM-10 nonattainment area; and (2) Section I.D. of the State regulation entitled ``Nonattainment
Areas,'' which requires a reduction in the amount of street sanding material applied on the major State highways in
the nonattainment area by 10 percent beginning 12/93 and by an additional 5 percent (or a total of 15 percent) beginning
12/95. Further, although no credit was claimed in the SIP, EPA is approving the following measure to make it Federally
enforceable and to further strengthen the SIP: Section I.B. of the State regulation entitled ``Nonattainment Areas,''
which requires 6 miles of unpaved gravel roads in the Town of Pagosa Springs to be paved. EPA is also approving Section
I.A. of the ``Nonattainment Area'' regulation, which includes a definition of terms used in the other sections of
the regulation.

A more detailed discussion of the individual source contributions, their associated control measures (including
available control technology) and an explanation of why certain available control measures were not implemented,
can be found in the TSD accompanying EPA's proposed approval of the Pagosa Springs moderate PM-10 nonattainment
area SIP (59 FR 11013-11015). EPA has reviewed the State's documentation and concluded that it adequately justifies
the control measures to be implemented. The implementation of Colorado's PM-10 nonattainment plan for Pagosa
Springs will result in the attainment of the PM-10 NAAQS by December 31, 1994 and maintenance through December
31, 1997. By this action, EPA is approving the Pagosa Springs PM-10 moderate nonattainment area plan's control
measures as satisfying the RACM, including RACT, requirement. 

EPA also finds that the State of Colorado's December 9, 1993 submittal of PM-10 contingency measures for the
Pagosa Springs moderate PM-10 nonattainment area meets the requirements of section 172(c)(9) of the Act. Specifically,
Section I.E. of the State regulation entitled ``Nonattainment Areas'' provides that, within two months following
EPA's determination that the Pagosa Springs area failed to attain the PM-10 NAAQS or make RFP, the Town of Pagosa
Springs must sweep all traffic lanes of the major State highway through town as soon as practical following each sanding
event using vacuum sweepers that are at least 34 percent effective. EPA has reviewed the State's documentation and
regulation and concluded that it adequately meets the requirements of section 172(c)(9) of the Act. By this action,
EPA is approving the PM-10 contingency measures for the Pagosa Springs PM-10 moderate nonattainment
area. 

In this document, EPA is also announcing its determination that major stationary sources of precursors of PM-10
do not contribute significantly to PM-10 levels in excess of the NAAQS in Pagosa Springs.

Lastly, EPA announces that the Pagosa Springs moderate PM-10 nonattainment area description specified in
40 CFR 81.306 is replaced with following boundary description:




Township 35N & Range 2W: 

Sections 13, 14, 15; section 23 NE, N 1/2 SE; section 24 all except SWSW; section 25 N 1/2 NE, NENW. 



Township 35N & Range 1W: 

Section 18 W 1/2.

 


Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for a revision to any SIP. Each request for a revision to the SIP shall be considered separately in light of specific
technical, economic, and environmental factors, and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements.




Final Action



This document makes final the action proposed on March 9, 1993 (59 FR 11012). As noted elsewhere in this final action,
EPA received no public comments on the proposed action. As a direct result, the Regional Administrator has reclassified
this action from Table 2 to Table 3 under the processing procedures established at 54 FR 2214, January 19, 1989. 

Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735 (October 4, 1993), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action
is ``significant'' and therefore subject to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) review and the requirements
of the Executive Order. The Order defines ``significant regulatory action'' as one that is likely to result in a rule
that may: 

(1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector
of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal
governments or communities; 

(2) Create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; 

(3) Materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations
of recipients thereof; or 

(4) Raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles
set forth in the Executive Order. 
It has been determined that this rule is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under the terms of Executive Order
12866 and is therefore not subject to OMB review. 

Under section 307(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act, petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed in the United
States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by July 19, 1994. Filing a petition for reconsideration by the
Administrator of this final rule does not affect the finality of this rule for the purposes of judicial review nor does
it extend the time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed, and shall not postpone the effectiveness
of such rule or action. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements. (See section
307(b)(2).)

Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands; Petition for Exemption from the Diesel Fuel Sulfur Requirement



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).




</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of direct final decision.





</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 On August 31, 1993, the Governor of the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI) submitted a petition requesting
that the Northern Mariana Islands, a commonwealth of the United States, be considered for an exemption from the sulfur
content requirement for motor vehicle diesel fuel, as specified in section 211(i) of the Clean Air Act, as amended
(Act). This action is a direct final decision that grants an exemption to CNMI from the diesel fuel sulfur content requirement
of section 211(i) and related provisions in section 211(g). The exemption is based on EPA's finding that it is unreasonable
to require persons in CNMI to comply with the sulfur content requirement due to the islands' unique geographical,
meteorological and economic factors, as well as other significant local factors. CNMI did not request an exemption
from the minimum cetane index of 40.


This action is being taken without prior proposal because EPA believes that this final decision is noncontroversial
and because the effect of this rulemaking is limited to CNMI. 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 


I. Introduction


This document describes EPA's action to approve as a direct final decision CNMI's request for exemption from the diesel
sulfur content requirement of section 211 of the Act and those related sections of EPA's motor vehicle diesel fuel
regulations (40 CFR part 80). The remainder of this document is divided into eight parts. Section II provides the background
for this action. Section III summarizes the contents of the petition by the Governor of CNMI. Section IV discusses
other relevant issues regarding this decision. Section V presents EPA's proposed final action and underlying rationale.
Finally, sections VI through IX address EPA's statutory authority, regulatory designation and the economic impacts
of this decision. 




II. Background


Section 211(i)(1) of the Act makes it unlawful, effective October 1, 1993, for any person to manufacture, sell, supply,
offer for sale or supply, dispense, transport, or introduce into commerce motor vehicle diesel fuel which contains
a concentration of sulfur in excess of 0.05 percent (by weight), or which fails to meet a cetane index minimum of 40 (or,
alternatively, contains more than 35 percent aromatics). Section 211(g)(2) makes it unlawful, effective October
1, 1993, for any person to introduce or cause or allow the introduction into any motor vehicle of diesel fuel which such
person knows or should know contains a concentration of sulfur in excess of the standard or fails to meet the cetane
index minimum. Although CNMI's petition did not specifically request an exemption from section 211(g)(2) it is reasonable
to read the petition as including such a request. Section 211(i)(3) establishes the sulfur content for fuel used in
the certification of heavy-duty diesel vehicles and engines. Section 211(i)(4) requires the Administrator to take
final action on any petition filed under section 325

1

, which seeks exemption from the requirements of section 211(i), within 12 months of the date of such petition.





Section 325 of the Act provides that upon application by the Governor of Guam, American Samoa, the Virgin Islands,
or the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, the Administrator may exempt any person or source in such territory
from various requirements of the Act, including sections 211(i) and (g). An exemption may be granted if the Administrator
finds that compliance with such requirements is not feasible or is unreasonable due to unique geographical, meteorological,
or economic factors of such territory, or other local factors as the Administrator deems significant.



III. Petition for Exemption


On August 31, 1993, the Honorable Lorenzo I. DeLeon Guerrero, Governor of the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana
Islands (CNMI), submitted a petition to exempt motor vehicle diesel fuel in CNMI from the sulfur content requirement
of section 211(i)(1) of the Act, and the EPA regulations promulgated at 40 CFR part 80. The petition is based on geographical,
meteorological, air quality, and economic factors unique to CNMI.
The exemptions granted today will apply to all persons in CNMI subject to the prohibitions of section 211(i)(1) and
related provisions of section 211(g)(2) of the Act and the diesel fuel requirements in 40 CFR part 80. The exemptions
will apply to all persons who manufacture, sell, supply, offer for sale or supply, dispense, transport, or introduce
into commerce motor vehicle diesel fuel, or who introduce diesel fuel into motor vehicles, in CNMI. CNMI is not requesting
an exemption from the minimum cetane requirement for motor vehicle diesel fuel as set forth in sections 211(i)(1)
and 211(g)(2). 
The following discussion summarizes the contents of the petition.



A. Geography and Location of the Northern Mariana Islands


The Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands consists of 14 islands of volcanic origin that extend in a general
north-south direction for 388 nautical miles, with a dry land area of 176.5 square miles. CNMI lies in the western part
of the Pacific Ocean and is located 1150 miles south of Tokyo; 1440 miles east of Manila; 108 miles north of Guam; and
5280 miles from the U.S. mainland. 
The population centers of CNMI exist on Saipan (38,896 pop.), Tinian (2,118 pop.), and Rota (2,295 pop.). The Northern
Islands of the Commonwealth have populations estimated at 36 people. 
CNMI has approximately 200 miles of roads, of which approximately 50 percent are paved. It is estimated that CNMI has
less than 500 diesel vehicles, of which approximately 60 are the property of the CNMI government.



B. Climate, Meteorology and Air Quality


CNMI has a tropical climate with consistently warm and humid weather. Prevailing trade winds are westward. Development
and the population of Saipan, the most populated island, are predominately on the western side. This meteorology
combined with the geographic development of the islands and the lack of heavy industry, have a beneficial impact on
CNMI's air quality. 
At the present time, CNMI is in attainment with all primary national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS). Given
the small number of diesel fueled vehicles on CNMI and the westward nature of the trade winds, granting an exemption
from the low-sulfur diesel standard is not expected to have any significant impact on the ambient air quality of CNMI.



C. Economic Factors


CNMI must rely totally on the costly importation of fuels exclusively from refineries in Singapore. Oil companies
in Singapore are presently not capable of refining diesel fuel that meets the 0.05% sulfur requirement. Consequently,
in order to comply with the diesel regulations, low-sulfur fuel would have to be imported from the U.S. mainland at
an estimated cost increase of 10 to 20 cents per gallon.

2

 Because of the added costs of shipping materials to CNMI for construction projects, construction costs on CNMI are
generally 20 to 40 percent higher than the U.S. mainland. Consequently, a fuel supplier on CNMI estimated that in order
to comply with the low-sulfur diesel fuel standard, four new storage tanks would need to be built for the three islands,
resulting in $2,000,000 in tank construction costs. 





Currently, the cost of diesel fuel on Saipan is approximately 20 cents per gallon higher than the U.S. mainland, and
even higher on the islands of Rota and Tinian. The increased costs of using low-sulfur fuel would be passed on to diesel
fuel consumers on CNMI, which has an average annual per capita income of under $7,200. 
Unlike the U.S. mainland, CNMI relies on diesel fuel exclusively to provide electrical power. Saipan has two bulk
storage facilities for diesel fuel, and Rota and Tinian each have one. The main use of this diesel fuel is for electrical
power generation with an insignificant amount used for motor vehicles.



D. Environmental Factors


Any sulfur dioxide emitted from the diesel-powered vehicles on CNMI is dispersed by the islands' trade winds and presents
no health risk, nor would it cause any air quality standards to be exceeded. 
 


IV. Other Issues


EPA addressed several other issues in the American Samoa and Guam decisions

3

 and is addressing them here in a manner consistent with these earlier decisions.





Issue: Sale of Certified Engines


EPA believes that the prohibition against the sale of uncertified engines in the Northern Mariana Islands (as in American
Samoa and Guam) should continue to apply. Beginning with model year 1994, some heavy-duty diesel engines may be equipped
with devices which will be adversely impacted by the level of sulfur in diesel fuel allowed by the exemption being granted
today, but it is possible that some emissions benefits can still be accrued. If the use of high-sulfur diesel fuel causes
vehicles equipped with aftertreatment devices to emit certain pollutants at higher levels than would be emitted
from such engines without the aftertreatment devices, the Agency may consider, among other things, allowing the
sale of certified engines without the affected devices. As expressed in the American Samoa and Guam exemptions, the
Agency believes such decisions should be made on a case-by-case basis upon receipt of evidence to support those decisions.



Issue: Exemption from Tampering


EPA believes that a blanket waiver from the tampering prohibition for model year 1994 and later heavy-duty engines
would allow tampering in situations where such tampering may result in an increase in emissions. For example, removal
of an emissions related device that is not affected by the high-sulfur fuel or is rendered less effective but not inoperative
by the high-sulfur fuel would increase emissions over what would have occurred in the absence of tampering.
Nevertheless, some model year 1994 and later heavy-duty engines may be equipped with aftertreatment devices that
may be rendered inoperative by the use of diesel fuel with a sulfur content exceeding 0.05% (by weight). The exercise
of enforcement discretion may be appropriate to allow the removal of such aftertreatment devices. However, EPA shall
not allow tampering with an emissions control device that has been or is likely to be rendered less effective, but not
rendered inoperative, as a result of the use of higher sulfur fuel unless there is evidence that it may actually cause
an increase in certain pollutants as discussed above.



Issue: Warranty Exemption


The Agency acknowledges that vehicles which were certified with low sulfur diesel fuel may be unable to meet Federal
emissions standards if they are fueled on high-sulfur diesel fuel. However, EPA believes an exemption from the general
warranty provisions of section 207 is not necessary to protect manufacturers from unreasonable warranty recoveries
by purchasers. The emission defect warranty requirements under section 207(a) of the Act require an engine manufacturer
to warrant that the engine shall conform at the time of sale to applicable emission regulations and that the engine
is free from defects which cause the engine to fail to conform with applicable regulations for its useful life. In practice,
this warranty is applicable to a specific list of emissions and emissions related engine components. 
It has been consistent EPA policy that misuse and/or improper maintenance of a vehicle or engine by the purchaser,
including misfueling, may create a reasonable basis for denying warranty coverage for the specific emissions and
emissions related engine components affected by this misuse. In this case, while use of fuel exempted from the sulfur
content limitation cannot be considered ``misfueling,'' it will have the same adverse effect on emissions control
components. Thus, EPA believes that where the use of high-sulfur diesel fuel will have an adverse impact on the emissions
durability of specific engine parts or systems, such as a trap oxidizer or other aftertreatment devices, the manufacturer
will have a reasonable basis for denying warranty coverage on that part or other related parts. However, as has consistently
been EPA's policy, those components not adversely affected by the use of high-sulfur diesel should continue to receive
full emissions warranty coverage. In any event, the number of engines likely to be covered on CNMI, and the potential
for excessive costs or disputes, are extremely small. EPA will expeditiously consider manufacturers' suggestions
for remedies to these situations on a case-by-case basis as they occur.



Issue: Recall Liability


Heavy-duty engine manufacturers are responsible for recalling and repairing engines that do not comply with emission
requirements for their useful lives. The EPA tests engine classes to determine whether engines comply with applicable
emission standards when properly used and maintained. Under section 207(c), if a substantial number of engines in
a specific engine class do not comply when tested, that entire class can be recalled. If a situation arose in which an
engine fueled with exempted diesel fuel were included in an EPA in-use compliance test program, EPA would determine,
on a case-by-case basis, if the noncompliance were the result of the use of exempted diesel fuel. If it were determined
that the exempted diesel fuel was the cause of the engine's failure to meet the applicable emission standards, that
fact would be considered before seeking a recall of the class. Given the fact that only high-sulfur diesel fuel (over
0.05% by weight) will be used in vehicles on CNMI, just as in American Samoa and Guam, the Agency does not intend to use
test results (emissions levels) from those vehicles to show noncompliance by those engines for the purpose of recalling
an engine class. In cases in which it was determined that the overall class was subject to recall, however, individual
engines would not be excluded from repair on the basis of the fuel used. Manufacturers are responsible for repairing
any engine in the recalled class regardless of its history of tampering or malmaintenance. The situation that would
occur on CNMI is no different and, thus, the manufacturers should remain liable for performing recall repairs on these
engines when required.



V. Final Action


Because of its remote location and lack of internal petroleum supplies, CNMI must rely totally on the importation
of diesel fuel and other petroleum products. The Asian refineries currently supplying CNMI's diesel fuel needs do
not have the capability to produce diesel fuel that meets the sulfur requirement of section 211(i) of the Act. Given
that CNMI has such a small market for motor vehicle diesel fuel, those refineries are not likely to invest in the substantial
modifications necessary to produce low- sulfur diesel fuel. Consequently, CNMI would have to import low-sulfur
fuel from the U.S. mainland at an increased cost of 10-20 cents per gallon, not including the additional estimated
capital expenditure of $2,000,000 to construct separate storage facilities. Since the vast majority of diesel fuel
used on CNMI is for power generation, it would be economically unreasonable for CNMI to use low-sulfur diesel for all
of its diesel fuel needs. 
By requiring CNMI to comply with the sulfur requirement of section 211(i), a major economic burden would be placed
on the citizens of CNMI with little or no environmental benefit. Despite the possibility that the use of high- sulfur
diesel fuel may cause increased particulate sulfate emissions in diesel vehicles equipped with trap systems or oxidation
catalysts, any increase in sulfate particulates emitted by such vehicles would be dispersed by the islands' trade
winds and would present a minimal threat to public health or the environment. Because of the small number of diesel
vehicles on CNMI, granting this exemption will not likely lead to future problems in maintaining compliance with
any National Ambient Air Quality Standards.
The Environmental Protection Agency has decided to exempt the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands from
compliance with the sulfur content requirements for diesel fuel under sections 211(i)(1) and (g)(2) of the Act, and
EPA's motor vehicle diesel fuel regulations at 40 CFR part 80. The Agency believes that compliance with the sulfur
requirement is unreasonable given the substantial increased costs to persons on CNMI and the minimal benefits to
the islands' air quality. These cost increases are the direct result of geographical, meteorological and economic
factors unique to CNMI.
Although CNMI did not explicitly request an exemption from section 211(g)(2), it is reasonable to read the petition
as including such a request. Sections 211(g) and 211(i) both restrict the use of high sulfur motor vehicle diesel fuel,
and exempting CNMI from section 211(i)'s sulfur requirement but not from section 211(g)'s related prohibition would
provide no relief from the problems CNMI presented in their petition. However, this action does not exempt CNMI from
the minimum cetane index requirement or the alternative aromatic level requirement in these sections of the Act or
EPA regulations.

4

 Thus, diesel fuel on CNMI that does not contain visible evidence of the dye 1,4 dialkylamino-anthraquinone shall
be presumed to be in compliance with the cetane or alternative aromatic standard for motor vehicle diesel fuel. 




This action is being taken without prior proposal because EPA believes that the decision to exempt CNMI from the diesel
fuel sulfur requirements is noncontroversial and anticipates no significant adverse comments on this action. In
petitions involving very similar factors, EPA exempted American Samoa and Guam from these same diesel fuel requirements.
Consistent with this decision, EPA has decided to approve the exemptions requested by the Governor of the Commonwealth
of the Northern Mariana Islands as a direct final decision.
The public should be advised that this action will be effective July 18, 1994, unless EPA receives notice by June 20,
1994 that someone wishes to submit adverse or critical comments. If such notice is received, this action will be withdrawn.
If it is withdrawn, EPA will publish a document announcing its withdrawal before the effective date provided in today's
document. A second document will then request comments on a proposed decision regarding CNMI's petition.
This procedure allows the opportunity for public comment and for oral presentation of data as required under section
307(d) of the Act. This procedure also provides an expedited procedure for final action where a decision is not expected
to be controversial and no adverse comment is expected. Since the October 1, 1993 effective date for the low-sulfur
fuel requirements has passed, EPA will regard CNMI as a low priority for enforcement of the diesel sulfur requirement,
pending the final decision on CNMI's petition.



VI. Statutory Authority


Authority for the action described in this document is in section 325(a)(1) (42 U.S.C. 7625-1(a)(1)) of the
Clean Air Act, as amended.



VII. Administrative Designation and Regulatory Analysis



Executive Order 12866



Under Executive Order 12866, (58 FR 51,735 (October 4, 1993)) the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action
is ``significant'' and therefore subject to OMB review and the requirements of the Executive Order. The Order defines
``significant regulatory action'' as one that is likely to result in a rule that may:




(1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector
of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal
governments or communities; 
(2) Create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency;

(3) Materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements,grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations
of recipients thereof; or

(4) Raise novel or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set
forth in the Executive Order.
 
The decision announced today alleviates any potential adverse economic impacts on CNMI and is not a significant regulatory
action as defined in E.O. 12866. OMB has exempted this regulatory action from E.O. 12866 review.
 


VIII. Impact on Small Entities


Pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601 through 612, whenever an agency is required to publish a general
notice of rulemaking for any proposed or final rule, it is required to certify that a regulation will not have a
significant adverse economic impact on a substantial number
of small business entities. Today's final decision will not have 
an adverse economic impact on small business entities, as the action eases requirements otherwise applicable to
affected entities. Pursuant to section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Administrator
certifies that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.



IX. Paperwork Reduction Act


The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, 44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq.

, and implementing regulations, 5 CFR part 1320, do not apply to this action as it does not involve the collection of
information as defined therein.

on behalf of the Director.

to the manager or official who has immediate responsibility for the action. Authority delegated by this chapter,
unless otherwise specifically provided, may be redelegated in whole or in part provided any such redelegation is
in writing and approved by the officer to whom the authority is initially delegated. This restriction does not apply
to a temporary redelegation of authority to a principal deputy or first assistant to be exercised during the absence
of the delegating official. 

(b) The authority to issue regulations having general applicability and future effect designed to implement, interpret
or prescribe law or policy, and which are to be published in the 

Federal Register

, may be delegated or redelegated only to positions for which it is required that the incumbent be confirmed by the United
States Senate. This does not prohibit an acting official from issuing regulations. This paragraph does not apply

Aid to Families With Dependent Children Program; Certain Provisions of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of
1990




<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Administration for Children and Families (ACF), HHS.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rules.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

These final rules apply to State agencies administering the Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) program
under Title IV-A of the Social Security Act. They implement three provisions of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation
Act of 1990 (OBRA 90), Public Law 101-508. The changes delete all references to income-deeming by legal guardians
in minor parent cases; expand State agency responsibility for reporting, to an appropriate agency or official, known
or suspected instances of child abuse and neglect of a child receiving AFDC; and add an explicit reference to title
IV-E on the list of programs for which information about AFDC applicants and recipients may be made available.
In addition, the reference to tile IV-C from 45 CFR 205.50(a)(1)(A) was deleted since the WIN program is no longer
operative.



The regulatory provisions contained in these final rules reflect a direct implementation of the statutory requirements
and do not include any changes to the interim final rules previously published on September 22, 1993.








</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

On September 22, 1993, we published an interim final regulation (see 58 FR 49218-49220) to implement three provisions
of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990, as amended. Discussion of these provisions follow.





Eliminating the Use of the Term ``Legal Guardian'' (Section 233.20 of the Final Rule)





The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (OBRA) of 1981 added section 402(a)9(39) of the Social Security Act to acquire
that, in determining AFDC benefits for a dependent child whose parent or legal guardian is under the age of 18, the State
agency must include the income of the minor parent's own parents or legal guardians who are living in the same home.
Section 5053 of Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 (OBRA 90) amended section 402(a)(39) of the Social Security
Act by eliminating the use of the term ``legal guardian.'' Section 402(a)(39) provides that in determining AFDC benefits
for a dependent child whose parent is under the age of 18, the State agency must include the income of the minor parent's
own parents who are living in the same home. We have amended Federal regulations at  233.20(a)(3)(xviii) to
reflect this statutory change.




As stated in the OBRA 90 conference report (H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 964, 101st Cong. 2d Sess. (Oct. 1990) pp. 911-12),
Congress recognized that legal guardianship is not relevant to eligibility determination. Even if a legal guardian
were appointed, the child would not be eligible for AFDC unless living with a relative as defined in section 406 of the
Social Security Act.


Congress also recognized that the use of the term ``legal guardian'' with respect to the deeming of income is inappropriate
in the context of the AFDC statute. Unlike the parent-child relationship, legal guardianship has not been a basis
for attributing income to AFDC beneficiaries. An example given in the Conference report illustrates that there is
the potential for unequal treatment under the AFDC program when legal guardianship is used as a source of attributed
income in three-generation families. If a minor child is living with an aunt who is her legal guardian, the aunt's income
is not automatically attributed to the AFDC beneficiary; however, if the minor has a child, the guardian's income
is included in the AFDC determination for the minor and her child. (H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 964, 101st Cong. 2d Sess. (Oct.
1990) p. 912). The OBRA amendment resolved these problems.






Reporting of Child Abuse and Neglect (Sections 205.50 and 233.90 of the Final Rule)





Prior to OBRA 90, section 402(a)(16) of the Social Security Act provided that, if the State agency has reason to believe
that a child and a relative receiving aid are residing in an unsuitable home due to the neglect, abuse, or exploitation
of the child, the State must take action. The State is required to report the situation with all the relevant information
to the appropriate court or law enforcement agencies in the State. This statutory provision is currently reflected
in the Federal regulations at  233.90(a)(2).

Section 5054 of OBRA 90 amended section 402(a)(16) of the Social Security Act to require that each State agency report,
to an appropriate agency or official, known or suspected instances of child abuse and neglect of a child receiving
AFDC. A conforming change was made to section 402(a)(9) to allow the release of information to appropriate individuals.
The amendment includes as ``instances'' of abuse and neglect situations where a child experiences physical or mental
injury, sexual abuse or exploitation, or negligent treatment or maltreatment under circumstances which indicate
that the child's health or welfare is threatened. To implement these statutory changes we have amended  233.90(a)(2)
and revised  205.50(a)(1) by adding a new paragraph (G). 



Disclosure of Information About AFDC Applicants and Recipients for Purposes Directly Connected With Foster Care
and Adoption Assistance Programs (Section 205.50 of the Final Rule) 



Prior to the enactment of OBRA 90, the use or disclosure of information concerning AFDC applicants and recipients
was restricted by section 402(a)(9) of the Social Security Act. Information on AFDC recipients and applicants could
only be used for purposes directly connected with: (1) The administration of the AFDC program or several other specified
Social Security Act programs; (2) any investigation, prosecution, or criminal or civil proceeding conducted in
connection with such programs; (3) the administration of any other Federal or Federally-assisted program providing
assistance or services to individuals on the basis of need; and (4) any audit of such programs (H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 964,
101st Cong. 2d Sess. (Oct. 1990) p. 913). 

This section of the Social Security Act did not contain a specific reference to title IV-E, which covers the foster
care and adoption assistance programs. 

Section 5055 of OBRA 90 amended section 402(a)(9)(A) of the Social Security Act by adding an explicit reference to
title IV-E in the list of programs for which information about AFDC applicants and recipients may be made available.
We have amended  205.50(a)(1)(i)(A) to reflect this statutory change. In addition, the reference to title
IV-C was deleted from 45 CFR 205.50(a)(1)(A), since the WIN program is no longer operative. 



Discussion of Comments 


No comments were received; therefore, these rules reflect no changes from the provisions previously published in
the interim final rule. 



Executive Order 12866 on Regulatory Planning and Review



Executive Order 12866 requires that regulations be reviewed to ensure that they are consistent with the priorities
and principles set forth in the Executive Order. The Department has determined that these rules are consistent with
these priorities and principles. An assessment of the costs and benefits of available regulatory alternatives (including
not regulating) demonstrated that the approach taken in the regulation is the most cost-effective and least burdensome
while still achieving the regulatory objectives. 



Paperwork Reduction Act 



These final rules do not require any information collection activities and, therefore no approval is necessary under
section 3504 (h) of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511). 



Regulatory Flexibility Act 



The Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354) requires the Federal government to anticipate and reduce the
impact of regulations and paperwork requirements on small businesses. The primary impact of these final rules is
on State governments and individuals. Therefore, we certify that these rules will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities because they effect benefits to individuals and payments to States.
Thus, a regulatory flexibility analysis is not required.

<USDEPT>FEDERAL MARITIME COMMISSION</USDEPT>








Actions to Adjust or Meet Conditions 
Unfavorable to Shipping in the 
United States/Korea Trade 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Federal Maritime Commission.

 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Withdrawal of final rule; Discontinuance of proceeding. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Federal Maritime Commission is withdrawing its November 13, 1992, final rule which found that unfavorable conditions
existed in the oceanborne trade between the United States and Korea, which precluded U.S. carriers from engaging
in trucking activities in Korea. That rule imposed fees on Korean-flag vessels in the amount of $100,000 per voyage,
but suspended the sanctions until June 1, 1994. The Commission has since reviewed the progress achieved by the Government
of Korea in implementing commitments to remove the restrictions. Inasmuch as reports from affected U.S. and Korean
carriers confirm that the impediments at issue have been removed, and all the carriers recommend termination of the
proceeding, there is no reason to continue the proceeding or to assess fees.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
This proceeding under section 19(1)(b) of the Merchant Marine Act, 1920, 46 U.S.C. app. 876(1)(b) (``Section 19''),
was initiated by the Federal Maritime Commission (``Commission'') on June 7, 1991 (56 FR 26361), by Notice of Proposed
Rulemaking (``Proposed Rule''). The Proposed Rule raised issues concerning apparent Government of Korea (``ROK'')
restrictions on U.S. carriers' ability to engage in trucking operations and to contract directly for rail service
in Korea incidental to intermodal commerce in the United States/Korea trade (``Trade''). It proposed sanctions
consisting of $100,000 per voyage fees on vessels in the Trade operated by Korean-flag carriers Hanjin Shipping Co.,
Ltd. and Hyundai Merchant Marine Co., Ltd. (collectively, ``Korean Carriers''). 


On the basis of comments on the Proposed Rule and several supplemental submissions received thereafter from the Korean
Carriers and the affected U.S. carriers, Sea-Land Service, Inc. and American President Lines, Ltd. (collectively,
``U.S. Carriers''), the Commission published a final rule on November 18, 1992 (57 FR 54318). The final rule found
that unfavorable conditions existed in the Trade by virtue of ROK restrictions on U.S. carriers' trucking activities.
It imposed the sanctions cited in the Proposed Rule, but suspended them until June 1, 1994, noting commitments made
by the ROK in the course of bilateral inter-governmental discussions in the summer of 1992. The suspension, the Commission
explained, would allow time for the ROK to implement the promised changes. 
In the meantime, the Commission directed that the U.S. and Korean Carriers, including Cho Yang Shipping Co., Ltd.,
which was added to the list of Korean Carriers, submit periodic reports to the Commission regarding the ROK's implementation
of its commitments. Although the finding of unfavorable conditions was limited to the trucking issue, the Commission
directed the carriers to report as well on ROK restrictions on rail access by the U.S. Carriers. The parties were ordered
to address enumerated issues in submissions due December 15, 1992; May 1, 1993; November 1, 1993; and May 1, 1994. 
Over the course of the reporting period, the Commission was advised that the ROK made considerable changes in its regulations
and policies, with the effect of remedying the conditions in issue. Effective May 10, 1993, regulations were amended
to enable U.S. carriers to issue Bonded Rail Transportation Permits without the need for a trucking license. Vehicle
ownership requirements for obtaining Simplified Bonded Transportation Permits were substantially reduced. The
carriers also indicated that the ROK adhered to its promised regionally-keyed timetable for issuing trucking licenses.
All limitations on U.S. carrier trucking operations were reportedly removed as of April 1, 1994. All five carriers,
U.S. and Korean, advise that the conditions on which the final rule is based no longer exist, and that the Commission's
objectives in this proceeding have been met. 
The Commission is satisfied that there is no longer a basis for continuing this proceeding. The final rule is accordingly
withdrawn and the proceeding discontinued.

Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement; Indirect Costs of Institutions of Higher Education


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Department of Defense (DOD).


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Interim rule with request for comments.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Director of Defense Procurement has issued an interim rule amending the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation
Supplement to prohibit limitation on reimbursement of otherwise allowable indirect costs incurred by an institution
of higher learning under DoD contracts.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
A. Background


Section 481 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1994 (Pub. L. 103-160) prohibits DoD from
placing any limitation on the reimbursement of otherwise allowable indirect costs incurred by an institution of
higher learning. For most such educational institutions, contract cost allowability is determined under FAR 31.3
which imposes Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular No. A-21, Cost Principles for Educational Institutions.
OMB Circular A-21 imposes a 26 percent ceiling on indirect administrative costs of educational institutions.
Section 841 abrogates that limitation for DoD contracts unless the institution requests that DoD waive the prohibition
in order to simplify the institution's management of cost reimbursements for DoD contracts.


B. Regulatory Flexibility Act


The interim rule is not expected to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under
the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq.

 The revisions flow directly from section 841 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1994 (Pub.
L. 103-160), no variation from the statute is allowed, and the regulations impose no independent economic impact
on small entities. An Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis (IRFA) has not been performed, however, comments
from small entities concerning the affected DFARS subpart will be considered in accordance with section 610 of the
Act. Such comments must be submitted separately and cite 5 U.S.C. 610 (DFARS Case 93-D317) in correspondence.


C. Paperwork Reduction Act


The Paperwork Reduction Act (Pub. L. 96-511) does not apply because the revisions do not impose any new recordkeeping
requirements or information collection requirements or collection of information from offerors, contractors,
or members of the public which require the approval of OMB under 44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq.


D. Determination To Issue an Interim Rule


A determination has been made under the authority of the Secretary of Defense to issue this rule as an interim rule.
Urgent and compelling reasons exist to promulgate this rule before affording the public an opportunity to comment.
The statutory prohibition against the capping of otherwise allowable indirect costs of higher institutions under
DoD contracts was effective upon enactment of the National Defense Authorization Act for 1994 (Pub. L. 103-160)
on November 30, 1994. Therefore, it is essential that guidance be issued as expeditiously as possible.

(1) Pursuant to section 841 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1994 (Pub. L. 103-160),
no limitation may be placed on the reimbursement of otherwise allowable indirect costs incurred by an institution
of higher education under a DoD contract awarded on or after November 30, 1993, unless that same limitation is applied
uniformly to all other organizations performing similar work under DoD contracts. The 26 percent limitation imposed
on administrative indirect costs by OMB Circular No. A-21 shall not be applied to DoD contracts awarded on or
after November 30, 1993, to institutions of higher education because the same limitation is not applied to other organizations
performing similar work.
(2) The cognizant administrative contracting officer may waive the prohibition in 231.303(1) if the governing body
of the institution of higher education requests the waiver to simplify the institution's overall management of DoD
cost reimbursements under DoD contracts.

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Closure. 






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 NMFS is prohibiting directed fishing for Pacific cod by vessels using hook-and-line or pot gear in the Bering Sea and
Aleutian Islands management area (BSAI). This action is necessary to prevent exceeding the second seasonal apportionment
of the Pacific cod total allowable catch (TAC) allocated to vessels using hook-and-line or pot gear in the BSAI. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The groundfish fishery in the BSAI exclusive economic zone is managed by the Secretary of Commerce according to the
Fishery Management Plan for the Groundfish Fishery of the BSAI (FMP) prepared by the North Pacific Fishery Management
Council under authority of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act. Fishing by U.S. vessels is governed
by regulations implementing the FMP at 50 CFR parts 620 and 675. 



In accordance with  675.20(a)(7)(ii), the Pacific cod TAC for the BSAI was established by the final 1994 initial
specifications of groundfish (59 FR 7656, February 16, 1994) and increased by an apportionment from the reserve (59
FR 21673, April 26, 1994) to 191,000 metric tons (mt). The second seasonal apportionment of the amount of the 1994 Pacific
cod TAC allocated to vessels using hook-and-line or pot gear is 8,404 mt pursuant to  675.20(a)(3)(iv) and  675.20(a)(2)(v).
This action is consistent with amendment 24, which apportions Pacific cod TAC among gear types and seasons (59 FR 4009,
January 28, 1994). 

The Director, Alaska Region, NMFS (Regional Director), has determined, in accordance with  675.20(a)(8),
that the second seasonal apportionment of the Pacific cod TAC allocated to vessels using hook-and-line or pot gear
in the BSAI soon will be reached. Therefore, the Regional Director has established a directed fishing allowance of
8,000 mt, with consideration that 404 mt will be taken as incidental catch in directed fishing for other species in
the BSAI. The Regional Director has determined that the directed fishing allowance has been reached. Consequently,
NMFS is prohibiting directed fishing for Pacific cod by vessels using hook-and-line or pot gear in the BSAI, effective
from 12 noon, A.l.t., May 16, 1994, until 12 noon, A.l.t., September 1, 1994. 

Directed fishing standards for applicable gear types may be 
found in the regulations at  675.20(h).

Final rule.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is issuing a final rule to amend the Federal performance standard for diagnostic
x-ray systems and their major components (the performance standard). The amendments revise the limits established
for maximum patient entrance exposure rates for fluoroscopic x-ray systems during high-level control and other
modes of operation. The revisions are being made due to concerns regarding excessively large radiation exposure
rates on some fluoroscopic x-ray systems. In addition, an inadvertent error is being corrected to improve the accuracy
of the regulations.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
I. Background


Under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 321 

et seq

.) as amended, FDA is amending the performance standard for diagnostic x-ray systems and their major components in
 1020.32 (21 CFR 1020.32) by revising the limits established for maximum patient entrance exposure rates for
fluoroscopic x-ray systems during high-level control and other modes of operation. In the 

Federal Register

 of August 15, 1972 (37 FR 16461), the performance standard was published as a final rule which became effective on August
1, 1974. Since that time, there have been several amendments to the performance standard. These amendments take into
account new technology, clarify misinterpreted provisions, or incorporate additional requirements determined
to be necessary to provide for adequate radiation safety of diagnostic x-ray systems.
FDA determined that further changes to the standard were necessary, in view of concerns regarding the potential for
unnecessary radiation exposures to patients from some current fluoroscopic x-ray system designs. Therefore, FDA
developed proposed draft amendments to the performance standard, which were discussed during a public meeting of
the Technical Electronic Product Radiation Safety Standards Committee (TEPRSSC) on November 14, 1990. The proposed
amendments that were discussed included the following:
(1) Replacement of the current two-tier system of entrance exposure rate limits applicable during normal fluoroscopy
on systems with automatic exposure rate control (AERC) with a single upper limit of 2.58x10

-3

 coulomb per kilogram (C/kg) per minute (10 roentgens per minute (R/min)), regardless of mode of operation;
(2) Establishment of an upper limit of 5.16x10

-3

 C/kg per minute (20 R/min) on entrance exposure rate during high-level control mode of fluoroscopy;
(3) Establishment of a requirement for an AERC mode of operation for any fluoroscopic x-ray system capable of operating
at an entrance exposure rate greater than 1.29x10

-3

 C/kg per minute (5 R/min); and
(4) Application of the entrance exposure rate limits discussed in paragraphs (1) and (2) above during continuous
recording of dynamic fluoroscopic images with a videotape recorder or similar device. The application of the entrance
exposure rate limit during continuous recording requires a distinction between the continuous mode of operation
and various modes of operation in which the x-ray exposure is pulsed. Therefore, a definition of pulsed mode of operation
is being added. This is necessary because a consensus as to appropriate limits for the various pulsed recording modes
does not exist and further study is needed before such a limit is imposed.
TEPRSSC approved the content of the proposed amendments and concurred with publication of them for public comment.
FDA proposed the amendments to the performance standard in the 

Federal Register

 of May 3, 1993 (58 FR 26407). Interested persons were given until August 2, 1993, to comment on the proposal. FDA received
and considered one comment each from a radiological physicist and a professional organization representing radiologists
and physicists. Both comments supported the proposed changes and suggested several additional amendments to the
standard. These comments also addressed fluoroscopy-related issues on which FDA specifically solicited comments
in the preamble to the proposed rule. FDA appreciates having received these comments and will consider them in the
context of possible future rulemaking activities related to fluoroscopic x-ray systems. A summary of the comments
pertaining to the proposal of May 3, 1993, and FDA's responses are discussed below.
 In addition, in the final rule that published in the 

Federal Register

 of May 3, 1993 (58 FR 26386 at 26398), in  1020.30(b) (21 CFR 1020.30(b), the acronym ``SID'' for source-image
receptor distance was inadvertently omitted. This document is also correcting that error.


II. Summary and Analysis of Comments


1. Both of the comments received concurred with all of the proposed amendments to the performance standard, except
that one of the comments suggested changing the proposed upper limit on entrance exposure rate during the high-level
control mode of operation. That comment advocated a limit of 3.87x10

-3

 C/kg per minute (15 R/min), rather than the proposed limit of 5.16x10

-3

 C/kg per minute (20 R/min), but noted a lack of objective data to support the recommendation. The other comment concurred
with the proposed limit of 5.16x10

-3

 C/kg per minute (20 R/min) and noted that a number of manufacturers provide equipment which does not exceed 2.58x10

-3

 C/kg per minute (10 R/min) during fluoroscopy.
The comment advocating a lower limit did not submit specific data supporting that position. The second comment on
the appropriate upper limit to be imposed on entrance exposure rate during high-level control mode of operation noted
that a lower limit was consistent with certain existing equipment, but nonetheless supported the limit proposed
by FDA. After reviewing these comments, FDA concludes that its choice of an upper limit is a reasonable one. The objective
in establishing such a limit is to provide a mode of operation that will reasonably accommodate unusual imaging requirements,
but also will prevent unnecessarily high exposure rates. The limit proposed was based on the observation that the
majority of fluoroscopic x-ray systems equipped with high-level control, which were evaluated in conjunction with
FDA testing for compliance with the performance standard, are limited to maximum entrance exposure rates of less
than 5.16x10

-3

 C/kg per minute (20 R/min). The proposed limit was also based on discussions with medical physicists regarding their
experience in limiting entrance exposure rates, which indicated that a limit of 5.16x10

-3

 C/kg per minute (20 R/min) eliminates unnecessarily high exposure rates without compromising the use of the equipment.
FDA interprets the lack of significant adverse comment on this proposal as an indication of general agreement with
the proposed limit. Therefore, FDA rejects the suggestion that a limit of 3.87x10

-3

 C/kg per minute (15 R/min) be established for the maximum entrance exposure rate, and is establishing the upper limit
of 5.16x10

-3

 C/kg per minute (20 R/min) as proposed.
FDA notes that recommendations related to limits on entrance exposure rate resulted from a workshop on fluoroscopy
cosponsored by FDA and the American College of Radiology (ACR) in October of 1992 (Ref. 2). These recommendations
generally favored limiting exposure rates from fluoroscopic x-ray systems in some manner and included suggestions
for limiting the maximum exposure rate to the input surface of the image intensifier tube. FDA has chosen not to include
these suggestions in this final rule because they were beyond the scope of the proposal. FDA will carefully consider
the recommendations from the workshop related to limiting exposure rates in conjunction with future amendments.
2. One of the comments suggested that the requirement for a continuous audible signal during the high-level control
mode of operation be modified to specify that the signal be emitted at the fluoroscopic imaging assembly (at an FDA-specified
volume level), to ensure that the signal is audible to the fluoroscopist.
The current requirement for a continuous audible signal is that the signal must be audible to the fluoroscopist, which
would seem to meet the intent of the comment. As with any medical device alarm or signal, the volume level of the signal
should be designed to be sufficiently loud to alert the operator to the status of the device, taking into account any
background noise likely to be present during use. In addition, the effect of an overly loud signal on the patient should
be considered in the signal design. FDA disagrees that the agency should specify an emission location or a particular
volume level for the signal, but encourages manufacturers, in the design of their systems, to consult available human
factors guidelines for audio (and visual) characteristics of medical device alarms and signals (e.g., Ref. 1), and
to test and evaluate their systems under representative operational conditions.
3. One of the comments referred to the workshop on fluoroscopy discussed in comment 1 above, and noted a number of additional
suggestions for changes to fluoroscopic x-ray system performance that were advocated by attendees at that workshop
(Ref. 2).
Those additional suggestions for changes are beyond the scope of the current proposal and would require a separate
proposal and opportunity for comment. FDA agrees that the recommendations from the workshop should be considered
as the basis for possible future amendments to the standard.


III. Environmental Impact


The agency has determined under 21 CFR 25.24(e)(3) that this action is of a type that does not individually or cumulatively
have a significant effect on the human environment. Therefore, neither an environmental assessment nor an environmental
impact statement is required.


IV. Analysis of Impacts


 An analysis of the costs and benefits of this regulation, conducted under Executive Order 12291, was discussed in
the proposed rule and the substance of that analysis has not changed. Executive Order 12291 has been superseded by
Executive Order 12866. FDA has examined the impacts of this final rule under Executive Order 12866 and the Regulatory
Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354). Executive Order 12866 directs agencies to assess all costs and benefits of available
regulatory alternatives and, when regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits
(including potential economic, environmental, public health and safety, and other advantages; distributive impacts;
and equity). The agency believes that this rule is consistent with the regulatory philosophy and principles identified
in the Executive Order. In addition, the rule is not a significant regulatory action as defined by the Executive Order
and so is not subject to review under the Executive Order.
 The Regulatory Flexibility Act requires agencies to analyze regulatory options that would minimize any
