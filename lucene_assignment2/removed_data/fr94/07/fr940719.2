Notice of Meeting of the National Organic Standards Board 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Agricultural Marketing Service, USDA. 

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 In accordance with the Federal Advisory Committee Act, as amended, the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) announces
a forthcoming meeting of the National Organic Standards Board (NOSB). 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Section 2119 (7 U.S.C. 6518) of the Food, Agriculture, Conservation, and Trade Act of 1990 (FACT Act), as amended 
(7 U.S.C. 6501 et seq.), requires establishment of a NOSB. The purpose of the Board is to assist in the development of
standards for substances to be used in organic production and to advise the Secretary on any other aspects of the implementation
of 
Title XXI of the FACT Act. The NOSB met for the first time in Washington, DC, in 
March 1992 and formed six committees to work on various aspects of the program. The committees are: Crops Standards;
Processing, Labelling and Packaging; Livestock Standards; Accreditation; National Materials List; and International
Issues. 


Purpose and Agenda


The main focus of this meeting is to approve recommendations from the full Board to the Secretary of Agriculture on
major aspects of the organic program. These recommendations represent the results of extensive discussion of issues
considered by working committees of the Board. The last meeting of the NOSB in February 1994 provided considerable
time for the committees to present their issues and papers for discussion with 
the full Board. This meeting will have the committees presenting proposed amendments to their draft recommendations
to the full Board for discussion, followed by a vote to approve the Board recommendations to the Secretary. 

Topics to be covered in the full Board meeting include processing and labeling standards; the process for reviewing
materials needed for the National List of approved synthetics and prohibited natural substances; accreditation
requirements and criteria for a peer review panel for accrediting certifying agents; draft recommendations for
organic crop 
production, developed by the Crops Committee; antibiotics, and parasiticides positions, and draft recommendations
prepared by the Livestock Committee; and import requirements for organic products. 
A final agenda will be available on May 1, 1994. Persons requesting copies should contact Ms. Faith Ashton at the above
address or phone number. 


Type of Meeting 

All meetings will be open to the public. Individuals and organizations wishing to provide written comments on these
issues or to express public comment on any organic issues should forward the request to Harold S. Ricker at the above
address or FAXED to 202/690-0338 by May 27, 1994, in order to be scheduled. The NOSB has scheduled time for public
input on Wednesday, June 1, 1994, beginning at 1 p.m. and continuing until 5:30 p.m. While people may sign up to speak
at the door, advance scheduling assures an opportunity in the time allowed and helps the NOSB plan its activities.
Each individual or organization will be allocated 10 minutes for presenting orally the key issues of concern, and
should provide copies of written material elaborating on those issues for the Committees. 



Dated: May 12, 1994.

Article IV_Duties After Loss



Your Duties



A. In the event of an occurrence causing a loss to the Crop(s) for which You make a claim for a MPCI Policy Indemnity Payment,
You must:

1. Give Us written notice of such loss within fifteen (15) days after such loss;

2. Upon Our request, submit to an examination under oath; and

proof of loss signed by You declaring the loss and Your share in the Crop(s).

B. It shall be a condition precedent to the payment of any indemnity that You make available to Us or authorize Us, in
writing, to obtain any and all records, documents, and information requested by Us to permit Us to verify and substantiate
the loss to the Crop(s) as well as any proof of loss submitted by You under the MPCI Policy and the handling, adjustment,
and payment to You of any loss under the MPCI Policy.

C. We may reject any claim for indemnity submitted and no indemnity payment will be made if any of the requirements of
this section are not met.



Our Duties



A. We will adjust all losses that are timely reported to Us in writing;

B. We will adjust any loss in regard to any Crop when You receive a MPCI Policy Indemnity Payment in regard to a loss to
that Crop under the MPCI Policy, and the amount of the indemnity, if any, under this Policy can be determined.

C. We will pay Your loss within thirty (30) days after:

1. We reach agreement with You;

2. The entry of a final court judgment; or

3. The filing of any appraisal award with Us.



Article V_Claim for Indemnity



Claim



In regard to any claim for indemnity as to any Crop insured under this Policy, You shall establish:

A. That You sustained a Crop production loss to such Crop caused by an insured peril under the MPCI Policy;

B. That You received a MPCI Policy Indemnity Payment in regard to the production loss to such Crop; and

C. The amount of the MPCI Policy Indemnity Payment You received. No indemnity shall be payable under this Policy as
to a Crop unless and until You receive a MPCI Policy Indemnity Payment, as a result of a loss to that Crop under the MPCI
Policy.



Indemnity Payment



A. The indemnity payable to You, if any, under this Policy shall be determined separately for each Crop, as specifically
provided in the endorsements to this Policy.

B. All loss adjustments are subject to inspection, revision and/or recalculation by Us and shall be finally accepted
by Us only after the content of the relevant adjustment forms have been found complete and correct by Us. We will be entitled
to correct any erroneously paid claims and recover any amount paid to You in excess of the correct indemnity payable
hereunder.

as to any one crop is limited to and shall not in any event exceed 100% of the total maximum coverage as stated in the summary
of coverage.




Article VI_Appraisal



If You and We fail to agree on the total indemnity payable to You for any Crop, either one can ask that the Indemnity be
set by appraisal. The appraisal process is as follows:

A. To start appraisal either You or We must make the request in writing to the other.

B. You and We must choose an independent appraiser and give the name and address of that appraiser to the other. This
must be done within ten (10) days after the request for appraisal is received.

C. The two appraisers must select an impartial umpire. If they do not agree on an umpire within five (5) days, either
You or We may have an umpire appointed by a Court located in the same state as the Crop.

D. The appraisers will then determine the total indemnity payable and give Us a written report of their agreement.
You will also get a copy of the report. The Indemnity they agree on will constitute the appraisal award which will be
the total indemnity payable to You.

E. If the appraisers fail to agree within a reasonable time, they will give the umpire a statement of their differences.
Then the umpire will join in the procedure. A written agreement signed by any two of the three will constitute the appraisal
award which will be the total indemnity payable to You.

You will pay Your appraiser and We will pay Ours. The unpire's fee and any other appraisal expenses will be shared equally
by You and Us.

Because You may be able to recover all or part of Your loss from someone other than Us, You must do all You can to preserve
any such rights. If We pay for a loss, then any right to recovery will belong to Us. If We recover more than We paid, plus
Our expenses, the excess will be paid to You.

We will not be liable for a greater proportion of any loss than the amount hereby insured shall bear to the whole insurance
covering the Crop insured against the peril involved, whether collectible or not.

Assignment of any interest under this policy shall not bind Us until our consent is endorsed hereon.

A waiver or change of any provision must be in writing and approved by Us. Our request for an appraisal or examination

relating to this insurance, either before or after a loss.



Article XII_Conformity to Statutes




If any terms of this Policy are in conflict with statutes of the state in which this Policy is issued, the Policy will
conform to such statutes.

and dividing this sum by the number of full active trading days during the month. For purposes of determining the Average
Daily Settlement Price, there must be fifteen (15) or more full active trading days during the applicable month. If
there are fourteen (14) or less full active trading days during the applicable month, such immediately preceding
consecutive full active trading days from the previous month(s) as are necessary will be added to the applicable months'
trading days until fifteen (15) full active trading days are available to determine the Average Daily Settlement
Price. 

A full active trading day is any trading day on the 

Minneapolis Grain Exchange 

commodity futures market during which more than fifty (50) wheat futures contracts are traded. 

In the event that trading on the 

Minneapolis Grain Exchange 

commodity futures market for wheat is suspended or terminated so that for purposes of determining the Average Daily
Settlement Price there are fourteen (14) or less full active trading days during the applicable month, such immediately
preceding consecutive full active trading days from the previous month(s) as are necessary will be added to the applicable
months' trading days until fifteen (15) full active trading days are available to determine the Average Daily Settlement
Price. 

B. In calculating the indemnity payable to You, if any, for any loss to any Crop other than Wheat, the ``Average Daily
Settlement Price'' for such Crop shall mean the average derived by totalling the Chicago Board of Trade commodity
futures daily final closing settlement price for such Crop for each full active trading day during the month and dividing
this sum by the number of full active trading days during the month. For purposes of determining the Average Daily Settlement
Price for any such Crop, there must be fifteen (15) or more full active trading days during the applicable month. If
there are fourteen (14) or less full active trading days during the applicable month for such Crop, such immediately

2. The ``Wheat Base Price'' shall be established as the highest MPCI Policy Crop Price Election for Wheat available
under the MPCI Policy for the then current crop year.

3. The Wheat Base Price shall be subtracted from the Wheat Futures Price to determine the ``Wheat Price Change''.

4. The ``Maximum Price Change'' per bushel shall be that amount selected by You ($1.00, $1.50, or $2.00 per bushel)
on Your application for coverage and shown on the Summary of Coverage provided by Us to You.

5. The ``Indemnity Per Bushel'' shall be the lesser of:

a. The Wheat Price Change; and

b. The Maximum Price Change.

6. The MPCI Policy Indemnity Payment shall be divided by Your MPCI Policy Crop Price Election for Wheat to determine
the ``Wheat Production Loss'' in bushels.

7. The Indemnity Per Bushel shall be multiplied by the Wheat Production Loss to determine the total indemnity to be
paid to You. 

B. ``Average Daily Settlement Price'' means the average derived by totaling midpoint of the bids for soft white Wheat
arriving at Portland, Oregon by rail, truck, or barge as reported by the Portland Grain Exchange for each price reporting
day during the month and dividing this sum by the number of price reporting days during the month. For purposes of determining
the Average Daily Settlement Price, there must be fifteen (15) or more price reporting days during the applicable
month. A price reporting day is any normal weekday that price bids for soft white Wheat are reported by the Portland
Grain Exchange. 

C. In the event that price reporting by the Portland Grain Exchange for soft white Wheat is suspended or terminated
so that for purposes of determining the Average Daily Settlement Price there are fourteen (14) or less price reporting
days from the Portland Grain Exchange, the Average Daily Settlement Price shall be derived by adding a Chicago-Portland
basis adjustment of thirty-five cents (35$) per bushel to the Chicago Board of Trade commodity futures daily
final closing settlement price for Wheat for each full active trading day during the month, totaling these basis-adjusted
daily final closing settlement prices for Wheat for each full active trading day during the month, and dividing this
sum by the number of full active trading days during the month. For purposes of determining the Average Daily Settlement
Price for Wheat, there must be fifteen (15) or more full active trading days during the applicable month. If there are
fourteen (14) or less full active trading days during the applicable month, no indemnity shall be payable as to Your
Wheat Crop and that portion of the Premium paid by You which is applicable to such Wheat Crop shall be refunded by Us.
A full active trading day is any trading day on the Chicago Board of Trade commodity futures market during which more
than 50 Wheat futures contracts are traded. 

Article XIV_DEFINITIONS is amended by adding, after paragraph H, the following new paragraph I: 

I. ``Wheat'' is defined to include both a wheat crop seeded during the fall months of the year, overwintered in the field
and harvested the following seasons, as well as wheat planted in the spring months of the year and harvested that same
year. 

Pursuant to the ``Insurance Period'' Section of Article II of the Policy: 

The coverage provided by the policy and this endorsement for your fall wheat crop 

is not continuous

. 

You must renew the coverage

 provided by the policy and this endorsement on your fall wheat crop 

no later than October 31 

of each year for coverage to be effective for the succeeding year.

<DOCTITLE>Announcement of the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation's Pending Evaluation of County Grain Sorghum Insurance
Programs</DOCTITLE>




<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Federal Crop Insurance Corporation, Agriculture.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of intent.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Federal Crop Insurance Corporation (FCIC) is announcing intent to evaluate its grain sorghum program. This announcement
solicits public comment and suggestion for improvement and increased participation in FCIC's grain sorghum program.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The Federal Crop Insurance Corporation conducts continuing evaluations of its insurance programs. Crop evaluations
provide valuable insight into how well programs are operating, the extent to which they are serving the customer,
the quality of the customer service provided, the program strengths, the program weaknesses, and program cost effectiveness.
Evaluations provide information necessary for FCIC to work for the continued improvement of its crop insurance programs.





The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 directed that FCIC take necessary actions to improve the actuarial
soundness of multiple peril crop insurance and to achieve, on and after October 1, 1995, a projected loss ratio not
to exceed 1.10. Therefore, crop programs experiencing high loss ratios and high net losses are priority programs
for FCIC to evaluate. For crop years 1989-1993, FCIC's grain sorghum program experienced a loss ratio of 1.66
and a net loss (premium less indemnity) of approximately $71,000,000.



The evaluation will include a review of actuarial and underwriting performance; the accuracy of existing program
dates (sales closing, final planting, acreage reporting, and contract cancellation); the effect of unit division
and related rate impacts; the determination of insurance coverage, an analysis of cause of loss, frequency and severity
of losses and other pertinent program factors. In addition, loss adjustment procedure and training will be evaluated.

<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Forest Service, USDA.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of intent to prepare an environmental impact statement.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Forest Service, USDA, will prepare an environmental impact statement (EIS) to analyze and disclose the environmental
impacts of a site-specific proposal to issue a permit and authorize construction of roads across National Forest
System (NFS) lands located in the Taneum Creek Drainage. The action is proposed in response to an application seeking
legal access to approximately 1280 acres in two separate sections of non-Federal land located within the Forest Boundary
on the Cle Elum Ranger District. The proposed action is located approximately 10 miles south of Cle Elum, Washington.
The purpose of the EIS will be to develop and evaluate a range of alternatives including a no action Alternative, and
possible additional alternatives to respond to issues identified during the scoping process. The proposed project
will be in compliance with the direction in the Wenatchee National Forest Land and Resource Management Plan (March
1990) which provides the overall guidance for management of the area. The agency invites written comments on the scope
of this project. In addition, the agency gives notice of this analysis so that interested and affected people are aware
of how they may participate and contribute to the final decision.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The Wenatchee National Forest is initiating this action in response to an application filed by Plum Creek Timber Company.
The applicant requests rights-of-way across NFS lands for the purpose of establishing temporary legal access to
approximately 1280 acres in two separate sections of land owned by the applicant. Both sections of land to be accessed
are surrounded by NFS lands and no legal road access to the sections currently exists.


The applicant seeks legal access pursuant to the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (ANILCA). The ANILCA
directs the Forest Service to grant access to inholdings of non-Federal land within the National Forest boundary
for the reasonable use and enjoyment of those lands by the landowner. The applicant has stated that it intends to manage
the lands to be accessed for long term timber production utilizing conventional ground based logging systems. The
applicant intends to build roads on the permitted rights-of-way sufficient to support the intended use of the land.
The access involves approximately 3,909 feet of road on 4 acres of NFS land for the Peaches section and 5000 feet of road
on 5 acres of NFS land for the Taneum section.
A range of alternatives will be considered, including a no action alternative. Other alternatives will be developed
in response to issues received during scoping.
The major issues that have been identified to date include the following: water quality; Late Successional Reserves;
Taneum Roadless Area; habitat for spotted owl, peregrine falcon and the gray wolf; cumulative effects of both the
road access and the management of the private land and Forest Service; and recreational road and trail use by Off Road
Vehicles.
Public participation will be especially important at several points during the analysis. The Forest Service will
be seeking information, comments, and assistance from Federal, State, and local agencies, and other individuals
or organizations who may be interested in or affected by the proposed actions. This information will be used in preparation
of the draft EIS. The scoping process includes:



1. Identifying potential issues.
2. Identifying issues to be analyzed in depth.
3. Eliminating insignificant issues or those which have been covered by a relevant previous environmental process.
4. Exploring additional alternatives.
5. Identifying potential environmental effects of the proposed action and alternatives (i.e. direct, indirect,
and cumulative effects and connected actions).
6. Determining potential cooperating agencies and task assignments.



The draft EIS is expected to be filed with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and to be available for public
review by January 31, 1995. At that time, copies of the draft EIS will be distributed to interested and affected agencies,
organizations, and members of the public for their review and comment. EPA will publish a notice of availability of
the draft EIS in the 

Federal Register

.
The comment period on the draft EIS will be no less than 45 days from the date the EPA notice appears in the 

Federal Register

. It is very important that those interested in the management of the Wenatchee National Forest participate at that
time.
The Forest Service believes, at this early stage, it is important to give reviewers notice of several court rulings
related to public participation in the environmental review process. First, reviewers of draft EIS's must structure
their participation in the environmental review of the proposal so that it is meaningful and alerts an agency to the
reviewer's position and contentions.

Harris, 

490 F. Supp. 1334, 1338 (E.D. Wis. 1980). Because of these court rulings, it is very important that those interested
in this proposed action participate by the close of the comment period so that substantive comments and objections
are made available to the Forest Service at a time when it can meaningfully consider them and respond to them in the final
EIS.
To assist the Forest Service in identifying and considering issues and concerns on the proposed action, comments
on the draft EIS should be as specific as possible. It is also helpful if comments refer to specific pages or chapters
of the draft EIS. Comments may also address the adequacy of the draft EIS or the merits of the alternatives formulated
and discussed in the statement. Reviewers may wish to refer to the Council on Environmental Quality Regulations for
implementing the procedural provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act at 40 CFR 1503.3 in addressing these
points.
The final EIS is scheduled to be completed by May 1, 1995. In the final EIS, the Forest Service is required to respond
to comments and responses received during the comment period that pertain to the environmental consequences discussed
in the draft EIS and applicable laws, regulations, and policies considered in making the decision regarding this
proposal. Sonny J. O'Neal, Forest Supervisor, Wenatchee National Forest is the responsible official. As the responsible
official he will document the decision and reasons for the decision in the Record of Decision. That decision will be
subject to Forest Service appeal regulations (36 CFR 215).

review by January 31, 1995. At that time, copies of the draft EIS will be distributed to interested and affected agencies,
organizations, and members of the public for their review and comment. EPA will publish a notice of availability of
the draft EIS in the 

Federal Register

.

The comment period on the draft EIS will be no less than 45 days from the date the EPA notice appears in the 

Federal Register

. It is very important that those interested in the management of the Wenatchee National Forest participate at that
time.

The Forest Service believes, at this early stage, it is important to give reviewers notice of several court rulings
related to public participation in the environmental review process. First, reviewers of draft EIS's must structure
their participation in the environmental review of the proposal so that it is meaningful and alerts an agency to the
reviewer's position and contentions. 

Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corp. 

v. 

NRDC, 

435 U.S. 519, 553 (1978). Also, environmental objections that could be raised at the draft EIS stage but that are not
raised until after completion of the final EIS may be waived or dismissed by the courts.

Wisconsin Heritages, Inc. 

v. 

Harris, 

490 F. Supp. 1334, 1338 (E.D. Wis. 1980). Because of these court rulings, it is very important that those interested
in this proposed action participate by the close of the comment period so that substantive comments and objections
are made available to the Forest Service at a time when it can meaningfully consider them and respond to them in the final
EIS.

To assist the Forest Service in identifying and considering issues and concerns on the proposed action, comments
on the draft EIS should be as specific as possible. It is also helpful if comments refer to specific pages or chapters
of the draft EIS. Comments may also address the adequacy of the draft EIS or the merits of the alternatives formulated
and discussed in the statement. Reviewers may wish to refer to the Council on Environmental Quality Regulations for
implementing the procedural provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act at 40 CFR 1503.3 in addressing these
points.

The final EIS is scheduled to be completed by May 1, 1995. In the final EIS, The Forest Service is required to respond
to comments and responses received during the comment period that pertain to the environmental consequences discussed
in the draft EIS and applicable laws, regulations, and policies considered in making the decision regarding this
proposal. Sonny J. O'Neal, Forest Supervisor, Wenatchee National Forest is the responsible official. As the responsible
official he will document the decision and reasons for the decision in the Record of Decision. That decision will be
subject to Forest Service appeal regulations (36 CFR 215).

<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Forest Service, USDA.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of intent to prepare an environmental impact statement.





</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Forest Service, USDA, will prepare an environmental impact statement (EIS) to analyze and disclose the environmental
impacts of a site-specific proposal to issue a permit and authorize construction of a road across National Forest
System (NFS) lands located in the Little Boulder and Big Boulder Creek System Drainages. The action is proposed in
response to an application seeking legal access to approximately 642 acres of non-Federal land located within the
Forest Boundary on the Cle Elum Ranger District. The proposed action is located approximately 10 miles northwest
of Cle Elum, Washington. The purpose of the EIS will be to develop and evaluate a range of alternatives including a no
action alternative, and possible additional alternatives to respond to issues identified during the scoping process.
The proposed project will be in compliance with the direction in the Wenatchee National Forest Land and Resource Management
Plan (March 1990) which provides the overall guidance for management of the area. The agency invites written comments
on the scope of this project. In addition, the agency gives notice of this analysis so that interested and affected
people are aware of how they may participate and contribute to the final decision.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The Wenatchee National Forest is initiating this action in respond to an application filed by Plum Creek Timber Company.
The applicant requests a right-of-way across NFS lands for the purpose of establishing temporary legal access to
approximately 642 acres in one section of land owned by the applicant. The section of land to be accessed is surrounded
by NFS lands and no legal road access to the section currently exists.



The applicant seeks legal access pursuant to the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (ANILCA). The ANILCA
directs the Forest Service to grant access to inholdings of non-Federal land within the National Forest boundary
for the reasonable use and enjoyment of those lands by the landowner. The applicant has stated that it intends to manage
the lands to be accessed for long term timber production utilizing conventional ground based logging systems. The
applicant intends to build a road on the permitted right-of-way sufficient to support the intended use of the land.
The access involves approximately 1200 feet of new road on one acre of NFS land.

A range of alternatives will be considered, including a no action alternative. Other alternatives will be developed
in response to issues received during scoping. 

The major issues that have been identified to date include the following: Water quality; fisheries; Snoqualmie Pass
Adaptive Management Area; Teanaway Recreation Area; habitat for spotted owl, peregrine falcon and the gray wolf:
cumulative effects of both the road access and the management of the private land and Forest Service. 

Public participation will be especially important at several points during the analysis. The Forest Service will
be seeking information, comments, and assistance from Federal, State, and local agencies, and other individuals
or organizations who may be interested in or affected by the proposed actions. This information will be used in preparation
of the draft EIS. The scoping process includes:

1. Identifying potential issues. 

2. Identifying issues to be analyzed in depth. 

3. Eliminating insignificant issues or those which have been covered by a relevant previous environmental process.


4. Exploring additional alternatives. 

5. Identifying potential environmental effects of the proposed action and alternatives (i.e. direct, indirect,
and cumulative effects and connected actions). 

6. Determining potential cooperating agencies and task assignments.

The draft EIS is expected to be filed with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and to be available for public
review by January 31, 1995. At that time, copies of the draft EIS will be distributed to interested and affected agencies,
organizations, and members of the public for their review and comment. EPA will publish a notice of availability of

<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Minority Business Development Agency.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 In accordance with Executive Order 11625, and 15 U.S.C. 1512, the Minority Business Development Agency (MBDA) is
soliciting competitive applications under its Minority Business Development Center (MBDC) program. The total
cost of performance for the first budget period (12 months) from October 1, 1994 to September 30, 1995 is estimated
at $198,971. The total Federal Amount is $169,125 and is composed of $165,000 plus the Audit Fee Amount of $4,125. The
application must include a minimum cost-share of 15% ($29,846) of the total project cost through non-Federal contributions.
Cost-sharing contributions may be in the form of cash contributions, client fees, in-kind contributions or combinations
thereof. The MBDC will operate in the Monmouth-Ocean-Atlantic, N.J. geographic service area.


The funding instrument for the MBDC will be a cooperative agreement. Competition is open to individuals, non-profit
and for-profit organizations, state, and local governments, American Indian tribes and educational institutions.
The MBDC Program provides business development services to the minority business community to help establish and
maintain viable minority businesses. To this end, MBDA funds organizations to identify and coordinate public and
private sector resources on behalf of minority individuals and firms; to offer a full range of management and technical
assistance to minority entrepreneurs; and to serve as a conduit of information and assistance regarding minority
business.
Applications will be evaluated on the following criteria: the experience and capabilities of the firm and its staff
in addressing the needs of the business community in general and, specifically, the special needs of minority businesses,
individuals and organizations (50 points); the resources available to the firm in providing business development
services (10 points); the firm's approach (techniques and methodologies) to performing the work requirements included
in the application (20 points); and the firm's estimated cost for providing such assistance (20 points).

An application must receive at least 70% of the points assigned to each evaluation criteria category to be considered
programmatically acceptable and response. Those applications determined to be acceptable and responsive will
then be evaluated by the Director of MBDA. Final award selections shall be based on the number of points received, the
demonstrated responsibility of the applicant, and the determination of those most likely to further the purpose
of the MBDA program. Negative audit findings and recommendations and unsatisfactory performance under prior Federal
Awards may result in an application not being considered for award. The applicant with the highest point score will
not necessarily receive the award.

MDCSs shall be required to contribute at least 15% of the total project cost through non-Federal contributions. To
assist them in this effort, MBDCs may charge client fees for management and technical assistance (M&TA) rendered.
Based on a standard rate of $50 per hour, MBDCs will charge client fees at 20% of the total cost for firms with gross sales
of $500,000 or less, and 35% of the total cost for firms with gross sales of over $500,000.

Quarterly reviews culminating in year-to-date evaluations will be conducted to determine if funding for the project
should continue. Continued funding will be at the total discretion of MBDA based on such factors as the MBDC's performance,
the availability of funds and Agency priorities.

Approval of Federal Information Processing Standards Publication 186, Digital Signature Standard (DSS)



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Commerce.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of approval of Federal Information Processing Standard 186, Digital Signature Standard.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This notice announces that the Secretary of Commerce has approved the Digital Signature Standard (DSS) as Federal
Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 186. The DSS provides the capability to generate digital signatures that
cannot be forged. This capability is needed by Federal government agencies to carry out their responsibilities for
electronic exchanges and to improve government operations through the use of information technology.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

On August 30, 1991, NIST published in the 

Federal Register

 (56 FR 42980) a notice which announced the proposed FIPS for DSS. On December 2, 1991, the comment period for the proposed
FIPS for DSS was extended by notice published in the 

Federal Register

 (56 FR 61231).



NIST received comments from 109 organizations and individuals in response to the 

Federal Register

 notice and to information sent to Federal agencies on the proposed FIPS for DSS. Many of the comments supported the
proposed DSS and stated requirements for a digital signature capability for use in electronic data applications.
Other comments in support of the DSS backed NIST's goal of a digital signature standard that is free of patent impediments
and that provides for interoperability and a uniform level of security.

NIST also received many comments criticizing the adoption of the proposed DSS. Some of the arguments in opposition
included: The selection process for the Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA) was not public; time provided for analysis
of the DSA was not sufficient; the DSA may infringe on other patents; the DSA does not provide for secret key distribution;
the DSA is incomplete because no hash algorithm is specified; the DSA is not compatible with international standards;
the DSA is not secure; the DSA is not efficient.

NIST considered all of the issues raised and believes that is has addressed them. The development of this standard
was carried out through NIST's usual procedures including solicitation of input from different sources. To provide
more time for analysis of the DSA, NIST extended the original three month review and comment period for an additional
three months. NIST has addressed the possible patent infringement claims, and has concluded that there are no valid
claims.

The DSA does not provide for secret key distribution since it is not intended for that purpose. Since the proposed DSS
was announced, a Secure Hash Standard was proposed and approved as FIPS 180. With respect to the compatibility of the
DSS with international standards, NIST has proposed that the DSA be an alternative signature standard within the
appropriate international standard (IS 9796). Concerning the security of the DSA, no cryptographic shortcut attacks
on the DSA have been discovered. However, NIST has revised the proposed standard to provide a larger modulus size.
This modification will accommodate requirements for long term security of digital signatures. NIST believes that
the efficiency of the DSA is adequate for most applications.
Given the complexity of the public comments, NIST proceeded deliberatively in its consideration of the August 1991
proposal. The written comments submitted by interested parties and other available material were carefully reviewed
and considered in the determination to finalize the proposed FIPS for DSS. On the basis of this review, NIST recommended
that the Secretary approve the standard as a Federal Information Processing Standards Publication, and prepared
a detailed justification document for the Secretary's review in support of that recommendation. The detailed justification
document which was presented to the Secretary is part of the public record and is available for inspection and copying
in the Department's Central Reference and Records Inspection Facility, room 6020, Herbert C. Hoover Building, 14th
Street between Pennsylvania and Constitution Avenues, NW., Washington, DC 20230.

This FIPS contains two sections: (1) An announcement section, which provides information concerning the applicability,
implementation, and maintenance of the standard; and (2) a specifications section which deals with the technical
requirements of the standard. Only the announcement section is provided in this notice.

Processing Standards Publication 186 



Announcing the Digital Signature Standard (DSS) 



Federal Information Processing Standards Publications (FIPS PUBS) are issued by the National Institute of Standards
and Technology (NIST) after approval by the Secretary of Commerce pursuant to Section 111(d) of the Federal Property
and Administrative Services Act of 1949 as amended by the Computer Security Act of 1987, Public law 100-235.




Name of Standard: 

Digital Signature Standard (DSS). 



Category of Standard: 

Computer Security; Cryptography. 



Explanation: 

This Standard specifies a Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA) appropriate for applications requiring a digital rather
than written signature. The DSA digital signature is a pair of large numbers represented in a computer as strings of
binary digits. The digital signature is computed using a set of rules (i.e., the DSA) and a set of parameters such that
the identity of the signatory and integrity of the data can be verified. The DSA provides the capability to generate
and verify signatures. Signature generation makes use of a private key to generate a digital signature. Signature
verification makes use of a public key which corresponds to, but is not the same as, the private key. Each user possesses
a private and public key pair. Public keys are assumed to be known to the public in general. Private keys are never shared.
Anyone can verify the signature of a user by employing that user's public key. Signature generation can be performed
only by the possessor of the user's private key. 

A hash function is used in the signature generation process to obtain a condensed version of data, called a message
digest (see Figure 1). The message digest is then input to the DSA to generate the digital signature. The digital signature
is sent to the intended verifier along with the signed data (often called the message). The verifier of the message
and signature verifies the signature by using the sender's public key. The same hash function must also be used in the
verification process. The hash function is specified in a separate standard, the Secure Hash Standard (SHS), FIPS
180. Similar procedures may be used to generate and verify signatures for stored as well as transmitted data. 


 















Approving Authority: 

Secretary of Commerce. 



Maintenance Agency: 

U.S. Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Computer Systems Laboratory
(CSL). 



Applicability: 

This standard is applicable to all Federal departments and agencies for the protection of unclassified information
that is not subject to section 2315 of Title 10, United States Code, or section 3502(2) of Title 44, United States Code.
This standard shall be used in designing and implementing public-key based signature systems which Federal departments
and agencies operate or which are operated for them under contract. Adoption and use of this standard is available
to private and commercial organizations. 



Applications: 

The DSA authenticates the integrity of the signed data and the identity of the signatory. The DSA may also be used in
proving to a third party that data was actually signed by the generator of the signature. The DSA is intended for use
in electronic mail, electronic funds transfer, electronic data interchange, software distribution, data storage,
and other applications which require data integrity assurance and data origin authentication. 



Implementations:

 The DSA may be implemented in software, firmware, hardware, or any combination thereof. NIST is developing a validation
program to test implementations for conformance to this standard. Information about the planned validation program
can be obtained from the National Institute of Standards and Technology, Computer Systems Laboratory, Attn: DSS
Validation, Gaithersburg, MD 20899.


Export Control:

 Implementations of this standard are subject to Federal Government export controls as specified in Title 15, Code
of Federal Regulations, Parts 768 through 799. Exporters are advised to contact the Department of Commerce, Bureau
of Export Administration for more information.


Patents:

 The Department of Commerce is not aware of any patents that would be infringed by this standard.


Implemented Schedule:

 This standard becomes effective December 1, 1994.


Specifications:

 Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS186) Digital Signature Standard (DSS), (affixed).


Cross Index


a. Federal Information Resources Management Regulations (FIRMR) subpart 201.20.303, Standards, and subpart 201.39.1002,
Federal Standards.
b. FIPS PUB 46-2, Data Encryption Standard.
c. FIPS PUB 73, Guidelines for Security of Computer Applications.
d. FIPS PUB 140-1, Security Requirements for Cryptographic Modules.
e. FIPS PUB 171, Key Management Using ANSI X9.17.
f. FIPS PUB 180, Secure Hash Standard.


Qualifications:

 The security of a digital signature system is dependent on maintaining the secrecy of users' private keys. Users must
therefore guard against the unauthorized acquisition of their private keys. While it is the intent of this standard
to specify general security requirements for generating digital signatures, conformance to this standard does
not assure that a particular implementation is secure. The responsible authority in each agency or department shall
assure that an overall implementation provides an acceptable level of security. This standard will be reviewed every
five years in order to assess its adequacy.

Waiver Procedure: 

Under certain exceptional circumstances, the heads of Federal departments and agencies may approve waivers to Federal
Information Processing Standards (FIPS). The head of such agency may redelegate such authority only to a senior official
designated pursuant to section 3506(b) of Title 44, United States Code. Waiver shall be granted only when:

a. Compliance with a standard would adversely affect the accomplishment of the mission of an operator of a Federal
computer system; or

b. Compliance with a standard would cause a major adverse financial impact on the operator which is not offset by Government-wide
savings.

Agency heads may act upon a written waiver request containing the information detailed above. Agency heads may also

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:






Authority: 

Executive Order 11651 of March 3, 1972, as amended; section 204 of the Agricultural Act of 1956, as amended (7 U.S.C.
1854).




The Agreement on Textiles and Clothing provides for the eventual integration of the textiles and clothing sector
into the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) 1994. The integration of the textiles and clothing sector into
the GATT 1994 will commence upon implementation of the Uruguay Round. 

Paragraph 6 of Article 2 of the Agreement states that 
``On the date of entry into force of this Agreement, each Member shall integrate into GATT 1994 products which, in 1990,
accounted for not less than 16 percent of the total volume of imports in 1990 of the products in the Annex, in terms of
HS lines or categories. The products to be integrated shall encompass products from each of the following four groups:
tops and yarns, fabrics, made-up textile products, and clothing.'' Integration into GATT 1994 would imply removal
of all quotas on these products, if any exist. A total of 2.7 billion square meters equivalent will be integrated during
the first phase of the integration process.

In anticipation of the passing of the terms of the Agreement by Congress, and even though the final process for determining
which products are to be integrated as yet has not been decided upon, the Chairman of the Committee for the Implementation
of Textile Agreements (CITA) is requesting interested parties to submit comments on paragraph 6 of Article 2 of the
Agreement. This action is being taken pursuant to an international agreement and thus relates to a foreign affairs
function of the United States. 
Comments must be received on or before July 18, 1994. Comments may be mailed to the Chairman, Committee for the Implementation
of Textile Agreements, room 3001, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th and Constitution Avenue NW., Washington, DC

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:






Authority: 

Executive Order 11651 of March 3, 1972, as amended; section 204 of the Agricultural Act of 1956, as amended (7 U.S.C.
1854).




On April 29, 1993, under the terms of the Bilateral Cotton, Man-Made Fiber, Silk Blend and Other Vegetable Fiber Textile
Agreement, effected by exchange of notes dated May 20, 1987 and June 11, 1987, as amended and extended, between the
Governments of the United States and Pakistan, the United States Government requested consultations with the Government
of Pakistan with respect to cotton and man-made fiber skirts in Categories 342/642.

The purpose of this notice is to advise the public that, pending agreement on a mutually satisfactory solution concerning
Categories 342/642, the Government of the United States has decided to control imports during the ninety-day period
which began on April 29, 1994 and extends through July 27, 1994 at a level of 44,933 dozen.

If no solution is agreed upon in consultations between the two governments, CITA, pursuant to the agreement, may later
establish a specific limit for the entry and withdrawal from warehouse for consumption of textile products in Categories
342/642, produced or manufactured in Pakistan and exported during the prorated period beginning on July 28, 1994
and extending through December 31, 1994, of not less than 66,266 dozen.

A summary market statement concerning Categories 342/642 follows this notice.

Anyone wishing to comment or provide data or information regarding the treatment of Categories 342/642, under the
agreement with the Government of Pakistan, or to comment on domestic production or availability of products included
in Categories 342/642, is invited to submit 10 copies of such comments or information to Rita D. Hayes, Chairman, Committee
for the Implementation of Textile Agreements, U.S. Department of Commerce, Washington, DC 20230; ATTN: Helen L.
LeGrande. The comments received will be considered in the context of the consultations with the Government of Pakistan.

Because the exact timing of the consultations is not yet certain, comments should be submitted promptly. Comments
or information submitted in response to this notice will be available for public inspection in the Office of Textiles
and Apparel, room H3100, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th and Constitution Avenue, NW., Washington, DC.

Further comments may be invited regarding particular comments or information received from the public which the
Committee for the Implementation of Textile Agreements considers appropriate for further consideration.
The solicitation of comments regarding any aspect of the agreement or the implementation thereof is not a waiver in
any respect of the exemption contained in 5 U.S.C. 553(a)(1) relating to matters which constitute ``a foreign affairs
function of the United States.''

The United States remains committed to finding a solution concerning Categories 342/642. Should such a solution
be reached in consultations with the Government of Pakistan, further notice will be published in the 

Federal Register

.

A description of the textile and apparel categories in terms of HTS numbers is available in the CORRELATION: Textile
and Apparel Categories with the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (see 

Federal Register

Import Situation and Conclusion



U.S. imports of cotton and manmade fiber skirts, Category 342/642, from Pakistan reached 139,441 dozen during the
year ending February 1994, 66 percent above the 83,893 dozen shipped during the year ending February 1993. Imports
from Pakistan increased from 85,441 dozen in 1992 to 119,637 dozen in 1993, a 40 percent increase. During the first
two months of 1994, imports of Category 342/642 from Pakistan were 39,497 dozen, double the 19,693 dozen imported
a year earlier.

The sharp and substantial increase of Category 342/642 imports from Pakistan is causing a real risk of disruption
in the U.S. market for cotton and manmade fiber skirts.


</SIGNJOB>
<SIGNJOB>
U.S. Production, Import Penetration and Market Share



U.S. production of cotton and manmade fiber skirts, Category 342/642, fell from 7,444,000 dozen in 1989 to 7,181,000
dozen in 1992, a decrease of 4 percent. U.S. production dropped to 6,143,000 dozen in 1993, 15 percent below the 1992
level. In contrast, U.S. imports of cotton and manmade fiber skirts, Category 342/642, increased from 6,396,000
dozen in 1989 to 6,884,000 dozen in 1992, an 8 percent increase. U.S. imports jumped to 7,386,000 dozen in 1993, 8 percent
above the 1992 level. In the first two months of 1994, Category 342/642 imports are up 24 percent above the January-February
1993 level.

The ratio of imports to domestic production increased from 86 percent in 1989 to 96 percent in 1992 and reached 120 percent
in 1993. The domestic manufacturers' share of the cotton and manmade fiber skirt market declined from 54 percent in
1989 to 51 percent in 1992. The domestic manufacturers' share dropped to 45 percent in 1993, 6 percentage points below
their 1992 market share.

Duty-Paid Value and U.S. Producers' Price



Approximately 77 percent of Category 342/642 imports from Pakistan during the year ending February 1994 entered
the U.S. under HTSUSA 6104.22.0030_Women's knit cotton skirts, entered as part of an ensemble; HTSUSA 6104.52.0010_Women's

Public Scoping Meeting, Plattsburgh AFB, NY



The United States Air Force (Air Force) will conduct a public scoping meeting to provide a forum for public officials
and the community to provide information and comments concerning the disposal and reuse of Plattsburgh AFB, NY. The
meeting will be held June 14, 1994 beginning at 7 p.m. at the Plattsburgh High School Auditorium, 1 Clifford Drive,
Plattsburgh, New York.

The purpose of this meeting is to: (l) Identify the environmental issues and concerns that should be analyzed to support
base disposal and reuse; (2) solicit comments on the proposed action; and (3) solicit potential disposal and reuse
alternatives for consideration in developing the Environmental Impact Statement (EIS). In soliciting disposal
and reuse alternatives, the Air Force will consider all reasonable alternatives offered by any federal, state or
local government agency; any federally-sponsored or private entity; or any individual. The resulting EIS will be
considered in making disposal decisions that will be documented in the Air Force's Final Disposal Plan and Record
of Decision for Plattsburgh AFB.

To ensure sufficient time to adequately consider public comments concerning environmental issues and disposal
alternatives to be included in the EIS, the Air Force recommends that comments and reuse proposals be presented at
the upcoming meeting or forwarded to the address below by August 1, 1994. The Air Force will, however, accept additional
comments at any time during the environmental impact analysis process.

Please direct written comments or requests for further information concerning the base disposal and reuse EIS to:
Lt Col Gary P. Baumgartel, HQ AFCEE/EC, 8106 Chennault Road, Brooks AFB TX 78235-5318, (210) 536-3907.

<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Department of Army, DoD



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of intent.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

United States Army Intelligence Center and Fort Huachuca provides year-round program development and testing facilities,
administration, and logistical support to both active and reserve component units from all branches of the armed
services. The proposed master plan formalizes the United States Army Intelligence Center and For Huachuca's priorities
for intelligence development and testing programs, and developing training ranges, maneuver areas, and facilities
over a twenty year period. This plan will prepare the United States Army Intelligence Center and Fort Huachuca to enter
the 21st century with the assets required for program development, and to conduct highly realistic, challenging,
and safe training to Army Training and Evaluation Program (ARTEP) standards.



The installation real property master plan is being updated and requires a supporting PDEIS for the following reasons:

a. The master plan update identifies major changes in development for the installation.

b. Several projects identified in the master plan update would require individual EIS's because they will potentially
cause unavoidable significant impacts to the environment.

c. An EA prepared for the installation ongoing mission developed in 1976 is inadequate and in need of revision to reflect
current and projected activities.



Alternatives



a. No action. Installation ongoing operations, development and training would continue at current levels.

b. Master plan and component plans would be implemented and current development and testing and training levels would
be maintained. Construction listed in the master plan would be implemented. 

c. Master plan and component plans would be expanded. Development and testing programs would be expanded. Training
would be expanded. Construction above the level outlined in the master plan would be implemented to meet total requirements.
The installation master plan for intelligence development and testing programs, and training, will be evaluated
as occurrences under each of the above alternatives.



Lead Agency



United States Army Intelligence Center and Fort Huachuca, AZ.



Scoping



Comments received as a result of this notice will be used to assist in evaluating the impacts of the master plan on the
environment, social, historical, archaeological and socioeconomic aspects of the United States Army Intelligence
Center and Fort Huachuca and the surrounding area. A scoping meeting will be held in the vicinity of the United States
Army Intelligence Center and Fort Huachuca within 30 days of the publication of this NOI.

<AGENCY>

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notification of termination of RFCC program.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Defense Logistics Agency has terminated its Regional Freight Consolidation Center program and will no longer
use the centers in new contract solicitations. To avoid the expense of modifying contracts, however, DLA will allow
vendors with outstanding contracts to ship to the RFCCs until July 22, 1994.



Before DLA created The RFCC program in November 1988, vendors delivered all products directly to DLA depots. The RFCC
program was designed to reduce vendor transportation costs by consolidating small package and less-than-truckload
shipments at regional centers, which then shipped the larger loads to DLA depots. DLA believed that vendors would
pass these savings on to the government as lower-priced bids for Department of Defense contracts. At its peak, the
program included seven regional centers_five operated by commercial firms and two operated by DLA depots.

DLA officials decided to end the program for several reasons. Most important, DLA was not satisfied that vendors were
passing transportation savings on to DOD in the form of lower contract prices and the RFCCs sometimes increased delivery
time to customers. In addition, because DOD is downsizing, the volume of shipments is decreasing and the cost of operating
the centers would outweigh the savings realized.

Algonquin Gas Transmission Co.; Notice of Availability of the Environment Assessment for the Proposed Brockton
Loop Cromwell Compressor Station Project



May 13, 1994.



The staff of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC or Commission) has prepared this Environmental Assessment
(EA) on the natural gas pipeline facilities proposed by Algonquin Gas Transmission Company (Algonquin) in the above-referenced
dockets.

The EA was prepared to satisfy the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act. The staff concludes that
approval of the proposed project, with appropriate mitigating measures, would not constitute a major Federal action
significantly affecting the quality of the human environment.

The EA assesses the potential environmental effects of the construction and operation of the proposed AFT-5
Pipeline Project, including: 

 3.8 miles of new 16-inch-diameter natural gas pipeline;

 compressor station modifications; and

 modifications to five meter stations.

The purpose of the proposed facilities would be to provide new firm transportation service of up to 14,758 MMBtu of
natural gas per day for Bay State Gas Company. The EA also evaluates alternatives to Algonquin's proposal.

The Massachusetts Energy Facility Siting Board has recommended an alternative to the proposed route in the vicinity
of Linwood Street identified in the EA as the Hampden Avenue/Jackson Heights Variation. The staff analyzed this,
as well as other routing variations but did not find that any of these variations were environmentally superior to
the proposed route with the mitigation recommended by the staff. The discussion of the variations begins on page 19
of the EA. We would welcome any additional comments on the variations..

The EA has been placed in the public files of the FERC and is available for public inspection at: Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission, Division of Public Information; 941 North Capitol Street NE., room 3104, Washington, DC 20426 (202)
208-1371.

Copies of the EA have been mailed to Federal, state and local agencies, public interest groups, interested individuals,
newspapers, and parties to this processing.

A limited number of copies of the EA are available from: Mr. Howard Wheeler, Environmental Project Manager, Environmental
Review and Compliance Branch II, Office of Pipeline Regulation, room 7312; 825 North Capitol Street NE., Washington,
DC 20426, (202) 208-2299.

Any person wishing to comment on the EA may do so. Written comments must reference Docket Nos. CP93-261-000
and CP93-261-001, and be addressed to: Office of the Secretary, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission,
825 North Capitol Street NE., Washington, DC 20426.

Comments should be filed as soon as possible, but must be received no later than June 2, 1994, to ensure consideration
prior to a Commission decision on this proposal. A copy of any comments should also be set to Mr. Howard Wheeler, Environmental
Project Manger.

Comments will considered by the Commission but will not serve to make the commentor a party to the proceeding. Any person
seeking to become a party to the proceeding must file a motion to intervene pursuant to Rule 214 of the Commission's
Rules of Practice and Procedures (18 CFR 385.214).

The date for filing timely motions to intervene in this proceeding has passed. Therefore, parties now seeking to file
late interventions must show good cause, as required by  385.214(b)(3), why this time limitation should be
waived. Environmental issues have been viewed as good cause for late intervention. You do no need intervenor status
to have your comments considered.

Additional information about this project is available from Mr. Howard Wheeler, Enviromental Review and Compliance
Branch II, Office of Pipeline Regulation, at (202) 208-2299.

<DOCTITLE>Decorative Specialties International, Inc.; Availability of Draft Environmental Assessment</DOCTITLE>



May 13, 1994.



In accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's
(Commission's) regulations, 18 CFR Part 380 (Order No. 486, 52 FR 47897), the Office of Hydropower Licensing has reviewed
the application for minorlicense for the proposed West Springfield Project, located on the Westfield River in Hampden
County, Massachusetts, and has prepared a Draft Environmental Assessment (EA) for the project.

In the DEA, the Commission's staff has analyzed the potential environmental impacts of the project and has concluded
that approval of the project, with appropriate enhancement measures, would not constitute a major federal action
significantly affecting the quality of the human environment.

Copies of the DEA are available for review in the Public Reference Branch, room 3104, of the Commission's offices at
941 North Capitol Street NE., Washington, DC 20426.

Any comments should be filed within 30 days from the date of this notice and should be addressed to Lois D. Cashell, Secretary,
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street NE., Washington, DC 20426. Please affix Project
No. 2608 to all comments. For further information, please contact Jim Haimes, Environmental Coordinator, at (202)

<DOCTITLE>Texas Gas Transmission Corporation, et al.; Natural Gas Certificate Filings </DOCTITLE>


May 12, 1994. 


Take notice that the following filings have been made with the Commission: 


1. Texas Gas Transmission Corporation 


[Docket No. CP94-388-000]


Take notice that on April 28, 1994, Texas Gas Transmission Corporation (Texas Gas), P.O. Box 1160, Owensboro, Kentucky
42302, filed an application in Docket No. CP94-388-000 pursuant to Section 7(b) of the Natural Gas Act
for permission and approval to abandon by sale certain pipeline facilities, all as more fully set forth in the application
which is on file with the Commission and open to public inspection. 
Texas Gas proposes to abandon by sale to Enron Louisiana Energy Company (ELEC) about 4,610 feet of 30-inch pipeline
and appurtenances (Plant Line) located between ANR Pipeline Company's (ANR) Eunice Compressor Station and the inlet
of ELEC's gas processing plant located near Eunice, Louisiana (Eunice Plant). Texas Gas states that the Plant Line
was placed into service in 1977 to receive gas transported by ANR for Texas Gas from the terminus of the High Island Offshore
System to ANR's Eunice Compressor Station. Texas Gas further explains that it received such natural gas from ANR at
the interconnection of the Plant Line and ANR's Eunice Compressor Station for transportation through the Plant Line
to the Eunice Plant for processing and return to Texas Gas at the interconnection of Texas Gas' mainline facilities
with the outlet of the Eunice Plant. Texas Gas also states that it transports natural gas through the Plant Line for
ANR under section 284 of the Commission's regulations. 
Texas Gas asserts that the proposed sale of the Plant Line is contingent upon ELEC receiving a declaratory order from
the Commission, establishing that, upon transfer from Texas Gas to ELEC, the Plant Line would constitute non-jurisdictional
processing facilities. 

Texas Gas states that all gas delivered for the account of Texas Gas, on behalf of either Texas Gas or its customers,
and received by ELEC through the Plant Line, would be transported by ELEC through the Plant Line at no charge and redelivered
to Texas Gas at the outlet of the Eunice Plant. 

Comment date

: June 2, 1994, in accordance with Standard Paragraph F at the end of this notice. 


2. Enron Louisiana Energy Company 


[Docket No. CP94-390-000]



Take notice that on April 28, 1994, Enron Louisiana Energy Company (ELEC), P.O. Box 1188, Houston, Texas 77251, filed
in Docket No. CP94-390-000 a petition for declaratory order requesting that the Commission disclaim
jurisdiction over certain facilities to be acquired from Texas Gas Transmission Corporation (Texas Gas), all as
more fully set forth in the petition which is on file with the Commission and open to public inspection. 
ELEC requests that the Commission issue an order declaring that a 4,610 foot, 30-inch pipeline and appurtenances
(Plant Line) to be acquired by ELEC from Texas Gas are incidental to the operation of ELEC's Eunice Processing Plant
(Eunice Plant) and that ELEC's ownership and operation of the Plant Line in conjunction with its Eunice Plant will
not be subject to the Commission's jurisdiction under the Natural Gas Act. ELEC states that the Plant Line is located
between ANR Pipeline Company's (ANR) Eunice Compressor Station and the inlet of ELEC's Eunice Plant. ELEC also states
that gas transported by ANR for Texas Gas and third parties moves from ANR's Eunice Compressor Station to ELEC's Eunice
Plant through the Plant Line. ELEC asserts that parties transporting gas through ANR's system, whose gas volumes
are processed at the Eunice Plant must enter into a transportation agreement with Texas Gas for the transportation
of natural gas through the Plant Line for delivery and processing at the Eunice Plant. 
ELEC states that the Plant Line is wholly incidental to the extraction of hydrocarbons in the Eunice Plant and is not
a facility for the transportation or sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce. ELEC further states that
if it is permitted to own the Plant Line as a non-jurisdictional extraction plant facility, ELEC would not assess a
transportation charge for natural gas from ANR or Texas Gas to reach the Eunice Plant. 


Comment date:

 June 2, 1994, in accordance with the first paragraph of Standard Paragraph F at the end of this notice.

a joint application pursuant to section 7(b) of the Natural Gas Act and part 157 of the Commission's Regulations for
an order authorizing abandonment of the exchange service known as Trunkline's Rate Schedule E-25 and as ANR's
Rate Schedule X-85, all as more fully set forth in the application which is on file with the Commission and open
to public inspection. 

Trunkline and ANR state that they were authorized in Docket No. CP79-189-000 to exchange up to 15,000 Mcf
of natural gas per day. ANR indicates that pursuant to this exchange service, it made deliveries to Trunkline at the
pipeline facilities of Stingray Pipeline Company at West Cameron Block 269 and West Cameron Block 537, Offshore Louisiana.
Trunkline indicates that pursuant to this exchange service, it delivered equivalent volumes of exchange gas to ANR
at the High Island Offshore System pipeline at High Island Area Blocks A-332, A-313, A-316, A-343,
and A-539, Offshore Texas, and/or the point of interconnection between Stingray and HIOS located at High Island
Area Block A-330, Offshore Texas. 

Trunkline states that it informed ANR by letter dated November 30, 1993, that it wished to terminate the exchange agreement.
Trunkline and ANR request that the effective date of the abandonment be the date of the Commission's order authorizing
the abandonment of the exchange service. 
Trunkline and ANR state they do not propose to abandon any facilities pursuant to the instant application. They further
state that such facilities will be used to provide open-access transportation pursuant to Trunkline's and ANR's
Part 284 blanket certificates.

<DOCTITLE>Florida Gas Transmission Co.; Proposed Changes in FERC Gas Tariff</DOCTITLE>



May 13, 1994.



Take notice that on May 11, 1994, Florida Gas Transmission Company (FGT) tendered for filing to become part of its FERC
Gas Tariff, Third Revised Volume No. 1, the following tariff sheets, with an effective date of June 1, 1944:




Fourth Revised Sheet No. 8A

Third Revised Sheet No. 8B






FGT states that section 27 of the General Terms and Conditions of its FERC Gas Tariff, Third Revised Volume No. 1 Adjustment
to be effective each April 1 and October 1 and that such Charge shall be based on the actual fuel usage and lost and unaccounted
for gas and the volumes delivered during the six-month period commencing one year prior to the effective date of the
Adjustment. Section 27.A.2 provides that ``Transporter may at any time make a filing requesting a waiver of the stated
Effective Date(s) to make an out-of-cycle adjustment.'' Section 27.C further provides that FGT may adjust the Fuel
Reimbursement Charge for known and measurable changes.


FGT states that the instant filing lowers its Fuel Reimbursement Percentage from 3.14%, established in Docket No.
TM94-3-34-000 effective April 1, 1994, to 2.25% which more closely matches volumes retained by
FGT with actual operating data.




FGT is filing to make the attached tariff sheets reflecting the reduced Fuel Reimbursement Charge of 2.25% effective
June 1, 1994. Because FGT will receive nominations for June, 1994 on May 24 and customers must make nominations and
upstream supply arrangements including fuel, FGT requests that the Commission issue an order accepting the attached
tariff sheets by Monday, May 23, 1994. If an order is not issued by May 23 in time for June nominations, FGT requests that
the attached tariff sheets be made effective on July 1, 1994, so that beginning-of-month nominations can reflect
the revised Fuel Reimbursement Charge.




Any person desiring to be heard or to protest said filing should file a motion to intervene or protest with the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capital Street NE., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with   385.214
and 385.211 of the Commission's Rules and Regulations. All such motions or protests should be filed on or before May
20, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate actions to be taken, but will
not serve to make protestants parties to the proceedings. Any person wishing to become a party must file a motion to
intervene. Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection.

<DOCTITLE>Tennessee Gas Pipeline Co.; Application</DOCTITLE>


May 13, 1994



Take notice that on May 6, 1994, Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company (Tennessee), P.O. Box 2511, Houston, Texas 77252,
filed in Docket No. CP94-533-000 an application pursuant to section 7(b) of the Natural Gas Act for permission
and approval to abandon an undivided 30 percent interest or, alternatively, an undivided 100 percent interests in
its ``San Salvador System'' and its ``La Rosa/Mustang Island System'' from interstate commerce.

Tennessee proposes that the abandoned undivided 30 percent interest or, alternatively undivided 100 percent interest,
would be transferred to Tennessee's indirect intrastate pipeline subsidiary, Channel Industries Gas Company (``Channel'').
Tennessee states that the primary proposal to abandon and transfer an undivided 30 percent interest in these to Channel
is based on discussions with, and at the request of, its customer that currently utilize these facilities. Tennessee
proposes that Channel would operate all of the San Salvador and La Rosa/Mustang Island Systems under either the primary
30 percent or the alternative 100 percent transfer option.

Tennessee identifies the facilities that it proposes to abandon as follows: The ``San Salvador System,'' which comprises
all of Tennessee's facilities at and upstream of Station 1, is comprised of approximately 600 miles of various diameter
pipeline facilities. It includes Tennessee's Station 1 and the San Salvador Line, which runs from Agua Dulce, Texas,
south approximately 98 miles to the vicinity of Edinburg, Texas. The San Salvador line is comprised of a 26-inch diameter
pipeline and a looped 16-inch diameter pipeline. Appurtenant to the San Salvador Line are: a 12-inch diameter pipeline
53 miles in length running from Duval County, Texas west of Station 1; 1 24-inch diameter pipeline 20 miles in length
running south from Station 1 to Endinburg, Texas; five 12-inch diameter pipelines totalling 82 miles in length; and
approximately 200 miles of smaller diameter pipeline facilities that connect into the San Salvador Line at numerous
points in southern Texas. Tennessee states that there is no line compression on the San Salvador pipeline facilities
other than at Station 1.
The ``La Rosa/Mustang Island System'' interconnects with Tennessee's 100 Line approximately 42 miles downstream
of Station 1, and extends from that point in a southeasterly direction approximately six miles, where it crosses Channel's
``A-S Pipe Line.'' From this crossing, the La Rosa/Mustang Island System continues southward into Corpus Christi
Bay and Offshore Texas (in state waters). This system is comprised of: the ``La Rosa'' line, consisting of six miles
of 10-inch diameter pipeline in Refugio County, Texas; the ``La Rosa-Mustang Island'' line, a 12-inch diameter pipeline
32 miles in length from Refugio County south into San Patricio County, Texas and on into Corpus Christi Bay; and an additional
22 miles of smaller diameter pipelines that connect into the La Rosa and Mustang Island lines in Refugio County, San
Patricio County, and Offshore Texas.
Tennessee's primary proposal is to transfer a 30 percent undivided interest in its San Salvador/La Rosa facilities
to the capital of Channel at a net book value of approximately $5.2 million. Tennessee proposes, in the alternative,
to transfer 100 percent of its San Salvador/La Rosa facilities to the capital of Channel at a net book value of $17.2
million. This $17.2 million net book value represents approximately 1.3 percent of Tennessee's rate base.
Tennessee states that: (1) there will be no diminution in service to Tennessee's shippers; (2) Abandonment will increase
utilization of the San Salvador/La Rosa facilities and enhance competition; (3) Abandonment will improve aggregation
of supplies for Tennessee; and (4) The flexibility goals of the NGPA are better served.
Tennessee notes in its application that Channel's intrastate rates and operations are regulated by the Railroad
Commission of Texas, and that Channel also provides open-access transportation service in accordance with section
311(a)(2) of the NGPA pursuant to rates authorized by the Commission. Channel Industries Gas Co., 13 FERC  62,042
(1980). Tennessee states that the Commission would retain jurisdiction over the rates charged by Channel for transportation
on these facilities in interstate commerce pursuant to section 311 of the NGPA. Tennessee's proposals are set forth
more fully in its application, which is on file and available for inspection at the Commission.
Any person desiring to be heard or to make any protest with reference to said application should on or before June 3,
1994, file with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Washington, D.C. 20426, a motion to intervene or a protest
in accordance with the requirements of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.214 or 385.211)
and the Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.10). All protests filed with the Commission will be considered
by it in determining the appropriate action to be taken but will not serve to make the protestants parties to the proceeding.
Any person wishing to become a party to a proceeding or to participate as a party in any hearing therein must file a motion
to intervene in accordance with the Commission's Rules.
Take further notice that, pursuant to the authority contained in and subject to the jurisdiction conferred upon the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission by Sections 7 and 15 of the Natural Gas Act and the Commission's Rules of Practice
and Procedure, a hearing will be held without further notice before the Commission or its designee on this application
if no motion to intervene is filed within the time required herein, if the Commission on its own review of the matter
finds that permission and approval for the proposed abandonment are required by the public convenience and necessity.
If a motion for leave to intervene is timely filed, or if the Commission on its own motion believes that a formal hearing
is required, further notice of such hearing will be duly given.
Under the procedure herein provided for, unless otherwise advised, it will be unnecessary for Tennessee to appear
or be represented at the hearing.

<DOCTITLE>Texas Gas Transmission Corp.; Application</DOCTITLE>



May 13, 1994



Take notice that on May 9, 1994, Texas Gas Transmission Corporation (Texas Gas), P.O. Box 1160, Owensboro, Kentucky
42302, filed in Docket No. CP94-538-000 an application pursuant to section 7(b) of the Natural Gas Act
for permission and approval to abandon an exchange service between Texas Gas and Columbia Gulf Transmission Company
(Columbia Gulf), all as more fully set forth in the request which is on file with the Commission and open to public inspection.

Texas Gas states that on January 16, 1979, Texas Gas and Columbia Gulf received an order in Docket No. CP78-525-000
(Order) issuing to them a certificate of public convenience and necessity (6 FERC  61,038 (1979)) authorizing
the transportation of natural gas by Columbia Gulf and the exchange of gas by Texas Gas and Columbia Gulf under a transportation
and exchange agreement dated July 6, 1978 (Agreement). Under the Agreement, Columbia Gulf received for Texas Gas's
account, on a firm basis, up to 3,000 Mcf per day of gas purchased by Texas Gas at the Exxon Garden City Gas Plant (Plant)
in St. Mary Parish, Louisiana, through an existing interconnection between Columbia Gulf and the Plant and transported
such gas to Columbia Gulf's Rayne Compressor Station in Acadia Parish, Louisiana, it is stated. Columbia Gulf says
that it then retained such volumes, less a pro rata share of fuel and delivered by exchange equivalent quantities of
natural gas, less such pro rata share, to Texas Gas at an existing interconnection between Texas Gas and Columbia Gulf
in Egan Parish, Louisiana. 

Texas Gas further states that such Agreement was terminated by the parties effective January 16, 1991. By this application,
Texas Gas is requesting authority to terminate the exchange service performed by the parties under the Agreement.
Texas Gas states Columbia gulf has already filed to abandon such transportation and exchange service by an application
filed in Docket No. CP93-686-000, on August 27, 1993.

Any person desiring to be heard or to make any protest with reference to said application should on or before June 3,
1994, file with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20426, a motion to intervene or a protest
in accordance with the requirements of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.214 or 385.211)
and the Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.10). All protests filed with the Commission will be considered
by it in determining the appropriate action to be taken but will not serve to make the protestants parties to the proceeding.
Any person wishing to become a party to a proceeding or to participate as a party in any hearing therein must file a motion
to intervene in accordance with the Commission's Rules. 

Take further notice that, pursuant to the Authority contained in and subject to the jurisdiction conferred upon the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission by sections 7 and 15 of the Natural Gas Act and the Commission's Rules of Practice
and Procedure, a hearing will be held without further notice before the Commission or its designee on this application
if no motion to intervene is filed within the time required herein, if the Commission on its own review of the matter
finds that permission and approval for the proposed abandonment are required by the public convenience and necessity.
If a motion for leave to intervene is timely filed, or if the Commission on its own motion believes that a formal hearing
is required, further notice of such hearing will be duly given.

Under the procedure herein provided for, unless otherwise advised, it will be unnecessary for Texas Gas to appear
or be represented at the hearing.

 Notice.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 Notice is hereby given in accordance with the provision of Section 1413 of the Safe Drinking Water Act, as amended,
42 U.S.C. 300f 

et seq

., and 40 CFR part 142, subpart B, the National Primary Drinking Water Regulations (NPDWR), that the State of Wisconsin
is revising its approved Public Water System Supervision (PWSS) primacy program. The Wisconsin Department of Natural
Resources (WDNR), has adopted drinking water regulations for Lead and Copper, 26 synthetic organic chemicals (SOCs)
and 7 inorganic chemicals (IOCs), and 8 volatile organic contaminants (VOCs) that correspond to the NPDWR for Lead
and Copper, SOCs, IOCs, and VOCs, and promulgated by the US Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) on June 7, 1991
(56 FR 26460-26564), on January 30, 1991, (56 FR 3526-3597) and, as amended on July 1, 1991, (56 FR 30266-30281).
The USEPA has completed its review of Wisconsin's PWSS primacy program revision and has determined that these sets
of state program revisions are not less stringent than the corresponding Federal regulations.



The USEPA has determined that the Wisconsin rule revision meets the requirements of the Federal rule. Therefore,
the USEPA has determined that these sets of state program revisions are no less stringent than the corresponding Federal
regulations and is proposing to approve the WDNR's rule revision.

All interested parties are invited to submit written comments on these proposed determinations, and may request
a public hearing on or before June 20, 1994. If a public hearing is requested and granted, the corresponding determination
shall not become effective until such time following the hearing, at which the Regional Administrator issues an order
affirming or rescinding this action. Frivolous or insubstantial requests for a hearing may be denied by the Regional
Administrator.

Requests for public hearing should be addressed to: Melanie J. La Force (WD-17J), U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency, Region 5, 77 West Jackson Boulevard, Chicago, Illinois 60604.

Any request for a public hearing shall include the following: (1) The name, address, and telephone number of the individual,
organization, or other entity requesting a hearing. (2) A brief statement of the requesting person's interest in
the Regional Administrator's determinations and of information that the requesting person intends to submit at
such hearing. (3) The signature of the individual making the request; or, if the request is made on behalf of an organization
or other entity, the signature of a responsible official of the organization or other entity.

Notice of any hearing shall be given not less than fifteen (15) days prior to the time scheduled for the hearing. Such
notice will be made by the Regional Administrator in the 

Federal Register

 and in newspapers of general circulation in the State of Wisconsin. A notice will be sent to the person(s) requesting
the hearing as well as to the State of Wisconsin. The hearing notice will include a statement of purpose, information
regarding the time and location, and the address and telephone number where interested persons may obtain further
information. The Regional Administrator will issue an order affirming or rescinding his determination upon review
of the hearing record. Should the determination be affirmed, it will become effective as of the date of the order.

Should no timely and appropriate request for a hearing be received, and should the Regional Administrator not elect
to hold a hearing on his own motion, these determinations shall become effective on June 20, 1994. Please bring this
notice to the attention of any persons known by you to have an interest in these determinations.

<DOCTITLE>Change in Solicitation Procedures Under the Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
agency:

 Office of Acquisition Policy, GSA.





</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
action:

 Notice.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
summary:

 Title VII of the ``Business Opportunity Development Act of 1988'' (Public Law 100-656) established the Small
Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program and designated nine (9) agencies, including GSA, to conduct the
program over a four (4) year period from January 1, 1989 to December 31, 1992. The Small Business Opportunity Enhancement
Act of 1992 (Pub. L. 102-366) extended the demonstration program until September 1996 and made certain changes
in the procedures for operation of the demonstration program. The law designated four (4) industry groups for testing
whether the competitive capabilities of the specified industry groups will enable them to successfully compete
on an unrestricted basis. The four (4) industry groups are: Construction (except dredging); architectural and engineering
(A&E) services (including surveying and mapping); refuse systems and related services (limited to trash/garbage
collection); and non-nuclear ship repair. Under the program, when a participating agency misses its small business
participation goal, restricted competition is reinstituted only for those contracting activities that failed
to attain the goal. The small business goal is 40 percent of the total contract dollars awarded for construction, trash/garbage
collection services, and non-nuclear ship repair and 35 percent of the total contract dollars awarded for architect-engineer
services. This notice announces modifications to GSA's solicitation practices under the demonstration program
based on a review of the agency's performance during the period from April 1, 1993 to March 31, 1994. Modifications
to solicitation practices are outlined in the Supplementary Information section below and apply to solicitations
issued on or after July 1, 1994.





</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
supplementary information:

 Procedures of construction or trash/garbage collection with an estimated value of $25,000 or less will be reserved
for emerging small business concerns in accordance with the procedures outlined in the interim policy directive
issued by the Office of Federal Procurement Policy (58 FR 13513, March 11, 1993).



Procurements of construction or trash/garbage collection with an estimated value that exceeds $25,000 by GSA contacting
activities will be made in accordance with the following procedures: 



Construction Services in Groups 15, 16, and 17



Procurements for all construction services (except solicitations issued by GSA contracting activities in Regions
2, 3, 5, 7, 9, and 10 in Group 15) will be conducted on an unrestricted basis.

Procurements for construction services in Group 15 issued by GSA contracting activities in Regions 2, 3, 5, 7, 9, and

Children's Disability Research Issues

Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation, HHS.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Request for applications to conduct children's disability policy research issues.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Department wishes to conduct research to provide a clearer understanding of the policy issues pertaining to children's
disability. This project looks at children with disabilities in a cross-cutting way. Policy issues revolve around
a comprehensive set of services, including health care, education, and income supports. Little information on children
with disabilities exists at the national level and even less is known about the use, cost, and impact of services for
these children. This project is intended to foster new policy research by encouraging the use of smaller data sets
from states, local areas, or facilities in order to address our policy concerns. We estimate that the scope and level
of effort will require from 12 to 17 months to accomplish. A total of $600,000 is available for awards in the $50,000
to $100,000 range. (See part V.E.4).



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
Part I. Background


Approximately 4.5 million or one in fifteen children under the age of 18 have a disability. The sizable number of children
with disabilities is a result of many factors, including rising life expectancies during the entire century, advances
in neonatal care and medical technology, and improvements in treatment for chronic diseases, many of which were previously
fatal. Children with disabilities are living longer, typically well into adulthood.
Over the past two decades, children with a wide range of disabilities, chronic conditions and illnesses have increasingly
become part of regular family and community life. A patchwork of public programs have been enacted to provide families
with a range of supports to keep their young members with disabilities at home (rather than in hospitals, institutions
or other residential settings), send them to local schools with non-disabled peers, and foster their participation
in typical community services and programs.
Administration of these public programs is spread among different Federal Departments and different agencies within
those Departments. Most public programs are found in either the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) or
in the Department of Education (DEd). DHHS public programs providing such support include: Supplemental Security
Income (SSI), which provides income support for children who are blind or disabled, Medicaid, especially through
the Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnosis and Treatment (EPSDT) benefit, and also certain Medicaid state plan
services such as rehabilitation and therapies, home and community based waivers, and ``TERFA 134'' or other eligibility
options that serve children whose families have incomes over the poverty level; and the Title V Maternal and Child
Health Block Grants, which enable states to plan, promote, coordinate, and evaluate health care for mothers and children
and provide health services to those individuals who do not have access to adequate health care. The major DEd program
is the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), originally authorized in 1975 as the Education for all
Handicapped Children's Act, which mandated that public schools provide a ``free appropriate education in the least
restrictive environment'' for all eligible children with disabilities. IDEA also provides early intervention
and preschool programs for children who have a disability, or are at risk of developing one.
More children with disabilities are participating in these public programs, due to both epidemiological factors
(higher survival rates) and to more generous programmatic definitions of disability. Advocates for children with
disabilities have won significant court decisions resulting in broader definitions of disability and more generous
benefits. A case in point is the 1990 Supreme Court decision 

Zebley 

v 

Sullivan,

 which broadened the definition of disability for the SSI program.
Growing program rolls and increasing costs give rise to a number of policy issues. The lack of data on disability among
children, as well as on their service use and costs complicates analysis of policy options. For example:

<DOCNO> FR940719-2-00082 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940719-2-00052 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

 There is widespread concern within the disability community and among families of children with disabilities
that coverage is inadequate for long term rehabilitation, skilled nursing, and home care services under virtually
all health care reform proposals. Yet little information exists on the potential demand for and cost-effectiveness
of such services for children with disabilities.
 The number of children receiving SSI doubled from nearly 300 thousand in 1989 to over 770 thousand in 1993. The
1990 

Zebley

 v. 

Sullivan

 Supreme Court decision, which invalidated the use of a medical ``listings only'' approach and replaced it with individualized
functional assessments, contributed to some, but not all growth in SSI. There is considerable concern about the size
of the potential pool of children who may qualify for SSI benefits in the future and how much SSI expenditures are likely
to grow as a result.
 Private health insurers increasingly attempt to control costs by offering managed care plans. Families of
children with disabilities and their advocates argue that managed care plans are inadequate for onging, chronic
health-related problems associated with disability and chronic illness.
 Both school systems and Medicaid agencies have responsibility to provide services for children with disabilities.
As school systems become increasingly strapped for funds to meet the entitlement requirements of Federal special
education law, they have incentives to bill Medicaid for health related services; Federal Medicaid cost sharing
is much higher than Federal special education funding. The implications of such billing practices on the lives of
children and on Federal and state budgets need to be examined.



In light of these trends and policy issues, the primary goal of the proposed research is to develop a clearer understanding
of children's disability. Available data on persons with disabilities, particularly that found in national data
sets, pertain primarily to adults. It is anticipated that this understanding will give policy makers information
on which to base prudent statutory, regulatory, and funding decisions pertinent to current programs as well as regarding
health care and welfare reform.
Potential users of the research include Federal and State officials involved in disability, health care, income
security, and educational policy, program development, program administration, and financing affecting children
with disabilities. Additionally, research findings may be used by hospital and facility administrators, school
administrators, service providers, home health agencies, rehabilitation agencies, and the insurance industry.


Part II_Required Research Issue Areas


Research conducted under grants awarded through this announcement will advance the state of knowledge regarding
children with disabilities in the following issue areas: (A) Definitions and measurement; (B) demographic and socio-economic
characteristics; (C) service use, expenditures, and effectiveness; (D) private cost of care; (E) financing of services
and supports; and (F) system organization. However, these questions are intended merely as illustrations. Applicants
may propose other questions related to the issue areas. These issue areas may be combined and other areas may be proposed
if they are clearly demonstrated to be relevant to policies regarding children with disabilities.
We encourage secondary data analysis. Given the dearth of national data, the applicant is encouraged to select information
from states, school systems, clinical-level data, or other available data sets, which could contain the relevant
analytic variables. Other methodologies may be appropriate.
The following sections list the kinds of questions envisioned under each of the above issue areas.

<TEXT>
 

A. Definitions and Measurement 



There is no consensus on how disability among children should be defined and measured for purposes of determining
prevalence in the population or for establishing eligibility for disability-related benefits and services. For
example, studies might address these questions: What are the research and programmatic implications of alternative
disability definitions and measures (including functional definitions, such as those used for adults) for different
policy purposes? How should such measures treat the different developmental stages of children from infancy through
adolescence? What is the estimated impact of using alternative definitions of eligibility on program participation
under cash assistance programs (e.g., SSI), health-related programs (e.g., Medicaid), education programs (e.g.
Parts B and H), or other Federal disability programs? 



B. Demographic and Socio-Economic Characteristics 



National survey data have yielded little information on the prevalence of disability among children, particularly
as it may signal a need for benefits or services. Within this issue area, the following types of questions are pertinent:
What trends characterize disability in children at various developmental stages? Is disability in children likely
to increase or decrease over the next 10 years, 20 years and beyond? To what extent are socio-economic, racial, or ethnic
factors predictors of disability and or the impact of disability on the child and his or her family? 

How does disability status change during the course of childhood? What are the rates of such change? Does disability
status change when children become adults? What are potential implications for program eligibility and service
use? 



C. Service Use, Expenditures, and Effectiveness 
 


A principal policy concern of government at all levels is the effective and efficient allocation of resources to maximize
the quality of life and potential of children with disabilities. Little information is available however on what
services children with disabilities need or use, how much they cost, and on their effectiveness. For example: What
patterns of acute care; transitional, rehabilitative, and supportive service use and expenditures characterize
children with disabilities at different stages of their development? How do service use and expenditure patterns
vary by condition and type of disability, level of functioning, socio-economic status, family structure, insurance
coverage, service availability, and program participation? 

What outcome measures are useful for evaluating short- or long-term cost-effectiveness of health, education, and
supportive services for children with disabilities? What is the evidence regarding the cost-effectiveness of service
interventions (health related, educational, and supportive services) on outcomes for children with disabilities?
How does this vary according to the stages of a child's development, by condition, level of functioning, socio-economic
status, by disability? 



D. Private Costs of Care



A major policy concern is the level of out-of-pocket costs incurred by families to raise children with disabilities
as compared to children without disabilities. Some evidence suggests that costs can vary greatly for children with
identical diagnoses depending on families' living situations, the severity of the disability, and whether a child
is institutionalized or receiving care at home. 

The following types of questions are illustrative: What are the extra out-of-pocket costs associated with raising
children with disabilities relative to the costs of care for children without disabilities, i.e., child care, respite
care, transportation, supplementary educational services, physical accommodations and assistive technology,
specialized equipment, home care, therapeutic services, general supplementary services, medical and pharmaceutical
expenses, and the opportunity costs of reduced parental labor force participation? Are there other private costs?


How do estimated costs vary by the following classifications: Type of disability; severity of disability; family
income; age, gender, race; institutionalization vs. non-institutionalization; SSI/non-SSI participation;
coverage by Medicaid, private health insurance, or no insurance. What are the cost differences for children with
disabilities on SSI, children with disabilities not on SSI, and children without disabilities? 

What are estimated total per capita costs including both private and public expenditures?

E. Financing of Services and Supports



Over the past 20 years there have been significant changes in the breadth and scope of public financing for services
to children with disabilities and their families. Although to a lesser extent, a private sector health insurance
role has also evolved. Insufficient attention has been focused on the impact of these changes, either from the perspective
of their impact on the lives of children with disabilities and their families, or with respect to the development of
a comprehensive and coordinated policy regarding disabled children. For example:



Private Health Insurance



What services are covered by private insurance plans? What are the limitations of private insurance coverage for
special services such as physical, occupational, speech/language/hearing, and respiratory therapies, psychotherapies,
other services, and durable or disposable goods? What are identifiable trends in private and public coverage and
expenditures for rehabilitative services? How do insurers apply the criterion of ``medical necessity'' to the use
of rehabilitative and therapy services by children with disabilities? What are alternative criteria?

What approaches are used for risk adjustment for children with disabilities? How effective are they?



Medicaid/Title V



What services are covered under which service authorities? Exactly what services are provided and billed under EPSDT;
what are trends in EPSDT expenditures? What has been the impact of the TEFRA-134 (``Katie Beckett'') state plan
eligibility option in states that have elected to use it; how do states control utilization and costs? What children
receive special services through 1915(c) waivers; how do coverage and costs vary across states? What services do
Title V agencies fund; what are inter-state variations in coverage and cost?



Educational Services



What special services do school systems currently provide for children with disabilities (including services for
the transition from school to work), where are these services provided, and how do services vary by age and type of disability?
What are trends in total expenditures?

What are trends in children receiving education services who are also eligible for SSI or Medicaid? How and to what
extent are school systems billing Medicaid for IDEA services to children with disabilities, and under which authorities?
What is the relationship between special education services, including parts B and H, and Medicaid? What trends can
be anticipated in this relationship?



Program Interactions



How do these programs/coverages interact, co-exist, or affect each other? What other public (state or substate)
programs assist children with disabilities and their families including cash or voucher benefits?



Cash Assistance Versus Service Benefits



Children with disabilities and their families receive assistance in very different ways: Through cash assistance
like AFDC and SSI and service benefits like Medicaid and IDEA. How do these methods differentially affect families?
What are the trade-offs of providing cash in lieu of services or vice versa?



F. System Organization



Multiple funding sources and types of services create problems with accessing services as well as with managing their
delivery and cost. Little is known about how families with children who are disabled deal with service systems and
how states and localities have attempted to organize, integrate, and manage disparate services.

How do children with disabilities and their families access services? How does entry via one system (e.g. school,
Medicaid, acute medical care) predict access to services in other systems?

How cost-effective are various approaches to case management used by children with disabilities (or subgroups)
and their families, including families doing their own case management?

What approaches have been proposed or tried to integrate acute and long-term care for children with disabilities?
What features must be present in an integrated approach?

What are the impacts of varying approaches to managed care and of state Medicaid reform efforts and other state health
reform initiatives on children with disabilities? What other systems have been put together by states, localities,
or private sector entities to serve children with disabilities in a comprehensive manner? What are their outcomes
and costs?

programs; to elicit the cooperation and coordination of other national, public, private, and voluntary agencies
in promoting public health programs; to improve communications and coordination among public information officers
at State health agencies; and to provide a forum for continuing education opportunities in public health communications,
in particular, communications with and through the news media. Approximately $115,000 will be available in FY 1994
to support this project for a 12-month budget period within a project period of up to 5 years. Funding estimates may
vary and are subject to change. Continuation awards within the project period will be made on the basis of satisfactory
progress and availability of funds. 

The purpose of this cooperative agreement is to:

(1) Enrich and improve public health programs;

(2) Identify methods to improve the quality and process of communication among members, CDC, and other Public Health
Service agencies;

(3) Elicit the cooperation and coordination of other national, public, private, and voluntary agencies in promoting
public health programs; and

(4) Provide a forum for continuing education opportunities in public health communications. 

CDC will:

(1) Provide technical assistance and consultation in the area of program development and implementation;

(2) Assist in the support of an annual conference for State, regional, and national exchange of public health information;

(3) Assist NPHIC in the selection and performance of proposed project activities;

Notice. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) proposes to disapprove a new drug application (NDA) for Deprenyl (deprenyl
citrate or deprenyl), submitted by Discovery Experimental and Development, Inc., 29949 S.R. 54 West, Wesley Chapel,
FL 33543 (Discovery). FDA is also providing Discovery notice of an opportunity for a hearing on the proposal. The grounds
for FDA's proposed refusal to approve are numerous. Most importantly, FDA concludes that there is insufficient information
to determine whether Discovery's deprenyl citrate is safe for use or will have the effect it purports or is represented
to have under the conditions of use prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the proposed labeling. Discovery's
deprenyl citrate is intended for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:


I. Background


Discovery has submitted an NDA for deprenyl citrate with proposed labeling for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
Throughout most of this document, the drug product is referred to as deprenyl citrate or deprenyl. Occasionally,
especially when referring to the active drug substance, the term selegiline is used to be consistent with terms and
claims made in the NDA. An NDA for another deprenyl product, selegiline hydrochloride (Eldepryl

 

) held by Somerset Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Somerset), was approved on June 5, 1989, for the treatment of Parkinson's
disease. The Somerset product, l-deprenyl, is the levorotatory acetylenic derivative of phenethylamine. Discovery
claims that there are: 


``four distinct functions of deprenyl in helping curb or delay the effects of Alzheimer's disease, and could very
well delay the onset of disease, if taken as a preventative.
Function 1. Deprenyl causes the body to naturally produce more dopamine, which normally depletes with age, which,
in turn, assists in maintaining healthy brain cells.
Function 2. Deprenyl blocks toxic free radicals from breaking down dopamine, which causes further degeneration
of brain cells.
Function 3. Deprenyl revives malfunctioning and dormant brain cells, bringing back lost body functions.
Function 4. Deprenyl increases the body's hormone content, which improves the body's motorability and the immune
system * * *.''


On November 29, 1991, Discovery submitted NDA 20-242 with data and information intended to demonstrate deprenyl
citrate's safety and effectiveness in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease and proposed that the product be marketed
without prescription. Discovery submitted a minor amendment on December 6, 1991, providing an updated table of contents
and some revised pages in the NDA.
On January 17, 1992, FDA notified Discovery by letter that the NDA was not acceptable for filing under 21 CFR 314.101
because the NDA was not sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review. FDA described numerous deficiencies
in an attachment to the letter. 
In response to FDA's refusal to file, Discovery requested an informal conference with FDA, and this was held on November
16, 1992. In a letter to Discovery dated November 24, 1992, FDA notified Discovery of its option to amend its application
under 21 CFR 314.101(a)(3) and file it over protest, and Discovery did this on December 7, 1992.
In a letter dated December 31, 1992, FDA acknowledged Discovery's request to file over protest and stated that the
application would be reviewed as filed. (In a letter dated February 9, 1993, Discovery objected to the advice given
in FDA's letters of November 24, and December 31, 1992, that an NDA filed over protest may not be amended once filed.)
In a letter to Discovery dated August 20, 1993, FDA concluded that the information presented by Discovery was inadequate
and that the application was not approvable (21 CFR 314.120). Discovery responded with a letter dated September 1,
1993, requesting a time extension of 180 days, under 21 CFR 314.120(a)(5), to consider its options regarding its application.
FDA granted this request. In a letter dated March 1, 1994, and received by FDA March 7, 1994, Discovery requested the
opportunity for a hearing under 21 CFR 314.120(a)(3) on the question of whether there are grounds for denying approval
of NDA 20-242. 


II. The Deficiencies in NDA 20-242


Discovery is required to submit, among other things, ``full reports of investigations which have been made to show
whether or not such drug is safe for use and whether such drug is effective in use,'' under section 505(b)(1) of the Federal
Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) (21 U.S.C. 355(b)(1)), as well as all information required under 21 CFR 314.50.

Discovery's NDA 20-242 provides insufficient information to determine whether Deprenyl gelatin capsules
and liquid are safe, and fails to include adequate tests by all methods reasonably applicable to show whether or not
Deprenyl gelatin capsules and liquid are safe; the NDA lacks substantial evidence that Deprenyl gelatin capsules
and liquid will have the effect they are represented to have; and the methods used in, and facilities and controls used
for, the manufacture, processing, and packing of Deprenyl gelatin capsules and liquid are inadequate to preserve
their identity, strength, quality, and purity (section 505(d) of the act). In addition, Discovery's NDA 20-242
fails to include an adequate environmental assessment, fails to include proper labeling and bioavailability data,
and fails to demonstrate compliance with current good manufacturing practice regulations. A detailed description
of these deficiencies follows.


A. The Safety of Deprenyl


Under section 505(d) of the act and 21 CFR 314.125(b)(2) and (b)(4), Discovery fails to include in NDA 20-242
adequate tests by all methods reasonably applicable to show whether or not Deprenyl gelatin capsules and liquid are
safe for use under the conditions prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the proposed labeling, and sufficient
information about Deprenyl gelatin capsules and liquid to determine whether they are safe for use under the conditions
prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the proposed labeling. 


1. Preclinical Data


Discovery fails to include either reports of the complete range of studies necessary to assess the pharmacological
and toxicological profile of the drug (21 CFR 314.50(d)) or clinical data to obviate the need for such studies.
Discovery fails to include any of the required toxicology studies such as: (1) Acute and subacute studies in rodents
and nonrodents, (2) chronic studies consisting of a 6-month rodent and a 12-month nonrodent study, (3) a genotoxicity
screen, 
(4) studies that examine the effects of the drug on reproduction, and (5) carcinogenicity studies (21 CFR 314.50(d)(2)).
Examples of the types of material FDA would review are described in ``Guideline for the Format and Content of the Nonclinical/
Pharmacology/Toxicology Section of an Application.''


2. Clinical Data


As noted above, selegiline hydrochloride (l-deprenyl) is currently being marketed as Eldepryl

 

 by Somerset for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. The exclusivity period for this application expires on June
6, 1994. FDA could only review NDA 20-242 as an application submitted under section 505(b)(1) of the act because
until the exclusivity period of Eldepryl

 

 expires, no application submitted under section 505(b)(2) or section 505(j) of the act which refers to Eldepryl

 

 can be approved. 
In NDA 20-242, Discovery attempts to use the previous approval of Somerset's selegiline hydrochloride product
as evidence of the safety of its deprenyl citrate product. The mere fact of approval may not, however, be used in this
way. Section 505(b)(1) of the act requires that Discovery submit full reports of investigations that have been made
to show its product is safe. Safety studies of Eldepryl

 

 are not available to Discovery for use in satisfying this requirement. Moreover, if Discovery's claims that Deprenyl
is ``purer, more potent and more effective'' than Eldepryl

 

 are true, such differences could reflect, among other things, increased absorption or rate of absorption, with increased
concentration in, or rate of transmission of the drug into the brain, and a greater potential for adverse events. In
NDA 20-242, no safety study was performed using Discovery's product and there was no study comparing the bioavailability
of Discovery's product to Eldepryl

 

. Accordingly, FDA cannot assess its safety.


B. The Effectiveness of Deprenyl 


Under section 505(d) of the act and 21 CFR 314.125(b)(5), Discovery has failed to provide in NDA 20-242 substantial
evidence, consisting of adequate and well-controlled studies, that Deprenyl gelatin capsules and liquid will have
the effect they are represented to have under the conditions of use prescribed, recommended, or suggested in their
proposed labeling.
The proposed labeling in Discovery's application claims that deprenyl citrate demonstrates a ``quantitative and
qualitative improvement in cognitive functions of Alzheimer's patients as a result of the inhibition of MAO-B
activity.'' To support this claim, Discovery includes reprints from 171 articles in the medical and scientific literature.
Although some of these articles pertain to deprenyl, not one study used Discovery's product or a product with a known
bioavailability relationship to Discovery's product.
Discovery identified 12 of these 171 articles as evidence of the effectiveness of deprenyl citrate in the treatment
of Alzheimer's disease. This notice discusses the first of these articles in greater detail than the others because
it has many characteristics of a well-controlled study and, if the report submitted were supplemented with additional
information, it might qualify as an adequate and well-controlled study supporting the effectiveness of a deprenyl
drug product in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. The remaining 11 studies are inherently incapable of being
regarded as substantial evidence of the effectiveness of deprenyl citrate in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease;
these are therefore summarized only briefly below. 
1. Mangoni, A., et al., ``Effects of a MAO-B Inhibitor in the Treatment of Alzheimer Disease,'' 

European Neurology

, 31:100-107, 1991.
i. 

Design

. One hundred thirty-six patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer-type disorders were enrolled in a 3-month randomized,
double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. They were evaluated at baseline and months 1, 2, and 3. Of the enrolled patients,
17 dropped out following randomization and before the first effectiveness assessment (the article does not report
the number from each group, but if original randomization created two groups of approximately equal size, i.e., 68
in each group, then, based on the number remaining in each group at the end of the study, virtually all 17 drop-outs would
seem to have been from the placebo group). Seven more (three on deprenyl and four on placebo) did not complete 3 months
of therapy. No explanation is given for the 17 early drop-outs or for the apparent imbalance in them. The seven later
patients were discontinued for poor efficacy (two deprenyl patients, four placebo patients) or poor compliance
(one deprenyl patient). There was thus an imbalance in the number of patients treated and analyzed: 65 L-deprenyl
(10 milligrams per day) and 47 placebo patients were included in the final analysis of effectiveness.
Effectiveness measurements were conducted in the following prefixed sequence: (1) Blessed's Dementia Scale, (2)
digit span (Wechsler Memory Scale (WMS)), (3) Raskin and Crook's Inventory of Psychic and Somatic Complaints for
the Elderly, (4) short story (WMS)_immediate recall, (5) simple copy of drawings, (6) Toulouse-Pieron attention
test, (7) facilitated copy of drawings, (8) short story (WMS)_delayed recall, and (9) word fluency. Measurements
were taken at baseline, and at the end of the first second, and third months. 
ii. 

Results

. Based on an analysis of variance between treatments including all four test occasions, statistically significant
differences are reported favoring L-deprenyl over placebo on all measurements except one portion of the Toulouse-Pieron
attention test.
iii. 

Discussion

. Taken at face value, the results in this published study suggest a positive effect of L-deprenyl in patients with
Alzheimer's disease. However, the published report lacks many of the details needed to assess a study. Thus, this
study, as published and without additional information, cannot contribute to fulfilling the statutory requirement
for substantial evidence of effectiveness:
(a) Discovery has failed to provide data from a bioequivalence study demonstrating that the rate and extent of absorption
of its product is essentially identical to the product manufactured by Chiesi Farmaceutici S.p.A. (Parma, Italy)
used in the Mangoni study (21 CFR 320.21 and 314.126(d)).
(b) No protocol is available for review to determine if the design and analysis, including analysis of patients not
completing the study, were performed as proposed (21 CFR 314.50 and 314.126(b)(1)).
(c) Measures and specific procedures to minimize bias (e.g., details of randomization, blinding, maintenance of
patient assignment code) are not described, and no explanation for the large imbalance in initial dropouts is given
(21 CFR 314.126(b)(5)).
(d) Case report forms or data tabulations, and individual patient data on safety and effectiveness measures are not
provided (21 CFR 314.50 and 314.126(a)).

with (-) Deprenyl,'' 

Life Sciences

, 45:525-531, 1989. This study is not an adequate and well-controlled clinical study of the effectiveness of
deprenyl citrate in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease; it is a study in rats, not a clinical study (21 U.S.C. 355(d);
see 21 CFR 314.126, 

passim

). 
3. Heinonen, E. H., et al., ``Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism of Selegiline,'' 

Acta Neurologica Scandinavia

, 126:93-99, 1989. This study is not an adequate and well-controlled clinical study of the effectiveness of
deprenyl citrate in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease; the clear objective of this study was to study the pharmacokinetics,
not the effectiveness, of selegiline (deprenyl) (21 U.S.C. 355(d); see 21 CFR 314.126, 

passim

).

Parkinson's Disease,'' 

The New England Journal of Medicine

, 321:1364-1370, 1992. This study is not an adequate and well-controlled clinical study of the effectiveness
of deprenyl citrate in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease; it was a study of Parkinson's, not Alzheimer's, disease
(see, e.g., 21 CFR 314.126(b)(6)).
5.Tariot, P. N., et al., ``Cognitive Effects of L-Deprenyl in Alzheimer's Disease,'' 

Psychopharmacology

, 91:489-495, 1987. This allegedly double-blind study in 17 patients is not an adequate and well-controlled
clinical study of the effectiveness of deprenyl citrate in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. There is no protocol
available to provide details (21 CFR 314.126(b)(1)). Despite the lack of a protocol, it is clear that the study did
not use a randomized concurrent control (21 CFR 314.126(b)(2)) or other means of assuring comparability of treatment
and control groups (21 CFR 314.126(b)(3)). Procedures to minimize bias, such as blinding are not described (21 CFR
314.126(b)(5)), and the test drug is not identified (21 CFR 314.126(d)).

7. Tariot, P. N., et al., ``Tranylcypromine Compared with L-Deprenyl in Alzheimer's Disease,'' 

Journal of Clinical Psycho-pharmacology

, 8:23-27, 1988. This seven-patient study is not an adequate and well-controlled clinical study of the effectiveness
of deprenyl citrate in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease; its primary purpose was to investigate tranylcypromine,
a drug of unknown effectiveness in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (see, e.g., 21 CFR 314.126(b)(2)(iv)).
8. Sunderland, T., et al., ``Dose-Dependent Effects of Deprenyl on CSF Monoamine Metabolites in Patients with Alzheimer's
Disease,''

, 91:293-296, 1987. This study is not an adequate and well-controlled clinical study of the effectiveness of
deprenyl citrate in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease; the clear objective of this study was to study the pharmacokinetics,
not the effectiveness, of deprenyl (21 U.S.C. 355(d); see 21 CFR 314.126, 

passim

).

of deprenyl citrate in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease; its primary purpose was the study of the effects in certain
tissues of hydrogen peroxide, not deprenyl citrate, and it is not a clinical study, i.e., a study in human patients
with the disease intended to be treated (21 U.S.C. 355(d); see 21 CFR 314.126,

does not even mention deprenyl or selegiline (21 U.S.C. 355(d); see 21 CFR 314.126,

of deprenyl citrate in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease because it is not the report of an investigation (21 U.S.C.
355(d); see 21 CFR 314.126, 

passim

).
12. Martini, E., et al., ``Brief Information an Early Phase-II-Study with Deprenyl in Demented Patients,''

of the effectiveness of deprenyl citrate in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease because, 

inter alia

, it is not the report of an investigation that permits a valid comparison with a control (21 CFR 314.126(b)(2)). 


C. Methods, Facilities, and Controls used by Discovery


Discovery's application is not approvable under section 505(d) of the act and 21 CFR 314.125(b)(1). The methods to
be used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the manufacture, processing, packing, and holding of the drug
substance and the drug product are inadequate to preserve its identity, strength, quality, purity, stability, and
bioavailability.


1. Drug Substance 


The application fails to contain adequate information concerning the methods used in the synthesis, extraction,
isolation, or purification of the new drug substance to determine its identity, strength, quality, and purity. The
many items of information required under 21 CFR 314.50(d)(1) that are absent from NDA 20-242 include, but are
not limited to, the following:
i. A full description of the physical and chemical characteristics of the drug substance, including adequate proof
of structure and stereochemistry. This characterization should be for the selegiline base and citrate (claimed
by the applicant to be a unique drug substance), and should include elemental analysis, infra-red spectroscopy,
ultraviolet spectroscopy, 1H and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (suitable to determine characterization from
coupling, peak positions, and peak patterns), a specific identity test for citrate and a suitable study to demonstrate
that a 1:1 citrate salt has actually been formed. Examples of the types of material FDA would review are described in
``Guideline for Submitting Supporting Documentation in Drug Applications for the Manufacture of Drug Substances,''
pp. 3-5. In addition, the NDA does not include all physical data for the selegiline citrate and a certificate
of analysis with completed tests for all proposed specifications. Examples of the types of material FDA would review
are described in ``Guideline for Submitting Samples and Analytical Data for Methods Validation,'' p. 5.
ii. An adequate description of the method of synthesis. The application lacks manufacturing procedures or master
batch formulas with quantities. Examples of the types of material FDA would review are described in ``Guideline for
Submitting Supporting Documentation in Drug Applications for the Manufacture of Drug Substances,'' e.g., pp. 11-18.
Discovery's argument that its manufacture of the selegiline base was a patented process that expired in 1985 does
not obviate the need for Discovery to submit complete manufacturing information. This information is required regardless
of whether or not the patent expired.
iii. A list of in-process controls describing the methods used to determine the completion of each reaction. Examples
of the types of material FDA would review are described in ``Guideline for Submitting Supporting Documentation in
Drug Applications for the Manufacture of Drug Substances,'' pp. 29-36.
iv. A description of the reagents, solvents, and materials used in the synthesis of the drug substance. Examples of
the types of material FDA would review are described in ``Guideline for Submitting Supporting Documentation in Drug
Applications for the Manufacture of Drug Substances,'' p. 10.
v. A description of the container closure system for storage and shipping of the drug substance. The application does
not provide the name of the manufacturer for each component or a letter of authorization to the manufacturer's drug
master file. Examples of the types of material FDA would review are described in ``Guideline for the Format and Content
of the Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Section of an Application,'' pp. 4-5. See also, 21 CFR 314.420(b).



2. Drug Product


i. 

Components, composition, and formulation

. The application does not identify by established name, if any, or complete chemical name, each of the substances
used as components of the drug product including each substance used in the synthesis, extraction, or other method
of preparation of the new drug substance. The specific areas of information pertaining to drug product components,
composition, and formulation required by 21 CFR 314.50(d)(1)(ii) that are absent from NDA 20-242 include the
following: (1) A list of all components used in the manufacture of the drug product, (2) a statement of the composition
of the drug product, and (3) a statement of the specifications and analytical methods for each component.
It is even unclear from the application what dosage form Discovery intends to manufacture. Tests absent from the application
include a specific identity test, a chiral identity test, a chiral purity test, an assay for the drug substance, and
a dissolution test. Such tests are necessary to permit FDA to make an assessment of the drug product.
ii. 

Drug product manufacture

. The application fails to contain a description of the manufacturing and packaging procedure and in-process control
for the drug product. Also absent is the method of sampling for quality assurance. (21 CFR 314.50(d)(1)(ii)). Examples
of the types of material FDA would review are described in ``Guideline for Submitting Documentation for the Manufacture
of and Controls for Drug Products,'' pp. 
4-7.
iii. 

Drug product laboratory methods

. The application fails to include specifications and analytical methods as are necessary to assure identity, strength,
quality, and purity of the drug product (21 CFR 314.50(d)(1)(ii)), and in particular fails to include a full description
of the laboratory methods that will be used to check each lot of the finished drug product. Sampling methods, procedures,
and a rationale for the sampling plan are not provided, and the regulatory specifications and test methods for the
drug product are also not provided. Examples of the types of material FDA would review are described in ``Guideline
for Submitting Documentation for the Manufacture of and Controls for Drug Products,'' pp. 
7-8.
iv. 

Drug product container system, packaging, and controls

. The application fails to provide adequate information with respect to the characteristics of, and the test methods
employed for, the container, closure, or other component parts of the drug package to assure their suitability for
the intended use. A description of the packaging procedures and in-process controls for the drug product are not included,
and the container/closure system used for the drug product is not even described (21 CFR 314.50(d)(1)(ii)). Examples
of the types of material FDA would review are described in ``Guideline for Submitting Documentation for Packaging
for Human Drugs and Biologics.''


3. Methods Validation


Discovery's application fails to include adequate laboratory test procedures to assure that the finished drug product
(or drug substance) conforms to appropriate standards of identity, strength, quality, and purity. Validations
of the test methods were not performed. Actual samples and full information pertaining to the samples were not submitted
to the NDA at the time of application (21 CFR 314.50(d)(1)(i) and (ii). Examples of the types of material FDA would review
are described in ``Guideline for Submitting Samples and Analytical data for Methods Validation.'' 


4. Reference Standard


The application lacks information about the reference standard and a sample of this standard for the active ingredient,
claimed to be selegiline citrate or selegiline base. It is necessary that the physical and chemical properties of
the reference standard be described to ensure its integrity to serve as such (21 CFR 314.50(e)(1)(i)(c)). Examples
of the types of material FDA would review are described in ``Guideline for Submitting Samples and Analytical Data
for Methods Validation,'' p. 6.)


5. Stability


The application fails to include a full description of, and data derived from, studies of the stability of the drug.
The stability of the drug product is not demonstrated in the container closure system proposed for use (21 CFR 314.50(d)(1)(ii);
see also 21 CFR 211.166.) Examples of the types of material FDA would review are described in ``Guideline for Submitting
Documentation for the Stability of Human Drugs and Biologics.''


6. Establishment Locations


The application fails to identify and show the location of each establishment conducting a part of the manufacturing,
processing, packaging, and labeling operations (21 CFR 314.50(d)(1)(i) and (d)(1)(ii)). Examples of the types
of material FDA would review are described in ``Guideline for Submitting Documentation for the Manufacture of and
Controls for Drug Products,'' p. 4. The application lacks a clear delineation of the operations that will be performed
by persons other than Discovery. For example, the contract facility used for encapsulation of the drug substance
solution is not identified in the submission.


7. Environmental Assessment


A complete and satisfactory environmental assessment is required under 21 CFR 25.22(a)(14) and 314.50(d)(1)(iii),
and failure to submit an adequate environmental assessment is grounds for FDA's refusal to approve an NDA (21 CFR 25.22(b)).
An NDA must contain either a claim for categorical exclusion under 21 CFR 25.24 or an environmental assessment under
21 CFR 25.31a. Discovery's environmental assessment was not a claim for exclusion, and consisted of a one paragraph
statement that is facially unresponsive to the requirements of 21 CFR 25.31a. For example, the environmental assessment
in NDA 20-242 does not provide an identification of chemical substances that are the subject of the proposed
action.


D. The Labeling of Deprenyl


The application is not approvable under section 505(d) of the act, as well as 21 CFR 314.125(b)(8), because the proposed
labeling does not comply with requirements for labels and labeling set forth in 21 CFR Part 201 and 21 CFR 314.50. The
proposed labeling fails to meet the statutory and regulatory requirements in numerous ways, including, but not limited
to, the following:
1. Labeling to be used for the packaged drug product is not provided in the application (21 CFR 314.50(e)(2)(ii)).

2. Labeling to be used for shipment and storage of the bulk drug substance (see 21 CFR 201.122), as well as all labeling
required to demonstrate compliance with current good manufacturing practice (CGMP) regulations (see, e.g., 21
CFR 211.122), are not provided in the application.
3. The proprietary name or designation of the drug product is not properly accompanied by the proper established name
of the drug substance in the label or labeling of the drug product (21 CFR 201.10(g)(1)). Furthermore, the name ``deprenyl''
(as the base, hydrochloride, or citrate salt) is not acceptable as the established name of the drug (see 21 CFR 299.4).



E. The Bioavailability or Bioequivalence of Deprenyl


The application is not approvable under section 505(d) of the act and 21 CFR 314.125(b)(9) because it does not contain
bioavailability or bioequivalence data required under 21 CFR part 320. The application must contain either of the
following: (1) Evidence demonstrating the in vivo bioavailability of the drug product or (2) information which would
permit the agency to waive demonstration of in vivo bioavailability. Discovery submitted neither and therefore
has not fulfilled the requirements for the human pharmacokinetics and bioavailability section of the NDA as required
by 21 CFR 314.50(d)(3) and 320.21(a).
Discovery contends that it is entitled to a waiver of the demonstration of in vivo bioavailability because the drug
and its metabolites are not measurable in plasma ``at their designated levels.'' This contention is incorrect, as
shown in two articles that provide information on metabolites. (See, Salonen, J. S., ``Determination of the Amine
Metabolites of Selegiline in Biological Fluids by Capillary Gas Chromatography,'' 

Journal of Chromatography

, 527:163-168, 1990; Heinonen, E. H., and R. Lammintausta, ``A Review of the Pharmacology of Selegiline,''


Acta Neurologica Scandinavia

, Suppl., 136:44-59, 1990.)
Discovery also states in the application that ``[d]ue to the stereospecificity and low [cerebrospinal fluid] concentration
of the L-amphetamine metabolites recovered during this trial, these metabolites do not contribute to the clinical
efficacy of deprenyl, nor do they pose any risk to the patient after extended use.'' This statement is not substantiated
in Discovery's application and, while taken in part from an earlier article by Heinonen (Heinonen, E. H., et al., ``Pharmacokinetics
and Metabolism of Selegiline,'' 

Acta Neurologica Scandinavia

, 126:93-99, 1989) is at odds with the information described in the 1990 article by Heinonen which, states that
desmethylselegiline may contribute to the pharmacological activity during selegiline treatment. 


F. Discovery's Compliance with CGMP's


The application is not approvable under section 505(d) of the act and 21 CFR 314.125(b)(13) because the methods to
be used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the manufacture, processing, packing, and holding of the drug
substance and drug product do not comply with the CGMP regulations (21 CFR parts 210 and 211). 
Between February 25 and March 2, 1993, FDA investigators made an inspection of Discovery's establishment in Wesley
Chapel, FL, and observed numerous violations of the CGMP regulations. The following are among numerous CGMP violations
observed during the February through March, 1993, inspection:
1. Discovery lacks adequate standard operating procedures with regard to: (i) Responsibilities of the quality control
unit (21 CFR 211.22); (ii) cleaning and maintenance of equipment used in manufacturing products (21 CFR 211.67);
(iii) receipt and handling of components (21 CFR 211.82); (iv) production and process control, e.g., weighing components
(21 CFR 211.101); (v) in-process controls or testing (21 CFR 211.110).
2. Discovery lacks a written stability program. Additionally, Discovery could locate no records documenting stability
testing of selegiline citrate (21 CFR 211.166).
3. Discovery could not produce batch production records showing manufacture of the one batch produced, which was
intended by the firm for use in clinical trials (21 CFR 211.188).
Until it can be verified in a subsequent inspection that Discovery is operating in compliance with the CGMP regulations
in 21 CFR parts 210 and 211, the agency cannot conclude that the methods, facilities, and controls used for the production
of the proposed drug product(s) are adequate to assure the identity, strength, quality, and purity of the drug product.


G. Conclusion


FDA proposes to refuse to approve Discovery's NDA 20-242 on the grounds that Discovery has failed to provide
adequate evidence of safety, effectiveness, proper methods, facilities and controls, environmental assessment,
proper labeling, bioavailability data, and compliance with CGMP regulations. Discovery has failed to submit the
appropriate studies and information necessary for the approval of its product.


III. Notice of Opportunity for a Hearing


The Director of the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (the Director) has evaluated the information discussed
above and, on the grounds stated, is proposing to refuse to approve NDA 20-242.
Therefore, notice is given to Discovery and to all other interested persons that the Director proposes to issue an
order under section 505(d) of the act, refusing to approve NDA 20-242. The Director finds that, (1) the investigations,
reports of which are required to be submitted pursuant to 21 U.S.C. 355(b), do not include adequate tests by all methods
reasonably applicable to show whether or not Discovery's deprenyl citrate product is safe for use under the conditions
prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the proposed labeling thereof; (2) the results of such tests do not show
that Discovery's deprenyl citrate product is safe for use under such conditions; (3) the methods used in, and the facilities
and controls used for, the manufacture, processing, and packaging of Discovery's deprenyl citrate product are inadequate
to preserve its identity, strength, quality, and purity; (4) upon the basis of the information submitted to the Director
as part of the application, and upon the basis of any other information before the Director with respect to Discovery's
deprenyl citrate product, the Director has insufficient information to determine whether Discovery's deprenyl
citrate product is safe for use under such conditions; (5) evaluated on the basis of the information submitted to the
Director as part of the application and any other information before the Director with respect to Discovery's deprenyl
citrate product, there is a lack of substantial evidence that the drug will have the effect it purports or is represented
to have under the conditions or use prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the proposed labeling thereof; and (6)
based on a fair evaluation of all material facts, the proposed labeling is false and misleading. 
In accordance with section 505 of the act and 21 CFR part 314, the applicant is hereby given an opportunity for a hearing
to show that approval of the NDA should not be refused.
An applicant who decides to seek a hearing shall file: (1) On or before June 20, 1994, a written notice of appearance
and request for hearing, and (2) on or before July 18, 1994, the data, information, and analyses relied on to demonstrate
that there is a genuine issue of material fact to justify a hearing, as specified in 21 CFR 314.200. Any other interested
person may also submit comments on this notice. The procedures and requirements governing this notice of opportunity
for a hearing, a notice of appearance and request for a hearing, information and analyses to justify a hearing, other
comments, and a grant or denial of a hearing are contained in 21 CFR 314.200 and in 21 CFR part 12.
The failure of the applicant to file a timely written notice of appearance and request for hearing, as required by 21
CFR 314.200, constitutes an election by that person not to use the opportunity for a hearing concerning the proposed
action, and a waiver of any contentions concerning the legal status of that person's drug products. Any new drug product
marketed without an approved NDA is subject to regulatory action at any time.
A request for a hearing may not rest upon mere allegations or denials, but must present specific facts showing that
there is a genuine and substantial issue of fact that requires a hearing. If it conclusively appears from the face of
the data, information, and factual analyses in the request for a hearing that there is no genuine and substantial issue
of fact that precludes the refusal to approve the application, or when a request for hearing is not made in the required
format or with the required analyses, the Commissioner of Food and Drugs will enter summary judgment against the person
who requests the hearing, making findings and conclusions, and denying a hearing.
All submissions pursuant to this notice of opportunity for a hearing are to be filed in four copies. Except for data
and information prohibited from public disclosure under 21 U.S.C. 331(j) or 18 U.S.C. 1905, the submissions may be
seen in the Dockets Management Branch (address above) between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.
This notice is issued under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (sec. 505 (21 U.S.C. 355)) and under authority
delegated to the Director of the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (21 CFR 5.82).

<DOCTITLE>Final Minimum Percentages for ``High Rate'' and ``Significant Increase in the Rate'' for Implementation of the General
Statutory Funding Preference for Advanced Nurse Education Grants for Fiscal Year 1994 </DOCTITLE>



The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) announces the final minimum percentages for ``high rate''
and ``significant increase in the rate'' for implementation of the general statutory funding preference for Advanced
Nurse Education Grants for fiscal year (FY) 1994, funded under the authority of section 821, title VIII of the Public
Health Service Act, as amended by the Nurse Education and Practice Improvement Amendments of 1992, title II of the
Health Professions Education Extension Amendments of 1992, Public Law 102-408, dated October 13, 1992. 


Purpose 


Section 821 of the Public Health Service Act, as implemented by 42 CFR part 57, subpart Z, authorizes assistance to
meet the costs of projects to: (1) Plan, develop and operate new programs, or (2) significantly expand existing programs
leading to advanced degrees that prepare nurses to serve as nurse educators or public health nurses, or in other clinical
nurse specialties determined by the Secretary to require advanced education. The period of Federal support should
not exceed 3 years. 


Statutory General Preference 


As provided in section 860(e)(1) of the PHS Act, preference will be given to any qualified applicant that_

 

(A) Has a high rate for placing graduates in practice settings having the principal focus of serving residents of medically
underserved communities; or 
(B) During the 2-year period preceding the fiscal year for which such an award is sought, has achieved a significant
increase in the rate of placing graduates in such settings.

 

This preference will only be applied to applications that rank above the 20th percentile of proposals recommended
for approval by the peer review group. 


Final Minimum Percentages for ``High Rate'' and ``Significant Increase in the Rate'' 


A proposed notice was published in the 

Federal Register

 on September 29, 1993 at 58 FR 50943. Two comments were received prior to the end of the comment period. The comments
will be discussed below. Comments on issues that were not specifically proposed for public comment are not addressed
in this notice. 
One respondent suggested that ``significant increase in the rate'' should be defined as a 25 percent increase rather
than a 50 percent increase as was proposed, because a large program would have a difficult time showing a 50 percent
increase. The definition of ``significant increase in the rate'' will remain at 50 percent because a program is required
to meet only one of the two criteria in the statutory preference in order to receive the funding preference. If a large
program can demonstrate that 30 percent of the graduates have been placed in medically underserved communities (``high
rate''), the application can receive the funding preference without any increase in the rate of placing students
in medically underserved communities. 
The respondent also recommended deletion of the requirement that 15 percent of graduates from the most recent year
should be working in these settings to receive the preference based on ``significant increase in the rate,'' because
the statute does not require this provision. The 15 percent requirement is intended to emphasize provision of substantial
care in medically underserved communities and will be retained. 
The final minimum percentages for ``high rate'' and ``significant increase in the rate'' remain as proposed and are
presented below. 
``High rate'' is defined as a minimum of 30 percent of graduates in academic year 1991-92 or academic year 1992-93,
whichever is greater, who spend at least 50 percent of their worktime in clinical practice in the specified settings.
Public health nurse graduates can be counted if they identify a primary work affiliation at one of the qualified work
sites. Graduates who are providing care in a medically underserved community as a part of a fellowship or other educational
experience can be counted. 
``Significant increase in the rate'' means that, between academic years 1991-92 and 1992-93, the rate
of placing graduates in the specified settings has increased by a minimum of 50 percent and that not less than 15 percent
of graduates from the most recent year are working in these settings.

<DOCTITLE>Final Minimum Percentages for ``High Rate'' and ``Significant Increase in the Rate'' for Implementation of the General
Statutory Funding Preference for Grants for Nurse Practitioner and Nurse-Midwifery Programs for Fiscal Year 1994</DOCTITLE>



The Health Reserves and Services Administration (HRSA) announces the final minimum percentages for ``high rate''
and ``significant increase in the rate'' for implementation of the general statutory funding preference, Grants
for Nurse Practitioner and Nurse-Midwifery Programs, for fiscal year (FY) 1994, funded under the authority of section
822, title VIII of the Public Health Service (PHS) Act, as amended by the Nurse Education and Practice Improvement
Amendments of 1992, title II of Public Law 102-408, Health Professions Education Extension Amendments of 1992,
dated October 13, 1992.



Purpose



Section 822 of the Public Health Service Act, as amended, authorizes grants to meet the costs of projects to: 

(1) Plan, develop and operate new programs; or

(2) Maintain or significantly expand existing programs for the training of nurse practitioners and/or nurse-midwives
who will, upon completion of their studies, be qualified to effectively provide primary health care, including primary
health care in homes and in ambulatory care facilities and other health care institutions.



Statutory General Preference



As provided in section 860(e)(1) of the PHS Act, preference will be given to any qualified applicant that_

(A) Has a high rate for placing graduates in practice settings having the principal focus of serving residents of medically
underserved communities; or

(B) During the 2-year period preceding the fiscal year for which such an award is sought, has achieved a significant
increase in the rate of placing graduates in such settings.

This preference will only be applied to applications that rank above the 20th percentile of proposals recommended
for approval by the peer review group.



Final Minimum Percentages for ``High Rate'' and ``Significant Increase in the Rate''



A proposed notice was published in the 

Federal Register 

on September 30, 1993 at 58 FR 51092. Two comments were received prior to the end of the comment period. The comments
will be discussed below. Comments on issues that were not specifically proposed for public comment are not addressed
in this notice.

One respondent suggested that ``significant increase in the rate'' should be defined as a 25 percent increase rather
than a 50 percent increase as was proposed, because a large program would have a difficult time showing a 50 percent
increase. The definition of ``significant increase in the rate'' will remain at 50 percent because a program is required
to meet only one of the two criteria in the statutory preference in order to receive the funding preference. If a large
program can demonstrate that 30 percent of the graduates have been placed in medically underserved communities (``high
rate''), the application can receive the funding preference without any increase in the rate of placing students
in medically underserved communities.

The respondent also recommended deletion of the requirement that 15 percent of graduates from the most recent year
should be working in these settings to receive the preference based on ``significant increase in the rate,'' because
the statute does not require this provision. The 15 percent requirement is intended to emphasize provision of substantial
care in medically underserved communities and will be retained.

The final minimum percentages for ``high rate'' and ``significant increase in the rate'' remain as proposed and are
presented below.

``High rate'' is defined as a minimum of 30 percent of graduates in academic year 1991-92 or academic year 1992-93,
whichever is greater, who spend at least 50 percent of their worktime in clinical practice in the specified settings.
Graduates who are providing care in a medically underserved community as a part of a fellowship or other educational
experience can be counted.

``Significant increase on the rate'' means that, between academic years 1991-92 and 1992-93, the rate
of placing graduates in the specified settings has increased by a minimum of 50 percent and that not less than 15 percent
of graduates from the most recent year are working in these settings.

<DOCTITLE>Final Minimum Percentage Rates for ``High Rate'' and ``Significant Increase in the Rate'' for Implementation of
the Statutory General Funding Preference, Funding Preference and Priority for Grants for Programs for Physician
Assistants_Fiscal Year l994 </DOCTITLE>


The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) announces the final minimum percentage rates for ``high
rate'' and ``significant increase in the rate'' for implementation of the statutory general funding preference,
funding preference and priority for fiscal year (FY) 1994 Grants for Programs for Physician Assistants authorized
under the authority of section 750 title VII of the Public Health Service (PHS) Act, as amended by the Health Professions
Education Extension Amendments of 1992, Public Law 102-408, dated October 13, 1992. 



Purpose 


Section 750 of the PHS Act authorizes the award of grants to accredited schools of medicine or osteopathic medicine
and other public or nonprofit private entities to assist in meeting the cost of planning, developing and operating
or maintaining programs for the training of physician assistants as defined 
under section 799(3) of the Public Health Service Act. 



Statutory General Funding Preference 


As provided in section 791(a) of the PHS Act, preference 
will be given to any qualified applicant that_
(A) Has a high rate for placing graduates in practice 
settings having the principal focus of serving 
residents of medically underserved communities; or 
(B) During the 2-year period preceding the fiscal year for 
which an award is sought, has achieved a significant increase in the rate of placing graduates in such settings. This
preference will only be applied to 
applications that rank above the 20th percentile that 
have been recommended for approval by the peer review 
group. 


Final Minimum Percentages for ``High Rate'' and ``Significant Increase in the Rate'', Funding Preference and Priority




A proposed notice was published in the 

Federal Register

 on February 17, 1994, at 59 FR 8007, for public comment. No comments were received during the 30-day comment period.
Therefore, the minimum percentages for ``high rate'' and ``significant increase in the rate,'' funding preference
and priority will be retained as follows; 
``High rate'' means that 20 percent of the physician assistant program graduates in academic year 1991-92 or academic
year 1992-93, whichever is greater, are spending at least 50 percent of their work time in these settings. 

``Significant increase in the rate'' means that, between academic years 1991-92 and 1992-93, the rate
of physician assistant program graduates in these settings has increased by at least 50 percent and that not less than
15 percent of the academic year 1992-93 graduates are working in these settings. 


Final Funding Preference 


In addition, a funding preference will be given to established physician assistant training programs which can demonstrate
that: (a) More than 50 percent of their graduates in 1993 entered a generalist specialty (family medicine, general
internal medicine, general pediatrics); or (b) an average of 40 percent of graduates over the last 3 years (1991, 1992,
and 1993) entered a generalist specialty. 


Final Funding Priority 



A funding priority will be given to approved applications that can demonstrate either substantial progress over
the last 3 years or a significant experience of 10 or more years in enrolling and graduating trainees from those minority
or low-income populations identified as at risk of poor health outcomes.

<DOCTITLE>Final Minimum Percentages for ``High Rate'' and ``Significant Increase in the Rate'' for Implementation of the General
Statutory Funding Preference for Grants for Professional Nurse Traineeships for Fiscal Year 1994 </DOCTITLE>



The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) announces the final minimum percentages for ``high rate''
and ``significant increase in the rate'' for implementation of the general statutory funding preference for fiscal
year (FY) 1994 Grants for Professional Nurse Traineeships funded under the authority of section 830, title VIII of
the Public Health Service (PHS) Act, as amended by the Nurse Education and Practice Improvement Amendments of 1992,
title II of the Health Professions Education Extension Amendments of 1992, Public Law 102-408, dated October
13, 1992. 



Purpose 


Section 830 of the Public Health Service Act authorizes the Secretary to award grants to meet the cost of traineeships
for individuals in advanced-degree programs in order to educate the individuals to serve in and prepare for practice
as nurse practitioners, nurse midwives, nurse educators, public health nurses, or in other clinical nursing specialties
determined by the Secretary to require advanced education. Federal support must be requested annually. 



Statutory Preference 



In making awards of grants under this section, preference will be given to any qualified applicant that: 

(a) Has a high rate for placing graduates in practice settings having the principal focus of serving residents of medically
underserved communities; or 

(b) During the 2-year period preceding the fiscal year for which such an award is sought, has achieved a significant
increase in the rate of placing graduates in such settings. 



Proposed Minimum Percentages for ``High Rate'' and ``Significant Increase in the Rate'' 



A notice which announced this grant cycle was published in the 

Federal Register

 on November 3, 1993 at 58 FR 58703, and proposed minimum percentages for ``high rate'' and ``significant increase
in the rate'' for implementation of the general statutory funding preference. No comments were received during the
30 day comment period. Therefore, the percentages for ``high rate'' and ``significant increase in the rate'' remain
as proposed, except that a technical correction has been made in the definition for ``high rate.'' The final minimum
percentages are shown below. 

 
``High rate'' is defined as a minimum of 20 percent of graduates in academic years 1990-91, 1991-92 or 1992-93
who spend at least 50 percent of their worktime in clinical practice in the specified settings. Public health nurse
graduates can be counted if they identify a primary work affiliation at one of the qualified work sites. Graduates
who are providing care in a medically underserved community as a part of a fellowship or other educational experience
can be counted. 


``Significant increase in the rate'' means that, between academic years 1991-92 and 1992-93, the rate
of placing graduates in the specified settings has increased by a minimum of 50 percent and that not less than 15 percent
of graduates from the most recent year are working in these settings.

Part A Data Collection Plan 



Introduction 



The Moving to Opportunity For Fair Housing (MTO) Demonstration program is an initiative on the part of Congress and
the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD or the Department) to explore ways to assist families now
living in public housing or project-based Section 8 housing to move out of the high-poverty areas of large central
cities. The demonstration will assist families by combining Section 8 rental assistance with intensive housing
search and counseling services in order to facilitate relocation to low-poverty neighborhoods.
 MTO is modeled on court-ordered remedial programs of the past two decades, in which federal courts have required HUD
to provide funding for rental assistance and housing counseling services in order to reduce racial segregation in
publicly assisted housing.
 Jurisdictions in which court-ordered programs have been established include Boston, Chicago, Cincinnati, and
Dallas. 






The Moving to Opportunity for Fair Housing (MTO) Demonstration was authorized in Section 152 of the Housing and Community
Development Act of 1992, which set the following parameters for the program: 




 Eligible families are very low-income families with children residing in public housing or project-based
Section 8-assisted housing located in areas with high concentrations of poverty. 

 Participating localities are restricted to no more than six very large cities with populations of at least
400,000 in metropolitan areas of at least 1.5 million people. 

 Local programs are created via contracts between the Secretary of HUD and nonprofit organizations or NPOs
(to provide counseling and services in connection with the demonstration) and public housing agencies or PHAs (to
administer the Section 8 rental assistance). The NPOs will receive funding to help pay for the costs associated with
counseling participating families, assisting them in finding appropriate units, and working with landlords to
encourage their participation in the MTO program. Local programs must match federal counseling funds with funds
from state or local public or private sources. PHAs will receive administrative funds for the increased number of
Section 8 certificates or vouchers made available through the MTO program. 

 In the short term, the demonstration will compare the costs and service differences between the MTO program
and the routine implementation of the Section 8 tenant-based rental assistance program. HUD will report to Congress
biennially on the effectiveness of the demonstration, including a report on who is served, the level of counseling
and types of services provided, and updates on the employment records of families assisted under the program. 

 In the long term, the demonstration will assess the housing, educational, and employment outcomes of families
assisted through the program. A final report to Congress on program outcomes is due in 2004. 

Section 8 rental assistance for the MTO demonstration was approved at $50 million for FY 92 and $52.1 million for FY
93.
 In addition, up to $500,000 was set aside for counseling grants. These funds will assist approximately 1,300 low-income
families at five HUD-selected sites: Baltimore, Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, and New York. 





For FY 94, Congress increased the demonstration appropriation by $164.5 million in rental assistance plus $7 million
in housing counseling funds. These additional MTO resources will assist another 2,000 or more families, bringing
the total to around 3,300. Current plans call for including 1,800 of the 3,300 families in a three-way experimental
design which is described later in this document.

HUD has contracted with Abt Associates, Inc. (the Contractor) to assist in planning and implementing the MTO demonstration
and developing a framework for reporting on the demonstration. Among Abt Associates' responsibilities are: (1)
Developing forms and procedures so that standardized information can be collected across sites regarding participants,
services and costs; (2) designing and assisting in the implementation of a three-way random assignment mechanism
for the demonstration; and, (3) providing data collection assistance, technical assistance, and monitoring to
local sites to ensure that the demonstration is implemented in an effective and standardized manner. Under a separate
procurement, HUD intends to conduct an evaluation of the demonstration using a three-way experimental design, in
order to answer policy questions about the long-term effects of the program on participants.

This request for OMB clearance covers two distinct groups of instruments related to start-up and early implementation
of the MTO demonstration program. The groups of instruments are based upon the identity of the respondent: 




 Data collection forms with participant respondents'' Baseline data will be collected through a survey of
participants. These data will be used initially to describe the participants served in the demonstration; eventually,
they will form the foundation for the long-term evaluation of the program's effects on participants. 

 Data collection forms with agency respondents'' MTO program operation data will be routinely collected and
maintained by PHAs and NPOS and periodically reported to HUD. These data will enable HUD to fulfill its monitoring
responsibilities and meet Congressional reporting requirements. 




The forms proposed for these data collection activities are the Enrollment Form and Participant Baseline Survey
(copies of these forms are provided in Appendix A), and the Participant Tracking Logs, Participant Counseling Log,
Program Cost forms, and Landlord Outreach Log, (Appendix B).

A1 Circumstances That Make The Collection of Information Necessary 



The statutory language establishing the MTO demonstration specifies that HUD must report to Congress on the progress
of the demonstration and the status of participants.
 Topics that are to be covered include: a comparison of the costs associated with implementing the MTO program (including
the costs of counseling, supportive services, and housing assistance payments) with the costs of routine implementation
of the Section 8 program; the number of persons served; the level of counseling and services provided under MTO; and
updates on the employment records of families assisted under the program. The legislation also directs HUD to provide
any other information that may be necessary in evaluating the demonstration. 





A final report to Congress is due in 2004. At that time, HUD is required to: (1) Report on the long-term housing, employment,
and educational achievements of the families assisted under the demonstration; and (2) assess such achievements
for a comparable population of Section 8 recipients not assisted under MTO.
 





The MTO demonstration builds on several existing efforts designed to reduce racial segregation in publicly assisted
housing and increase the mobility of families receiving Section 8 assistance.
 Court-ordered programs in Chicago and Cincinnati, and a voluntary program in Hartford, Connecticut, have been the
subject of recent studies.
 These studies suggest that a combination of Section 8 and housing counseling assistance can facilitate the movement
of low- income families to areas of low minority concentration or low poverty, and ultimately increase their educational
and employment opportunities. 






A study of the Gautreaux program in Chicago by James Rosenbaum of Northwestern University has received much recent
attention.
 Rosenbaum studied the mothers and children of families who moved to suburban locations under the Gautreaux program,
comparing their educational and employment status with those who moved to other in-city locations. He found that
outcomes for adult suburban movers were very positive in terms of employment; suburban movers were 25 percent more
likely than city movers to have a job after the move. Among the children of Gautreaux families, he found that children
in suburban locations had higher satisfaction with teachers and better attitudes about schools. He also found that
high school drop-out rates were much lower for suburban children_5 percent compared with 20 percent among those in
city neighborhoods. It should be noted that Rosenbaum's work has been criticized for serious methodological problems.
One of the most serious criticisms is that Rosenbaum's reference group was not a strict control group since it consisted
of other Gautreaux participants placed in units within the City of Chicago. Thus, the selection of a suburban and urban
location was partly voluntary rather than a matter of random assignment. 





The MTO demonstration differs from its predecessor programs in a number of ways. First, while the Gautreaux and Cincinnati
programs focus on moving families to areas with low minority concentrations, MTO focuses on moving its participants
to areas of low poverty. MTO participants must move to low-poverty census tracts (defined as tracts where fewer than
10 percent of the people had incomes below the poverty level in 1989, as measured by the 1990 Census). Second, the MTO
demonstration is designed to serve a broad range of families, including those who may have difficulty making moves,
notably larger families and those without automobiles. Third, the Section 8 certificates and vouchers will be allocated
to the central city PHAs for the MTO demonstration; in other mobility programs, Section 8 assistance has been administered
by the organizations that provide housing counseling services. The MTO demonstration requires collaboration between
a PHA, to administer the Section 8 assistance, and a nonprofit agency to provide housing counseling, assist families
in finding units, and work to develop landlord support for the program.

Finally, to overcome the methodological problems associated with other research on mobility programs, HUD has embedded
a randomized experiment in the MTO demonstration. Applicants for the program will be assigned randomly to one of three
groups: 




 An experimental group, which will receive a Section 8 certificate or voucher plus special counseling and search
assistance in order to locate and move to housing only in low-poverty areas;

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940719-2-00103 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940719-2-00062 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

 A Section 8 control group, which will receive a regular tenant-based Section 8 certificate or voucher (with
no locational restrictions) plus regular briefing and assistance from the public housing agency; or 
 An in-place control group, which will receive no tenant-based assistance but which will remain initially
in current public housing or Section 8 project-based housing.




All these participants will be tracked over a ten-year period to assess the program's effects.
 By using three-way random assignment, HUD will be able to provide definitive answers to three key policy questions
regarding mobility programs. First, do programs like MTO contribute to moves to low-poverty areas? Second, are these
moves (and not other factors) the basis for positive employment and educational outcomes? Third, is the MTO approach
more 
effective than the existing Section 8 program in producing such outcomes? 





A2 How and By Whom the Data Will Be Used 


The information will be used by the Department to (1) monitor demonstration activities; (2) prepare biennial reports
to Congress; and (3) establish baseline information about participants for a long-term evaluation of the program,
the results of which will be reported in Congress in 2004. Much of the information collected under this request for
clearance will also be used by local demonstration sites to manage the program locally. 


A2.1 Consequences if the Information Was Not Collected 


Without this planned data collection effort, HUD would be unable to meet its short-term responsibilities with regard
to program monitoring or Congressional reporting. In addition, without collecting baseline information about
participants and their families, HUD would be unable to assess long-term effects of the program and to answer key policy
questions about mobility programs. 



A2.2 Description of the MTO Data Collection Plan 


This request for OMB clearance covers two distinct groups of instruments associated with the start-up and early implementation
of the MTO demonstration program. The groups of instruments are based upon the identity of the respondent: 



 Data collection forms with participant respondents_Baseline data will be collected through a survey of participants.
These data will be used initially to describe the participants served in the demonstration; they form the foundation
for the long-term evaluation of the program's effects on participants. 
 Data collection forms with agency respondents_MTO program operation data will be routinely collected and
maintained by PHAs and NPOS and periodically reported to HUD. These data will enable HUD to fulfill its monitoring
responsibilities and meet Congressional reporting requirements. 




Each of the instruments in these two groups will be discussed in turn. Copies of the instruments can be found in the appendices.




A2.2.1 Data Collection with Participant Respondents 


Two data collection instruments have been developed for participant respondents: the MTO Enrollment Form and the
Participant Baseline Survey. In addition, information about participants related to income, current residence
and other items will be taken from HUD form 50058, which provides family-level data for households receiving assistance
under the public housing and Section 8 programs. Copies of the instruments and the HUD 50058 form are found 
in Appendix A. 

Potential applicants are identified through outreach efforts conducted by the public housing agency. Families
interested in participating contact the PHA by a certain date. The PHA makes a preliminary review and identifies those
families that appear to be eligible for the program.
 A waiting list of screened families who are interested in participating in the program is developed by each PHA. Families
are notified that they may be eligible to 
participate in the MTO program, and an appointment to verify eligibility is made. 




When a family comes to the PHA for the scheduled appointment, eligibility is reviewed by a PHA intake worker. Based
on this in-person review, if the applicant is eligible for the program, he/she is requested to complete the Enrollment
Form and MTO Baseline Participant Survey. While the baseline is a self-administered survey, a data collection assistant
will be available at each site to answer questions and assist those that may have language or literacy problems. 



MTO Enrollment Form. 

The MTO Enrollment Form is completed by applicants (also referred to here as ``families'') who wish to participate
in the program. The Enrollment Form will be presented to the applicants by PHA staff. This brief form advises the applicant
of the demonstration requirements, including random assignment, forming the basis of informed 
consent. The applicant checks one of the two boxes on the form to indicate whether he/she is interested in participating
in the MTO program. The form is signed and dated by the applicant. The PHA staff will be available to answer applicants'
questions about the demonstration. 



MTO Participant Baseline Survey. 

The Participant Baseline Survey is completed by all those who sign the Enrollment Form for MTO and are determined eligible
for Section 8 and the MTO program, whether or not they eventually receive assistance under MTO. In other words, the
survey is completed by those who will ultimately be assigned to the experimental and both control groups. The survey
is completed prior to random assignment, in order to avoid any 
effect that assignment to one group or another would have on participants' answers. 

The Participant Baseline Survey provides information necessary for an evaluation of the long-term effects of the
program. Thus, the questions are focused on developing information that can help to explain outcomes_that is, data
on particular characteristics or experiences of families that will help to explain why the program ultimately affected
them as it did. The baseline survey is divided into three parts. Part I requests information about the following topics:





 Housing information: the participant's previous experience with the Section 8 program, the participant's
mobility and prior housing, reasons for wanting to move, and condition of current housing.
 Neighborhood: participant's satisfaction with current neighborhood, safety and victimization, neighborhood
conditions, and access to services. 
 Neighbors: the participant's social network and social supports. 
 Employment history: Current and recent employment, recent efforts to search for work, transportation to
work.

<TEXT>
 

 Benefits: receipt of AFDC, General Welfare/General Relief, food stamps, and other assistance. 
 Outlook: the participant's self-efficacy relative to outcome of interest, such as ability to live in a low-poverty
neighborhood or ability to get along with neighbors.

 Parent involvement: the participant's involvement with his/her children's schooling. 
 Contact information: the names of three friends or relatives who do not live with the participant and will always
know how to contact him/her. This information will be used for long-term tracking of the participants and follow-up
survey work.




Part II collects demographic information about every member of the participant's household. A cover sheet requests
the full name of each member as well as basic demographic information, including birth date, sex, race, ethnicity.
The second page contains a matrix in which information about adult household members is reported. This information
includes relationship to applicant, school and work status, marital status, number of children, and the 
year first child was born. 

In addition, Part II includes two short surveys for children living in the household. One is for children five and younger,
and the 
other is for children from six to eighteen years of age. The applicant completes a sheet for each child in the household.
For younger children, basic information is requested about pre-school attendance, child care arrangements, general
health and behavior. For children 6 to 18, information includes school and grade, attendance in gifted or special
education classes, general 
behavior and health, and child care arrangements. 




A2.2.2 Data Collection with Agency Respondents 


At each of the demonstration sites, the public housing authorities and nonprofit organizations will routinely collect
and update program data and submit them (initially to the Contractor, later to HUD) on a monthly basis during the demonstration
period.
 These data will be used by HUD to monitor the progress of the demonstration (i.e., the number of people 
participating in the program, the number who have leased units), to identify differences in the program among the
sites and reasons for these differences, to determine the costs associated with adding MTO counseling to the conventional
Section 8 program, and to develop biennial reports 
to the Congress. It should be noted that the collection of the data is also useful to each of the sites, as they manage
and monitor their own programs. The data collection instruments that have been designed for agency respondents are:
the Participant Tracking Forms for PHAs and NPOs; the Participant Counseling Log for NPOs; the Program Cost Forms
for PHAs and NPOs; and the Landlord Outreach Log for NPOs. These are discussed below and can be found in Appendix B.







PHA and NPO Participant Tracking Logs. 

Tracking logs provide a mechanism for monitoring the progress of participants from enrollment through lease-up
of a new unit. Separate tracking logs have been developed for the PHAs and NPOs which they will update on an as-needed
basis. Updated logs will be copied and submitted monthly (initially to the Contractor, later to HUD), so that the progress
of demonstration enrollment, search, and lease-up can be monitored. 
The ``PHA tracking log'' requires PHA staff to record the name and social security number of all eligible applicants
as they are enrolled in the program and the dates when key PHA-related activities occur. For example, PHA staff will
record the date the Enrollment Form is signed, the date the Participant Baseline Survey is completed, and the outcome
of random assignment. The log separately tracks participants in the experimental, Section 8 control, and 
in-place control groups. For experimental and Section 8 control group families, the log captures the date a certificate
or voucher is issued and dates for search extension and expiration of the certificate or voucher. Once a participant
finds a unit, the dates for the housing quality standards inspection, lease approval, and move-in are recorded.

The ``NPO participant tracking log'', to be maintained by staff of the nonprofit agencies, applies only to experimental
group participants. It is used to record the dates and results of NPO-related activities. These include a credit check,
a visit to the participant's home, and accompanied visits to inspect up to three prospective units. When the participant
finds a unit, 
the unit address and neighborhood are recorded, along with the date of a follow-up visit by NPO staff. 
After random assignment, tracking of the in-place control group members will not require a special data collection
by the PHA. It will be accomplished using extracts from the electronic Form 50058 files that PHAs and Section 8 project
managers maintain for periodic submission to HUD.
 







Participant Counseling Log. 

Part of the design of the MTO program is the provision of counseling to participants in the experimental group, from
the time of receiving a Section 8 certificate or voucher, for as long as one year after they have leased a unit under MTO.
This counseling_on search methods, community features, credit problems, and family adjustment_will be provided
by the nonprofit organizations. NPO staff will be asked to record contacts with each participant, whether the contact
is by phone or in person, as well as the purpose and duration of the contact. NPOs will retain this information; it will
be submitted to HUD at the end of the intake period and one year later. NPOs may choose to substitute their own forms to
collect this information, provided that the same information is contained on their forms.



Program Cost Forms. 

HUD is required to identify the costs associated with operating the MTO demonstration in biennial reports to Congress.
To do this, it will be necessary to document the staff costs associated with counseling MTO participants (including
staff time and travel), the cost of conducting credit checks, identifying housing units, recruiting and working

with landlords, as well as managing random assignment and general program administration. Separate forms have been
developed for NPOs and PHAs, to report to HUD on a monthly basis all costs related to the program. The forms require documentation
of the amount of staff time devoted to a range of program activities, including outreach, enrollment, random assignment,
record-keeping, and counseling. The name and 
hourly wage of staff working on MTO during the month is to be reported, along with the total number of hours the staff
person devoted to MTO that month. Non-staff costs associated with the demonstration are to be reported as well, including
indirect labor costs and benefits, overhead expenses, subcontracts, and fees.
 
In order to minimize the burden on participating agencies, data on staff time by activity will be collected for just
two one-month periods during the demonstration intake period. Total costs will be reported in the other months.

<DOCNO> FR940719-2-00105 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940719-2-00062 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

NPOs will also be required to document how matching funds are assigned to various program activities. In-kind services
or other contributions supporting each activity will also be identified and will be assigned a dollar value. 



Landlord Outreach Log.

 HUD and the Congress have expressed an interest in learning about the level of landlord outreach that occurs through
the program. It is the NPO's responsibility to recruit landlords to participate in the MTO program, particularly
owners and managers of more than 500 units and those with large (3+ bedrooms) units. The log allows the NPO to keep a record
of the names and addresses of landlords who are contacted, the types and location of units under their management,
and the landlord's interest in participating in the program. Similarly, it provides a place to record contacts with
property owner associations. The Landlord Outreach Logs are updated by the NPOs as necessary. Updated logs will be
copied and sent to HUD at the end of each month for the intake period of the MTO demonstration. 



A2.3 Research Objectives and Analysis Design 



The research objectives for the demonstration derive largely from the authorizing legislation, the Housing and
Community Development Act of 1992. In the short term, the primary objective is to test whether the MTO program can lead
to significantly more leasing in low-poverty areas than would have occurred if standard Section 8 procedures were
employed. To do so, it is necessary to obtain evidence of the effects and costs of adding MTO housing search assistance
services to the Section 8 rental assistance program. As noted above, information must be collected about standard
Section 8 practices, which may vary considerably from site to site, and their associated costs at each of the demonstration
sites. In addition, information must be collected about the rate at which participants are able to move to low-poverty
areas, the level of special housing counseling provided by NPOs to assist these moves, as well as other program activities
(i.e, landlord outreach) that facilitate movement to low-poverty areas. Through the agency data collection and
the Contractor's monitoring and technical assistance activities, data will be provided to HUD that will enable a
full account of the costs involved in adding search assistance to the Section 8 program and the number of families who
were able to move to low-poverty areas as a result of this assistance. 

In the long term, the primary research objective of the MTO demonstration is to determine whether MTO placements have
measurable impacts on the lives and opportunities of the families selected for the experimental group. A mandated
report to Congress in 2004 will address the long-term effects of the demonstration. HUD has determined that the key
methodological strategy for measuring long-term effects is through three-way random assignment of MTO program
participants at the time of entry into the program, permitting a comparison of experimental and control group subjects
for the final evaluation report. Experimental group participants will receive Section 8 assistance to move to low-poverty
areas, as well as special housing search and counseling assistance provided by NPOs at each of the demonstration sites.
One control group of participants will receive the Section 8 assistance along with the standard Section 8 briefing
and support provided by the PHAs. A second control group will receive no assistance under the MTO program but will retain
current public housing or Section 8 project-based housing. All three groups will be tracked by HUD for a period of ten
years, through any moves or changes in assistance status that may occur. 

The analysis design for the long-term evaluation is under development by HUD and an outside experts group, which has
been convened twice (in December 1993 and March 1994).
 To date, the group has focused its attention primarily on the experimental design (confirming the choice of three-way
random assignment) and on the development of the baseline survey described in the previous section. Presumably,
analysis plans and other data collection instruments (such as household follow-up surveys) will be needed to analyze
the long-term impacts of MTO. The Department intends to pursue these through the work of the experts' group and through
later procurements.





A3 Use of Improved Technologies 



The potential for using improved information technology to reduce burden in this study has been reviewed. The study
requires that information be gathered from the following sources: 

 From families who enroll in the program_information that determines their eligibility for the program and
baseline data about applicants and their families; 

 From PHAs_documentation of MTO program operations and costs; information about the administration of the
regular Section 8 program; extracts of existing participant records; and 



</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940719-2-00106 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940719-2-00062 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

 From NPOs_documentation of MTO landlord outreach, counseling, program 
operations, and costs. 

 


Data on families will be gathered through the Participant Baseline Survey and use of an existing HUD form for public
housing and Section 8 tenants, HUD Form 50058.

14

 PHAs submit 50058 data monthly to the HUD Multifamily Tenant Characteristics System.

15

 Procedures will be developed to extract the same 50058 data for MTO families (from all three groups) as the basis for
long-term tracking. 






Except for Form 50058 data, it is expected that all information collected by PHAs and NPOs will be recorded on paper,
copies of which will be submitted to HUD according to a pre-established schedule. HUD's decision to employ paper forms
for this demonstration was made after careful consideration of the viability of automated data collection. The cost
of developing automated versions of the forms would be prohibitive. The availability and type of computer equipment
at NPOs and PHAs may vary considerably. No single automated version could be used in all demonstration sites; moreover,
introduction of new software would require more training time for the PHA and NPO staff than instruction on the use
of paper forms. If the PHAs and NPOs have existing software that enables them to record the requested information electronically,
the Contractor will work with the agency or organization to arrive at a compatible electronic format for easier submission.




A4 Efforts to Avoid Duplication 



This data collection effort represents the only Federal effort to monitor and assess the Moving to Opportunity for
Fair Housing Demonstration. Existing data on applicants, to the extent they are available at the PHAs, will be used
in lieu of new data collection. The primary source of existing data on applicants will be HUD 50058 forms, completed
at admission or lease-up, at annual recertification, and at the end of participation for Section 8 assisted tenants
and for public housing tenants. 

To differing degrees, PHAs already maintain data on the costs of administering traditional Section 8 programs. To
the extent that these data are available, they will obviate the need to collect this information especially for the
MTO demonstration. 



A5 Why Similar Already-Available Data Cannot Be Used 



This data collection represents the first attempt to collect information about this new demonstration; no similar
data are available. Because of the differences between MTO and other mobility programs,

16

 and particularly because of the experimental design (with random assignment to three groups), data must be collected
directly about the characteristics of participants and their success in utilizing the MTO or regular Section 8 rental
assistance. Wherever HUD has identified similar data on participants that will be useful, these data will be used
and not duplicated in MTO instruments. Further, because of the unique nature of program operations under this demonstration,
detailed data on agency practices must be gathered. For example, there are no systematic data available on the methods
and costs of nonprofit landlord outreach or counseling in different cities. They must therefore be collected under
the demonstration. 





A6 Efforts to Minimize the Burden for Small Entities 



Respondents for this data collection include MTO program participants, public housing authorities, and nonprofit
organizations participating in the MTO demonstration. The PHAs are all very large agencies. However, some of the
NPOs may qualify as small entities. Consequently, we have minimized the number of items that the NPOs will be required
to collect. In addition, grantees were advised in the Notice of Funding Availability for the demonstration that they
would be required to collect data for research purposes. HUD is assisting them with this responsibility, by providing
the staff support of a data collection assistant at each site, who is hired by the Contractor to help the NPOs and PHAs
with record-keeping and data collection. 



A7 Consequences of Less Frequent Data Collection 



The data gathered from participants is a one-time collection for the intake phase. PHAs and NPOs are required to maintain
records and report to HUD on a monthly basis for the intake phase. Any further follow-up will be conducted under a separate
procurement and will be the subject of a separate clearance request. 



A8 Circumstances Requiring Deviation from Guidelines in 5 CFR 1320.6 



The data collection does not deviate from the guidelines in 5 CFR 1320.6. 



A9 Consultations Outside the Agency 



In developing these instruments, HUD has obtained input from a number of sources. First, the Department has hired
Abt Associates Inc. to assist in the design of the data collection for the demonstration. Key staff from Abt Associates
are: Dr. Judith Feins, Ms. Mary Joel Holin, Ms. Janine Sullivan, Mr. Antony Phipps, Dr. Susan Popkin, Dr. Larry Orr.


Second, HUD has convened an experts' panel for the MTO demonstration. The members of the panel are shown in Exhibit
A.1. Third, Contractor staff have consulted with staff and reviewed materials provided by the Gautreaux Program
in Chicago. These include the Leadership Council's monthly reports to HUD, the information packet provided to potential
Gautreaux participants, and Gautreaux program forms (such as the intake and credit check forms). The Contractor
has also discussed with Gautreaux Program administrators their methods for tracking participants through the program.
Fourth, an extensive review has been conducted of the research literature on mobility programs, to identify all the
important areas where baseline data are needed for a long-term evaluation of MTO's effects.

A10 Arrangements and Assurances Regarding Confidentiality 


Program participants will be assured that the information they provide will be kept confidential and used only for
the purposes of this research. No data will be released in a form that can be identified with individual participants.
These assurances will be included in the Enrollment Form that is signed by all applicants during the intake process.



A11 Sensitive Questions 


There are no questions of a sensitive nature in this data collection effort.

A12 Estimated Cost to the Federal Government 


The cost to the Federal Government of the MTO demonstration is $69,661,760 
($18,979,085 for vouchers, $49,510,100 for certificates, $500,000 for counseling, and $672,575 for implementation
assistance and evaluation). The cost of the data collection described in this Supporting Statement is $179,585.




A13 Respondent Burden 


The respondent burden calculations presented in Exhibit A.2 cover a period of two years (24 months) from the anticipated
June 1, 1994 start-up of the MTO demonstration.

A14 Reasons for Changes in Burden 


This is an original submission of a Request for OMB Clearance for the data collection of the MTO demonstration. Therefore,
this section is not applicable. 



A15 Tabulation Plan, Statistical Analysis and Study Schedule 


Currently, the intake phase of the MTO demonstration is scheduled to begin in June 1994 and end in June 1995. Including
the FY 94 Notice of Funding Availability, this intake phase may be extended through June 1996. 
Immediate plans for tabulation or other analysis of the data collected under this request for clearance are limited
to those of the Contractor, Abt Associates, and to the period from the start of demonstration site operations (scheduled
for June 1, 1994) until February 1995. The Contractor's Final Report will combine documentation of the MTO demonstration
characteristics 
(including random assignment, outreach, training, and monitoring) with description of PHA and NPO operating characteristics
as they relate to the demonstration. It will compare the counseling and search assistance delivered to experimental
group participants (within the observation period) by the NPOs with the standard Section 8 counseling and other services
routinely offered by the PHAs to Section 8 certificate- and voucher-holders. While the report will not contain any
presentation of early participant or cost data from the demonstration,
 it will amply document the design and early implementation of the MTO demonstration. 




In preparation for the end of the Contractor's period of work, and for assumption of data collection and monitoring
activities directly by HUD, Department staff will develop plans for the tabulation and reporting of participant
and cost data to Congress, as required by the statute authorizing MTO. 



Part B Statistical Methods 



B1 Potential Respondent Universe 



The potential respondent universe for the Moving to Opportunity for Fair Housing Demonstration consists of two parts:
the families that apply for Section 8 through the demonstration (including informed consent to enroll), and the agencies
that are involved in the administration of the housing assistance and counseling program that form the demonstration.
As indicated in Part A of this request, the instruments for which clearance is requested fall into two groups, by parts
of the potential respondent universe, as follows: 




 Data collection forms with participant respondents_the Enrollment Form and Participant Baseline Survey;


 Data collection forms with agency respondents_the Participant Tracking Forms, Participant Counseling
log (optional), Program Cost Forms, and Landlord Outreach Log. 



MTO Demonstration Participants 



MTO demonstration participants are those families that (a) respond to MTO outreach conducted by the site agencies,
(b) receive information about MTO and about the different possible outcomes of applying (due to random assignment),
and (c) agree to join the demonstration by signing the Enrollment Form. Such participants must be families with children
currently receiving housing assistance (residing in either public housing or Section 8 project-based housing)
in the high-poverty census tracts designated by the local housing authority for the demonstration. 

Based upon the applications submitted by the five successful sites in response to the MTO NOFA, the size of the potential
participant respondent universe is shown in Exhibit B.1.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940719-2-00110 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940719-2-00062 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

 


These participants are the potential respondents for the Enrollment Form and Participant Baseline Survey. The sites
have confirmed to the Department that they will expand the targeted areas if it is necessary (for purposes of sufficient
sample size) to attract more families to the demonstration. 



MTO Demonstration Agencies 



There are 14 local agencies playing administrative roles in the MTO demonstration; they are listed in Exhibit B.2.
Of the 14, 10 will be reporting entities and are the potential respondents for these data collection instruments:
the Participant Tracking Forms, the Participant Counseling Log (optional), the Program Cost Forms, and the Landlord
Outreach Log. More specifically, the Participant Counseling Log and Landlord Outreach Log will only be used by the
NPOs; the other instruments will be completed by both types of agency. Note that 4 of the 9 nonprofits shown in the exhibit
are subcontractors to other nonprofits; for purposes of discussing respondent burden, in Part A13 above, it was indicated
that data collection responsibilities lay with the prime nonprofit in each site.

B2 Statistical Methods 


This section contains five parts. B2.1 presents the MTO demonstration's stratification and sampling plans. Section
B2.2 discusses sampling procedures. B2.3 presents the justification of level of accuracy achieved by the sample
sizes. Section B2.4 discusses any problems requiring specialized sampling procedures. Section B2.5 addresses
the topic of use of less frequent data collection cycles.



B2.1 Stratification and Sampling Plans 


The sample for the evaluation will consist of families who apply to the demonstration and are randomly assigned to
one of three groups:



 The experimental group, which will receive geographically restricted certificates or vouchers, along with
counseling and assistance in finding a private unit to lease;
 The Section 8 control group, which will receive regular Section 8 certificates or vouchers, which are geographically
unrestricted; and 
 The in-place control group, which will receive no certificates or vouchers, but will continue to receive project-based
assistance.



Exhibit B.3 shows the optimal allocation of the sample among these three groups. This allocation assumes: 



 The Department is interested in estimating the difference in impacts between the MTO treatment and the regular
Section 8 program (or, alternatively, the difference in impacts between living in the central city outside housing
projects and living in the suburbs); 
 The lease-up rate in the Section 8 group will be 70 percent; and 
 1,800 certificates or vouchers will be available for the demonstration, all of which can be used interchangeably
as MTO certificates or vouchers or as regular Section 8 certificates or vouchers. 



The exhibit shows two alternative sample allocations (and total sample sizes), one based on an assumed lease-up rate
of 20 percent in the experimental group and one based on an assumed lease-up rate of 40 percent in that group.
 Because the certificates and vouchers issued to the experimental group participants can only be used in certain low-poverty
areas outside the neighborhoods where these families would ordinarily seek housing, we expect that even with special
counseling and assistance their lease-up rate will be substantially lower than that of the regular Section 8 group.
However, given the limited experience with this type of program, it is very difficult to predict what that rate will
be. Therefore, we show sample allocations for lease-up rates that bracket the likely range of rates for this group.





Under the assumption of a 20 percent lease-up rate, it will require 4,500 families in the experimental group and 1,286
families in the Section 8 control group to produce 900 leased-up families in each, the optimal division of certificates
or vouchers between the two groups. An additional 3,214 families will be required for the in-place control group,
for a total sample size of 9,000 families. With a 40 percent lease-up rate in the experimental group, only 2,250 families
would be needed in that group to produce 900 leased-up families. Under this assumption, the optimal number of in-place
controls also falls to 964, for a total sample size of 4,500 families.

<DOCNO> FR940719-2-00112 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940719-2-00062 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 



The final sample size will be determined by the actual lease-up rate (i.e., the number of families actually required
to exhaust the 1,800 certificates/vouchers available) and the random assignment ratio. In the absence of reliable
knowledge about the lease-up rate to be expected in the experimental group, the Contractor plans to take the conservative
approach of setting the initial random assignment ratio based on the assumption of a 20 percent lease-up rate in this
group. If, as the demonstration progresses, this group experiences a higher lease-up rate, the random assignment
ratio can be adjusted accordingly. 


B2.2 Sampling Procedures 


As specified in the authorizing legislation, the MTO demonstration will be targeted to very low-income families
with children who reside in public housing or receive project-based Section 8 assistance in specific high-poverty
areas of five large cities. Participating PHAs will notify all eligible families within the designated demonstration
areas of the availability of assistance to move out of project-based housing.
The first step in intake will be to determine the eligibility of applicant families. This involves verifying the applicant's
family composition, income, and legal tenancy in public or project-based Section 8 housing in the designated high-poverty
census tracts. At this stage, families will be reminded that, because demonstration slots are limited, not all eligible
applicants can be accepted; those to be accepted will be chosen by a lottery. They will be asked to agree to participate
in the study (i.e. provide any information or cooperation that is requested by the researchers) even if they are not
chosen to receive demonstration assistance. 
At this point, after signing the Enrollment Form, baseline data for the experimental analysis will be collected.
It is important that these data be collected before applicants are assigned to any specific assistance group, in order
to ensure that their responses are not influenced by knowledge of the group to which they have been assigned. 
The next step in the intake process will be random assignment of applicant families to an experimental group that receives
assistance under MTO, a control group that receives regular Section 8 certificates/vouchers, or to an in-place control
group that receives no certificates or vouchers. 
Families assigned to the regular Section 8 program will receive the standard PHA briefing and any other assistance
the PHA would normally provide Section 8 enrollees. Since all applicants will have expressed an interest in moving
out of project-based housing, it is assumed that virtually all will take the Section 8 certificates or vouchers and
begin searching for acceptable housing. Those who are successful in finding units that pass PHA inspection will move;
those who are unsuccessful will remain in their public or project-based housing. 
Families assigned to the experimental group will receive a standard briefing from the PHA and will be issued an MTO
certificate/voucher. They will then be invited for a preliminary counseling session with the nonprofit organization
(NPO) involved in the demonstration. Some of these families may decide not to search once they learn more about the
MTO certificates/vouchers' restriction to use in low-poverty areas. Those who elect to continue will receive further
NPO counseling and assistance in locating acceptable units in low-poverty areas. 
Families randomly assigned to the in-place control group will be informed that, because the number of applicants
exceeded the number of certificates/vouchers available for this special demonstration, they will not receive assistance
in moving. They will, however, continue to receive project-based assistance and could be wait-listed for Section
8 existing program assistance. 
Random assignment will occur after collection of the baseline data and before any Section 8 briefing. It will be important
that PHA staff determine each applicant's eligibility and collect baseline data prior to random assignment, to ensure
that no ineligibles are included in the sample and that responses to the baseline instruments are not influenced by
knowledge of the treatment to which the family has been assigned. It will also be important to ensure that, following
random assignment, families receive a careful explanation of the nature and terms of the assistance they are being
offered (or, if they are being offered no new assistance, that they remain eligible for their current assistance).
To avoid confusion, briefings for the experimental and regular Section 8 control groups will be conducted separately.

The fact that some intake activities must occur before random assignment and others must occur after, but perhaps
within the same visit by the participant to the PHA office, means that random assignment must be capable of being conducted
with very quick turn-around. The most efficient way to accomplish this is for PHA staff to conduct random assignment
on-site. To ensure that random assignment is conducted properly, and that staff cannot ``game'' the procedure, the
Contractor has developed a computerized random assignment routine that can be run by local program staff on virtually
any personal computer, with minimal training. Intake staff need only respond to on-screen prompts for the applicant's
name, date of birth, and Social Security number; 
 the random assignment routine will then automatically display the family's assignment on the screen and store it
on the diskette containing the random assignment software. 




Demonstration staff will inform the applicants of their assignments and refer the MTO and regular Section 8 groups
to their respective briefings. Those assigned to remain in-place will be informed that, because the number of applicants
exceeded the number that could be assisted in this special demonstration, the PHA was not able to give them a certificate/voucher.
They will be assured, however, that they will continue to receive their current project-based assistance. PHA staff
will give applicants this information both orally and in writing, ensuring that all applicants in this group receive
the same information and providing them a document to refer to if they have subsequent questions about their status.

B2.3 Justification of Level of Accuracy 





The precision of the impact estimates is measured by the size of the smallest program 
effect that could be detected as statistically significant at the .05 level with 80 percent power 
with a given sample. This is the ``minimum detectable effect.'' 



Exhibit B.4 shows the minimum program effects on several different outcomes that would 
be detectable under the optimal sample allocation shown in Exhibit B.3.
 The top panel of the 
exhibit is based on the conservative assumption that the lease-up rate for the experimental group 
will be 20 percent; the bottom panel assumes a 40 percent lease-up rate for this group. 







As shown in Exhibit B.4, if the lease-up rate for the experimental group turns out to be 
20 percent, we can be confident of detecting a program-induced increase of 7 percentage points 
in the educational attainment rate of children in families who lease up in the Section 8 control 
group_an increase of 14 percent in the proportion receiving a high school diploma or GED.
 
A 6.4 percentage point increase in the employment rate of adults who lease up in the Section 
8 control group would be detectable with 80 percent power, as would a $992 (13 percent) 
increase in their earnings. 







Because a much smaller proportion of the experimental group is expected to lease up 
successfully and receive assistance, effects on assistance recipients in this group must be much 
larger to be detectable. With a 20 percent lease-up rate, the minimum detectable effects on 
educational attainment and earnings are both about one-third of the control mean for this group. 
The smallest detectable effect on the employment rate of MTO assistance recipients will be about 
16 percentage points. 



The final column of Exhibit B.4's upper panel shows the minimum detectable differences 
between the impact on the regular Section 8 group and the impact on the MTO group. If the 
MTO lease-up rate is 20 percent, differences in impact in the 21 to 32 percent range would be 
detectable.

As shown in the bottom panel of Exhibit B.4, substantially smaller effects will be 
detectable if the lease-up rate in the MTO group turns out to be 40 percent. In particular, 
differences in impact between the regular Section 8 group and the MTO group of 15 to 22 
percent will be detectable if the lease-up rate is 40 percent. 



Minimum detectable effects for site-specific estimates will be about 2.24 times as large 
as those for the pooled five-site estimates. Therefore, only very large program impacts will be 
detectable within individual sites. 



The minimum detectable effects on employment rates estimated here for the pooled five-site sample (even for the more
conservative lease-up rate assumption) are of the same order of 
magnitude as the effects found by Rosenbaum and Fischer in their studies of mobility programs 
for public housing tenants and applicants, and the minimum detectable effects on educational 
attainment are similar to the effect Rosenbaum found for school dropout rates.
 This suggests 
that the demonstration sample will be adequate to detect effects of the size that are likely to 
occur. However, it must be borne in mind that those earlier studies may have been subject to 
selection bias that would inflate their estimates of program impact. 







The minimum detectable effects shown here are based on HUD's initial commitment of 
certificates and vouchers to the MTO experimental design, totalling 1,800. A further allocation 
of about 1,500 certificates and vouchers is available in FY94.
 The proportion of these 
resources that will be devoted to the experimental evaluation of MTO has not yet been 
determined; some may be reserved for demonstrations of different MTO administrative models. 
However, Exhibit B.5 shows the minimum detectable effects that would be attainable if this 
entire allocation were used to increase the sample size for the experimental evaluation of MTO 
to 3,300 certificates and vouchers.

This increase in the sample reduces the minimum detectable effects by about 25 percent. As can be seen in the exhibit,
with this sample size, differences in impact in the range of 15 to 23 percent would be detectable if the MTO lease-up
rate is 20 percent. Even smaller differences, in the 11 to 18 percent range, would be detectable if the MTO lease-up
rate is 40 percent. 



B2.4 Problems Requiring Specialized Sampling Procedures 



The data collection for the Moving to Opportunity demonstration does not require any specialized sampling procedures.




B2.5 Use of Less Frequent Data Collection Cycles 



The instruments covered in this request for OMB clearance have different collection cycles, as follows:

 


 The 

data collection forms with participant respondents_

the Enrollment Form and Participant Baseline Survey_are designed for one-time administration only. 

 The 

data collection forms with agency respondents_

the Participant Tracking Forms, the Participant Counseling log (optional), the Program Cost Forms, and the Landlord
Outreach Log_are designed for periodic collection, described below.

 


Of the latter group of forms, the Participant Tracking Forms, the Program Cost Forms, and the Landlord Outreach Logs
will be collected on a monthly basis during the period of MTO intake. Monthly collection of tracking forms is essential
because of the likelihood that many of the participants will be moving as a result of receiving Section 8 assistance;
close tracking in the search and lease-up period will form the foundation of the long-term tracking effort designed
to support measurement of program impacts over a ten-year period. Monthly collection of cost forms matches the typical
accounting cycle of site agencies and is essential for meeting the Congressional mandate to compare MTO's costs with
those of the regular Section 8 program. Thus, Congress's intent in creating MTO necessitates the use of monthly data
collection cycles for these items. Finally, aggressive landlord outreach is expected to be important to the program's
success. For this reason, it is essential to monitor NPO efforts in this area monthly. 



The Participant Counseling log (or local equivalent) will be collected only twice during the demonstration, at the
mid-point and end of the Contractor's monitoring period. This form is primarily for NPO management of the demonstration,
although its contents will be used in describing the efforts of the site agencies to counsel and support participants.




B3 Response Rate 



B3.1 Procedures to Maximize Response Rate and Handle Nonresponse 



Concerns about maintaining a high response rate have been addressed by the Department by means of the following strategies.
For the 

data collection forms to be completed by the site agencies, 

the Department has sought to ensure a high level of response by:

 


 Notifying the demonstration site applicants, as part of the Notice of Funding Availability, that participation
in the record-keeping and data collection of the demonstration is a mandatory component; 

 Agreeing to provide an on-site assistant to help with the collection of data; and 

 Involving the demonstration sites in the development of the data collection forms; and 

 Contracting with Abt Associates to monitor and provide technical assistance to demonstration sites.

 


For the 

forms to be completed by participants, 

The Department has sought to achieve a high response rate by (1) collecting the data during the Section 8 application
process, and (2) using a ``guided self-administered'' mode to collect the data. The Enrollment Form and Baseline
Survey are designed as self-administered forms. However, the site assistants hired by the Contractor to assist the
demonstration, one in each city, will help the participants by reading the questions aloud while the participants
are completing the forms and fielding any questions from participants who may have difficulty understanding the
questions due to limited literacy or language skills. 

The site assistants will be hired and trained by Abt Associates, the Contractor. In addition, Abt will assign a field
manager to provide ongoing training and supervision of the site assistants. The field manager and site assistants
hired for this data collection will need the following qualifications, at a minimum:

 


 A proven track record conducting interviews with AFDC recipients and other low-income populations; 


</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940719-2-00116 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940719-2-00062 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

 Experience working with local agencies and their record-keeping systems; and 

 A sufficient understanding of the MTO demonstration and the operational and research goals motivating the
data collection.

 


Abt Associates has extensive experience in the collection of data on-site. The field manager and site assistant positions
will be staffed from Abt's national network of experienced field interviewers. 



Just prior to the beginning of the data collection, Abt will bring the field data collection team together for an intensive,
two-day training session. Using a combination of written training materials and role-playing, the site assistants
will be briefed on the participant instruments. They will also be thoroughly oriented to the agency data collection
forms. In addition, the site assistants will receive a comprehensive discussion of the demonstration and its data
collection needs. 

The field manager will have responsibility for maintaining the quality and flow of the data collection at each site.
To accomplish this, the field manager will attend the full three-day training session for staff from the five MTO sites.
The field manager will also visit each site early in the data collection period, to become familiar with the MTO staff
and operations at each PHA and NPO and work with the site assistant to provide the most effective support for the demonstration
at the site. Throughout the data collection period, the field manager will maintain regular contact with the site
assistants (no less frequently than once a week) and the MTO staff at the sites. The field manager in turn, will report
to the data collection director at Abt on the progress of the data collection, any problems that arise, and potential
solutions. 



B3.2 Expected Response Rate 



Because completion of the Enrollment Form and Baseline Survey is part of the process of applying for the MTO demonstration,
and due to the assistance described in Section B3.1 above, response rates of virtually 100 percent are expected from
participant respondents. 

With regard to agency respondents, all PHAs and NPOs applying for the MTO demonstration in response to the NOFA have
signed statements agreeing to cooperate with the special record-keeping and data collection requirements of the
demonstration. There may be further special language to this effect in the grant agreements governing the award of
counseling funds from HUD to the NPOs. These requirements, in combination with the assistance provided by the Contractor,
should produce extremely high response rates on all instruments to be completed by the site agencies. 



B4 Tests of Procedures or Methods/Results of Pre-testing 



The Department's Contractor, Abt Associates, developed the data collection forms for this submission. Abt has consulted
the PHAs and NPOs involved in MTO; staff from these organizations reviewed draft versions of the program operation
forms (the Participant Tracking Logs, Participant Counseling Log, Program Cost Forms, and Landlord Outreach Logs)
and provided feedback on their design and feasibility. 

In developing the Baseline Survey, the Contractor also reviewed numerous existing instruments and consulted with
the Department's experts' panel. To the greatest extent possible, the MTO baseline survey uses tested questions
from prior studies. Below is a list of the major topic areas included in the survey and the sources consulted for each
area: 



Mobility:

 The Gautreaux studies, James Rosenbaum and Susan Popkin, Northwestern University; Cincinnati Special Mobility
program study, Paul Fischer, Lake Forest College; Greg Duncan, University of Michigan.

<DOCTITLE>Occupancy, Camping Stay Limits and Supplementary Rules</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Bureau of Land Management, Interior.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of final camping limit and supplementary rules under 43 CFR subpart 8365.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This occupancy and camping stay limit applies to designated campgrounds and to undeveloped Bureau of Land Management
administered public lands (that are not closed to camping) within the Susanville District, California. Persons
camping on the public lands in the Susanville District are limited to a total of twenty-eight (28) days per year. A fourteen
(14) day consecutive limit is established for any one location. Campers must move a minimum of 2 miles when changing
from one location to another. Camping along the Bizz Johnson Trail on BLM land is limited to three (3) days between each
trailhead. No camping is allowed at or within one (1) mile of Hobo Camp or Devil's Corral trailheads and is prohibited
along the south side road that extends west of Hobo Camp within the Susan River Canyon. Under special circumstances
and upon request, the authorized officer may give written permission for extension of these limits.



In accordance with 43 CFR 8365.1-6, the following supplementary rules are hereby established for the entire
Susanville District.

1. Firearms discharge is prohibited within 1/4 mile of all trailheads on the Susanville District.

2. No person may leave personal property unattended in campgrounds, developed recreation areas, or elsewhere on
public lands within the Susanville District for a period of more than seventy-two (72) hours without written permission
from the authorized officer.

3. No person shall discharge or ignite a firecracker, rocket or other firework, or explosive without authorization
from the BLM.

4. No person shall cut or remove live standing trees or any portion thereof except when authorized by BLM permits or
timber sale contracts.

5. Campfires are allowed in designated fire-safe areas or on existing natural bare mineral soil where ten (10) feet
or more of clearance exists between the campfire area and adjacent vegetation. Campfires along the Bizz Johnson Trail
on BLM land are only allowed in designated areas. Persons using campfires are required to have a campfire permit issued
by the Bureau of Land Management, the U.S. Forest Service, or the California Department of Forestry. All campfires
are subject to seasonal fire restrictions.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

This occupancy and camping stay limit is being established to provide consistency and uniformity for the camping
public on Bureau of Land Management administered lands throughout the Susanville District, California, and to prevent
user conflicts by providing equal opportunities to camp in given areas. Establishment of this length of stay limit
is also to assist the Bureau in reducing the incidence of unauthorized occupancy of public lands in the name of recreational
camping. These supplementary rules do not supersede camping and occupancy rules developed for special areas or emergency
situations. The supplementary rules are to protect resources and to improve the safety of recreational users of the
public lands.



In response to public comments received and further review by BLM of the proposed camping stay limits and supplementary
rules, the following changes were made from the draft proposal. This resulted in the present limits and rules. The
proposed camping stay limit on the Bizz Johnson Trail was reduced from seven days to three days. The twenty-eight day
limit per year is for the entire district and not twenty-eight days in each of three resource areas.

Authority for this stay and the supplementary rules are contained in CFR title 43, chapter II, part 8360, subparts
8365.1-2(a) and 8365.1-6.




PENALTIES: 

Violations of any regulations in this part by a member of the public, except for the provisions of 8365.1-7, are
punishable by fine not to exceed $1,000 and/or imprisonment not to exceed 12 months. Violations of supplementary
rules authorized by 8365.1-6 are punishable in the same manner.

<DOCTITLE>Rules of Conduct and Final Supplementary Rules for Certain Public Lands Managed by the Bureau of Land Management,
Las Vegas District</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Bureau of Land Management, Interior.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Rules of conduct and final supplementary rules for certain public lands known as Ash Springs located in the unincorporated
town of Ash Springs along U.S. Highway 93, Las Vegas District, Lincoln County, Nevada.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The rules of conduct and supplementary rules are necessary for the management of activities on public land at Ash Springs,
Lincoln County, Nevada. These rules of conduct and supplementary rules would be limited to activities occurring
within the following area, hereafter referred to as Ash Springs:



Mount Diablo Meridian, Nevada


T. 6 S., R. 61 E.,


Sec. 6 NW1/4NW1/4.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Ash Springs contains the White River Springfish (

Crenichthys baileyi baileyi

) a Federal listed endangered species. A Coordinated Resource Management Plan was developed for the area; one of the
planned actions was to establish rules to restrict certain activities to protect the fish species.




The proposed supplementary rules were published in the 

Federal Register

 on Friday, October 15, 1993 on page 53557. One comment was received from the Nevada Division of Wildlife (NDOW) during
the 30 day comment period ending on November 15, 1993. The NDOW expressed concerns that the 2 hour limit was too restrictive
and that they would not be able to carry out their necessary duties at Ash Springs within this time limit. They also expressed
confusion on the way proposed rule I(E) was written.

Authority for these supplementary rules is contained in CFR title 43, chapter II, part 8360, subpart 8365.1-6.
Authority for other rules that could apply are contained in CFR title 43, chapter II, part 8360, subparts 8365.1-1,
8365.1-2, 8365.1-3, 8365.1-4, 8365.1-5, 8365.1-7, 8365.2-1, 8365.2-2,
8365.2-3, 8365.2-4, 8365.2-5. 

The following are the final supplementary rules for Ash Springs:

1. The following actions are prohibited, within Ash Springs:

a. Overnight Camping. 

Camping means the erecting of a tent or shelter of natural or synthetic material, preparing a sleeping bag or other
bedding material for use, or parking of a motor vehicle, motor home or trailer for the apparent purpose of overnight
occupancy.



b. Occupancy or use of Ash Springs by any individual, or any group, is limited to 2 hours during any 24 hour period. The
intent of this rule is to establish a time frame that can be used to resolve conflicts between two or more parties using
the spring at one time.

c. Introducing wildlife, fish, or plants, including their reproductive bodies, into Ash Springs, except when authorized
by the District Manager.

d. Collecting wood or other plant material for use in a campfire or any other purpose.

e. Washing dishes, animals, or one's self with any detergents and/or soaps.

f. Operating a motorized vehicle off of designated roads, trails, or parking area.




Designation shall be marked by the posting of appropriate signs or markers, or by the erection of physical barriers,
or both.

2. The supplementary rules for Ash Springs do not apply to employees or contractors of any Federal or State agency when
engaged in performance of official duties.

3. Violation of any of these supplementary rules is punishable by a fine not to exceed $1,000, imprisonment not to exceed
12 months, or both, as provided for under the Federal Land Policy and Management Act (Pub. L. 94-579) as amended
at 18 U.S.C. 3571(b)(s).

Draft Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement to Continue the Program of Protecting the Southwest Border Through
the Interdiction of Illegal Drugs With the Support of the Joint Task Force Six


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

The Immigration and Naturalization Service, Justice. Joint Task Force Six, Environmental Agency.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of availability of the draft programmatic environmental impact statement (DPEIS).



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This Notice is to notify interested parties that the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) has prepared a
DPEIS for the proposed continuation of the Joint Task Force Six (JTF-6) support Program. The JTF-6 Program
involves providing operational, engineering, and general support to Law Enforcement Agencies (LEAs) that have
drug interdiction responsibilities within the southwestern border states.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
Statutory Authority


This Notice is being issued to interested parties in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA),
Public Law 91-190, and Regulations for Implementing the Procedural Provisions of NEPA, 40 CFR parts 1500-1508.
These Regulations allow for a 45-day comment period from the date the DPEIS is submitted to Environmental Protection
Agency and the Notice of availability is published in the 

Federal Register

. That date was April 15, 1994.


Background


JTF-6 was activated on November 13, 1989, at Fort Bliss, Texas, by the Secretary of Defense in accordance with
the President's National Drug Control Strategy. The thrust of this program is the use of Department of Defense training
resources in the support of agencies responsible for the fight against illegal drugs.
The mission of JTF-6 is to plan and coordinate military training along the U.S. Southwest Land Border in support
of counter-drug activities by Federal, State, and Local LEA's, as requested through Operation Alliance and approved
by the Secretary of Defense or a designated representative.
The JTF-6 Program provides operational, engineering, and general support to LEAs operating within the Southwestern
United States which have drug interdiction authority and allows the LEAs to conduct their missions more efficiently
and effectively. The actions performed by JTF-6 personnel are quite diverse, ranging from reconnaissance
operations to the building and renovation of roads and radio towers. The JTF-6's primary area of concern is within
a 50-mile-wide corridor along the U.S./Mexico Border from Port Arthur, Texas, to San Diego, California.
The INS is responsible for the prevention of smuggling and unlawful entry of aliens into the United States. This is
the task of the Border Patrol, which also has been designated the primary law enforcement component responsible for
drug interdiction between the U.S. land Ports-of-Entry.
Since the Border Patrol has been the primary beneficiary of most JTF-6 engineering actions to date, INS elected
to act as lead agency for the preparation of this DPEIS. The Environmental Protection Agency and JTF-6 elected
to act as cooperating agencies. A Notice of Intent to prepare a PEIS was published on July 15, 1993, in the 

Federal Register

 at 58 FR 38140.


Purpose


The purpose of the DPEIS is to address cumulative environmental impacts of previous actions as well as those actions
which may be developed within the reasonably foreseeable future. The DPEIS analyzes these cumulative impacts and
generically examines the impacts of future individual actions based on experience with similar past actions. The
DPEIS also describes the different types of actions performed by JTF-6.


Proposed Action


Based on performance accomplishments, INS wishes to have JTF-6 continue to provide the support services to
the LEA's at the same or similar levels that have occurred since November 1989. The support services provided by JTF-6
to the LEA's are characterized as operational, engineering, and general.
This proposed action complies with the National Defense Authorization Act (Pub. L. 101-510, as amended) and
the President's National Drug Control Strategy, in accordance with Section 1005 of the Anti Drug Abuse Act (Pub. L.
100-690). Continuation of the JTF-6 Program is INS' preferred alternative.


Alternatives


1. No action, which essentially is a discontinuation of the JTF-6 support services to the LEA's.
2. To continue the JTF-6 Program without the engineering support services, which is the support category that
has greatest potential for environmental impacts.

The Life Insurance Company of Virginia



May 12, 1994.



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or the ``Commission'').



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of Application for an order under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the ``1940 Act'').





APPLICANTS: 

The Life Insurance Company of Virginia (``Life of Virginia''), Life of Virginia Separate Account I, Life of Virginia
Separate Account II, Life of Virginia Separate Account III, Aon Advisors, Inc. (``AAI''), and Aon Savings Plan (the
``Plan''). (The three separate accounts shall be referred to collectively as the ``Accounts.'' The Accounts, Life
of Virginia, AAI, and the Plan shall be referred to collectively as the ``Applicants.'')




RELEVANT 1940 ACT SECTIONS: 

Order requested under Section 6(c) of the 1940 Act for exemptions from sections 9(a), 13(a), 15(a) and 15(b) of the
1940 Act, and Rule 6e-3(T)(b)(15) thereunder; and an order requested under section 17(b) of the 1940 Act for
exemptions from section 17(a) of the 1940 Act.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY OF APPLICATION: 

The Accounts and Life of Virginia seek an order exempting them and certain other separate accounts (the ``future accounts'')
established in the future by Life of Virginia, or any life insurance company affiliate of Life of Virginia, from the
provisions of sections 9(a), 13(a), 15(a) and 15(b) of the 1940 Act, and Rule 6e-3(T)(b)(15) thereunder, to
permit the Accounts and the future accounts to hold shares of Life of Virginia Series Fund, Inc. (the ``Fund'') at the
same time that the Fund offers its shares to the Plan or other qualified pension or retirement plans. In addition, AAI
and the Plan seek an order exempting them from section 17(a) of the 1940 Act to the extent necessary to permit the Plan
to purchase certain classes of shares of the Fund with investment securities of the Plan.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Following is a summary of the application. The complete application is available for a fee from the Commission's Public
Reference Branch.



Applicants' Representations



1. Life of Virginia, a stock life insurance company organized under the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia on March
21, 1871, is a wholly owned subsidiary of Combined Insurance Company of America, which is a wholly owned subsidiary
of Aon Corportion. Life of Virginia is the depositor and sponsor of the Accounts.

2. Each of the Accounts is a separate account registered under the 1940 Act as a unit investment trust. The Accounts
act as funding media for variable life insurance policies issued by Life of Virginia. Life of Virginia Separate Account
I has four subdivisions; Life of Virginia Account II and Life of Virginia Separate Account III each have nineteen subdivisions.
Four of the subdivisions of each of the Accounts invest in one of the four investment portfolios of the Fund.

3. Life of Virginia and other life insurance companies directly or indirectly owned by Aon Corporation may establish
variable life insurance separate accounts in the future that also would need to rely on the exemptions requested herein
by the Accounts and Life of Virginia. Any such future separate accounts would be registered under the 1940 Act as unit
investment trusts. 

4. AAI, a wholly owned subsidiary of Aon Corporation, in engaged primarily in the business of providing investment
management and advice to pension plans, corporations, investment companies and other organizations. AAI is registered
under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, is the investment adviser to the Fund, and manages certain Plan assets.

5. The Plan was authorized by the board of directors of Aon Corporation. Interests in the Plan are registered under
the Securities Act of 1933 (File No. 33-27984). The Plan currently offers participants four investment options:
Aon Corporation common stock, interest in a pool of guaranteed investment contracts, interests in a money market
investment portfolio, and interest in a balanced investment portfolio. 

6. Participation in the Plan is open to all eligible employees of Aon Corporation and its subsidiaries_including
Life of Virginia and AAI_which have adopted the Plan. The Plan is intended to qualify under section 401(a) and 501(a)
of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the ``Code''), and includes a cash or deferred arrangement intended
to quality under section 401(k) of the Code. The Plan is also subject to the provisions of the Employee Retirement Income
Security Act of 1974 (``ERISA''), applicable to defined contribution profit sharing plans.

7. The Plan trustees are appointed by Aon Corporation, and currently are all employers of Aon Corporation subsidiaries.
Under the terms of the Plan, Aon Corporation retains the right to appoint other individuals or corporations as trustees,
including persons not affiliated with Aon Corporation. The Plan is administered by a plan committee consisting of
various employees of Aon Corporation and its subsidiaries. 

8. The Fund was incorporated under the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia on May 14, 1984, and is registered under
the 1940 Act as an open-end diversified management investment company. The Fund consists of four series: Common Stock
Index Portfolio, Government Securities, Money Market Portfolio and Total Return Portfolio.

9. To date, the Fund has offered its shares only to Life of Virginia (as seed money investments), the Accounts, and Life
of Virginia Separate Account 4 (``Account 4''), a variable annuity separate account. The Fund offers each series
of shares to corresponding subdivisions of each of the Accounts to support variable life insurance contracts (``VLI
contracts'') and to Account 4 to support variable annuity contracts (``VA contracts''). (The VLI contracts and the
VA contracts shall be referred to collectively as the ``variable contracts.'')

10. In light of recent changes in the federal tax law which have created the opportunity for the Fund to substantially
increase its net assets by selling shares to the Plan and to other qualified pension or retirement plans, the Accounts
and Life of Virginia propose that the Fund be permitted to sell its shares directly to the Plan and to unaffiliated pension
or retirement plans subject to ERISA and Sections 401(a) and 501(a) of the Code (the ``unaffiliated plans''). 
For purposes of the 1940 Act, the unaffiliated plans will not be affiliated persons of the Fund or of the Applicants
or affiliated persons of such persons. Nor will the trustees and the other fiduciaries of the unaffiliated plans be
affiliated persons of the Fund or of the Applicants or affiliated persons of such persons.

11. Applicants state that Section 817(h) of the Code imposes certain diversification standards on the assets underlying
variable contracts held in the portfolios of the Fund. The Code provides that variable contracts will not be treated
as annuity contracts or life insurance contracts, as the case may be, for any period for which the underlying assets
are not diversified in accordance with Treasury Department regulations.

12. Treasury Regulation 1.817-5 establishes specific diversification requirements for the investment portfolios
underlying variable contracts. The regulation generally provides that, in order to meet these diversification
requirements, all of the beneficial interests in the investment company must be held by the segregated assets account
of one or more life insurance companies. However, the regulation also contains an exception to this requirement that
permits trustees of a qualified pension or retirement plan to hold shares of an investment company_the shares of which
are also held by insurance company segregated asset accounts_without adversely affecting the status of the investment
company as an adequately diversified underlying investment for variable contracts issued through such segregated
asset accounts. 

13. As a result of this exception to the general diversification requirement, qualified pension and retirement plans
(such as the Plan or the unaffiliated plans) may select the Fund as an investment option without endangering the tax
status of Life of Virginia VLI contracts issued through the Accounts or VA contracts issued through Account 4. Fund
shares sold to the Plan or to the unaffiliated plans would be held by their respective trustees, as required by section
403(a) of ERISA. The Plan trustees would generally vote Fund shares that they hold for the Plan in accordance with instructions
solicited from Plan participants. The trustees or other fiduciaries of the unaffiliated plans may vote Fund shares
held by their plans in their own discretion or, if the applicable plan so provides, in accordance with instructions
from participants in such plans.

14. Applicants also propose that, in one or more discrete instances, the Plan be permitted to purchase Funds shares
using investment securities held in one of the investment portfolios currently offered to Plan participants.

15. Applicants represent that the investment objectives of the money market and balanced investment portfolios
offered by the Plan are very similar to the investment objective of the Fund's Money Market Portfolio and Total Return
Portfolio, respectively. Accordingly, Applicants propose that, subject to the approval of the Fund's board of directors
and the judgment of the Plan trustees that the proposed transactions do not violate the prohibited transaction and
fiduciary duty requirements of ERISA, the Plan be permitted to use the assets of its money market portfolio to purchase
shares of the Fund's Money Market Portfolio and the assets of its balanced portfolio to purchase shares of the Fund's
Total Return Portfolio. If the proposed consolidations were to occur, the Plan would initially acquire a substantial
majority of the outstanding shares of these two Fund portfolios.



Applicants' Legal Analysis and Conclusions



A. Request for Exemptions Under Sections 6(c)



(i) General Grounds for Relief



1. Life of Virginia and the accounts request that the Commission issue an order pursuant to section 6(c) of the 1940
Act, exempting them as well as any future accounts from the provisions of sections 9(a), 13(a), 15(a) and 15(b) of the
1940 Act and Rule 6e-3(T)(b)(15) thereunder to the extent necessary for the Accounts and any future accounts to hold
shares of the Fund at the same time that the Plan and the unaffiliated plans hold shares of the Fund. Life of Virginia
and the Accounts submit that the requested exemptions are appropriate in the public interest and consistent with
the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the 1940 Act.

2. Life of Virginia and the Accounts currently rely on the exemptions provided by Rule 6e-3(T)(b)(15) under
the 1940 Act, which provides partial exemptions from sections 9(a), 13(a), and 15(b) of the 1940 Act for certain VLI
contracts. However, the exemptions granted by the Rule are available only where: (i) The Fund offers its shares 

exclusively

 to separate accounts of Life of Virginia or any life insurance company affiliate of Life of Virginia offering either
scheduled premium variable life insurance contracts or flexible premium variable life insurance contracts, or
both; or (ii) the Fund offers its shares to variable annuity separate accounts of Life of Virginia or of any life insurance
company affiliate of Life of Virginia. The Rule 6e-(T)(b)(15) exemptions would not be available to Life of Virginia,
the Accounts, or any future accounts if the Fund were to sell its shares to the Plan or to unaffiliated plans.
3. In general, section 9(a) of the 1940 Act disqualifies any person convicted of certain offenses, and any company
affiliated with that person, from acting or serving in various capacities with respect to a registered investment
company. Section 9(a)(3) provides that it is unlawful for any company to serve as investment adviser or principal
underwriter for any registered open-end investment company if an affiliated person of that company is subject to
a disqualification enumerated in sections 9(a) (1) or (2). However, Rule 6e-3(T)(b)(15) (i) and (ii) provides
exemptions from section 9(a), under certain circumstances and subject to certain conditions that limit the application
of the eligibility restrictions of section 9(a) to affiliated individuals or companies that directly participate
in the management of the Fund.
4. Life of Virginia and the Accounts assert that the partial relief provided by Rule 6e-3(T)(b)(15) effectively
limits the amount of monitoring of personnel that Life of Virginia and its affiliates would have to conduct to ensure
compliance with section 9 to that which is appropriate in light of the policy and purposes of section 9. Life of Virginia
and the Accounts further assert that the Rule recognizes that it is not necessary for the protection of investors or
the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the 1940 Act to apply the provisions of section 9(a) to
the many hundreds of individuals in a large insurance company complex, most of whom typically have no involvement
in matters pertaining to investment companies affiliated with that organization.
5. Rule 6e-3(T)(b)(15)(iii) also provides partial exemptions from sections 13(a), 15(a) and 15(b) of the 1940
Act to the extent that, under certain limited circumstances, the Rule permits Life of Virginia and any life insurance
company affiliates thereof that establish future accounts: (i) to disregard the voting instructions of VLI contract
owners if following such instructions would cause Life of Virginia to make (or refrain from making) certain investments
that would result in changes in the subclassification or investment objectives of the Fund; or (ii) (subject to the
provisions of paragraphs (b)(5)(i) and (b)(7)(ii)(A) of Rule 6e-3(T)) to approve or disapprove any contract
between the Fund and AAI, when such action is mandated by insurance regulatory authority.
6. Life of Virginia and the Accounts assert that historically, the exclusivity provision in Rule 6e-3(T)(b)(15)
evolved from the Commission's concern about possible divergent interests between or among different classes of
investors (

e.g.,

 variable contract owners) in mutual funds supporting variable life insurance separate accounts. The unit investment
trust structure for supporting VLI contracts created the opportunity for a mutual fund underlying a trust also to
offer its shares to a variable annuity separate account (hereinafter, ``mixed funding''). Rule 6e-3(T)(b)(15)
was designed to permit a separate account supporting both flexible and scheduled premium VLI contracts to share the
same underlying fund and engage in mixed funding.
7. Life of Virginia and the Accounts maintain that the proposed Plan and unaffiliated plan investments in the Fund
should not increase the likelihood of material irreconcilable conflicts, and should benefit VA and VLI contracts
owners.
8. Life of Virginia and the Accounts maintain that qualified retirement plan investors in the Fund would have substantially
the same interests as current variable contract owners. Like variable contract owners, qualified retirement plan
investors are long-term investors. Therefore, most can be expected not to withdraw their assets from the Plan or the
unaffiliated plans. In addition, since neither variable contract owners nor Plan and unaffiliated plan investors
would be taxed on the investment return of their respective investments in the Fund, they would be taxed on the investment
return of their respective investments in the Fund, they would share a strong interest in the Fund operating in a manner
that preserves its tax status. For these reasons, Life of Virginia and the Accounts represent that material conflicts
between these two groups of investors regarding capital transactions are unlikely. Life of Virginia and the Accounts
also note that ERISA imposes general diversification requirements on qualified pension and retirement plan investments
that are consistent with the diversification requirements applicable to the Fund under section 817(h) of the Code.
9. Life of Virginia and the Accounts represent that the Accounts and the Plan are governed in similar ways. Plan trustees
have a fiduciary duty to participants that is similar to the obligations that Life of Virginia (or any life insurance
company affiliate thereof) has to look after the interests of variable contract owners.
10. Life of Virginia and the Accounts assert that, because Plan and unaffiliated plan investors would have beneficial
interests similar to those of current investors, the addition of the Plan and unaffiliated plans as shareholders
of the Fund, and the addition of Plan and unaffiliated Plan participants as persons having beneficial interests in
the Fund, should not increase the risk of material irreconcilable conflicts among investors. Life of Virginia and
the Accounts further assert that even if a material irreconcilable conflict involving the Plan or the unaffiliated
plans or their respective participants arose, the trustees of the Plan and the unaffiliated plans, may, if their fidiciary
duty to the participants requires it, redeem the shares of the Fund held by the Plan or the unaffiliated plans and make
alternative investments without obtaining prior regulatory approval. Similarly, the Plan and most if not all of
the unaffiliated plans, may hold cash or other liquid assets pending their reinvestment in a suitable alternative
investment.
11. Life of Virginia and the Accounts maintain that variable contract owners would benefit from the expected increase
in net assets of the Fund's portfolios resulting from additional investments by Plan and unaffiliated plan participants.
Such additional investments also should lower the costs of investing for variable contract owners, promote economies
of scale, permit increased safety through greater portfolio diversification, provide the Fund's investment adviser
with greater flexibility because of a larger portfolio, and make more feasible the addition of new portfolios in the
future.
12. The Applicants note that when the Commission last revised Rule 6e-3(T) in 1987, the Treasury Department
had not issued Treasury Regulation 1.817-5 which permits the Fund to sell shares to qualified pension or retirement
plans without adversely affecting the tax status of Life of Virginia's variable contracts. Life of Virginia and the
Accounts submit that, although proposed regulations had been published, the Commission did not envision this possibility
when it last examined Rule 6e-3(T)(b)(15), and might well have broadened the exclusivity provision of the Rule
at that time to include plans such as the Plan (or the unaffiliated plans) had this possibility been apparent. Applicants
further note that the Commission recently issued an order under Section 6(c) granting the exemptions requested herein
to applicants in very similar circumstances.


(ii) Voting Rights


13. Life of Virginia and the Accounts do not see any inherent conflicts arising between or among the interests of variable
contract owners, or Plan participants because of the potential for the Plan to hold a controlling interest in a portfolio
of the Fund. If the exemptions requested herein are granted to Life of Virginia and the Accounts, the Plan trustees
generally would vote shares of the Fund held by them on behalf of the Plan pursuant to instructions from Plan participants.
Thus, Plan participants' interests will be represented in the Fund in substantially the same manner as are those of
Life of Virginia's variable contract owners.
14. Life of Virginia and the Accounts assert that it is unlikely that Plan participants as a group vote in a manner that
would disadvantage variable contract owners. Moreover, the trustees and other affiliated persons of the Plan will
not be in a position to exercise undue influence over the Fund or any of its portfolios.
15. Also, with regard to resolving or remedying possible conflicts of interest related to voting, the Plan's investment
in the Fund does not present any complications not otherwise occasioned by traditional mixed funding as permitted
by Rule 6e-3(T)(b)(15). Life of Virginia and the Accounts submit that just because the interests and opinions
of Fund investors may differ does not mean that inherent conflicts of interest exist between or among such investors.
16. Section 403(a) of ERISA provides that, with few exceptions, trustees of the unaffiliated plans would have the
exclusive authority and responsibility for exercising voting rights attributable to their respective plan's investment
securities. Where a named fiduciary appoints an investment adviser, the adviser has the authority and responsibility
to exercise such voting rights unless the authority and responsibility is reserved to the trustee(s) or a non-trustee
fiduciary.
17. Life of Virginia and the Accounts generally expect many of the unaffiliated plans to have their trustees or other
fiduciaries exercise, in their discretion, voting rights attributable to investment securities held by the unaffiliated
plans. Some of the unaffiliated plans, however, may provide for the trustee(s), an investment adviser (or advisers),
or another named fiduciary to exercise voting rights in accordance with instructions from participants.

18. Where unaffiliated plans do not provide participants with the right to give voting instructions, Life of Virginia
and the Accounts do not see any potential for material irreconcilable conflicts of interests between variable contract
owners and unaffiliated plan investors with respect to voting of Fund shares. Life of Virginia and the Accounts note
that there is very little likelihood that any particular unaffiliated plan will hold a controlling interest in a portfolio
of the Fund. However, even if an unaffiliated plan were to hold such a controlling interest, Life of Virginia and the
Accounts do not believe that such control would disadvantage other investors in the Fund to any greater extent than
would be the case were an institutional shareholder to hold a controlling interest. Life of Virginia and the Accounts
submit that investment in the Fund by the unaffiliated plans will not create any of the voting complications occasioned
by traditional mixed and shared funding, or by the Plan's proposed investment in the Fund.
19. Where unaffiliated plans provide participants with the right to give voting instructions, Life of Virginia and
the Accounts do not believe that participants in unaffiliated plans_acting as a single group or in combination with
participants in other unaffiliated plans_would vote in a manner that would disadvantage variable contract owners.
As is the case with the Plan's proposed investment in the Fund, the purchase of Fund shares by the unaffiliated plans
that provide voting rights does not present any complications not otherwise occasioned by traditional mixed and
shared
 funding.




20. In light of Treasury Regulation 1.817-5(f)(3)(iii) which specifically permits ``qualified pension or
retirement plans'' and separate accounts to share the same underlying management investment company, Life of Virginia
and the Accounts have concluded that neither the Code, nor other Treasury Regulations or revenue rulings thereunder,
would create any inherent conflicts of interest between or among participants, VLI and variable contract owners.


(iii) Tax Treatment of Distributions


21. Although there are differences in the manner in which distribution from the Plan or the unaffiliated plans and
distributions from variable contracts are taxed, Life of Virginia and the Accounts maintain that these differences
will have no impact on the Fund. The Accounts, Account 4, the future accounts, the Plan, and the Unaffiliated plans
each will purchase and redeem such shares at net asset value in conformity with Rule 22c-1 under the 1940 Act without
the imposition of any sales charges.


(iv) Potential Future Conflicts Arising From Tax Law Changes


22. Life of Virginia and the Accounts do not see any greater potential for material irreconcilable conflicts arising
between the interests of plan investors and other Fund investors from possible future changes in the federal tax laws
than that which already exists with regard to such conflicts arising between variable contract owners.


(v) Conditions for Relief


23. Life of Virginia and the Accounts represent and agree that if the exemptions requested herein pursuant to Section
6(c) of the 1940 Act are granted, they will rely on such exemptions to purchase and hold Fund shares only if the following
conditions are met:



(a) The board of directors of the Fund, including a majority of those directors who are not interested persons of the
Fund or interested persons of such persons, shall: (i) adopt a resolution approving the sale of Fund shares to the Plan
and the unaffiliated plans; and (ii) monitor the Fund for the existence of any material irreconcilable conflicts
between or among the interests of variable contract owners, and qualified pension and retirement plan investors.
(b) Life of Virginia will monitor its operations and those of the Fund for the purpose of identifying any material conflicts
or potential material conflicts between or among the interests of qualified retirement and pension plan investors
and variable contract owners.
(c) Life of Virginia will report any such conflicts or potential conflicts to the Fund's board of directors and will
provide the board with all information reasonably necessary for the board to consider any issues raised by such existing
or potential conflicts. Life of Virginia will also assist the board in carrying out this obligation by, among other
things, informing the board whenever it disregards voting instructions from variable contract owners.
(d) Life of Virginia will provide ``pass-through'' voting privileges to variable contract owners as long as the Commission
interprets the 1940 Act to require such privileges. Life of Virginia will vote Fund shares held by it that are not attributable
to variable contract reserves in the same proportion as instructions received in a timely fashion from variable contract
owners, and shall be responsible for ensuring that the Accounts and Account 4 each calculate ``pass-through'' votes
in a consistent manner.
(e) In the event that a conflict of interest arises between variable contract owners, and/or qualified retirement
or pension plan investors, Life of Virginia will, at its own expense, take whatever action is necessary to remedy such
conflict (as it adversely affects variable contract owners), up to and including: (1) establishing a new-registered
management investment company; and (2) withdrawing assets attributable to reserves for the variable contracts
subject to the conflict from the Fund and (A) reinvesting such assets in a different investment medium (including
another portfolio of the Fund), or (B) submitting the question of whether such segregation should be implemented
to a vote of all affected variable contract owners, and, as appropriate, segregating the assets supporting the contracts
of any group of such owners that votes in favor of such segregation, or offering to such owners the option of making such
a change. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Life of Virginia will not be obligated to establish a new funding medium
for any group of variable contracts if an offer to do so has been declined by a vote of a majority of the variable contract
owners adversely affected by the conflict.
(f) The board meeting minutes of the Fund or other appropriate records shall record: (1) all reports sent by Life of
Virginia, depositors of the future accounts, the Plan, or the unaffiliated plans to be the board of directors of the
Fund; (2) notices sent by the Fund's board of directors to Life of Virginia, the depositors of the future accounts,
the Plan, or the unaffiliated plans, notifying the recipient of the existence of or potential for a material conflict
between the interests of variable contract owners and qualified retirement and pension plan investors; and (3) board
deliberations regarding conflicts or potential conflicts. Such board meeting minutes or other records shall be
made available to the Commission upon request.
(g) The Fund's prospectus shall disclose that: (1) Fund shares are offered in connection with mixed funding and to
401(a) plans; (2) both mixed funding and investment by 401(a) plans in the Fund may present certain conflicts of interest
between variable contract owners and qualified retirement and pension plan investors; and (3) the Fund's board of
directors will monitor for the existence of any material conflict of interest. The Fund also shall notify the Plan
and Life of Virginia that similar prospectus disclosure may be appropriate in separate account prospectuses or the
Plan prospectus.
(h) Life of Virginia and the Accounts will continue to rely on Rule 6e-3(T)(b)(15) and to comply with all of its
conditions.

(i) To the extent permitted or required by ERISA, the Plan is amended to provide ``pass-through'' voting privileges
to Plan participants.



24. Life of Virginia and the Accounts represent that the future accounts and their life insurance company depositors
will rely on the exemptions from section 6(c) of the 1940 Act requested herein to purchase and hold Fund shares 

only if

 such life insurance company depositors comply with conditions (b), (c), (d), (e) and (h) above as those conditions
relate to such life insurance company depositors and to the owners of variable annuity contracts and variable life
insurance contracts issued by those life insurance company depositors.


B. Request for Exemptions Under Section 17(b)


25. AAI and the Plan request that the Commission issue an order pursuant to section 17(b) of the 1940 Act, exempting
them from the provisions of section 17(a) of the 1940 Act to the extent necessary to permit the Plan to purchase shares
of the Fund with investment securities of the Plan. AAI and the Plan represent that the terms of the proposed transactions
as set forth herein, including the consideration to be paid and received: (i) Are reasonable and fair to the Fund, to
its Money Market Portfolio and its Total Return Portfolio, to shareholders, and to variable contract owners invested
in each of the Money Market Portfolio and the Total Return Portfolio; and (ii) do not involve overreaching on the part
of any person concerned. Furthermore, AAI and the Plan represent that the proposed transactions will be consistent
with the general purposes of the 1940 Act and, more specifically, the policies of the Fund, its Money Market Portfolio,
and its Total Return Portfolio.
26. AAI and the Plan also assert that the proposed transactions, in addition to meeting the standards of section 17(b)
vis-a-vis the Fund, are fair and reasonable to the Plan and are in the best interests of the Plan participants as determined
by the Plan trustees. In particular, AAI and the Plan submit that the proposed transactions are consistent with the
policy and purpose of the Plan as recited in its current registration statement, and are consistent with the provisions
of ERISA (applicable to defined contribution plans) regarding reporting and disclosure, participation and vesting,
funding, fiduciary responsibility, administration and enforcement.
27. Section 17(a)(1) of the 1940 Act, in relevant part, prohibits any affiliated person of a registered investment
company, or any affiliated person of such person, acting as principal, from knowingly selling any security or other
property to that company. Section 17(a)(2) of the 1940 Act generally prohibits the persons described above, acting
as principals, from knowingly purchasing any security or other property from the registered investment company.
28. Section 2(a)(3) of the 1940 Act defines the term ``affiliated person of another person'' in relevant part as: ``(A)
any person directly or indirectly owning, controlling, or holding with power to vote, 5 per centum or more of the outstanding
voting securities of such other person; (B) any person 5 per centum or more of whose outstanding voting securities
are directly or indirectly owned, controlled, or held with power to vote, by such person; (C) any person directly or
indirectly controlling, controlled by, or under common control with, such other person. * * *''
29. AAI and the Plan assert that because Life of Virginia's general account owns directly more than 25% of the outstanding
voting securities of the Common Stock Index Portfolio and the Government Securities Portfolio of the Fund, and because
section 2(a)(9) of the 1940 Act establishes a presumption that a person owning 25% or more of another person's outstanding
voting securities controls the latter person, the Common Stock Index Portfolio and the Government Securities Portfolio
are controlled by Life of Virginia and, consequently, by Aon Corporation. Although the variable contract owners
are considered the beneficial owners of many Fund shares, AAI and the Plan submit that the Fund and each of its portfolios
(arguably) is under the control of Life of Virginia (and Aon Corporation), since Life of Virginia owns of record all
of the shares of the Fund. AAI and the Plan further submit that, because they, too, are controlled by Aon Corporation,
AAI, the Plan, the Fund, and the Fund's portfolios can be deemed under the common control of Aon Corporation. 
30. AAI and the Plan asset that since a person under common control with a registered investment company is an affiliated
person of that investment company, AAI and the Plan are affiliated persons of the Fund and its Money Market Portfolio
and Total Return Portfolio. The Plan's proposal to purchase Fund shares with investment securities would entail
the sale of such securities by the Plan (or by AAI and the Plan), acting as principal, to the Fund and therefore would
contravene section 17(a).
31. Section 17(b) of the 1940 Act provides that the Commission may, upon application, grant an order exempting any
transaction from the prohibitions of Section 17(a) if the evidence establishes that:
(a) The terms of the proposed transaction, including the consideration to be paid or received, are reasonable and
fair and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned;
(b) The proposed transaction is consistent with the policy of each registered investment company concerned, as recited
in its registration statement and reports filed under the 1940 Act; and
(c) The proposed transaction is consistent with the general purposes of the 1940 Act.
32. Subject to certain enumerated conditions, Rule 17a-7 under the 1940 Act exempts from the prohibitions of
section 17(a) a purchase or sale transaction between: (i) Registered investment companies or separate series of
registered investment companies, which are affiliated persons, or affiliated persons of affiliated persons, of
each other; (ii) between separate series of a registered investment company; or (iii) between a registered investment
company or a separate series of a registered investment company and a person which is an affiliated person of such registered
investment company (or affiliated person of such person) solely by reason of having a common investment adviser or
investment advisers which are affiliated persons of each other, common directors, and/or common officers.

33. AAI and the Plan submit that they cannot rely on Rule 17a-7 because they are not affiliated persons of the Fund
or the Money Market Portfolio or the Total Return Portfolio 

solely by reason of

 having a common investment adviser or affiliated investment advisers, common directors, and/or common officers.
AAI and the Plan also note that since the proposed purchase of Fund shares by the Plan involves the purchase and sale
of securities for securities, the proposed transaction does not meet the condition of Rule 17a-7 that the transaction
be a purchase or a sale for no consideration other than cash payment against prompt delivery of a security for which
market quotations are readily available.
34. AAI and the Plan assert that where, as here, an investment company would comply in substance with, but cannot literally
meet all of the conditions of, Rule 17a-7, the Commission should consider the extent to which the investment
company meets the Rule 17a-7 or other similar conditions, and issue an order if the protections of Rule 17a-7
would be provided in substance. AAI and the Plan maintain that although the transactions will conform in all material
respects with the substance of all but one of the conditions enumerated in Rule 17a-7, the terms of the proposed
transactions_including the consideration to be received by the Fund_are reasonable, fair, and do not involve overreaching
by investment company affiliates.
35. AAI and the Plan submit that the proposed transactions would offer to the Fund the same degree of protection from
overreaching that Rule 17a-7 offers to investment companies involved in purchase or sale transactions with
their affiliates. For example, the Plan could not ``dump'' undesirable securities on the Fund, transfer investment
securities from the Fund, or effect the proposed transactions at a price that is disadvantageous to the Fund. In addition,
although the transactions will not be for cash, each will be effected based upon (i) the independent market price of
the Plan's investment securities valued as specified in Rule 17a-7(b), and (ii) the net asset value per share
of the Money Market Portfolio or the Total Return Portfolio, valued in accordance with the procedures disclosed in
the Fund's registration statement and as required by Rule 22c-1 under the 1940 Act. AAI and the Plan represent
that no brokerage commission, fee, or other remuneration will be paid to any party in connection with the proposed
transactions. In addition, although the board of directors of the Fund will not adopt specific procedures to govern
the proposed transactions, it will scrutinize and specifically approve by resolution each such transaction, including
the price to be paid for the Fund's shares and the nature and quality of the securities offered in payment for such shares.
36. AAI and the Plan represent that the proposed sale of additional shares is consistent with the investment policy
of both the Money Market Portfolio and the Total Return Portfolio of the Fund, as recited in the Fund's registration
statement, and the sale of shares for investment securities, as contemplated by the proposed transactions, is also
consistent with these investment policies provided that (i) the shares are sold at net asset value, and (ii) the securities
are of the type and quality that each portfolio would have acquired with the sale proceeds had the shares been sold for
cash. As recited in the conditions listed below, the Fund's board of directors will examine the portfolios of the Plan's
money market and balanced portfolios and only approve the proposed transactions if they, including a majority of
those directors who are not interested persons of the Fund, or interested persons of such persons, determine that
(i) and (ii) would be met.
37. The proposed transactions, as described herein, are consistent with the general purposes of the 1940 Act as stated
in the Findings and Declaration of Policy in Section 1 of the 1940 Act. The proposed transactions do not present any
of the conditions or abuses that the 1940 Act was designed to prevent.
38. AAI and the Plan maintain that the terms of the proposed transactions are fair and reasonable to the Plan as well
as to the Fund, and protect the Plan and the Fund from overreaching by their respective affiliates.

39. AAI and the Plan represent that the Plan trustees have determined that the proposed transactions are in the best
interests of Plan participants, and are consistent with the policies and purpose of the Plan as recited in various
Plan documents, including its registration statement. In this regard, AAI and the Plan represent that the Plan trustees
have determined that the Fund's Money Market Portfolio has substantially the same investment objectives as the Plan's
money market investment portfolio and, likewise, that the Fund's Total Return Portfolio has substantially the same
investment objectives as the Plan's balanced portfolio.
40. AAI and the Plan represent that Plan participants will benefit from the fact that the expense of liquidating Plan
assets, purchasing Fund shares with cash, and reinvesting the cash in substantially the same assets, would be avoided.
AAI and the Plan further represent that, to the extent that the Plan trustees have determined that the Fund's Money
Market Portfolio and Total Return Portfolio should replace the Plan's current money market portfolio and balanced
portfolio, respectively, the proposed transactions would greatly diminish the expense of this replacement to Plan
participants.

41. AAI and the Plan represent that the proposed transactions are consistent with the provisions of ERISA regarding
reporting and disclosure, participation and vesting, funding, fiduciary responsibility, administration and
enforcement that are applicable to defined contribution plans.

42. AAI and the Plan represent and agree that if the exemptions requested herein pursuant to section 17(b) of the 1940
Act are granted, the Plan will purchase shares of the Fund with investment securities only if the following conditions
are met:




(a) Shares of the Money Market Portfolio or the Total Return Portfolio of the Fund will be purchased with investment
securities of the Plan's money market portfolio or balanced portfolio.

(b) The transactions will be effected at the ``independent current market price'' of the investment securities (as
that term is defined in Rule 17a-7 under the 1940 Act), and at the net asset value of appropriate Fund share next
computed after the closing of the transaction.

(c) No brokerage commission, fee (except for customary transfer fees), or other remuneration will be paid in connection
with the transactions.

(d) The Fund's board of directors, including a majority of those directors who are not interested persons of the Fund,
or interested persons of such persons shall: (i) review the terms of the transactions, the composition of the investment
portfolios of the Plan to be used as the purchase price in the transactions, and the value (and the valuation method)
of the investment securities comprising the purchase price in the transactions; and (ii) adopt a resolution determining
separately for each transaction, that the transaction is reasonable and fair to the existing investors in the appropriate
Fund portfolio, that the transaction would not subject the Fund to overreaching, and that the investment securities
offered by the Trustees on behalf of the Plan in that transaction are consistent with the investment objective, policies
and restrictions of the related Fund portfolio.

(e) The Fund agrees in writing that it will maintain and preserve for a period of not less than six years from the end of
the fiscal year in which the transaction occurs_and for the first two years in a readily accessible place_a written
record of each such transaction setting forth: (i) a description of the investment securities used as the purchase
price for Fund shares; (ii) the terms of such transaction; and (iii) the information and materials upon which the determinations
described in condition (d) above were made.



Conclusion



1. AAI and the Plan request an order of the Commission pursuant to section 17(b) of the 1940 Act exempting them from section
17(a) of the 1940 Act to the extent necessary to permit the Plan to purchase certain classes of shares of the Fund with
investment securities of the Plan. AAI and the Plan submit that, for the reasons stated above, the terms of the proposed
transactions_including the consideration to be paid and received: (i) Are reasonable and fair to the Fund, its Money
Market Portfolio, its Total Return Portfolio, its shareholders, and the variable contract owners invested in the
Money Market Portfolio and the Total Return Portfolio; and (ii) do not involve overreaching on the part of any person
concerned. Furthermore, the proposed transactions will be consistent with the general purposes of the 1940 Act and
the policies of the Fund, its Money Market Portfolio, and its Total Return Portfolio.

2. In addition, Life of Virginia and the Accounts request an order pursuant to section 6(c) of the 1940 Act, exempting
them as well as any future accounts from the provisions of sections 9(a), 13(a), 15(a), and 15(b) of the 1940 Act, and
Rule 6e-3(T)(b)(15) thereunder, to the extent necessary to permit the Accounts and any future accounts to hold
shares of the Fund at the same time that the Plan and other qualified retirement and pension plans hold shares of the
Fund.

3. For the reasons stated above, Applicants submit that the proposed transactions do not present any of the conditions
or abuses that the 1940 Act was designed to prevent, and that the requested exemptions are appropriate in the public
interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions
of the 1940 Act.




For the Commission, by the Division of Investment Management, under delegated authority.

<DOCTITLE>Order Suspending Certain Air Service To and From Haiti</DOCTITLE>



<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 We are publishing the order in its entirety as an appendix to this document. 



</SUMMARY>
<SIGNER>
Patrick V. Murphy,


</SIGNER>
<SIGNJOB>
Acting Assistant Secretary for Aviation and International Affairs.




In re: Suspension of Certain Air Service To and From Haiti; Order



[Docket 49547; Order 94-5-18]




By Executive Order 12914 issued May 7, 1994, the President, in view of United Nations Security Council Resolution
No. 917 of May 6, 1994, and in order to take additional steps with respect to the actions and policies of the 

de facto

 regime in Haiti beyond those steps taken in Executive Orders 12775, 12779, 12853 and 12872, ordered that certain further
economic sanctions be imposed against Haiti, including the suspension of certain air services operated between
the United States and Haiti. 

In accordance with Executive Order 12914, we tentatively found in Order 94-5-13, issued May 9, 1994, that
the public interest requires the regulatory prohibition of charter passenger and scheduled and charter all-cargo
air services between the United States and Haiti except those flights that may be permitted pursuant to the Executive
Order. 

In that order we proposed to add the following conditions to all U.S. air carrier certificates, all section 402 permits
held by foreign air carriers, and all exemptions held by U.S. and foreign air carriers (these requirements would apply
to indirect as well as direct air carriers):




Effective immediately and until further order of the Department, the holder and its agents may not engage in all-cargo
or charter foreign air transportation which includes a stop in Haiti.




We also tentatively found that this proposed action is required by both the public interest and the public convenience
and necessity.

Comments in response to this order were required to be filed with the Department no later than 5:00 p.m., Tuesday, May
10, 1994. Comments were filed by the National Air Carrier Association (NACA) and Federal Express Corporation (FedEx).
NACA objected to ``any action that will discriminate between scheduled and charter passenger service.''
 FedEx, although it presently offers no services in or out of Haiti, either by direct or indirect air service, argued
that ``all cargo, including that carried on passenger aircraft, should be treated the same. . . .''







As we stated in the Show Cause Order, the public interest findings in this instance are based upon Executive Order 12914.
In that order, the President took the following action:




The following are prohibited, notwithstanding the existence of any rights or obligations conferred or imposed by
any international agreement or any contract entered into or any license or permit granted before the effective date
of this order, except to the extent provided in regulations, orders, directives, authorizations, or licenses that
may hereafter be issued pursuant to this order: (a) the granting of permission to any aircraft to take off from, land
in, or overfly the territory of the United States, if the aircraft, as part of the same flight or as a continuation of
that flight, is destined to land in or has taken off from the territory of Haiti, 

with the exception of regularly scheduled commercial passenger flights.

 (emphasis added)

 


The Executive Order explicitly excepts regularly scheduled commercial passenger flights from the prohibitions
imposed. Both NACA and FedEx would have us recraft the certificate and permit amendment language in order to change
the scope of the sanctions ordered by the President. We decline to take such action given the President's clearly stated
directive. 

Accordingly, we have decided to make final the tentative findings and conclusions in Order 94-5-13.


Accordingly: 

1. All U.S. air carrier certificates, all section 402 permits held by foreign air carriers, and all exemptions held
by U.S. and foreign air carriers are hereby amended to add the following condition:




Effective immediately and until further order of the Department, the holder and its agents may not engage in all-cargo
or charter foreign air transportation which includes a stop in Haiti.




2. Effective immediately and until further order of the Department, no indirect air carrier may engage in all-cargo
or charter foreign air transportation which includes a stop in Haiti.

3. Unless disapproved by the President of the United States under section 801 of the Federal Aviation Act, this order
and the certificate and permit amendments contained herein shall become effective on the 61st day after its submission
for section 801 review or upon date of receipt of advice from the President or his designee under Executive Order 12597
and implementing regulations that the President does not intend to disapprove the Department's order under that
section, whichever occurs earlier;
 and





4. We shall serve a copy of this order upon all U.S. and foreign air carriers holding certificates of public convenience
and necessity, foreign air carrier permits, or exemption authority, the Air Transport Association, the National
Air Carrier Association, the International Air Transport Association, the American Society of Travel Agents, the
Air Freight Association, the Ambassador of the Republic of Haiti in Washington, D.C., the Federal Aviation Administration,
and the United States Department of State. 

5. We will publish this order in the 

Federal Register

<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice and request for comments.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

Notice is hereby given that the Trade Policy Staff Committee (TPSC) is requesting written public comments on the announced
intention of Bulgaria, Mongolia, Russia, and Ukraine to accede to the GATT. Comments received will be considered
by the Executive Branch in developing the U.S. position and objectives for the bilateral and multilateral negotiations
that will determine these countries' terms of accession to the General Agreement, and ultimately to the World Trade
Organization after the Agreement establishing that organization enters into effect. Additional requests for public
comment and advice on accession negotiations with other countries will be published as their negotiations develop.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
1. Written Comments




The Chairman of the Trade Policy Staff Committee invites written public comments on the issues to be addressed in the
course of negotiations with Bulgaria, Mongolia, Russia, and Ukraine to determine the terms of these countries' accession
to the General Agreement and potentially to the World Trade Organization. These terms will be negotiated in bilateral
meetings with their governments' representatives and in meetings of their Working Parties, established by the Contracting
Parties to the GATT to conduct the negotiations. Public comments were requested on the accession of Bulgaria to the
GATT in June 1990, but changes in Bulgaria's trade regime since that time require that we request additional comments.


The Committee is seeking public comments on the possible effect on U.S. trade of these countries' accession to the
GATT/WTO, with particular reference to any trade measures applied by these countries that could be subject to the
provisions of the General Agreement or the WTO, including on: (1) Tariff levels or other import measures currently
applied by these countries to imports of specific interest to U.S. exporters, (2) export restrictions and charges,
(3) conditions in trade in services, (4) trade-related investment measures, (5) protection of intellectual property,
(6) customs procedures in the areas of valuation, licensing, application of standards and sanitary and phytosanitary
measures, (7) subsidies applied to domestic production and exports that affect trade, (8) government procurement
and on trade in civil aircraft, and (9) the overall experiences of U.S. firms in trading with these countries in recent
years.


The Committee is seeking information on the structure and conduct of these countries' trade policies, on barriers
to trade with them, or on any other measure that inhibits imports or artificially stimulates exports to the detriment
of U.S. trade interests that can be addressed in the context of the obligations they will undertake with their adherence
to the General Agreement and later membership in the WTO.

All comments will be considered in developing the U.S. position and objectives for the examination of the trade regimes
of Bulgaria, Mongolia, Russia, and Ukraine in the context of their GATT accession and potential membership in the
WTO, and for the bilateral negotiations concerning both the substantive terms of the Protocol of Accession and the
establishment of schedules for market access in the areas of agriculture, industrial goods, and services. Information
on products or practices subject to these negotiations should include, whenever appropriate, the import or export
tariff classification number used by Bulgaria, Mongolia, Russia, and Ukraine for the product concerned.


Persons submitting written comments on Bulgarian or Mongolian accession should provide a statement, in twenty copies,
by noon, Friday, June 3, 1994, and on Russian or Ukrainian accession by noon, Friday, June 17, 1994, to Carolyn Frank,
TPSC Secretary, Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, Room 414, 600 17th Street NW., Washington, DC 20506. Non-confidential
information received will be available for public inspection by appointment, in the USTR Reading Room, 600 17th Street
NW., room 101, Washington, DC, Monday through Friday, 10 a.m. to 12 noon and 1 p.m. to 4 p.m. For an appointment call Brenda
Webb on 202-395-6186. Business confidential information will be subject to the requirements of 15 CFR
2003.6. Any business confidential material must be clearly marked as such on the cover letter or page and each succeeding
page, and must be accompanied by a non-confidential summary thereof.

2. Background


The GATT Contracting Parties have established Working Parties to examine the requests by Bulgaria, Mongolia, Russia,
and Ukraine to accede to the General Agreement pursuant to Article XXXIII of that Agreement. The Working Parties for
the accessions of Bulgaria and Mongolia are well advanced in their work, while those for Russia and the Ukraine were
only recently established and have not yet met. These Working Parties, composed of interested GATT members, examine
applicant countries' foreign trade regimes during the course of several meetings and ultimately submit to the GATT
Council recommendations that may include a draft Protocol of Accession and a schedule of tariff and nontariff concessions.
There is no established timetable for the accession process. The United States will be a major participant in these
deliberations, and will engage in bilateral negotiations with all four countries to develop the terms of each country's
accession to the General Agreement and to the WTO. These terms will be contained in a Protocol package that will include
Protocol commitments and schedules addressing market access issues in agriculture and in non-agricultural goods.
The Protocol package could also include a schedule of commitments in services and additional commitments on internal
supports and export subsidies in agriculture required by WTO provisions.
The Protocol of Accession that each country negotiates with the GATT Contracting Parties will set forth the agreed
terms of membership in the GATT and the WTO, based on the relationship of the foreign trade regime of each country to
the Articles of the General Agreement and the WTO. Aspects of the foreign trade regime that are normally examined in
such negotiations include: application of most-favored-nation treatment and national treatment to imports from
other GATT contracting parties, licensing requirements, quantitative trade restrictions, subsidy practices
as they affect trade, non-tariff charges and taxes, customs valuation and classification procedures, transparency
in trade regulation and administration, and state trading practices and monopolies. The Working Party will want
to receive information from each of the four countries concerning trade in services, intellectual property protection,
trade-related investment measures, agricultural supports and subsidies, and sanitary and phytosanitary requirements.
In addition, as part of the accession process, each of these countries will conduct bilateral negotiations with interested
GATT members to formulate schedules of tariff and non-tariff concessions in agriculture, goods, and services that
will become part of the terms of GATT/WTO accession contained in the Protocol package. These concessions will consist
of agreement by the acceding countries to bind against increase the tariff and non-tariff terms of market access applied
to certain imports. Such concessions restrict their ability to block trade though non-tariff means or to increase
the tariff rate applied to those items without offering appropriate compensatory tariff concessions on other items.
The rates of duty and other conditions of market access for agriculture, goods, and services negotiated bilaterally,
as well as all the other protections of GATT Articles and the WTO, will apply to the trade of all other GATT contracting
parties and WTO members with whom these countries have GATT/WTO relations after accession or with whom they have other
Most-Favored-Nation agreements.
As a member of the GATT/WTO, Bulgaria, Mongolia, Russia, and Ukraine will enjoy a multilateral guarantee of unconditional
most-favored-nation treatment from countries with which they have GATT relations that is more comprehensive than
that available through bilateral agreements. The bindings on tariffs and certain nontariff measures maintained
in the schedules of other members of the GATT and the WTO that have formal GATT/WTO relations with these four countries
will be extended to their exports as obligations, first under the GATT, and potentially under the WTO. They will also
have recourse to GATT/WTO procedures to protect themselves from unfair or unreasonable trade actions by these countries.
In return for these benefits, each country acceding to GATT/WTO will be expected to grant similar benefits to the trade
of other GATT/WTO members, to conduct its trade policies in accordance with the rules set out in the General Agreement
and the WTO, and to establish its own schedules of tariff and non-tariff commitments and concessions.

<DOCTITLE>Identification of Foreign Countries That Deny Adequate and Effective Intellectual Property Protection or Market
Access to Persons That Rely on Intellectual Property Protection</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Office of the United States Trade Representative.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of identification of foreign countries that deny adequate and effective intellectual property protection,
or deny fair and equitable market access to persons who rely on intellectual property protection, pursuant to section
182(a) and section 182(e) of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (Trade Act).






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

Pursuant to section 182(a) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2242), the USTR has identified 36 countries that deny adequate
and effective intellectual property protection or deny fair and equitable market access to persons who rely on intellectual
property protection. Three trading partners, Argentina, China and India, were identified as presenting particularly
serious problems requiring a review of their status in 60 days; six trading partners were placed on the priority watch
list; and eighteen trading partners were placed on the watch list. Nine other countries received special mention.
No countries were designated priority foreign countries under section 182(a)(2) of the Trade Act.




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Section 182(a) of the Trade Act requires the USTR to identify foreign countries that deny adequate and effective protection
of intellectual property rights or that deny fair and equitable market access for persons that rely on intellectual
property protection. From among these identified foreign countries, the USTR must designate as ``priority foreign
countries'' those countries whose acts, policies or practices are the most onerous or egregious and have the greatest
adverse impact (actual or potential) on relevant U.S. products. Countries may not be identified as priority foreign
countries if they are engaged in good faith negotiations, or making significant progress in multilateral or bilateral
negotiations to provide adequate and effective protection or enforcement of intellectual property rights.





Although the USTR identified no priority foreign countries in the 1994 special 301 review, he did note that Argentina,
China and India presented particularly serious problems. The USTR stated that the status of each of these countries
would be revisited in 60 days, and that if satisfactory progress had not been made by that time, they would be designated
priority foreign countries.



The USTR also named trading partners to the administratively-created priority watch list and watch list. The trading
partners named to the priority watch list include the European Union, Japan, Korea, Saudi Arabia, Thailand and Turkey.
The trading partners named to the watch list include Australia, Chile, Colombia, Cyprus, Egypt, El Salvador, Greece,
Guatemala, Indonesia, Italy, Pakistan, Peru, the Philippines, Poland, Spain, Taiwan, the United Arab Emirates,
and Venezuela. Four of these trading partners_Egypt, El Salvador, Greece and the United Arab Emirates_will be subject
to out-of-cycle reviews, which are formal mid-year reviews when the USTR will determine whether the problems or practices
that resulted in those countries being placed on the list have been addressed. Finally, the trading partners warranting
special mention of their practices, but not warranting placement on a formal list, include Brazil, Canada, Germany,
Honduras, Israel, Panama, Paraguay, Russia and Singapore.
