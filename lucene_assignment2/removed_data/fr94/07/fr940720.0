ACTION:

 Final rule. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is amending the licensing, inspection, and annual fees charged to its applicants
and licensees. The amendments are necessary to implement Public Law 101-508, enacted November 5, 1990, which
mandates that the NRC recover approximately 100 percent of its budget authority in Fiscal Year (FY) 1994 less amounts
appropriated from the Nuclear Waste Fund (NWF). The amount to be recovered for FY 1994 is approximately $513 million.

I. Background 


Public Law 101-508, the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 (OBRA-90), enacted November 5, 1990,
requires that the NRC recover approximately 100 percent of its budget authority less the amount appropriated from
the Department of Energy (DOE) administered NWF for FYs 1991 through 1995 by assessing fees. OBRA-90 was amended
in 1993 to extend the NRC's 100 percent fee recovery requirement through 1998. 
The NRC assesses two types of fees to recover its budget authority. First, license and inspection fees, established
in 10 CFR Part 170 under the authority of the Independent Offices Appropriation Act (IOAA), 31 U.S.C. 9701, recover
the NRC's costs of providing individually identifiable services to specific applicants and licensees. The services
provided by the NRC for which these fees are assessed include the review of applications for the issuance of new licenses
or approvals, amendments to or renewal of licenses or approvals, and inspections of licensed activities. Second,
annual fees, established in 10 CFR Part 171 under the authority of OBRA-90, recover generic and other regulatory
costs not recovered through 10 CFR Part 170 fees. 
Subsequent to enactment of OBRA-90, the NRC published six final fee rules after evaluation of public comments.
On July 10, 1991 (56 FR 31472), the NRC published a final rule in the 

Federal Register

 that established the Part 170 professional hourly rate and the materials licensing and inspection fees, as well as
the Part 171 annual fees, to be assessed to recover approximately 100 percent of the FY 1991 budget. In addition to establishing
the FY 1991 fees, the final rule established the underlying basis and methodology for determining both the 10 CFR Part
170 hourly rate and fees and the 10 CFR Part 171 annual fees. The FY 1991 rule was challenged in Federal court by several
parties. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit rendered its decision on those challenges
on March 16, 1993, in 

Allied-Signal v. NRC,

 remanding two issues to the NRC for further consideration (988 F.2d 146 (D.C. Cir. 1993)). The court decision was also
extended to cover the FY 1992 fee rule by court order dated April 30, 1993. 
On April 17, 1992 (57 FR 13625), the NRC published in the 

Federal Register

 two limited changes to 10 CFR Parts 170 and 171. The limited changes became effective May 18, 1992. The limited change
to 10 CFR Part 170 allowed the NRC to bill quarterly for those license fees that were previously billed every six months.
The limited change to 10 CFR Part 171 lowered in some cases the maximum annual fee of $1,800 assessed a materials licensee
who qualifies as a small entity under the NRC's size standards. A lower tier small entity fee of $400 per licensed category
was established for small business and non-profit organizations with gross annual receipts of less than $250,000
and small governmental jurisdictions with a population of less than 20,000. 
On July 23, 1992 (57 FR 32691), and July 20, 1993 (58 FR 38666), the NRC published final rules in the 

Federal Register

 that established the licensing, inspection, and annual fees necessary for the NRC to recover approximately 100 percent
of its budget authority for FY 1992 and FY 1993 respectively. The basic methodology used in the FY 1992 and FY 1993 final
rules was unchanged from that used to calculate the 10 CFR Part 170 professional hourly rate, the specific materials
licensing and inspection fees in 10 CFR Part 170, and the 10 CFR Part 171 annual fees in the final rule published July
10, 1991 (56 FR 31472). The methodology for assessing low-level waste (LLW) costs was changed in FY 1993 in response
to the judicial decision mentioned earlier. This change was explained in detail in the FY 1993 final rule published
July 20, 1993 (58 FR 38669-72). In brief, the NRC created two groups_large waste generators and small waste generators.
Licensees within each group are charged a uniform flat fee. 
On March 17, 1994 (59 FR 12539), the NRC reinstated the annual fee exemption for nonprofit educational institutions
after notice and comment. In response to the March 16, 1993, judicial decision, the exemption had been eliminated
in the final rule published by NRC on July 20, 1993 (58 FR 38666). 
The American College of Nuclear Physicians and the Society of Nuclear Medicine filed a Petition for Rulemaking which
included a request that the Commission exempt medical licensees from fees for services provided in nonprofit institutions.
The Commission denied that request on March 17, 1994 (59 FR 12555). 
Section 2903(c) of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 required the NRC to undertake a broad review of its annual fee policies
under Section 6101(c) of OBRA-90, solicit public comment on the need for policy changes, and recommend changes
in existing law to the Congress that the NRC found were needed to prevent the placement of an unfair burden on certain
NRC licensees. To comply with the Energy Policy Act requirements, the NRC reviewed more than 500 public comments submitted
in response to the request for comment published in the 

Federal Register

 on April 19, 1993 (58 FR 21116), and sent its report to Congress on February 23, 1994. A copy of this report has been placed
in the Public Document Room.

On May 10, 1994 (59 FR 24065), the NRC published its proposed rule for FY 1994 establishing the licensing, inspection,
and annual fees necessary for the NRC to recover approximately 100 percent of its budget authority for FY 1994, less
the appropriation received from the NWF. The basic approach, policies, and methodology used in the proposed rule
were unchanged from those used to calculate the 10 CFR part 170 professional hourly rate, the specific materials licensing
and inspection fees in 10 CFR part 170, and the 10 CFR part 171 annual fees set forth in the final rules published July
10, 1991 (56 FR 31477), July 23, 1992 (57 FR 322691), and July 20, 1993 (58 FR 38666), with the following exceptions:
(1) The Commission has reinstated the annual fee exemption for nonprofit educational institutions; and (2) in this
final rule, the NRC has directly assigned additional effort to the reactor and materials programs for the Office of
Investigations, the Office of Enforcement, the Advisory Committee on Reactor Safeguards, and the Advisory Committee
on Nuclear Waste. Resources for these activities had previously been included in overhead, but are now assigned directly
to the class of licensees that they support. Because this direct assignment results in a reduction of overhead costs
allocated to each FTE, the cost per FTE is about 3 percent less than it would have been without the additional direct
assignment. 
On May 19, 1994 (59 FR 26097) the NRC amended its fee regulations in 10 CFR part 171 to establish revised FY 1991 and FY
1992 surcharges for NRC licensees. The revised surcharges reflect the revised method of allocating low-level waste
(LLW) costs adopted by the Commission in the FY 1993 final fee rule published July 20, 1993 (58 FR 38666). Refunds/credits
totalling $2.2 million will be given to certain NRC materials licensees as a result of the revised surcharges for FY
1991 and FY 1992. 


II. Responses to Comments 


The NRC received thirty-three comments on the proposed rule. Although the comment period ended on June 9, 1994, the
NRC has reviewed and evaluated all comments received. Copies of all comment letters received are available for inspection
in the NRC Public Document room, 2120 L Street, NW (lower level) Washington, DC. 
Many of the comments were similar in nature. For evaluation purposes, these comments have been grouped, as appropriate,
and addressed as single issues in this final rule. The comments are as follows: 


A. Fee Legislation


1. 

Comment. 

Several commenters noted that NRC had completed its report on fee policy mandated by the Energy Policy Act of 1992 and
had sent a report to Congress with legislative recommendations. They expressed their agreement with the legislative
recommendation in the report that OBRA-90 be amended to relax the requirement to recover 100 percent of its budget
and remove certain costs from the fee base, thereby eliminating many of the burdens they deem to be inequitable. They
urged the NRC to work with Congress to modify OBRA-90 to make the assessment of fees more equitable across the
board. 


Response. 

The need for legislation is beyond the scope of this rulemaking proceeding. The NRC will continue to work with Congress
on fee issues. 
2.

 Comment.

 Several commenters stated that it is very important for the NRC to control its internal costs in order for the nuclear
industry to be successful in reducing overall program costs. One commenter suggested that the NRC consider staff
reductions and other management improvements to reduce budget needs based on a decline in the number of materials
licensees.
Another commenter commended the NRC on its willingness and ability to hold the line on, and indeed reduce, its recoverable
budget for FY 1994. While noting that the proposed FY 1994 annual fees for power reactors are lower than those assessed
in FY 1993, commenters from utility licensees or their representatives believe that further reductions are possible,
especially in the areas where power reactor licensees are required to unfairly subsidize cost recovery for activities
that benefit all licensees or for activities that are unrelated to the power reactor class of licensees. While encouraged
by the recent recommendations for legislative changes made by the NRC to Congress in the report required by the Energy
Policy Act of 1992, commenters recommended that NRC consider the following actions it can take now without waiting
for legislative changes: 
(1) Reduce costs by eliminating or deferring lower priority research and generic rulemaking activity; 
(2) Reduce the amount to be collected under part 171 by increasing part 170 licensing and inspection fees; 
(3) Raise the lower tier small entity fee; and 
(4) Use an annual escalation, e.g., CPI or some equivalent index, of small entity fee limits which have stayed at $400
and $1,800 since they were set two years ago.

Response. 

The NRC is working to improve the internal efficiency and effectiveness of its program as a means of controlling operating
costs and, therefore, keeping fees billed to licensees as low as practicable. Economies have been achieved through
the elimination of the NRC's uranium recovery field office in Denver, Colorado and consolidating the agency's two
smallest regional offices_Regions IV and V. The NRC is tightening its financial operations by increasing the effectiveness
and efficiency of its program financing. As a result of these efforts, the NRC proposed and Congress approved a $12.7
million recision (reduction) to the original appropriation enacted for FY 1994. Therefore, the total amount to be
recovered from fees from all classes of licensees in FY 1994 is about $6 million less than the amount to be recovered
in FY 1993. 
The Chief Financial Officers Act (CFO) requires that the NRC conduct a biennial review of fees and other charges imposed
by the Agency for its services and revise these charges to reflect the costs incurred in providing those services.
The 10 CFR Part 170 licensing and inspection fees were increased significantly for some materials licenses in FY 1993
as a result of the first CFO biennial review. The 10 CFR Part 170 fees for FY 1995 will be revised to reflect the results
of the second CFO review. 
On April 7, 1994 (59 FR 16513), the Small Business Administration (SBA) issued a final rule changing its size standards.
This rule increased the receipts-based SBA size standards due to inflation. The NRC is considering proposing amendments
to the NRC size standards that would reflect the SBA action. Any amendments to the NRC size standards will be submitted
to SBA for approval and published in the 

Federal Register

 for public notice and comment as required by the Small Business Credit and Business Opportunity Enhancement Act of
1992 (Pub. L. 102-366). The NRC will reexamine the annual fees assessed for small entities once the NRC completes
its evaluation of the NRC size standards, which is expected to be done in FY 1995. 
The NRC in this final FY 1994 fee rule is continuing a maximum annual fee of $1,800 and $400 per licensed category, respectively,
for those licensees who can qualify as small entities under NRC size standards. The impact of the fees for FY 1994 on
small entities has been evaluated in the Regulatory Flexibility Analysis (see Appendix A of this final rule). The
small entity subsidy in this final fee rule has been calculated on that basis. 


B. Fee Methodology


1. Hourly Rate




Comment. 

Several commenters indicated that the hourly rate of $133 is excessive and cannot be justified. These commenters
noted that the rate is considerably higher than the typical industry charge-out rate for direct employees and equals
or exceeds the hourly charges for senior consultants at major national consulting organizations. Other commenters
supported the proposed removal of costs for the Office of Investigations, the Office of Enforcement, the Advisory
Committee on Reactor Safeguards, and the Advisory Committee on Nuclear Waste from overhead and their direct assignment
to the reactor and materials programs. Commenters stated that this is an improvement in that it better defines the
beneficiaries of certain regulatory activities and more equitably allocates the fees for services provided. 


Response. 

As indicated in previous final rules, the NRC professional hourly rate is established to recover approximately 100
percent of the agency's Congressionally approved budget, less the appropriation from the NWF, as required by OBRA-90.
Both the method and budgeted costs used by the NRC in the development of the hourly rate of $133 for FY 1994 are discussed
in detail in Part III, Section-by-Section Analysis, for  170.20 of the proposed rule (59 FR 24069; May 10, 1994)
and the same section of this final rule. For example, Table II shows the direct FTEs (full time equivalents) by major
program for FY 1994 and Table III shows the budgeted costs (salaries and benefits, administrative support, travel
and other G&A contractual support) that must be recovered through fees assessed for the hours expended by the
direct FTEs. As indicated in the proposed rule and supported by the commenters, the NRC has directly assigned additional
effort to the reactor and materials programs for the Office of Investigations, the Office of Enforcement, the Advisory
Committee on Reactor Safeguards, and the Advisory Committee on Nuclear Waste. Resources for these activities had
previously been included in overhead but are now directly assigned to the class of licensees they support. This change
results in the increase in the hourly rate being less than it would have been otherwise. Given the increase in the costs
to be recovered through the hourly rate, including increases in the cost of doing business (e.g., inflation), it is
necessary to increase the 1994 hourly rate by less than one percent to recover 100 percent of the budget as required
by OBRA-90. The specific details regarding the budget for FY 1994 are documented in the NRC's publication ``Budget
Estimates, Fiscal Year 1994'' (NUREG-1100, Volume 9). Copies of NUREG-1100, Vol. 9 may be purchased from
the Superintendent of Documents, U.S. Government Printing Office, Mail Stop SSOP, Washington, DC 20402-9328.
Copies are also available from the National Technical Information Service, 5285 Port Royal Road, Springfield, VA
22161. A copy is also available for inspection and copying for a fee in the NRC Public Document Room, 2120 L Street, NW
(Lower Level), Washington, DC 20555-0001.

2. Fees Based on Other Factors





Comment.

 As in FYs 1991-1993, commenters indicated that NRC should assess fees based on the amount or type of material
possessed, the number of radioactive sources, the sales generated by the licensed location, the competitive condition
of certain markets and the effect of fees on domestic and foreign competition. 



Response.

 The issues of basing fees on the amount of material possessed, the frequency of use of the material, the size of the facilities,
and market competitive positions, was addressed by the NRC in previous rules and in the Regulatory Flexibility Analysis
in Appendix A to the final rule published July 10, 1991 (56 FR 31511-31513). The NRC did not adopt that approach
because it would require licensees to submit large amounts of new data and would require additional NRC staff to evaluate
the data submitted and to develop and administer even more complex fee schedules. The NRC continues to believe that
uniformly allocating the generic and other regulatory costs to the specific licensee within a class to determine
the amount of the annual fee is a fair, equitable, and practical way to recover those costs and that establishing reduced
annual fees based on gross receipts (size) is the most appropriate approach to minimize the impact on small entities.
Therefore, NRC finds no basis for altering its approach at this time. This approach was upheld by the D.C. Circuit in
its March 16, 1993, decision in 

Allied-Signal. 



3. High-Level Waste



Comment.

 One commenter stated that the Department of Energy (DOE) should pay, through user fees, for NRC's costs related to
DOE's high-level waste (HLW) activities at Yucca Mountain. 



Response.

 All of NRC's direct costs related to the disposal of civilian high-level waste in DOE's geologic repository are paid
for with funds appropriated from the Nuclear Waste Fund (NWF). For FY 1994, the budgeted amount appropriated to the
NRC from the NWF is about $22 million. The amount appropriated from the NWF is subtracted from the total NRC appropriation,
and is therefore not included in the fee base. This is shown in Table I. Thus, no NRC fees are assessed to recover the direct
HLW costs. 



C. Specific Fee Issues_Part 170 



1. Fees for Special Projects. 




Comment.

 Several commenters supported the proposed change in 10 CFR part 170 special project fees whereby the definition would
be revised to indicate that 10 CFR part 170 fees will not be assessed for certain reports submitted to the NRC. Rather,
commenters point out these costs are more appropriately assessed as 10 CFR part 171 annual fees because the related
activities are in support of generic efforts such as development of regulatory guidance applicable to a class of licensees.
One commenter, while supporting the proposed change, stated that the terms ``alternate method'', ``reanalysis'',
and ``unreviewed safety issue'' are imprecise and should be further defined or explained. Another commenter requested
that the NRC reinstate a fee ceiling for topical report reviews. The commenter indicated that a fee ceiling would encourage
the submittal of topical reports and contribute to the advance of the state-of-the-art in the nuclear industry and
resultant improvement in nuclear plant safety. 


Response.

 The NRC has revised the definition of special projects as provided in  170.3 of the regulations to indicate that
10 CFR part 170 fees will not be assessed for certain requests/reports. Based on a commenter's suggestion, the terms
``alternate method'', ``reanalysis'', and ``unreviewed safety issue'' have been further explained in section
IV, Section-by-Section Analysis. 

The NRC indicated in the FY 1991 final fee rule that it had decided to eliminate the ceiling for topical report reviews
based on the 100 percent recovery requirement and congressional guidance that each licensee or applicant pay the
full costs of all identifiable regulatory services received from the NRC. Further, the NRC costs for topical reports
reviews vary significantly depending on the particular topical report reviewed. This makes it impractical to establish
an equitable ceiling or flat fee (56 FR 31478; July 10, 1991). Recently, the Commission revisited this issue as part
of its review of fee policy that was required by EPA-92. The policy of assessing 10 CFR part 170 fees, without a
ceiling, for the review and approval of topical reports was reconfirmed. For these reasons, the NRC is not establishing
a fee ceiling for topical reports in this final rule.

2. Fees for Reciprocity




Comment.

 The NRC charges Agreement State licensees who provide services in non-Agreement States, ``reciprocity fees''.
A few commenters indicated that they were opposed to the fees for reciprocity, particularly the proposed fees for
revisions to information submitted on the NRC Form-241 filed by 10 CFR 150.20 general licensees. They stated that
fees are an unnecessary burden and suggested that the NRC reconsider its decision to increase the current fees and
add additional charges for reciprocity licensees. They stated that these costs would have to be included in proposals
for work in non-Agreement States and that, as small firms, they could not absorb such costs and remain competitive
with larger firms offering similar services. One commenter suggested that the fee for revisions to NRC Form 241 be
established at $25 to $50 per revision rather than $200 as proposed. Commenters questioned whether the establishment
of the reciprocity fees is an effort to restrict survey activities to the home-State of the company because the additional
costs do not make it feasible to even consider bidding for projects out of the state. Commenters claimed that this allows
larger, wealthier companies the opportunity to bid for and secure out-of-state work. Other commenters supported
the reciprocity fees, including the proposed fees for revisions. They encouraged NRC to assess fees for services
provided specific classes of licensees and to reduce the costs classified as overhead. 



Response.

 The NRC is adopting the approach contained in the proposed rule as this is consistent with the Congressional mandate
that, to the extent practicable, a class of licensees bear the costs of providing regulatory services to them. Other
approaches suggested by commenters would have the effect of shifting the costs of reviewing revisions to Form 241
to other classes of licensees. Agreement State licensees requesting reciprocity for activities conducted in non-Agreement
States or in offshore waters are subject to 10 CFR 150.20. The first time within a calendar year that an Agreement State
licensee conducts activities in non-Agreement States or in offshore waters, it must file a completed NRC Form 241.
Revisions to the initial NRC Form 241 are filed for review and authorization when persons using the 10 CFR part 150.20
general license either add locations of work, use different radioactive material or perform additional work activities
in a non-Agreement State. Information submitted to the NRC by the 10 CFR 150.20 general licensee that clarifies or
deletes specific locations or work sites, work site contacts, or dates of work is considered by the NRC to be a clarification,
not a revision. Changes in the equipment to be used under the 10 CFR 150.20 general license do not require a revision
if there is no change in (1) activity to be conducted, (2) the radioactive material to be used, and (3) if the Agreement
State license authorizes the new equipment. 

The fee of $700 for the initial filing of Form-241 is the same as that assessed in FY 1993. The fee of $200 for revisions
to the Form-241 has been added to this final rule. The reciprocity fees established by the NRC are not intended to restrict
companies from doing work in non-Agreement States. The fees will allow the NRC to recover the costs it expends in reviewing
initial applications and revisions filed by 10 CFR part 150.20 general licensees. That is, the fee is intended to recover
the cost of identifiable services to a specific applicant in accordance with OBRA-90 and the IOAA. Fee Category
16 of 10 CFR part 170.31 has been revised to add a fee of $200 for each revision filed by Agreement State licensees. The
revision fee will be due at the time the applicant files a revision to information submitted on the initial Form-241
with the NRC.

3. Fees for Irradiators




Comment. 

One commenter indicated that underwater irradiators should not be placed, for fee purposes, in fee Categories 3F
and 3G, the same category as ``panoramic'' or ``cell'' type irradiators, because the amount of regulation pertaining
to unshielded source irradiators is much greater than that which applies to underwater irradiators. The commenter
believes the license should be classified as Category 3E, a self-shielded irradiator. The commenter states that
the relative complexity of the two designs dictates that this be the case. Therefore, licensing, inspection, and
other NRC activities dealing with underwater irradiators must consume much less time and effort compared to their
``cell'' or ``panoramic'' counterparts. 



Response. 

The Commission will continue to place underwater irradiators in fee Categories 3F and 3G. Although the sources are
not removed from their shielding for irradiator purposes, underwater irradiators are not self-shielded as are the
small irradiators in fee Category 3E. The underwater irradiators are large irradiators and possession limits of
thousands of curies are authorized in the license. As a result, more regulatory effort is required to regulate underwater
irradiators than is required to regulate the small irridiators in fee Category 3E. For example, the provisions of
10 CFR part 36 apply the same requirements to both the underwater irradiators where the source is not exposed for irradiation
and the exposed source irradiators. The average cost of conducting license reviews and performing inspection of
the underwater irradiators where the source remains shielded during irradiation are similar to the costs for irradiators
where the source is exposed during irradiation.



D. Specific Fee Issues_Part 171 



1. Exemption From Fees for State-Owned Reactors. 





Comment. 

Several commenters supported the proposed exemption from annual fees for State-owned research reactors. These
commenters indicated that the reactors are used primarily for educational training and academic research purposes
and contribute significantly to the national research effort and thereby provide significant externalized benefits
to society. 



Response. 

The NRC, in this final rule, will amend both   170.11(a) and 171.11(a)(2) to provide that State-owned
research reactors used primarily for educational training and academic research purposes will be exempt from fees.
The proposed rule would have amended only 10 CFR part 171. The NRC believes that both of these changes are consistent
with the legislative intent of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 that government-owned research reactors be exempt from
fees if they meet the technical design criteria of the exemption and are used primarily for educational training and
academic research purposes. 



2. Annual Fee for Uranium Recovery Facilities





Comment. 

While supporting the NRC's proposed first-time assessment of a $1.5 million annual fee to the Department of Energy
(DOE) for Uranium Mill Tailing Control Act (UMTCA) activities, several commenters strongly objected to the proposed
annual fees for uranium recovery licensees. They agree that the NRC should be reimbursed by the collection of reasonable
fees commensurate with services provided but indicated that the proposed fees are not equitable or reasonable and
have not been implemented in a fair and equitable manner. They believe that the Class I fees for mill licensees are entirely
disproportionate to the degree of NRC's involvement with the uranium recovery sites. Commenters indicated that
the large increases in fees for FY 1994 (approximately $36,000 per mill) demonstrate again the inconsistent and fluctuating
nature of the NRC fee system. These licensees asserted that they have no means of anticipating or budgeting for the
fees and therefore large increases are unacceptable. One commenter stated that the NRC's argument that the fees have
increased because the initial licensing of Envirocare's 11.e(2) facility is complete is irrelevant and without
merit because Envirocare's license is a Class 4D byproduct disposal facility and not a uranium recovery license.
Commenters note that while the amount to be recovered from uranium recovery licenses was $465,000 for FY 1993, the
amount to be recovered for FY 1994 increased to $2.1 million_a 350 percent increase. Commenters state that regulatory
services to the industry have not increased from FY 1993 to FY 1994. Commenters find this situation particularly troubling
as they believe the costs for uranium recovery facilities should have decreased with the closure of the Uranium Recovery
Field Office (URFO) in Denver, Colorado, which was described by NRC ``as a cost reduction measure to uranium recovery
licensees''. 

One commenter argues that the annual fee of $8,700 for a Category 4D license is not justified when one considers the
fee of $94,300 for a mill license, a difference of $85,600. The commenter states that this disparity is so great that
it cannot be explained as anything short of arbitrary and capricious. The commenter asserted that to be equitable,
Category 4D licenses should be assessed the same fees as a mill in fee Category 2.A.(1), Class I, because commercial
byproduct disposal sites are analogous to uranium recovery tailings impoundments and essentially require the same
regulatory oversight. 

One commenter was concerned that the new fees collected from DOE will not be used to decrease the fees placed on other

Response. 

Contrary to the commenter's claim, the total budget authority to be recovered through fees from Title II uranium recovery
licensees has decreased over the past two years. The following table shows the NRC budget authority for Title II uranium
recovery licensees for FY 1992, FY 1993, and FY 1994. 






As shown above, the NRC total budget authority for commercial uranium recovery licensees has steadily decreased
from $3,668,000 in FY 1992 to $2,839,000 in FY 1994, a 23 percent decrease since FY 1992. However, because of the relatively
large collection of 10 CFR Part 170 fees in FY 1993 as a result of the NRC licensing review efforts associated with the
Envirocare license application, the FY 1993 amount of $465,000 to be collected through annual fees is $174,000 less
than the FY 1994 annual fee amount of $639,000. In FY 1993, the NRC estimated that approximately $2.6 million would
be collected from 10 CFR 170 fees, including fees for the major review work for the Envirocare 11.e(2) license. The
Envirocare license was issued on November 19, 1993. Therefore, the 10 CFR Part 170 fees estimated to be collected in
FY 1994 have decreased. 

Another reason for the increase in FY 1994 annual fees for commercial uranium recovery licensees is a reduction in
the number of licensees. In FY 1993 there were 14 uranium recovery licensees subject to annual fees, compared with
12 licensees in FY 1994. This is a decrease of 2 licensees (or 14 percent). Because costs are allocated to a class of licensees,
any terminations that occur within the class will raise the annual fees for the remaining licensees within that class
in order for the NRC to collect approximately 100 percent of its budget in fees. The generic and other regulatory costs
allocated to a class of licensees under 10 CFR Part 171 are not dependent on the number of licensees in a class. 

While the total amount of annual fees to be recovered from all uranium recovery licensees, commercial (Title II) and
DOE (Title I) is $2.1 million in FY 1994, $1.5 million of this amount is for DOE Uranium Mill Tailing Control Act (UMTRCA)
activities. The $1.5 million related to DOE UMTRCA activities is being paid by DOE in FY 1994, leaving the $0.6 million
to be paid by the commercial Title II facilities. The budget for DOE UMTRCA activities does not affect commercial uranium
recovery license fees in FY 1994, nor did it affect their fees prior to FY 1994. As noted by the commenters, DOE is being
assessed a $1.5 million annual fee in FY 1994 (10 CFR 171.16(d), fee Category 18b). For FYs 1991-1993, the costs
for DOE UMTRCA activities were assessed to operating power reactors as a surcharge because DOE was not an NRC licensee
(10 CFR 171.15(c)(2)). In FY 1994, the costs for UMTRCA activities were moved from the power reactor class of licensees
to the uranium recovery class because as of September 21, 1993, DOE became a general licensee of the NRC (10 CFR 40.27)
because post-reclamation closure of the Spook, Wyoming site had been achieved. As a result, DOE will be billed for
the costs ($1.5 million in FY 1994) associated with NRC's UMTRCA review and all activities associated with the facilities
assigned to DOE under UMTRCA. 

The statement made by a commenter that fees collected from DOE will not be used to decrease NRC's license fees is not
correct. The $1.5 million to be collected from DOE will not be assessed to operating power reactors who have paid these
costs since FY 1991. Therefore, the fees for operating power reactors will decrease as a result of the reallocation
of costs. 

Based on the comments regarding the annual fee for licenses authorizing the disposal of 11e.(2) byproduct material,
the NRC has reexamined its allocation of the budget for Title II uranium recovery activities. Based on this reexamination
and the comments received, the NRC has concluded that the part of the budgeted costs for the uranium recovery class
of licensees should be allocated to licenses that authorize receipt and disposal of 11e.(2) byproduct material,
because some of these budgeted resources are used to regulate these licensees. Thus, the $639,000 to be recovered
in annual fees will be recovered from fee category 2.A.(2) Class I facilities, Class II facilities and Other facilities,
plus licenses authorizing disposal of 11e.(2) byproduct material. Additionally, the Commission has determined
that for licenses issued for the primary purpose of disposal of 11e.(2) byproduct material (e.g., the license issued
to Envirocare in FY 1994) the annual fee should be 90 percent of the fee for a Class I mill. This is based on a determination
that an estimated 90 percent of the budget for regulating Class I mills is related to the mill tailings and the remaining
10 percent to the processing of the ore. Therefore, since essentially the same regulations apply to the mill tailings
generated by a Class I mill and the 11e.(2) byproduct material received by a licensee whose primary purpose is to dispose
of 11e.(2) byproduct material, the annual fee for a licensee whose primary purpose is the disposal of 11e.(2) byproduct
material should be the same as that portion (90 percent) of the annual fee for a Class I facility that is related to the
mill tailings. The annual fee for non-operating mills that accept 11e.(2) byproduct material for disposal in tailings
piles created by mill operations will not be changed, because such disposal is incidental to the existing tailings
that were generated prior to elimination of the mill's authority to operate and the Commission's policy is not to assess
an annual fee to non-operating facilities. As a result of the above changes the base annual fee for a Class I facility
will be reduced from $94,300 to $74,500 for FY 1994. The annual fee for licenses with the primary purpose of disposal
of 11e.(2) byproduct material will be $67,000.

3. Annual Fee for Fuel Facilities




a. 

Comment.

 Two commenters objected to the proposed reclassification of General Atomics' (GA) special nuclear material license
from one subclass to another. Commenters indicated that such a reclassification, with the attendant increase in
annual fees, would have the further effect of forcing GA to shut down the manufacture of a limited number of TRIGA research
reactor fuel elements, thereby eliminating any U.S. source for this type of reactor fuel. Commenters argued that
the licensee is not a ``fuel facility'' in the same sense as other fee Category 1.A.(1) licensees, in that all of the
licensees in fee Category 1.A.(1) are large suppliers of light water reactor fuel to the commercial power industry
or the U.S. Navy. Commenters stated that reclassifying the license is inconsistent with the NRC's stated underlying
basis of charging a class of licensees for NRC costs attributable to that class of licensees particularly when one
considers, for comparison purposes, the special nuclear material (SNM) throughput, facility size, employment
numbers, complexity of processes, chemical/physical forms of SNM, and number of process steps. Commenters therefore
concluded that the GA license should not be reclassified. 

General Atomics, whose license is to be reclassified, commented that after three years of being classified as a fee
Category 1.A.(2) licensee, there is no justification for suddenly reclassifying the license as a fee Category 1.A.(1)
fuel facility, because there has been no change of any kind in the activities or licensing status since 1991 that would
warrant reclassification of the facility. GA also contends that it is unfair to reclassify the license after the beginning
of the fiscal year and to impose more than an eight-fold increase in the fee associated with the new category without
the licensee having the opportunity to take licensing action to avoid the fee. GA states that when the initial rule
for 100 percent recovery was published in FY 1991, the NRC recognized that many licensees might wish to avoid or minimize
the fees by terminating or modifying their licenses, and for that reason provided a 30-day period before the effective
date of the rule for a licensee to file a request to terminate the license or request a possession-only license and thereby
avoid paying the annual fee. GA also stated that imposition of the proposed fee would force them to significantly raise
its unit fuel prices to recover the eight-fold fee increase and that many of its customers for research reactor fuel
are typically low-budget research facilities such as university research reactors, many of which are operated by
nonprofit educational institutions. 






















Response. 

The NRC established fuel facilities as a separate class of licensees in FY 1991. Within the class, there are four subclasses
of licensees described in 10 CFR 171.16(d): high-enriched uranium (HEU) fuel fabrication, low-enriched uranium
(LEU) fuel fabrication, all other materials licenses authorizing critical quantities of special nuclear material,
and UF

6

 converters. One of the questions raised by the commenters is whether GA license SNM-696 should be placed in the
LEU fuel fabrication facility subclass (fee category 1.A.(1)) or the other facility subclass authorizing critical
quantities of special nuclear material (fee category 1.A.(2)). Fee Category 1.A.(1) of 10 CFR 171.16(d) is intended
to cover those licenses that authorize the possession and use of uranium 235 or plutonium for fuel fabrication activities.
In the proposed rule for FY 1994, the NRC concluded that license SNM-696, held by GA, would be reclassified from
fee Category 1.A.(2) (all other materials licenses authorizing critical quantities of special nuclear material)
to fee Category 1.A.(1) (a low-enriched fuel fabrication facility). This reclassification is based on the fact that
(1) the license authorizes the possession and use of uranium 235 for fuel fabrication activities and (2) GA manufactures
TRIGA research reactor fuel elements using low-enriched fuel. As a result, the proper classification for license
SNM-696 is fee category 1.A.(1) (low-enriched fuel fabrication). In the past, this license was improperly
categorized by NRC and as a result, General Atomics was assessed substantially lower fees over the past three years
than it should have been. Rather than continue using an incorrect fee classification for this license, now that the
NRC is aware of its administrative error, this final rule places the license in its proper fee category. The NRC recently
addressed a similar classification issue in response to a Babcock and Wilcox (B&W) request that their LEU fuel
fabrication facility be reclassified from fee category 1.A.(1) (LEU facility) to fee category 1.A.(2) (all other
materials licenses authorizing critical quantities of special nuclear material). On January 7, 1994, the NRC denied
this request for reasons similar to those stated above for the General Atomics license. 
The other question raised by the commenter is whether the fee for the GA license should be the same as the other LEU fuel
fabrication licenses because their fuel and process is different. That is, would assessing GA the same fee as other
LEU fuel fabrication licensees represent a disproportionate allocation of costs to GA. B&W has also raised similar
questions relative to their LEU facility. The NRC is considering B&W's request for a partial exemption from annual
fees under 10 CFR 171.11(d). This request is currently under review. Some of the comments received concerning the
GA fuel facility are similar to the arguments presented by B&W for an exemption. GA states that ``Reclassifying
GA as a Category 1.A.(1) licensee is inconsistent with the NRC's stated underlying basis of `charging a class of licensees
for NRC costs attributable to that class of licensees.' It asserts that by any measure of comparison, e.g., SNM * * *
complexity of processes, chemical/physical forms of SNM, number of process steps, etc., GA's licensed activities
are nowhere close to being in the same class as the licensees listed in Category 1.A.(1). GA's * * * licensed
processes are simple small batch-wise operations, there are no processes involving solutions or powders (the fuel
is a uranium-zirconium metal alloy), * * *'' 
The NRC believes that consideration of GA's comment as a request for an exemption under 10 CFR 171.11(d) is appropriate
and supported by 

Allied-Signal 

v. 

NRC. 

The Court there indicated that they saw no reason to require the Commission to address rare situations in the rule itself,
especially since 10 CFR Part 171 provides for exemptions in unusual circumstances. Therefore, the NRC intends to
treat the unusual circumstances discussed in GA's comments as an exemption request, which it will address in the near
future. The Commission notes, however, that the exemption determination will not be based on factors associated
with size, ability to pay, or other economic factors. As stated in the decision to reinstate the exemption from annual
fees for non-profit educational institutions, ability to pay is not a basis for an exemption (59 FR 12539). The NRC
also addressed these issues in the Regulatory Flexibility Analysis in Appendix A to the final rule published July
10, 1991 (56 FR 31511). The Commission indicated these generally are not factors it will consider in setting fees and
finds no basis for altering its approach at this time.

Given the questions raised by B&W, GA, and other fuel facilities regarding exemptions from fees and proper fee
category classification, the NRC plans to reexamine the fuel facility subclass categorizations. Any restructuring
that results from this reexamination will be included in the proposed FY 1995 fee rule for notice and comment. 
The NRC adopts General Atomics' suggestion that the NRC consider a waiver of the FY 1994 annual fees if, within the 30-day
period after the NRC acts on their exemption request, it notifies the NRC in writing, in accordance with 10 CFR 70.38,
that it wishes to relinquish the portion of their license permitting fabrication of fuel elements or to obtain a POL.
In order to be considered for the waiver of the FY 1994 annual fee, General Atomics must permanently cease fuel fabrication
activities within the 30-day period after NRC acts on the exemption request. 
With respect to the argument that reclassifying the license is inconsistent with the NRC's stated underlying basis
of ``charging a class of licensees for NRC costs attributable to that class of licensees'', costs for providing an
identifiable service related to a specific application, license or approval are recovered under the fee regulations
in 10 CFR Part 170. For generic and other regulatory costs not recovered under 10 CFR 170, the NRC, in compliance with
the requirements of OBRA-90, has allocated these costs to major classes of licensees. The law permits, and the
NRC has established, a schedule of annual charges in 10 CFR Part 171 that assesses different annual charges to different
licensees or classes of licensees. To the extent practicable, and where necessary for a more fair and equitable allocation
of costs, a major class of licensees is divided into subclasses. Within a class or subclass of licensees, the costs
are uniformly allocated to each licensee in the class or subclass based on the premise that there is no significant
difference in the generic and other regulatory services provided to each licensee within a class or subclass. This
approach and principle are used for all classes of licensees (57 FR 32693; July 23, 1992). The Commission has carefully
reviewed the costs allocated to the LEU fuel fabrication subclass and concluded that the budgeted costs have been
properly assigned to those licensees within the subclass. 
b. 

Comment. 

Commenters also objected to the increases in annual fees for Category 1.A.(1) (low-enriched fuel facilities) and
Category 1.A.(2), (other materials licenses authorizing critical quantities of special nuclear material). Commenters
indicated that the base fee for low-enriched fuel facilities has increased from about $700,000 in FY 1991 to $1.4 million
in FY 1994, while Category 1.A.(2) increased from about $175,000 to $304,000 (including surcharge). These increases,
commenters claimed, place an undue hardship on the profitable operation of these facilities and are grossly out of
proportion to any warranted increase in the effort expended by the NRC in regulating these classes of licensees. One
commenter stated that the NRC's practice of retroactively revising annual fees causes major corporate budgeting
problems, especially when large increases between the originally invoiced quarterly payments and actual annual
fees are the result. 



Response. 

The amount of the NRC's fees are based on the budget authority for a class of licensees and do not consider impact on a
company's profitability. The NRC budgeted costs for this class of licensees have increased because the NRC budgeted
and the Congress appropriated greater resources to regulate the safety and safeguards of fuel facilities. Under
the 100 percent recovery statute of OBRA-90, charging this class of licensees fees that fail to recover the full
budgeted amount, would mean that other licensees must pay additional fees which provide no benefit to them. NRC promulgates
its final rules as early as it can subject to certain time-sensitive constraints: the NRC must receive a Congressionally
approved budget, calculate the numerous fees in question, issue a proposed rule for comment, evaluate the comments,
and issue a final fee rule. 
c. 

Comment. 

One commenter, Allied-Signal (A-S), believed that the costs allocated to the UF

6

 conversion subclass should be divided equally between two licensees rather than one, even though the second licensee
has a possession only license (POL). A-S argued that the NRC has not provided a rational basis for exempting that
licensee from the annual fee. A-S noted the NRC's policy that it is the existence of a license, not operations,
that determines allocation of costs for recovery through the annual fee. A-S believes that a licensee that has
a license to operate but does not do so is no different from a licensee that has operated, stops doing so, and holds a POL.
A-S believes that, in each case, the NRC's regulations are equally applicable and the licensee benefits from
them. A-S pointed out that it is the only entity in the U.S. engaging in UF

6

 conversion operations and although it has attempted to pass the cost of fees on to its customers, it has not been able
to do so on a broad-scale basis. A-S claimed that the proposed fee would raise its costs by 6 cents per pound and
that winning bids from Canadian and European UF

6

 converters are decided by as little as 1 cent per pound of UF

6

. 
A-S also argued that the UF

6

 conversion license should be removed from the fuel facility class of licensees and included in the uranium recovery
class because the operations of the UF

6

 converter are more similar to those of a uranium mill than to a fuel facility. Additionally, there is now only one UF

6

 converter in the U.S. and a subcategory of one does not accurately reflect the relevant amount of NRC's resources devoted
to the license and for that reason is inappropriate. Therefore, according to Allied-Signal, the annual fee is not
fairly and equitably allocated as required by OBRA-90, and does not bear a reasonable relationship to the cost
of providing regulatory services, also required by the statute. A-S, therefore, believes the resulting fee
for UF

6

 converters is disproportionately higher than that charged to licensees in the uranium recovery category and disproportionately
close to what is assessed to operating reactors. 


Response. 

The NRC has a long-standing policy of not assessing annual fees to those licensees who have indicated to the NRC that
they wish to amend their license to permanently withdraw authority to operate and have been issued a possession only
license (POL) (51 FR 33228; September 18, 1986). In FY 1991, the NRC reconsidered and reaffirmed its policy that licensees
with POLs would not be subject to the annual fees when it initially established fees to recover 100 percent of its budget
authority under OBRA-90 (56 FR 14873; April 12, 1991). Recently, the Commission revisited this issue as part
of its fee policy review required by EPA-92, and affirmed its decision to continue the policy of not assessing
annual fees to licensees when the license is amended to authorize possession only or decommissioning. This is consistent
with the concept that those who benefit from a license that authorizes operation or use of material should pay annual
fees. Therefore, consistent with agency policy included in the past fee rules, and the FY 1994 proposed fee rule, the
NRC will not assess FY 1994 annual fees to Sequoyah Fuels Corporation, previously a UF

6

 converter but now is not authorized to operate as a UF

6

 converter.

However, the NRC recognizes that its fee rule including this policy could result in a disproportionate allocation
of costs to a licensee in unusual situations. Exemptions for such unusual circumstances are provided for in 10 CFR
171.11(d) and are supported by 

Allied-Signal v. NRC. 

The NRC concludes that the issues raised by Allied-Signal regarding a disproportionate allocation of the budgeted
costs to them, as a result of the elimination of Sequoyah Fuels from the fee base, falls within the confines of an unusual
situation. Therefore, the NRC will consider Allied-Signal's comments regarding NRC's allocation of costs to them
as an exemption request under 10 CFR 171.11(d). The Commission will issue a decision on this exemption request in the
near future. 
As indicated in the response in item 3(a), the NRC recognized that there will be adverse impacts on licensees as a result
of implementing OBRA-90. The NRC has concluded after notice and comment rulemaking that it would not be appropriate
to consider licensees' ability to pass through costs in establishing its fee schedules, an approach now recommended
by Allied-Signal. As stated in the decision to reinstate the exemption from annual fees for nonprofit educational
institutions, ability to pay is not a basis for an exemption (59 FR 12539). No one sought judicial review of that decision.

The Commission disagrees with Allied-Signal's suggestion that it be placed in the uranium recovery fee category
rather than that reserved for fuel facilities, where it is currently located. The NRC includes the regulatory costs
for UF

6

 conversion facilities in the fuel facility class of licensees. In developing the FY 1994 annual fees the NRC followed
the established budget structure. This permitted the NRC to more readily identify and allocate generic and other
regulatory costs to a class of licensees, and allowed the NRC to explain and to show the origin of these costs upon public
examination of the record. 
Although the UF

6

 conversion facilities are included in the same class as fuel fabrication facilities for budgeting purposes, the
annual fee is based on the NRC's costs attributable to the UF

6

 conversion facility subclass of licensees. For example, generic safety and safeguards and other regulatory costs
are included in the budgeted costs for the fuel facilities class of licensees. However, none of the safeguards costs
are included in the annual fee for the UF

6

 conversion facility subclass since none of these costs are attributable to this subclass. Thus, the costs included
in the annual fee for the UF

6

 subclass of licensees are those budgeted costs attributable to the subclass. These costs, and the resulting annual
fee, would be the same independent of where they are included in the budget. Therefore, even if the UF

6

 conversion facilities are more akin to uranium recovery facilities, the budgeted costs attributable to them result
in a different annual fee. 
The NRC further notes that the NRC's costs of promulgating regulations for a type of licensee do not necessarily decrease
when the number of licenses in a class goes down. Whether a class of licensees is comprised of one licensee or one hundred,
generic safety concerns may well remain the same, and the same research and regulations are necessary. This is what
distinguishes the annual fee from the 10 CFR Part 170 fees, which are charged to recapture costs for specific services
such as inspections and license amendments. By its very nature the annual fee is levied to recover the costs of providing
services, such as the development of new regulations, that cannot be attributed to a specific licensee. 
The NRC does recognize the strain this policy unavoidably places on licensees who become, as Allied-Signal has, the
single licensee in their class or subclass. The NRC will be reviewing this problem along with others associated with
classification of fuel facilities. Any changes resulting from this review will be included in the FY 1995 proposed
rule for notice and public comment.

4. Fees for Independent Spent Fuel Storage Installations 




Comment. 

One commenter, while noting that the willingness and ability of the NRC to hold the line on, and indeed reduce, the recoverable
budget for FY 1994 is commendable, questioned the increase in fees from $136,200 to $363,500 for Independent Spent
Fuel Storage Installations. As a minimum, the commenter believes NRC should identify the additional resources to
be expended in this area. 


Response. 

The reasons for the increased fees for independent spent fuel storage licensees are two-fold. First, the budgeted
amount necessary to regulate spent fuel activities which is recovered through 10 CFR Part 170 and 171 fees increased
to provide regulatory oversight for the increased number of facilities and to accomplish necessary rulemaking activities
for spent fuel facilities. Additionally, as the licensing of these facilities are completed, the amount of fees from
10 CFR Part 170 decreased resulting in an increased amount of the budget that must be recovered from 10 CFR Part 171.



5. Proration of Annual Fees 




Comment. 

Several commenters concurred with the proposed proration provisions and permitting a waiver of annual fees for those
who either filed for termination of their license prior to October 1, 1993, or permanently ceased licensed activities
by September 30, 1993 but had not yet received necessary NRC approvals before the end of the fiscal year. 


Response. 

The NRC has amended 10 CFR 171.17 to revise the proration provision for reactors and add a proration provision for materials
licenses. The proration provisions are effective for FY 1994. The NRC proposed to prorate the annual fees for materials
licenses upgraded or downgraded during the fiscal year. However, based on lack of sufficient data at this time on upgrades
and downgrades of licenses and the administrative burden to implement this part of the proposed proration provision
for FY 1994, the NRC will prorate the annual fees only for those licenses for which a termination request or a request
for a POL has been filed during the fiscal year and for new licenses issued during the fiscal year. This issue will be
revisited in a future rulemaking. 


E. Other Issues 


1. Impact of Fees on Licensees




Comment. 

Several commenters expressed concern about the impact of fees, particularly on the practice of nuclear medicine.
Some commenters indicated that the increase in annual fees may indirectly limit access to critical radiological
care, particularly for small, rural, medical practices. They suggest that the fees be reduced or that NRC freeze the
annual license fee for a five-year period in order for them to stay in business. 


Response. 

The NRC is concerned about the impact of its fees but has concluded that significant changes can only come about through
the enactment of legislation. The Commission is satisfied that the fee schedule being promulgated for FY 1994 satisfies
all statutory obligations. The Commission recently considered the effect of fees on the medical community and decided
that it would not provide the significant fee relief requested by the medical commenters (59 FR 12555; March 17, 1994).



2. Deferral of Fees for Standardized Plants and Early Site Reviews 




Comment. 

One commenter urged NRC to reestablish the NRC's previous fee deferral policy for review of standardized plant designs
and early site reviews indicating that fee deferral for review of the standardized designs is essential to encourage
the development of such designs. 


Response. 

The Commission decided in the FY 1991 final fee rule that the costs for standardized reactor design reviews, whether
for domestic or foreign applicants, should be assessed under 10 CFR Part 170 to those filing an application with the
NRC for approval or certification of a standardized design (56 FR 31478; July 10, 1991). Recently, the Commission
revisited this issue as part of its review of fee policy required by the EPA-92 and reconfirmed its FY 1991 decision.
The NRC continues to believe the costs of these reviews should be assessed to advanced reactor applicants. The NRC
finds no compelling justification for singling out these classes of applications for special treatment and shifting
additional costs to operating power reactors or other NRC licensees. 


3. Revise 10 CFR 171.13 Notice 




Comment. 

One commenter pointed out that 10 CFR 171.13 states that the NRC will publish a notice concerning the annual fee in the


Federal Register

 during the first quarter of each fiscal year and that for the past four years the NRC has not met the requirement stated
in the regulation. The commenter suggests that the NRC publish the proposed annual fee and professional hourly rate
as early as possible within NRC's fiscal year to facilitate licensees' budget and planning processes. 


Response. 

The NRC agrees with the commenter and acknowledges the realities of the situation that the proposed rule has been published
during the third quarter of each of the past four fiscal years. The intent of the NRC is to publish the proposed rule as
quickly as is practicable but realizes and agrees that it is unlikely that publication will occur during the first
quarter of the fiscal year. To permit appropriate notice and comments, however, 10 CFR 171.13 will not be revised in
this final rule but will be revised in a future rulemaking.

III. Final Action_Changes Included in the Final Rule 



The NRC is amending its licensing, inspection, and annual fees for FY 1994. OBRA-90 requires that the NRC recover
approximately 100 percent of its FY 1994 budget authority, including the budget authority for its Office of the Inspector
General, less the appropriations received from the NWF, by assessing licensing, inspection, and annual fees. 

For FY 1994, the NRC's budget authority was originally $547.7 million. The Commission, in its effort to streamline
operations, proposed a $12.7 million rescission to its original appropriation for FY 1994. Congress approved this
NRC-proposed reduction. This resulted in a revised budget authority of $535.0 million. Approximately $22.0 million
of the revised budget was appropriated from the NWF. Therefore, OBRA-90 requires that the NRC collect approximately
$513.0 million in FY 1994 through 10 CFR part 170 licensing and inspection fees and 10 CFR part 171 annual fees. This
amount to be recovered for FY 1994 is about $6 million less than the total amount to be recovered for FY 1993. The NRC estimates
that approximately $120.1 million will be recovered in FY 1994 from the fees assessed under 10 CFR part 170. The remaining
$392.9 million will be recovered through the 10 CFR part 171 annual fees established for FY 1994. 

The NRC has not changed the basic approach, policies, or methodology for calculating the 10 CFR part 170 professional
hourly rate, the specific materials licensing and inspection fees in 10 CFR part 170, and the 10 CFR part 171 annual
fees set forth in the final rules published July 10, 1991 (56 FR 31472), July 23, 1992 (57 FR 32691), and July 20, 1993
(58 FR 38666), with the following exceptions: (1) The Commission has reinstated the annual fee exemption for nonprofit
educational institutions and (2) in this final rule, the NRC has directly assigned additional effort to the reactor
and materials programs for the Office of Investigations, the Office of Enforcement, the Advisory Committee on Reactor
Safeguards, and the Advisory Committee on Nuclear Waste. Resources for these activities had previously been included
in overhead but are now assigned directly to the class of licenses that they support. As a result of this direct assignment,
the cost per direct FTE is about 3 percent less than it would have been without the additional direct assignment. 

Under this final rule, fees for most materials and fuel cycle licensees will increase because_

(1) The NRC professional rate has increased slightly from $132/hr to $133/hr; 


(2) The NRC has directly assigned additional effort to the reactor and materials programs for the Office of Investigations,
the Office of Enforcement, the Advisory Committee on Reactor Safeguards, and the Advisory Committee on Nuclear Waste.
Resources for these activities had previously been included in overhead, but are now assigned directly to the class
of licensees that they support; 


(3) The number of licenses in some classes has decreased as compared to FY 1993 due to license termination or consolidation,
resulting in fewer licensees to pay for the costs of regulatory activities not recovered under 10 CFR Part 170; and



(4) The budget for some classes of licensees has increased.


The NRC contemplates that any fees to be collected as a result of this final rule will be assessed on an expedited basis
to ensure collection of the required fees by September 30, 1994, as stipulated in OBRA-90. Therefore, as in FY
1991, FY 1992, and FY 1993, the fees will become effective 30 days after publication of the final rule. The NRC will send
a bill for the amount of the annual fee to the licensee or certificate, registration, or approval holder upon publication
of the final rule. Payment is due on the effective date of the FY 1994 rule.




A. Amendments to 10 CFR Part 170: Fees for Facilities, Materials, Import and Export Licenses, and Other Regulatory
Services 



Five amendments have been made to Part 170. These amendments do not change the underlying basis for the 
regulation_that fees be assessed to applicants, persons, and licensees for specific identifiable services rendered.
The revisions also comply with the guidance in the Conference Committee Report on OBRA-90 that fees assessed
under the Independent Offices Appropriation Act (IOAA) recover the full cost to the NRC of all identifiable regulatory
services each applicant or licensee receives.


First, the agency-wide professional hourly rate, which is used to determine the Part 170 fees, is increased from $132
per hour to $133 per hour ($231,216 per direct FTE). The rate is based on the FY 1994 direct FTEs and that portion of the
FY 1994 budget that does not constitute direct program support (contractual services costs) and is not recovered
through the appropriation from the NWF. As indicated earlier, the decrease in the FY 1994 budget as compared to the
FY 1993 budget is primarily for direct program support, which is not included in the hourly rate. Thus, the reduction
in the budget has limited impact on the hourly rate but will show up as a direct reduction to the amount allocated to the
various classes of licensees.


Second, the current Part 170 licensing and inspection fees in   170.21 and 170.31 for all applicants and
licensees are revised to reflect the very small increase in the hourly rate.


Third, the definition of special projects as provided in  170.3 of the regulations is revised as a result of (1)
the NRC's experience in implementing the 100 percent fee recovery program during the past three years and (2) the NRC's
most recent fee policy review, required by the Energy Policy Act of 1992. The NRC believes that the costs for some requests
or reports being filed with NRC are more appropriately captured in the 10 CFR Part 171 annual fees rather than assessing
specific fees under 10 CFR Part 170. These reports, although submitted by a specific organization, support NRC's
development of generic guidance and regulations (e.g., rules, regulatory guides, and policy statements), and resolution
of safety issues applicable to a class of licensees, such as those addressed in generic letters. Therefore, the applicable
definition in  170.3 and the footnotes in   170.21 and 170.31 are revised to indicate that 10 CFR
Part 170 fees will not be assessed for requests/reports which have been submitted to the NRC: 


(1) In response to a Generic Letter or NRC Bulletin that does not result in an amendment to the license, does not result
in the review of an alternate method or reanalysis to meet the requirements of the Generic Letter or does not involve
an unreviewed safety issue; 


(2) In response to an NRC request (at the Associate Office Director level or above) to resolve an identified safety,
safeguards, or environmental issue, or to assist the NRC in developing a rule, regulatory guide, policy statement,
generic letter, or bulletin; or 


(3) As a means of exchanging information between industry organizations and the NRC for the purpose of supporting
generic regulatory improvements or efforts.


The terms ``alternate method'', ``reanalysis'' and ``unreviewed safety issue'' are explained in more detail in
Section IV, Section-By-Section Analysis.


Fourth,  170.11(a) is amended to establish an exemption from fees for State-owned research reactors if they
meet the technical design criteria for the exemption and are research reactors used primarily for educational training
and academic research purposes.


Fifth, Fee Category 2 is amended by establishing two additional fee categories, 2.A.(2) and 2.A.(3), which cover
licenses authorizing receipt and disposal of Section 11e.(2) byproduct material as defined by the Atomic Energy
Act. The current 2.A. category has been amended to read 2.A.(1). The current 4.D. fee category has been eliminated.
This action recognizes that: (1) Source material licenses are issued to cover these licensed activities and therefore
they are more appropriately placed in the source material category; and (2) that a further distinction should be made
between those licenses whose primary purpose is to authorize receipt and disposal of 11e.(2) material requiring
the establishment of a new tailings pile and those licenses authorizing the receipt and disposal of 11e.(2) material
incidental to tailings piles created by mill operations.


In addition, Category 16 of  170.31, reciprocity, is amended to include a fee to recover the NRC's costs of reviewing
revisions to the initial NRC Form 241 filed by 10 CFR 150.20 general licensees. Agreement State licensees requesting
reciprocity for activities conducted in non-Agreement States or in offshore waters are subject to 10 CFR 150.20.
The first time within a calendar year that an Agreement State licensee conducts activities in non-Agreement States
or in offshore waters, it must file a completed NRC Form 241. Revisions to the initial NRC Form 241 are filed for review
and authorization when persons using the 10 CFR Part 150.20 general license either add locations of work, use different
radioactive material or perform additional work activities in a non-Agreement State.

B. Amendments to 10 CFR Part 171: Annual Fees for Reactor Operating Licenses, and Fuel Cycle Licenses and Materials
Licenses, Including Holders of Certificates of Compliance, Registrations, and Quality Assurance Program Approvals
and Government Agencies Licensed by NRC 




Six amendments have been made to 10 CFR Part 171. First, 
 171.11(a)(2) is amended to provide that State-owned research reactors used primarily for educational training
and academic research purposes will be exempt from the annual fee. The NRC believes that this change is consistent
with the legislative intent of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 that government-owned research reactors be exempt from
annual fees if they meet the technical design criteria for the exemption and are used primarily for educational training
and academic research purposes. 


Second,   171.15 and 171.16 are amended to revise the annual fees for FY 1994 to recover approximately
100 percent of the FY 1994 budget authority, less fees collected under 10 CFR Part 170 and funds appropriated from the
NWF. 


Third, fee Category 2 of  171.16(d) is amended by establishing two new fee categories, 2.A.(3) and 2.A.(4),
relating to the disposal of 11e.(2) byproduct material as defined by the Atomic Energy Act. The current fee Category
4.D. has been eliminated. This action recognizes that (1) part of the budgeted costs for the uranium recovery class
of licensees should be allocated to source material licenses that authorize receipt and disposal of 11e.(2) material
because some of these budgeted resources are used to regulate these licensees and (2) a further distinction should
be made between those licenses whose primary purpose is to authorize receipt and disposal of 11e.(2) byproduct material
requiring the establishment of a new mill tailings pile and those non-operating mills that accept 11e.(2) byproduct
material for disposal incidental to tailings piles created by mill operations. 


In addition, fee Category 18 of  171.16(d) is amended to assess fees to the Department of Energy (DOE) for its
general license in 10 CFR 40.27. The general license fulfills a requirement of the Uranium Mill Tailings Radiation
Control Act of 1978 (UMTRCA) (Public Law 95-604) that the perpetual custodian of reclaimed uranium mill tailings
piles be licensed by the NRC. The general license provided for in the regulation covers only post-reclamation closure
custody and site surveillance. Based on NRC's acceptance of DOE's Long Term Surveillance Plan for the Spook, Wyoming,
site on September 21, 1993, the site is now subject to the general license in 10 CFR 40.27. Because DOE now holds an NRC
license, it is subject to annual fees. The NRC had previously indicated its intent to bill DOE for UMTRCA costs once
post-closure was achieved and the sites were licensed by the Government (56 FR 31481; July 10, 1991). As a result, DOE
will be billed for the costs associated with NRC's UMTRCA review of all activities associated with the facilities
assigned to DOE under UMTRCA. As with other licensees, the annual fee for this class of licensees (DOE UMTRCA facilities)
will recover the generic and other regulatory costs not recovered through 10 CFR Part 170 fees. Because DOE, as a Federal
agency, cannot be assessed Part 170 fees under the Independent Offices Appropriation Act of 1952 (IOAA), the result
is that NRC will assess annual fees to DOE for the total costs of DOE UMTRCA activities. 


Fourth, 10 CFR 171.17 is amended to add a proration provision for materials licenses and to revise the proration provision
for reactors. The annual fee for materials licensees is prorated based on applications filed after October 1 of the
fiscal year to terminate a license or obtain a POL. Those materials licensees who file applications between October
1 and March 31 of the fiscal year to terminate the license or obtain a POL will be assessed one-half the annual fee stated
in 
 171.16(d) for the affected fee category(ies). Those materials licensees filing applications on or after
April 1 of the fiscal year to terminate a license or obtain a POL will be assessed the full annual fee for that fiscal year.
Those licensees who file for termination or POL must also permanently cease operations of relevant licensed activities
during the periods mentioned for the fees to be reduced. Similarly, materials licensees who were issued new licenses
during the fiscal year will be charged a prorated annual fee based on the date of issuance of the new license. New materials
licenses issued during the period October 1 through March 31 will be assessed one-half of the annual fee stated in  171.16(d)
for the applicable fee category(ies) for that fiscal year. New licenses issued on or after April 1 will not be assessed
an annual fee for that fiscal year. 


The proration provision in  171.17 applicable to reactors is amended to provide that, for licensees who have
requested an amendment to withdraw operating authority permanently during the FY, the annual fee will be prorated
based on the number of days during the FY the operating license was in effect before either the possession only license
was issued or the license was terminated. 


Fifth, Footnote 1 of 10 CFR 171.16(d) is amended to provide for a waiver of the FY 1994 annual fees for those materials
licensees, and holders of certificates, registrations, and approvals who either filed for termination of their
licenses or approvals or filed for possession only/storage licenses prior to October 1, 1993, and permanently ceased
licensed activities entirely by September 30, 1993. All other licensees and approval holders who held a license or
approval on October 1, 1993, are subject to FY 1994 annual fees. This change is in recognition of the fact that since
the final FY 1993 rule was published in July 1993, licensees have continued to file requests for termination of their
licenses or certificates with the NRC. Other licensees have either called or written to the NRC since the FY 1993 final
rule became effective requesting further clarification and information concerning the annual fees assessed. The
NRC is responding to these requests as quickly as possible. However, the NRC was unable to respond and take action on
all of the requests before the end of the fiscal year on September 30, 1993. Similar situations existed after the FY
1991 and FY 1992 rules were published, and in those cases NRC provided an exemption from the requirement that the annual
fee is waived only where a license is terminated before October 1 of each fiscal year.

Sixth,  171.19 is amended to credit the quarterly partial payments already made by certain licensees in FY 1994
either toward their total annual fee to be assessed or to make refunds, if necessary. 

The 10 CFR part 171 annual fees have been determined using the same method used to determine the FY 1991, FY 1992, and
FY 1993 annual fees. The amounts to be collected through annual fees in the amendments to 10 CFR part 171 are based on
the increased professional hourly rate. The amendments to 10 CFR part 171 do not change the underlying basis for 10
CFR part 171; that is, charging a class of licensees for NRC costs attributable to that class of licensees. The changes
are consistent with the Congressional guidance in the Conference Committee Report on OBRA-90, which states
that the ``conferees contemplate that the NRC will continue to allocate generic costs that are attributable to a given
class of licensee to such class'' and the ``conferees intend that the NRC assess the annual charge under the principle
that licensees who require the greatest expenditures of the agency's resources should pay the greatest annual fee''
(136 Cong. Rec., at H12692-93). 

During the past three years, many licensees have indicated that although they held a valid NRC license authorizing
the possession and use of special nuclear, source, or byproduct material, they were in fact either not using the material
to conduct operations or had disposed of the material and no longer needed the license. In responding to licensees
about this matter, the NRC has stated that annual fees are assessed based on whether a licensee holds a valid NRC license
that authorizes possession and use of radioactive material. Whether or not a licensee is actually conducting operations
using the material is a matter of licensee discretion. The NRC cannot control whether a licensee elects to possess
and use radioactive material once it receives a license from the NRC. Therefore, the NRC reemphasizes once again that
annual fees will be assessed based on whether a licensee holds a valid license with the NRC that authorizes possession
and use of radioactive material. To remove any uncertainties regarding agency policy on this issue, the NRC amended
10 CFR 171.16, footnotes 1 and 7 on July 20, 1993 (58 FR 38666). 



C. FY 1994 Budgeted Costs



The FY 1994 budgeted costs, by major activity, that will be recovered through 10 CFR parts 170 and 171 fees are shown
in Table I. 






The $26.6 million identified for those activities which are not identified as either 10 CFR parts 170 or 171 or the NWF
in Table I are distributed among the classes of licensees as follows:




$24.4 million to operating power reactors; 

$.7 million to fuel facilities; and 

$1.5 million to other materials licensees.




In addition, approximately $6.3 million must be collected as a result of continuing the $1,800 maximum fee for small
entities and the lower tier small entity fee of $400 for certain licensees. In order for the NRC to recover 100 percent
of its FY 1994 budget authority in accordance with OBRA-90, the NRC will recover $5.3 million of the $6.3 million
from operating power reactors and the remaining $1.0 million from other nonreactor entities that do not meet NRC small
entity size standards.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940720-0-00017 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940720-0-00001 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

This distribution results in an additional charge (surcharge) of approximately $273,000 per operating power reactor;
$55,770 for each HEU, LEU, UF

6

, and each other fuel facility license; $1,670 for each materials license in a category that generates a significant
amount of low level waste; and $170 for other materials licenses. When added to the base annual fee of approximately
$2.8 million per reactor, this will result in an annual fee of approximately $3.1 million per operating power reactor.
The total fuel facility annual fee will be between approximately $1.2 million and $3.2 million. The total annual fee
for materials licenses will vary depending on the fee category(ies) assigned to the license. 

The additional charges not directly or solely attributable to a specific class of NRC licensees and costs not recovered
from all NRC licensees on the basis of previous Commission policy decisions will be recovered from the designated
classes of licensees previously identified. A further discussion and breakdown of the specific costs by major classes
of licensees are shown in section IV of this final rule. 



IV. Section-by-Section Analysis 



The following analysis of those sections that are affected under this final rule provides additional explanatory
information. All references are to title 10, chapter I, Code of Federal Regulations. 



Part 170 

Section 170.3 Definitions



This section is amended to revise the definition of special projects. This change is based on NRC's experience during
the past three years in implementing the 100 percent fee recovery program and the fee policy review required by the
Energy Policy Act of 1992. The NRC believes that the costs for some requests or reports being filed with NRC are more
appropriately captured in the 10 CFR part 171 annual fees instead of assessing specific fees under 10 CFR part 170.
Therefore, the definition in  170.3, as well as the footnotes in   170.21 and 170.31, are amended
to indicate that 10 CFR part 170 fees will not be assessed for requests/reports which have been submitted to the NRC:


1. In response to a Generic Letter or NRC Bulletin that does not result in an amendment to the license, does not result
in the review of an alternate method or reanalysis to meet the requirements of the Generic Letter, or does not involve
an unreviewed safety issue; 

2. In response to an NRC request (at the Associate Office Director level or above) to resolve an identified safety,
safeguards, or environmental issue, or to assist the NRC in developing a rule, regulatory guide, policy statement,
generic letter, or bulletin; or 

3. As a means of exchanging information between industry organizations and the NRC for the purpose of supporting generic
regulatory improvements or efforts. 

The terms ``alternate method'', ``reanalysis'', and ``unreviewed safety issue'' as used in item 1 are further explained
as follows: 

``Alternate method'' is a method that deviates significantly (i.e., more than necessary for plant-specific or generic
program development) from the method proposed in the Generic Letter or NRC Bulletin; 

``Reanalysis'' is an analysis of an alternate method but not a review of changes to a method which is consistent with
that proposed by the Generic Letter or Bulletin. These types of ``consistent'' changes could be revisions submitted
pursuant to an NRC staff request for additional information or modification, or changes necessary for plant-specific
or generic implementation; and 

``Unreviewed safety issue'' is a safety issue unrelated to the safety issue identified in the generic communication
that arises from proposal of an alternate method and will require reanalysis by the NRC staff. 



Section 170.11 Exemptions



Paragraph (a)(9) of this section is established to provide an exemption from fees for State-owned research reactors
that meet certain technical design criteria and are used primarily for educational training and academic research
purposes. Currently, Federal agencies are exempt from payment of 10 CFR part 170 fees under the Independent Offices
Appropriation Act (IOAA). The proposed rule would have amended only 10 CFR part 171. The NRC believes however, that
this change to 10 CFR part 170 is consistent with the legislative intent of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 that government-owned
research reactors be exempt from fees if they meet the technical design criteria for the exemption and are used primarily
for educational training and academic research purposes. There is currently one research reactor, owned by the Rhode
Island Atomic Energy Commission, that will be exempt under this amendment to  170.11.

Section 170.20 Average Cost Per Professional Staff Hour



This section is amended to reflect an agency-wide, professional staff-hour rate based on FY 1994 budgeted costs.
Accordingly, the NRC professional staff-hour rate for FY 1994 for all fee categories that are based on full cost is
$133 per hour, or $231,216 per direct FTE. The rate is based on the FY 1994 direct FTEs and NRC budgeted costs that are
not recovered through the appropriation from the NWF. The rate is calculated using the identical method established
for FY 1991, FY 1992, and FY 1993. As noted earlier, in this final rule, the NRC has directly assigned additional effort
to the reactor and materials programs for the Office of Investigations, the Office of Enforcement, the Advisory Committee
on Reactor Safeguards and the Advisory Committee on Nuclear Waste. The method is as follows: 

1. All direct FTEs are identified in Table II by major program. For FY 1994 the NRC has traced additional direct effort
to the reactor and materials programs for the Office of Investigations, the Office of Enforcement, the Advisory Committee
on Reactor Safeguards, and the Advisory Committee on Nuclear Waste. The budgeted costs for these activities had previously
been included in overhead but are now being directly assigned to the class of licensees that they support. 





2. NRC FY 1994 budgeted costs are allocated, in Table III, to the following four major categories: 

(a) Salaries and benefits. 

(b) Administrative support.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940720-0-00019 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940720-0-00001 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(c) Travel. 

(d) Program support. 

3. Direct program support, which is the use of contract or other services in support of the line organization's direct
program, is excluded because these costs are charged directly through the various categories of fees. 

4. All other costs (i.e., Salaries and Benefits, Travel, Administrative Support, and Program Support contracts/services
for G&A activities) represent ``in-house'' costs and are to be collected by allocating them uniformly over the
total number of direct FTEs. 

Using this method, which was described in the final rules published July 10, 1991 (56 FR 31472), July 23, 1992 (57 FR
32691), and July 20, 1993 (58 FR 38666), and excluding direct Program Support funds, allocating the remaining $376.6
million uniformly to the direct FTEs (1,628.9) results in a rate of $231,216 per FTE for FY 1994. The Direct FTE Hourly
Rate is $133 per hour (rounded to the nearest whole dollar). This rate is calculated by dividing $376.6 million by the
number of direct FTEs (1,628.9 FTE) and the number of productive hours in one year (1744 hours) as indicated in OMB Circular
A-76, ``Performance of Commercial Activities.'' 






Section 170.21 Schedule of Fees for Production and Utilization Facilities, Review of Standard Reference Design
Approvals, Special Projects, Inspections and Import and Export Licenses. 

The licensing and inspection fees in this section, which are based on full-cost recovery, are revised to reflect the
FY 1994 budgeted costs and to recover costs incurred by the NRC in providing licensing and inspection services to indentifiable
recipients. The fees asssessed for services provided under the schedule are based on the professional hourly rate
as shown in  170.20 and any direct program support (contractual services) costs expended by the NRC. Any professional
hours expended on or after the effective date of this rule will be assessed at the FY 1994 rate shown in  170.20.
Although the amounts of the import and export licensing fees in  170.21, facility Category K, have not changed
from FY 1993 as a result of the very small increase in the hourly rate from $132 per hour to $133 per hour, they are being
published for purposes of convenience.

For those applications currently on file and pending completion, footnote 2 of  170.21 is revised to provide
that the professional hours expended up to the effective date of this rule will be assessed at the professional rates
established for the rules that became effective on June 20, 1984, January 30, 1989, July 2, 1990, August 9, 1991. August
24, 1992, and August 19, 1993, as appropriate. For topical report applications currently on file which are still pending
completion of the review and for which review costs have reached the applicable fee ceiling established by the July
2, 1990, rule, the costs incurred after any applicable ceiling was reached through August 8, 1991, will not be billed
to the applicant. Any professional hours expended for the review of topical report applications, amendments, revisions,
or supplements to a topical report on or after August 9, 1991, are assessed at the applicable rate established by  170.20.

Section 170.31 Schedule of Fees for Materials Licenses and Other Regulatory Services, Including Inspections and
Import and Export Licenses.

The licensing and inspection fees in this section are modified to recover the FY 1994 costs incurred by the Commission
in providing licensing and inspection services to identifiable recipients. Those flat fees, which are based on the
average time to review an application or conduct an inspection, are adjusted to reflect the very small increase in
the professional hourly rate from $132 per hour in FY 1993 to $133 per hour in FY 1994. In many cases, the fees for FY 1994
are the same as those assessed in FY 1993.

 
The amounts of the licensing and inspection flat fees were rounded by applying standard rules of arithmetic so that
the amounts rounded would be de minimus and convenient to the user. Fees that are greater than $1,000 are rounded to
the nearest $100. Fees under $1,000 are rounded to the nearest $10. 

The revised flat fees are applicable to fee categories 1.C and 1.D; 2.B and 2.C; 3.A through 3.P; 4.B through 9.D, 10.B,
15A through 15E and 16. The revised fees will be assessed for applications filed or inspections conducted on or after
the effective date of this rule. 

Fee Category 2 is amended by establishing two additional fee categories 2.A.(2) and 2.A.(3) which cover licenses
authorizing receipt and disposal of Section 11e.(2) byproduct material as defined by the Atomic Energy Act. The current
2.A. category has been amended to read 2.A.(1). The current 4.D. fee category has been eliminated. This action recognizes
that (1) source material licenses are issued to cover these licensed activities and they are more appropriately placed
in the source material category and (2) that a further distinction should be made between those licenses whose primary
purpose is to authorize receipt and disposal of 11e.(2) material requiring the establishment of a new tailings pile
from those licenses authorizing the receipt and disposal of 11e.(2) material incidental to tailings piles created
by mill operations. 

Fee Category 16, reciprocity, is also amended to include a fee to recover the costs incurred by the NRC for the review
of revisions to the information submitted on the initial NRC Form-241 filed by 10 CFR 150.20 general licensees during
the remainder of the calendar year. Agreement State licensees requesting reciprocity for activities conducted
in non-Agreement States or in offshore waters are subject to 10 CFR 150.20. The first time within a calendar year that
an Agreement State licensee conducts activities in non-Agreement States or in offshore waters, it must file a completed
NRC Form 241. Revisions to the initial NRC Form 241 are filed for review and authorization when persons using the 10
CFR Part 150.20 general license either add locations of work, use different radioactive material or perform additional
work activities in a non-Agreement State. 

For those licensing, inspection, and review fees assessed that are based on full-cost recovery (cost for professional
staff hours plus any contractual services), the revised hourly rate of $133, as shown in  170.20, applies to
those professional staff hours expended on or after the effective date of this rule. 



Part 171 

Section 171.11 Exemptions



Paragraph (a)(2) of this section is amended to exempt State-owned reactors used primarily for educational training
and academic research purposes from annual fees. The NRC believes that this change is consistent with the legislative
intent of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 that government-owned research reactors be exempt from annual fees if they
meet the technical design criteria of the exemption and are used primarily for educational training and academic
research purposes. There is currently one research reactor, owned by the Rhode Island Atomic Energy Commission,
that will be exempt under this amendment to  171.11. 


Section 171.15 Annual Fee: Reactor Operating Licenses



The annual fees in this section are revised to reflect FY 1994 budgeted costs. Paragraphs (a), (b)(3), (c)(2), (d),
and (e) are revised to comply with the requirement of OBRA-90 to recover approximately 100 percent of the NRC
budget for FY 1994. Table IV shows the budgeted costs that have been allocated directly to operating power reactors
as part of the base fee. They have been expressed in terms of the NRC's FY 1994 programs and program elements. The resulting
total base annual fee amount for power reactors is also shown.

Based on the information in Table IV, the base annual fees that will be assessed for FY 1994 are the amounts shown in Table
V below for each nuclear power operating license. 








The ``Other Reactor'' listed in Table V was not included in the fee base because historically Big Rock Point has been
granted a partial exemption from the annual fees. With respect to Big Rock Point, a smaller older reactor, the NRC hereby
grants a partial exemption from the FY 1994 annual fees based on a request filed with the NRC in accordance with  171.11.
The total amount of $0.2 million to be paid by Big Rock Point has been subtracted from the total amount assessed operating
reactors as a surcharge.

Paragraph (b)(3) is revised to change the fiscal year references from FY 1993 to FY 1994. Paragraph (c)(2) is amended
to show the amount of the surcharge for FY 1994. This surcharge is added to the base annual fee for each operating power
reactor shown in Table V. The purpose of this surcharge is to recover those NRC budgeted costs that are not directly
or solely attributable to operating power reactors but nevertheless must be recovered to comply with the requirements
of OBRA-90. The NRC has continued its previous policy decision to recover these costs from operating power reactors.

The FY 1994 budgeted costs related to the additional charge and the amount of the charge are calculated as follows:



 

The annual additional charge is determined as follows: 







On the basis of this calculation, an operating power reactor, Beaver Valley 1, for example, would pay a base annual
fee of $2,805,000 and an additional charge of $273,000 for a total annual fee of $3,078,000 for FY 1994. 
Paragraph (d) is revised to show, in summary form, the amount of the total FY 1994 annual fee, including the surcharge,
to be assessed for each major type of operating power reactor. 
Paragraph (e) is revised to show the amount of the FY 1994 annual fee for nonpower (test and research) reactors. In FY
1994, $373,000 in costs are attributable to those commercial and non-exempt Federal government organizations that
are licensed to operate test and research reactors. Applying these costs uniformly to those nonpower reactors subject
to fees results in an annual fee of $62,200 per operating license. The Energy Policy Act establishes an exemption for
certain Federally-owned research reactors that are used primarily for educational training and academic research
purposes where the design of the reactor satisfies certain technical specifications set forth in the legislation.
Consistent with this legislative requirement, the NRC granted an exemption from annual fees for FY 1992 and FY 1993
to the Veterans Administration Medical Center in Omaha, Nebraska, the U.S. Geological Survey for its reactor in Denver,
Colorado, and the Armed Forces Radiobiological Institute in Bethesda, Maryland for its research reactor. This exemption
was initially codified in the July 20, 1993 (58 FR 38695) final fee rule at  171.11(a) and more recently in the
March 17, 1994 (59 FR 12543) final rule at  171.11(a)(2). The NRC intends to continue to grant exemptions from
the annual fee to those Federally owned research and test reactors who meet the exemption criteria specified in  171.11.
The NRC is amending  171.11(a)(2) to exempt from annual fees the research reactor owned by the Rhode Island Atomic
Energy Commission.

Section 171.16 Annual fees: Materials Licensees, Holders of Certificates of Compliance, Holders of Sealed Source
and Device Registrations, Holders of Quality Assurance Program Approvals, and Government agencies licensed by
the NRC. 

 171.16(c) covers the fees assessed for those licensees that can qualify as small entities under NRC size standards.
Currently, the NRC assesses two fees for licensees that qualify as small entities under the NRC's size standards.
In general, licensees with gross annual receipts of $250,000 to $3.5 million pay a maximum annual fee of $1,800 per
licensed category. A second or lower-tier small entity fee of $400 is in place for licensees with gross annual receipts
of less than $250,000 and small governmental jurisdictions with a population of less than 20,000. Although the amounts
of the small entity fees have not changed for FY 1994, they are being published for purposes of convenience. 

Paragraph (d) is revised to reflect the FY 1994 budgeted costs for materials licensees, including Government agencies,
licensed by the NRC. These fees are necessary to recover the FY 1994 generic costs totalling $63.7 million that apply
to fuel facilities, uranium recovery facilities, spent fuel facilities, holders of transportation certificates
and QA program approvals, and other materials licensees, including holders of sealed source and device registrations.


Fee Category 2 is amended by establishing two new fee categories 2.A.(3) and 2.A.(4) relating to the disposal of Section
11e.(2) byproduct material as defined by the Atomic Energy Act. The current 4.D. category has been eliminated. This
action recognizes that (1) part of the budgeted costs for the uranium recovery class of licensees should be allocated
to source material licenses that authorize receipt and disposal of 11e.(2) material because some of these budgeted
resources are used to regulate these licensees and (2) a further distinction should be made between those licenses
whose primary purpose is to authorize disposal of 11e.(2) byproduct material requiring the establishment of a new
mill tailings pile for disposal of 11e.(2) material and those non-operating mills that accept 11e.(2) byproduct
material for disposal incidental to tailings piles created by mill operations. 

In addition, Fee Category 18 is amended to assess fees to the Department of Energy (DOE) for use of the general license
provided under 10 CFR 40.27. Currently, DOE is billed for the issuance of transportation Certificates of Compliance.
The general license fulfills a requirement of the Uranium Mill Tailings Radiation Control Act of 1978 (UMTRCA) (Public
Law 95-604) that the perpetual custodian of reclaimed uranium mill tailings piles be licensed by the NRC. The
 40.27 general license covers only post-reclamation closure custody and site surveillance. In September
1993, DOE became a general licensee of the NRC because post-reclamation closure of the Spook, Wyoming site had been
achieved. Because DOE now holds an NRC license, it is subject to annual fees. The NRC had previously indicated its intent
in the FY 1991 final fee rule to bill DOE for UMTRCA costs once post-closure was achieved and the sites were licensed
by the Government (56 FR 31481; July 10, 1991). As a result, DOE will be billed for the costs associated with NRC's UMTRCA
review of all activities associated with the facilities assigned to DOE under UMTRCA. As with other licensees, the
annual fee for this class of licensees (DOE UMTRCA facilities) will recover the generic and other regulatory costs
not recovered through 10 CFR Part 170 fees. Because DOE, as a Federal agency, cannot be assessed Part 170 fees under
the IOAA, the NRC will assess annual fees for the total costs of DOE UMTRCA activities to DOE. 

Tables VI and VII show the NRC program elements and resources that are attributable to fuel facilities and materials
users, respectively. The costs attributable to the uranium recovery class of licensees are those associated with
uranium recovery research, licensing and inspection. For transportation, the costs are those budgeted for transportation
research, licensing, and inspection. Similarly, the budgeted costs for spent fuel storage are those for spent fuel
storage research, licensing, and inspection.

 The allocation of the NRC's $16.8 million in budgeted costs to the individual fuel facilities is based, as in FYs 1991-1993,
primarily on the OBRA-90 conferees' guidance that licensees who require the greatest expenditure of NRC resources
should pay the greatest annual fee. Because the two high-enriched fuel manufacturing facilities possess strategic
quantities of nuclear materials, more NRC safeguards costs (e.g., physical security) are attributable to these
facilities. Likewise, more of the safety licensing and inspection costs are allocated to the HEU facilities because
more of these resources are used for HEU facilities as compared to other facilities. However, safety program assessment
and safety event evaluation costs for fuel facilities are uniformly allocated to HEU and LEU facilities because these
activities apply equally to each of the HEU and LEU facilities. 


Using this approach, the base annual fee for each facility is shown below. 




 


One of Combustion Engineering's (CE) low enriched fuel facilities has not been included in the fee base because of
the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals' decision of March 16, 1993, directing the NRC to grant an exemption for FY 1991 to
Combustion Engineering for one of its two facilities. As a result of the Court's decision, the NRC granted an exemption
to one of CE's low enriched uranium fuel facilities for FY 1994. The NRC has therefore excluded this facility from the
calculation of the FY 1994 annual fees for the low enriched fuel category. 


Of the $2.1 million attributable to the uranium recovery class of licensees, about $1.5 million will be assessed to
the Department of Energy (DOE) to recover the costs associated with DOE facilities under the Uranium Mill Tailings
Radiation Control Act of 1978 (UMTRCA). These costs were previously recovered from operating power reactors because
DOE was not an NRC licensee prior to September 1993 and therefore could not be billed under 10 CFR Part 171. In September
1993, DOE became a general licensee of the NRC because post-reclamation closure of the Spook, Wyoming site had been
achieved. Approximately 44 percent of the remaining costs of $639,000 for uranium recovery is attributable to uranium
mills (Class I facilities) and facilities that dispose of 11e.(2) byproduct materials, approximately 39 percent
is attributable to those solution mining licensees who do not generate uranium mill tailings (Class II facilities),
and the remaining 17 percent is allocated to the other uranium recovery facilities (e.g., extraction of metals and
rare earths). The resulting annual fees for each class of licensee are: 






 2.A.(2)_Class I facilities: $74,500 
 
2.A.(2)_Class II facilities: $41,200 
 
2.A.(2)_Other facilities: $36,200 
 
2.A.(3)_11e.(2) disposal: $67,000 
 
2.A.(4)_11e.(2) disposal 
 incidental to existing 
 tailings site: $8,700 






The annual fees for FY 1994 for the uranium recovery class of licensees are less than the FY 1992 fees and are higher than
the FY 1993 annual fees. The total amount of fees that must be recovered from uranium recovery commercial licensees
has decreased by about 10 percent compared to FY 1993; however, the annual fee per facility has increased for two basic
reasons. First, the amount that is expected to be recovered through part 170 fees has decreased as a result of completing
the licensing of the Envirocare 11e.(2) byproduct disposal facility. This requires relatively more costs to be recovered
through annual fees. The second cause of the increase is a decrease in the number of licensees in the class to be assessed
annual fees for FY 1994.

For spent fuel storage licenses, the generic costs of $2.2 million have been spread uniformly among those licensees
who hold specific or general licenses for receipt and storage of spent fuel at an ISFSI. This results in an annual fee
of $363,500. This represents a fee increase compared to FY 1993 in order to recover the increased budget necessary
to perform rulemakings and the regulatory oversight over the increased number of licensees. 


To equitably and fairly allocate the $38.6 million attributable to the approximately 6,500 diverse material users
and registrants, the NRC has continued to base the annual fee on the Part 170 application and inspection fees. Because
the application and inspection fees are indicative of the complexity of the license, this approach continues to provide
a proxy for allocating the costs to the diverse categories of licensees based on how much it costs NRC to regulate each
category. The fee calculation also continues to consider the inspection frequency, which is indicative of the safety
risk and resulting regulatory costs associated with the categories of licensees. In summary, the annual fee for these
categories of licenses is developed as follows: 


Annual Fee=(Application Fee+Inspection Fee/Inspection Priority)xConstant+(Unique Category Costs). 


The constant is the multiple necessary to recover $38.6 million and is 2.6 for FY 1994. The unique costs are any special
costs that the NRC has budgeted for a specific category of licensees. For FY 1994, unique costs of approximately $2.6
million were identified for the medical improvement program which is attributable to medical licensees. Materials
annual fees for FY 1994 are 13 to 17 percent higher compared to the FY 1993 annual fees. There are two basic reasons for
the changes in the fees from FY 1993. First, the FY 1994 budgeted amount attributable to materials licensees is about
10 percent higher than the comparable FY 1993 to reflect the cost necessary to regulate this class of licensees and
the direct allocation of certain budgeted costs as opposed to including them in the hourly rate. Second, the number
of licensees to be assessed annual fees in FY 1994 has decreased (from about 6,800 to about 6,500), resulting in a 4 percent
increase in fees. The materials fees must be established at these levels in order to comply with the mandate of OBRA-90
to recover approximately 100 percent of the NRC's FY 1994 budget authority. 


A materials licensee may pay a reduced annual fee if the licensee qualifies as a small entity under the NRC's size standards
and certifies that it is a small entity using NRC Form 526. 


 To recover the $4.0 million attributable to the transportation class of licensees, $923,000 will be assessed to the
Department of Energy (DOE) to cover all of its transportation casks under Category 18. The remaining transportation
costs for generic activities ($3.1 million) are allocated to holders of approved QA plans. The annual fee for approved
QA plans is $64,700 for users and fabricators and $900 for users only.

The amount or range of the FY 1994 base annual fees for all materials licensees is summarized as follows: 




Paragraph (e) is amended to establish the additional charge to be added to the base annual fees shown in paragraph (d)
of this final rule. The Commission is continuing the approach used in FY 1993 so as to assess the budgeted low-level
waste (LLW) costs to two broad categories of licensees (large LLW generators and small LLW generators) based on historical
disposal data. This surcharge continues to be shown, for convenience, with the applicable categories in paragraph
(d). Although these NRC LLW disposal regulatory activities are not directly attributable to regulation of NRC materials
licensees, the costs nevertheless must be recovered in order to comply with the requirements of OBRA-90. For
FY 1994, the additional charge recovers approximately 18 percent of the NRC budgeted costs of $8.1 million relating
to LLW disposal generic activities from small generators, which are comprised of materials licensees that dispose
of LLW. The percentage distribution reflects the deletion of LLW disposed by Agreement State licensees. The FY 1994
budgeted costs related to the additional charge for LLW and the amount of the charge are calculated as follows: 




Of the $8.1 million in budgeted costs shown above for LLW activities, 82 percent of the amount ($6.7 million) are allocated
to the 120 large waste generators (reactors and fuel facilities) included in 10 CFR Part 171. This results in an additional
charge of $55,600 per facility. Thus, the LLW charge will be $55,600 per HEU, LEU, UF

6

 facility, and each of the other 3 fuel facilities. The remaining $1.4 million is allocated to the material licensees
in categories that generate low level waste (965 licensees) as follows: $1,500 per materials license except for those
in Category 17. Those licensees that generate a significant amount of low level waste for purposes of the calculation
of the $1,500 surcharge are in fee Categories 1.B, 1.D, 2.C, 3.A, 3.B, 3.C, 3.L, 3.M, 3.N, 4.A, 4.B, 4.C, 5.B, 6.A, and
7.B. The surcharge for licenses in fee Category 17, which also generate and/or dispose of low level waste, is $22,800.

Of the $6.3 million not recovered from small entities, $1.0 million is allocated to fuel facilities and other materials
licensees. This results in a surcharge of $170 per category for each fuel facility and materials licensee that is not
eligible for the small entity fee. 
On the basis of this calculation, a fuel facility (a high enriched fuel fabrication licensee, for example) pays a base
annual fee of $3,176,000 and an additional charge of $55,770 for LLW activities and small entity costs. A medical center
with a broad-scope program pays a base annual fee of $30,900 and an additional charge of $1,670, for a total FY 1994 annual
fee of $32,570. 


Section 171.17 Proration


10 CFR 171.17 is amended to add a proration provision for materials licenses and to revise the provision for reactors.
The annual fee for materials licenses would be prorated based on applications filed after October 1 of the fiscal year
either to terminate a license or obtain a POL. Those materials licensees who file applications between October 1 and
March 31 of the fiscal year to terminate the license or obtain a POL will be assessed one-half the annual fee stated in
 171.16(d) for the affected fee category(ies). Those materials licensees who file applications on or after
April 1 of the fiscal year to terminate a license or obtain a POL will be assessed the full annual fee for that fiscal year.
Those licensees who file for termination or a POL must also permanently cease operations of those licensed activities
during the periods mentioned for the fee to be reduced. Similarly, materials licensees who were issued new licenses
during the fiscal year will be charged a prorated annual fee based on the date of issuance of the new license. New materials
licenses issued during the period October 1 through March 31 will be assessed one-half of the annual fee stated in  171.16(d)
for the applicable fee categories for that fiscal year. New licenses issued on or after April 1 of the fiscal year will
not be assessed the annual fee for that fiscal year. 
The proration provision in  171.17 applicable to reactors is amended to provide that for licensees who have
requested a license amendment to withdraw operating authority permanently during the FY the annual fee will be prorated
based on the number of days during the FY the operating license was in effect before the possession-only license was
issued or the license was terminated.

Footnote 1 of 10 CFR 171.16(d) is amended to provide for waiver of the annual fees for those materials licensees, and
holders of certificates, registrations, and approvals who either filed for termination of their licenses or approvals
or filed for possession only/storage only licenses before October 1, 1993, and permanently ceased licensed activities
entirely by September 30, 1993. All other licensees and approval holders who held a license or approval on October
1, 1993 are subject to the FY 1994 annual fees. 


Section 171.19 Payment


This section is revised to give credit for partial payments made by certain licensees in FY 1994 toward their FY 1994
annual fees. The NRC anticipates that the first, second, and third quarterly payments for FY 1994 will have been made
by operating power reactor licensees and some materials licensees before the final rule is effective. Therefore,
NRC will credit payments received for those three quarters toward the total annual fee to be assessed. The NRC will
adjust the fourth quarterly bill in order to recover the full amount of the revised annual fee or to make refunds, as
necessary. As in FY 1993, payment of the annual fee is due on the effective date of the rule and interest accrues from
the effective date of the rule. However, interest will be waived if payment is received within 30 days from the effective
date of the rule. 
During the past three years many licensees have indicated that although they held a valid NRC license authorizing
the possession and use of special nuclear, source, or byproduct material, they were in fact either not using the material
to conduct operations or had disposed of the material and no longer needed the license. In responding to licensees
about this matter, the NRC has stated that annual fees are assessed based on whether a licensee holds a valid NRC license
that authorizes possession and use of radioactive material. Whether or not a licensee is actually conducting operations
using the material is a matter of licensee discretion. The NRC cannot control whether a licensee elects to possess
and use radioactive material once it receives a license from the NRC. Therefore, the NRC reemphasizes that the annual
fee will be assessed based on whether a licensee holds a valid NRC license that authorizes possession and use of radioactive
material. To remove any uncertainty, the NRC issued minor clarifying amendments to 10 CFR 171.16, footnotes 1 and
7 on July 20, 1993 (58 FR 38700). 


V. Environmental Impact: Categorical Exclusion 


The NRC has determined that this final rule is the type of action described in categorical exclusion 10 CFR 51.22(c)(1).
Therefore, neither an environmental impact statement nor an environmental impact assessment has been prepared
for the final regulation. 


VI. Paperwork Reduction Act Statement

This final rule contains no information collection requirements and, therefore, is not subject to the requirements
of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.). 



VII. Regulatory Analysis 



With respect to 10 CFR Part 170, this final rule was developed pursuant to Title V of the Independent Offices Appropriation
Act of 1952 (IOAA) (31 U.S.C. 9701) and the Commission's fee guidelines. When developing these guidelines the Commission
took into account guidance provided by the U.S. Supreme Court on March 4, 1974, in its decision of 

National Cable Television Association, Inc. 

v. 

United States, 

415 U.S. 36 (1974) and 

Federal Power Commission 

v. 

New England Power Company, 

415 U.S. 345 (1974). In these decisions, the Court held that the IOAA authorizes an agency to charge fees for special
benefits rendered to identifiable persons measured by the ``value to the recipient'' of the agency service. The meaning
of the IOAA was further clarified on December 16, 1976, by four decisions of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District
of Columbia, 

National Cable Television Association 

v. 

Federal Communications Commission, 

554 F.2d 1094 (D.C. Cir. 1976); 

National Association of Broadcasters 

v. 

Federal Communications Commission, 

554 F.2d 1118 (D.C. Cir. 1976); 

Electronic Industries Association 

v. 

Federal Communications Commission, 

554 F.2d 1109 (D.C. Cir. 1976) and 

Capital Cities Communication, Inc. 

v. 

Federal Communications Commission, 

554 F.2d 1135 (D.C. Cir. 1976). These decisions of the Courts enabled the Commission to develop fee guidelines that
are still used for cost recovery and fee development purposes. 

The Commission's fee guidelines were upheld on August 24, 1979, by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in


Mississippi Power and Light Co. 

v. 

U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, 

601 F.2d 223 (5th Cir. 1979), 

cert. denied

, 444 U.S. 1102 (1980). The Court held that_ 

(1) The NRC had the authority to recover the full cost of providing services to identifiable beneficiaries; 

(2) The NRC could properly assess a fee for the costs of providing routine inspections necessary to ensure a licensee's
compliance with the Atomic Energy Act and with applicable regulations; 

(3) The NRC could charge for costs incurred in conducting environmental reviews required by NEPA; 

(4) The NRC properly included the costs of uncontested hearings and of administrative and technical support services
in the fee schedule; 

(5) The NRC could assess a fee for renewing a license to operate a low-level radioactive waste burial site; and 

(6) The NRC's fees were not arbitrary or capricious.

With respect to 10 CFR Part 171, on November 5, 1990, the Congress passed Public Law 101-508, the Omnibus Budget
Reconciliation Act of 1990 (OBRA-90) which required that for FYs 1991 through 1995, approximately 100 percent
of the NRC budget authority be recovered through the assessment of fees. OBRA-90 was amended in 1993 to extend
the 100 percent fee recovery requirement for NRC through 1998. To accomplish this statutory requirement, the NRC,
in accordance with  171.13, is publishing the final amount of the FY 1994 annual fees for operating reactor licensees,
fuel cycle licensees, materials licensees, and holders of Certificates of Compliance, registrations of sealed
source and devices and QA program approvals, and Government agencies. OBRA-90 and the Conference Committee
Report specifically state that_ 

(1) The annual fees be based on the Commission's FY 1994 budget of $535.0 million less the amounts collected from Part
170 fees and the funds directly appropriated from the NWF to cover the NRC's high level waste program; 

(2) The annual fees shall, to the maximum extent practicable, have a reasonable relationship to the cost of regulatory
services provided by the Commission; and 

(3) The annual fees be assessed to those licensees the Commission, in its discretion, determines can fairly, equitably,
and practicably contribute to their payment. 

Therefore, when developing the annual fees for operating power reactors, the NRC continued to consider the various
reactor vendors, the types of containment, and the location of the operating power reactors. The annual fees for fuel
cycle licensees, materials licensees, and holders of certificates, registrations and approvals and for licenses
issued to Government agencies take into account the type of facility or approval and the classes of the licensees.


10 CFR Part 171, which established annual fees for operating power reactors effective October 20, 1986 (51 FR 33224;
September 18, 1986), was challenged and upheld in its entirety in 

Florida Power and Light Company 

v. 

United States, 

846 F.2d 765 (D.C. Cir. 1988), 

cert. denied, 

490 U.S. 1045 (1989). 

10 CFR Parts 170 and 171, which established fees based on the FY 1989 budget, were also legally challenged. As a result
of the Supreme Court decision in 

Skinner 

v. 

Mid-American Pipeline Co., 

109 S. Ct. 1726 (1989), and the denial of certiorari in 

Florida Power and Light, 

all of the lawsuits were withdrawn. 

The NRC's FY 1991 annual fee rule was largely upheld by the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals in 

Allied-Signal 

v. 

NRC, 

988 F.2d 146 (D.C. Cir. 1993). 



VIII. Regulatory Flexibility Analysis 



The NRC is required by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 to recover approximately 100 percent of its budget
authority through the assessment of user fees. OBRA-90 further requires that the NRC establish a schedule of
charges that fairly and equitably allocates the aggregate amount of these charges among licensees. 

This final rule establishes the schedules of fees that are necessary to implement the Congressional mandate for FY
1994. The final rule results in an increase in the fees charged to most licensees, and holders of certificates, registrations,
and approvals, including those licensees who are classified as small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility
Act. The Regulatory Flexibility Analysis, prepared in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 604, is included as Appendix A to this
final rule. 



IX. Backfit Analysis 



The NRC has determined that the backfit rule, 10 CFR 50.109, does not apply to this final rule and that a backfit analysis
is not required for this final rule. The backfit analysis is not required because these final amendments do not require
the modification of or additions to systems, structures, components, or design of a facility or the design approval
or manufacturing license for a facility or the procedures or organization required to design, construct or operate
a facility.

 Proration. 



Annual fees will be prorated for NRC licensees as follows: 

(a) Reactors. The annual fee for reactors (power or nonpower) that are subject to fees under this part and are granted
a license to operate on or after October 1 of a FY is prorated on the basis of the number of days remaining in the FY. Thereafter,
the full fee is due and payable each subsequent FY. Licensees who have requested amendment to withdraw operating authority
permanently during the FY will be prorated based on the number of days during the FY the license was in effect before
the possession only license was issued or the license was terminated. 

(b) Materials licenses (including fuel cycle licenses). The annual fee for a materials license that is subject to
fees under this part and issued on or after October 1 of the FY is prorated on the basis of when the NRC issues the new license.
New licenses issued during the period October 1 through March 31 of the FY will be assessed one-half the annual fee for
that FY. New licenses issued on or after April 1 of the FY will not be assessed an annual fee for that FY. Thereafter, the
full fee is due and payable each subsequent FY. The annual fee will be prorated for licenses for which a termination
request or a request for a POL has been received on or after October 1 of a FY on the basis of when the application for termination
or POL is received by the NRC provided the licensee permanently ceased licensed activities during the specified period.
Licenses for which applications for termination or POL are filed during the period October 1 through March 31 of the
FY are assessed one-half the annual fee for the applicable category(ies) for that FY. Licenses for which applications
for termination or POL are filed on or after April 1 of the FY are assessed the full annual fee for that FY. 

12. In section 171.19, paragraphs (b) and (c) are revised to read as follows: 



 171.19

 Payment. 



* * * * *



(b) For FY 1994 through FY 1998, the Commission will adjust the fourth quarterly bill for operating power reactors
and certain materials licensees to recover the full amount of the revised annual fee. If the amounts collected in the
first three quarters exceed the amount of the revised annual fee, the overpayment will be refunded. All other licensees,
or holders of a certificate, registration, or approval of a QA program will be sent a bill for the full amount of the annual
fee upon publication of the final rule. Payment is due on the effective date of the final rule and interest accrues from
the effective date of the final rule. However, interest will be waived if payment is received within 30 days from the
effective date of the final rule. 

(c) For FYs 1994 through 1998, annual fees in the amount of $100,000 or more and described in the 

Federal Register

 notice pursuant to  171.13, must be paid in quarterly installments of 25 percent as billed by the NRC. The quarters
begin on October 1, January 1, April 1, and July 1 of each fiscal year. Annual fees of less than $100,000 must be paid once
a year as billed by the NRC.

Appendix A to This Final Rule_Regulatory Flexibility Analysis for the Amendments to 10 CFR Part 170 (License Fees)
and 10 CFR Part 171 (Annual Fees) 

I. Background. 



The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.) establishes as a principle of regulatory practice that
agencies endeavor to fit regulatory and informational requirements, consistent with applicable statutes, to a
scale commensurate with the businesses, organizations, and government jurisdictions to which they apply. To achieve
this principle, the Act requires that agencies consider the impact of their actions on small entities. If the agency
cannot certify that a rule will not significantly impact a substantial number of small entities, then a regulatory
flexibility analysis is required to examine the impacts on small entities and the alternatives to minimize these
impacts. 

To assist in considering these impacts under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, the NRC adopted size standards for determining
which NRC licensees qualify as small entities (50 FR 50241; December 9, 1985). These size standards were clarified
November 6, 1991 (56 FR 56672). The NRC size standards are as follows: 

(1) A small business is a business with annual receipts of $3.5 million or less except private practice physicians
for which the standard is annual receipts of $1 million or less. 

(2) A small organization is a not-for-profit organization which is independently owned and operated and has annual
receipts of $3.5 million or less. 

(3) Small governmental jurisdictions are governments of cities, counties, towns, townships, villages, school
districts, or special districts with a population of less than 50,000. 

(4) A small educational institution is one that is (i) supported by a qualifying small governmental jurisdiction,
or (ii) one that is not state or publicly supported and has 500 employees or less. 

Public Law 101-508, the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 (OBRA-90), requires that the NRC recover
approximately 100 percent of its budget authority, less appropriations from the Nuclear Waste Fund, for Fiscal Years
(FY) 1991 through 1995 by assessing license and annual fees. OBRA-90 was amended in 1993 to extend the 100 percent
recovery requirement for NRC through 1998. For FY 1991, the amount collected was approximately $445 million; for
FY 1992, approximately $492.5 million; for FY 1993 about $518.9 million and the amount to be collected in FY 1994 is
approximately $513 million. 

To comply with OBRA-90, the Commission amended its fee regulations in 10 CFR Parts 170 and 171 in FY 1991 (56 FR
31472; July 10, 1991) in FY 1992, (57 FR 32691; July 23, 1992) and in FY 1993 (58 FR 38666; July 20, 1993) based on a careful
evaluation of over 1,000 comments. These final rules established the methodology used by NRC in identifying and determining
the fees assessed and collected in FY 1991, FY 1992, and FY 1993. The NRC has used the same methodology established in
the FY 1991, FY 1992, and FY 1993 rulemakings to establish the fees to be assessed for FY 1994 with the following exceptions:
(1) the Commission has reinstated the annual fee exemption for nonprofit educational institutions; and (2) in this
final rule, the NRC has directly assigned additional effort to the reactor and materials programs for the Office of
Investigations, the Office of Enforcement, the Advisory Committee on Reactor Safeguards, and the Advisory Committee
on Nuclear Waste. The methodology for assessing low-level waste (LLW) costs was changed in FY 1993 based on the U.S.
Court of Appeals decision dated March 16, 1993 (988 F.2d 146, (D.C. Cir. 1993)). The FY 1993 LLW allocation method has
been continued in the FY 1994 final rule. 



II. Impact on small entities. 



The comments received on the proposed FY 1991, FY 1992, FY 1993 and FY 1994 fee rule revisions and the small entity certifications
received in response to the final FY 1991, FY 1992, and FY 1993 fee rules indicate that NRC licensees qualifying as small
entities under the NRC's size standards are primarily those licensed under the NRC's materials program. Therefore,
this analysis will focus on the economic impact of the annual fees on materials licensees. 

The Commission's fee regulations result in substantial fees being charged to those individuals, organizations,
and companies that are licensed under the NRC materials program. Of these materials licensees, the NRC estimates
that about 18 percent (approximately 1,300 licensees) qualify as small entities. This estimate is based on the number
of small entity certifications filed in response to the FY 1991, FY 1992, and FY 1993 fee rules. In FY 1993, the NRC conducted
a survey of its materials licensees. The results of this survey indicated that about 25 percent of these licensees
could qualify as small entities under the current NRC size standards.

The commenters on the FY 1991, FY 1992, FY 1993, and FY 1994 proposed fee rules indicated the following results if the
proposed annual fees were not modified:




_Large firms would gain an unfair competitive advantage over small entities. One commenter noted that a small well-logging
company (a ``Mom and Pop'' type of operation) would find it difficult to absorb the annual fee, while a large corporation
would find it easier. Another commenter noted that the fee increase could be more easily absorbed by a high-volume
nuclear medicine clinic. A gauge licensee noted that, in the very competitive soils testing market, the annual fees
would put it at an extreme disadvantage with its much larger competitors because the proposed fees would be the same
for a two-person licensee as for a large firm with thousands of employees. 

_Some firms would be forced to cancel their licenses. One commenter, with receipts of less than $500,000 per year,
stated that the proposed rule would, in effect, force it to relinquish its soil density gauge and license, thereby
reducing its ability to do its work effectively. Another commenter noted that the rule would force the company and
many other small businesses to get rid of the materials license altogether. Commenters stated that the proposed rule
would result in about 10 percent of the well-logging licensees terminating their licenses immediately and approximately
25 percent terminating their licenses before the next annual assessment. 

_Some companies would go out of business. One commenter noted that the proposal would put it, and several other small
companies, out of business or, at the very least, make it hard to survive. 

_Some companies would have budget problems. Many medical licensees commented that, in these times of slashed reimbursements,
the proposed increase of the existing fees and the introduction of additional fees would significantly affect their
budgets. Another noted that, in view of the cuts by Medicare and other third party carriers, the fees would produce
a hardship and some facilities would experience a great deal of difficulty in meeting this additional burden.




Over the past three years, approximately 2,600 license, approval, and registration terminations have been requested.
Although some of these terminations were requested because the license was no longer needed or licenses or registrations
could be combined, indications are that other termination requests were due to the economic impact of the fees. 

The NRC continues to receive written and oral comments from small materials licensees. These comments indicate that
the $3.5 million threshold for small entities is not representative of small businesses with gross receipts in the
thousands of dollars. These commenters believe that the $1,800 maximum annual fee represents a relatively high percentage
of gross annual receipts for these ``Mom and Pop'' type businesses. Therefore, even the reduced annual fee could have
a significant impact on the ability of these types of businesses to continue to operate. 

To alleviate the continuing significant impact of the annual fees on a substantial number of small entities, the NRC
considered alternatives, in accordance with the RFA. These alternatives were evaluated in the FY 1991 rule (56 FR
31472; July 10, 1991), in the FY 1992 rule (57 FR 32691; July 23, 1992), and in the FY 1993 rule (58 FR 38666; July 20, 1993).
The alternatives considered by the NRC can be summarized as follows.




_Base fees on some measure of the amount of radioactivity possessed by the licensee (e.g., number of sources). 

_Base fees on the frequency of use of the licensed radioactive material (e.g., volume of patients). 

_Base fees on the NRC size standards for small entities.




The NRC has reexamined the FY 1991, FY 1992, and FY 1993 evaluation of these alternatives. Based on that reexamination,
the NRC continues to support the previous conclusion. That is, the NRC continues to believe that establishment of
a maximum fee for small entities is the most appropriate option to reduce the impact on small entities. 

The NRC established, and is continuing for FY 1994, a maximum annual fee for small entities. The RFA and its implementing
guidance do not provide specific guidelines on what constitutes a significant economic impact on a small entity.
Therefore, the NRC has no benchmark to assist it in determining the amount or the percent of gross receipts that should
be charged to a small entity. For FY 1994, the NRC will rely on the analysis previously completed that established a
maximum annual fee for a small entity by comparing NRC license and inspection fees under 10 CFR Part 170 with Agreement
State fees for those fee categories that are expected to contain a substantial number of small entities. Because these
fees have been charged to small entities, the NRC continues to believe that these fees, or any adjustments to these
fees during the past year, do not have a significant impact on them. In issuing this final rule for FY 1994, the NRC concludes
that the materials license and inspection fees do not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities
and that the maximum annual small entity fee of $1,800 be maintained to alleviate the impact of the fees on small entities.

By maintaining the maximum annual fee for small entities at $1,800, the annual fee for many small entities will be reduced
while at the same time materials licensees, including small entities, pay for most of the FY 1994 costs ($33.3 million
of the total $38.6 million) attributable to them. Therefore, the NRC is continuing, for FY 1994, the maximum annual
fee (base annual fee plus surcharge) for certain small entities at $1,800 for each fee category covered by each license
issued to a small entity. Note that the costs not recovered from small entities are allocated to other materials licensees
and to operating power reactors. 
While reducing the impact on many small entities, the Commission agrees that the current maximum annual fee of $1,800
for small entities, when added to the Part 170 license and inspection fees, may continue to have a significant impact
on materials licensees with annual gross receipts in the thousands of dollars. Therefore, as in FY 1992 and FY 1993,
the NRC will continue the lower-tier small entity annual fee of $400 for small entities with relatively low gross annual
receipts for FY 1994. This lower-tier small entity fee was established in the final rule published in the 

Federal Register

 on April 17, 1992 (57 FR 13625). 
In establishing the annual fee for lower tier small entities, the NRC continues to retain a balance between the objectives
of the RFA and OBRA-90. This balance can be measured by (1) the amount of costs attributable to small entities
that is transferred to larger entities (the small entity subsidy); (2) the total annual fee small entities pay, relative
to this subsidy; and (3) how much the annual fee is for a lower tier small entity. Nuclear gauge users were used to measure
the reduction in fees because they represent about 40 percent of the materials licensees and most likely would include
a larger percentage of lower tier small entities than would other classes of materials licensees. The Commission
is continuing an annual fee of $400 for the lower tier small entities to ensure that the lower tier small entities receive
a reduction (75 percent for small gauge users) substantial enough to mitigate any severe impact. Although other reduced
fees would result in lower subsidies, the Commission believes that the amount of the associated annual fees, when
added to the license and inspection fees, would still be considerable for small businesses and organizations with
gross receipts of less than $250,000 or for governmental entities in jurisdictions with a population of less than
20,000. 


III. Summary 


The NRC has determined the annual fee significantly impacts a substantial number of small entities. A maximum fee
for small entities strikes a balance between the requirement to collect 100 percent of the NRC budget and the requirement
to consider means of reducing the impact of the proposed fee on small entities. On the basis of its regulatory flexibility
analyses, the NRC concludes that a maximum annual fee of $1,800 for small entities and a lower tier small entity annual
fee of $400 for small businesses and non-profit organizations with gross annual receipts of less than $250,000, and
small governmental entities with a population of less than 20,000, will reduce the impact on small entities. At the
same time, these reduced annual fees are consistent with the objectives of OBRA-90. Thus, the revised fees for
small entities maintain a balance between the objectives of OBRA-90 and the RFA. The NRC has used the methodology
and procedures developed for the FY 1991, the FY 1992, and the FY 1993 fee rules in this final rule establishing the FY
1994 fees. Therefore, the analysis and conclusions established in the FY 1991, the FY 1992, and the FY 1993 rules remain
valid for this final rule for FY 1994.

Airworthiness Directives; General Electric Aircraft Engines CT7 Series Turboprop Engines

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule, request for comments. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to General Electric Aircraft Engines
(GE) CT7 series turboprop engines. This action requires a one-time ultrasonic inspection of a suspect population
of propeller shafts for metallurgical defects, and if necessary, replacement with a serviceable part. This amendment
is prompted by a report of an inflight propeller separation due to a metallurgical defect. The actions specified in
this AD are intended to prevent failure of the propeller shaft, which can result in separation of the propeller from
the propeller shaft and possible damage to the aircraft.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has determined that certain propeller shafts on General Electric Aircraft
Engines (GE) CT7 series turboprop engines may have a metallurgical defect that could cause separation of the propeller
from the propeller shaft. The FAA's investigation has revealed this population of propeller shafts may contain a
metallurgical defect known as a pipe inclusion, which developed during manufacture of the shaft. This defect typically
forms during the process of melting the ingot used to form the shaft and positions itself at either end of the ingot.
During this phase of the manufacturing process cropping both ends of the ingot normally ensures complete removal
of such defects. The FAA has determined, however, that for five heat lots of material, pipe inclusions may not have
been completely removed from the material used to form the propeller shaft. The FAA has determined that suspect material
was used to manufacture approximately 326 propeller shafts. 


The FAA received a report of a propeller separating from a SAAB-SCANIA SF340 series aircraft inflight following
severe vibration. The FAA's investigation revealed that the propeller shaft separated due to a pipe inclusion defect
positioned in a high stress location of the propeller shaft. That defect initiated a crack which propagated to failure.
This condition, if not corrected, could result in failure of the propeller shaft, which can result in separation of
the propeller from the propeller shaft and possible damage to the aircraft. 
The FAA has reviewed and approved the technical contents of GE (CT7-TP Series) Service Bulletin (SB) No. A72-350,
Revision 3, dated June 9, 1994, that describes procedures for a one-time ultrasonic inspection of the propeller shaft
flange outer diameter (OD) fillet radius and inner diameter (ID) bore for detection of subsurface defects. In addition,
Table 3 of this SB lists by propeller gearbox serial number (S/N) a certain population of suspect propeller shafts
to be identified by internal markings during a one-time borescope inspection. Those propeller shafts with markings
identified as suspect in accordance with this SB must be ultrasonically inspected prior to further flight.

Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other GE CT7 series turboprop engines
of the same type design, this airworthiness directive (AD) is being issued to prevent separation of the propeller
from the propeller shaft, which could result in damage to the aircraft. This AD requires a one-time ultrasonic inspection
of the propeller shaft flange OD fillet radius and ID bore on a suspect population of propeller shafts for subsurface
metallurgical defects, and if necessary, replacement with a serviceable part. This inspection must be performed
at the next shop visit after the effective date of this AD, or prior to October 31, 1994, whichever occurs first. The
FAA has determined that the compliance end-date of October 31, 1994, will be necessary to ensure timely inspection
of all propeller shafts and thus minimize the potential for additional propeller shaft failures. The actions are
required to be accomplished in accordance with the service bulletin described previously. 
Since a situation exists that requires the immediate adoption of this regulation, it is found that notice and opportunity
for prior public comment hereon are impracticable, and that good cause exists for making this amendment effective
in less than 30 days. 


Comments Invited 


Although this action is in the form of a final rule that involves requirements affecting flight safety and, thus, was
not preceded by notice and an opportunity for public comment, comments are invited on this rule. Interested persons
are invited to comment on this rule by submitting such written data, views, or arguments as they may desire. Communications
should identify the Rules Docket number and be submitted in triplicate to the address specified under the caption
``

ADDRESSES

.'' All communications received on or before the closing date for comments will be considered, and this rule may be
amended in light of the comments received. Factual information that supports the commenter's ideas and suggestions
is extremely helpful in evaluating the effectiveness of the AD action and determining whether additional rulemaking
action would be needed. 
Comments are specifically invited on the overall regulatory, economic, environmental, and energy aspects of the
rule that might suggest a need to modify the rule. All comments submitted will be available, both before and after the
closing date for comments, in the Rules Docket for examination by interested persons. A report that summarizes each
FAA-public contact concerned with the substance of this AD will be filed in the Rules Docket. 
Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments submitted in response to this notice must submit
a self-addressed, stamped postcard on which the following statement is made: ``Comments to Docket Number 94-ANE-07.''
The postcard will be date stamped and returned to the commenter. 
The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.

The FAA has determined that this regulation is an emergency regulation that must be issued immediately to correct
an unsafe condition in aircraft, and is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866. It has
been determined further that this action involves an emergency regulation under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures
(44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979). If it is determined that this emergency regulation otherwise would be significant
under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures, a final regulatory evaluation will be prepared and placed in the Rules

Airworthiness Directives; McDonnell Douglas Model MD-11 Series Airplanes 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This amendment supersedes an existing airworthiness directive (AD), 
applicable to certain McDonnell Douglas Model MD-11 series airplanes, that currently 
requires inspections to verify the installation of shear pins, shear pin retainers, and shear 
pin retainer attaching parts in the aft end of the center pylon thrust link, and repair, if 
necessary. That AD was prompted by a report that both shear pins that attach the aft end 
of the center engine pylon thrust link to the tail pylon were missing. This amendment adds 
inspections to verify that the shear pin retainer attaching parts are tightened within 
specified limits; and adds a terminating modification for those inspections. This 
amendment also expands the applicability of the rule to include additional airplanes. The 
actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent structural damage to the engine 
mount structure, which could lead to loss of airplane components. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal 
Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) by superseding AD 92-23-03, amendment 39-8403 
(57 FR 47991, October 21, 1992), which is applicable to certain McDonnell Douglas 
Model MD-11 series airplanes, was published in the 

Federal Register

 on March 17, 1994 
(59 FR 12558). The action proposed to continue to require repetitive visual inspections to 
verify the installation of the shear pins, the shear pin retainers, and the shear pin retainer 
attaching parts in the aft end of the center engine (No. 2) pylon thrust link. It also 
proposed (1) to add repetitive inspections to verify that the shear pin retainer attaching 
parts are tightened within specified limits; (2) to delete the previously provided ``optional 
terminating action'' (which consists of a one-time verification for tightness of the nuts of 
the four shear pin retainer attaching bolts); and (3) to require eventual replacement of the 
existing retainer and attaching parts with a new retainer and attaching parts, as terminating 
action for the currently required repetitive visual inspections and the proposed repetitive 
verifications of tightness. 






Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making 
of this amendment. Due consideration has been given to the comments received. 




One commenter supports the proposal. 




The Air Transport Association (ATA) of America, on behalf of one member 
operator, and the manufacturer request that the proposed AD be revised to indicate that 
the 60-day repetitive inspection specified in paragraph (a) and (b) be required only until 
either the initial verification for tightness (of the shear pin retainer attaching parts), the 
terminating action, or an FAA-approved repair is accomplished. These commenters state 
that the FAA already has approved repairs applicable to paragraphs (a) and (b) of the 
proposal, which have consisted of the installation of new parts. New parts obviously will 
be tightened upon installation; therefore, reinspection of the tightness of these parts within 
60 days appears to be unwarranted. The commenters request that the repetitive interval 
for the inspection for installation of parts be revised to 18 months in order to be consistent 
with the recommendations of Phase 2 of the original issue of McDonnell Douglas Alert 
Service Bulletin A54-71. 




The FAA concurs in part with the commenter's request. Upon further 
consideration of the procedures specified in the referenced service bulletin, the FAA 
concurs that a 60-day repetitive inspection interval is not necessary in certain situations, 
explained as follows: 




Paragraphs (a)(1) and (b)(1)(i) of the final rule apply to situations where the shear 
pins, shear pin retainers, and shear pin retainer attaching parts have been inspected and 
found to be installed. The FAA finds that inspections to verify the installation of these 
parts must be repeated every 60 days, so long as there is no other action accomplished 
that will ensure the tightness of the attaching parts. These inspections for installation may 
be terminated, however, when the initial verification for tightness of the shear pin retainer 
attaching parts is accomplished in 18 months in accordance with paragraph (c) of the rule; 
or when the terminating modification described in paragraph (d) is installed, if earlier than 
18 months.

The FAA has revised paragraphs (a)(2) and (b)(1)(ii) of the final rule, which apply 
to situations where any shear pin is missing or has migrated, and any shear pin retainer or 
shear pin retainer attaching part is missing. In such cases, an FAA-approved repair is 
required to be installed; the FAA has determined that these approved repairs will be such 
that no further inspections for installation of parts will be necessary once the approved 
repair is installed. The FAA has revised these paragraphs of the final rule to reflect this 
determination. 



Additionally, the FAA has added new paragraphs (a)(3) and (b)(1)(iii), which 
specify that, in situations where the shear pin retainers or shear pin retainer attaching parts 
are missing or loose, and the shear pin has not migrated, operators may accomplish a 
repair in accordance with procedures specified as ``Condition II'' in McDonnell Douglas Alert 
Service Bulletin A54-31, Revision 1, dated June 3, 1993. Subsequent to this repair, no 
further inspections for installation of parts are required. These paragraphs have been 
added in order to provide operators with an additional repair procedure that may be used 
in lieu of obtaining prior FAA-approval of repairs (which was the only option provided for 
in the proposal). 



These same commenters contend that the 15-day compliance time for the initial 
inspection required by proposed paragraph (b) is not warranted for certain airplanes. The 
commenters point out that a tightness check was accomplished on airplanes in Groups V 
and VI (as specified in the referenced McDonnell Douglas service bulletin) prior to 
delivery; therefore, an initial inspection for installation of the subject parts should not be 
required for these airplanes. The commenters request that, for these airplanes, only a 
``re-verification'' for tightness be required within 18 months. Additionally, the commenters 
point out that an initial visual inspection for installation of parts was accomplished on 
airplanes in Group III and IV prior to delivery; therefore, the compliance time for initial 
inspection for installation of parts required by this proposed rule should be extended. The 
commenters suggest extending the initial compliance time to 60 days, since this is the 
compliance time recommended by the manufacturer in the referenced service bulletin. 



The FAA concurs in part with the commenter's requests. The FAA acknowledges 
that it is appropriate to revise paragraph (b) of the final rule to differentiate between the 
requirements of the various groups of airplanes specified in the referenced service bulletin: 



As for airplanes in Groups III and IV, the FAA does not concur with the 
commenter's request to extend the initial compliance time for the inspection for installation 
of parts on these airplanes. While these airplanes may have been inspected prior to 
delivery, and while the manufacturer's revised service bulletin recommends a repetitive 
inspection interval of 60 days, the FAA points out that the inspection procedures 
described in that service bulletin have not been mandated previously. Since the revised 
service bulletin was released over a year ago, there is no way to guarantee that affected 
airplanes have been repetitively inspected prior to the issuance of this final rule. In light of 
this, the FAA considers a compliance time of 15 days necessary in order to ensure that the 
accomplishment of what may be the first repetitive inspection for some airplanes is carried 
out in a timely manner. However, the FAA has revised the compliance terms of paragraph 
(b)(1) to provide a ``grace period'' for operators of airplanes that may have been visually 
(re-)inspected recently. The final rule now reflects a compliance time for the initial visual 
inspection as ``within 15 days after the effective date of the AD, or prior to the 
accumulation of 60 days since the last visual inspection, whichever occurs later.'' 



As for airplanes in Groups V and VI, the FAA concurs that these airplanes need 
not be subject to the initial inspection for installation of parts as required by paragraph (b), 
as long as repetitive verifications for tightness are conducted. Therefore, the FAA has 
revised paragraph (b) by adding a new paragraph (b)(2), which addresses these airplanes 
and allows them the option of either repetitively inspecting for installation of parts (as 
originally proposed), or conducting a verification for tightness within 18 months after the 
last verification was performed. If operators of these airplanes elect to perform the 
verification for tightness, it must be repeated every 18 months until the terminating 
modification is accomplished in accordance with paragraph (d) of the rule. 



These same commenters request that proposed paragraph (c) be revised to indicate 
that accomplishment of the verification for tightness of the shear pin retainer attaching 
parts terminates the requirement for the repetitive visual inspections for installation of 
these same parts required by paragraph (a) and (b). The FAA concurs and has revised 
paragraph (c) of the final rule accordingly. 



These commenters also request that proposed paragraph (d) be revised to extend 
the compliance time for accomplishment of the terminating modification from the 
proposed 3 years to 5 years. The commenters consider this modification to be only an 
``improvement change,'' and operators should be allowed to install it during a convenient 
and regularly scheduled maintenance period in order to avoid special scheduling of 
airplanes and additional associated costs. The FAA does not concur. In developing the 
compliance time for the terminating action, the FAA considered not only the safety 
implications, but the manufacturer's recommendations, the availability of required 
modification parts, and the practical aspects of an orderly modification of the fleet. In 
consideration of all of these items, the FAA determined that 3 years is an appropriate 
interval that will coincide with regularly scheduled maintenance periods (``C'' checks) for 
the majority of the affected operators. However, under the provisions of paragraph (f) of 
the final rule, the FAA may approve requests for adjustments to the compliance time if 
data are submitted to substantiate that such an adjustment would provide an acceptable 
level of safety.

After careful review of the available data, including the comments noted above, the 
FAA has determined that air safety and the public interest require the adoption of the rule 
with the changes previously described. The FAA has determined that these changes will 
neither increase the economic burden on any operator nor increase the scope of the AD. 



There are approximately 94 Model MD-11 series airplanes of the affected design in 
the worldwide fleet. The FAA estimates that 42 airplanes of U.S. registry will be affected 
by this AD. 



Accomplishment of the required inspections for installation of parts will take 
approximately 4 work hours per airplane, at an average labor rate of $55 per work hour. 
Based on these figures, the total cost impact of these requirements of this AD on U.S. 
operators is estimated to be $9,240, or $220 per airplane, per inspection. 



Accomplishment of the required verification for tightness of the shear pin retainer 
attaching parts will take approximately 6 work hours per airplane, at an average labor rate 
of $55 per work hour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of these requirements 
of this AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $13,860, or $330 per airplane, per 
verification. 



Accomplishment of the required terminating modification will take approximately 
6 work hours per airplane, at an average labor rate of $55 per work hour. Required parts 
will be provided by the manufacturer at no cost to operators. Based on these figures, the 
total cost impact of these requirements of this AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be 
$13,860, or $330 per airplane. 



The total cost impact figures discussed above are based on assumptions that no 
operator has yet accomplished any of the requirements of this AD action, and that no 
operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not adopted. 



The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the 
States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the 
distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. 
Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule 
does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism 
Assessment. 



For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant 
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT 
Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) will not 
have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small 
entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been 
prepared for this action and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be 
obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption

Secondary Direct Food Additives Permitted in Food for Human Consumption; Cellulose Triacetate


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Food and Drug Administration, HHS.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is amending its food additive regulations to provide for the safe use of cellulose
triacetate as an immobilizing agent for lactase for use in reducing the lactose content of milk. This action is in response
to a petition filed by Vitenco, Inc.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

In a notice published in the 

Federal Register

 of March 17, 1978 (43 FR 11266), FDA announced that a generally recognized as safe (GRAS) affirmation petition (GRASP
7G0088) had been filed by Vitenco, Inc., 594 Marett Rd., Lexington, MA 02173, requesting that lactase from 

Kluyveromyces

 (

Saccharomyces

) 

lactis

 entrapped in cellulose triacetate fibers be affirmed as GRAS for use in reducing the lactose content of milk. Subsequent
to the filing of this petition, FDA affirmed, in response to a separate petition (GRASP 6G0077), that lactase enzyme
from 

K

. 

lactis

 is GRAS for this use (21 CFR 184.1388) (49 FR 47384 at 47387, December 4, 1984). Therefore, this document deals only
with the use of cellulose triacetate as an immobilizing agent and with any potential contaminants that might be introduced
into food from this use. 


Although the information submitted in GRASP 7G0088 allows the agency to conclude that the use of cellulose triacetate
as an immobilizing agent is safe, the petition did not establish that the critical data are generally available as
required by 21 CFR 170.30(b). Consequently, the agency has evaluated those portions of the petition that relate to
cellulose triacetate as a food additive (rather than as a GRAS affirmation) petition and is issuing this decision
in accordance with 21 CFR 170.38(c)(1).


I. Determination of Safety


Under section 409(c)(3)(A) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) (21 U.S.C. 348(c)(3)(A)), the so-called
``general safety clause,'' a food additive cannot be listed for a particular use unless a fair evaluation of the evidence
establishes that the additive is safe for that use. FDA's food additive regulations (21 CFR 170.3(i)) define safe
as ``a reasonable certainty in the minds of competent scientists that the substance is not harmful under the intended
conditions of use.''
The Delaney anticancer provision of the general safety clause of the act (section 409(c)(3)(A)) further provides
that no food additive shall be deemed safe if it is found to induce cancer when ingested by man or animal. Importantly,
however, the Delaney clause applies to the additive itself and not to constituents of the additive. That is, where
an additive itself has not been shown to cause cancer, but contains a carcinogenic impurity, the additive is properly
evaluated under the general safety clause using risk assessment procedures to determine whether there is a reasonable
certainty that no harm will result from the proposed use of the additive (see 

Scott

 v. 

FDA

, 728 F.2d 322 (6th Cir. 1984)).


II. Evaluation of Safety of the Petitioned Use of the Additive


The requested use of cellulose triacetate is as an immobilizing agent for the enzyme lactase in the production of reduced
lactose milk. Cellulose triacetate containing physically entrapped lactase enzyme is added to milk that is to be
treated; enzymatic digestion of lactose is allowed to occur; and the immobilizing agent and entrapped enzyme are
then quantitatively removed from the treated milk. Data submitted by the petitioner demonstrate that when cellulose
triacetate is used as an immobilizing agent, it does not affect the milk in which it is used in any way. The data in the
petition also demonstrate that no detectable cellulose triacetate is present in the final product intended for human
consumption. Based on these factors, FDA concludes that the ingredient itself is safe under these conditions of use.
FDA, in its evaluation of the safety of this additive, has reviewed not only the safety of the additive itself but also
the safety of the chemical impurities that may be present in the additive from the manufacturing process. Residual
amounts of reactants and manufacturing aids are commonly found as contaminants in chemical products, including
food additives.
Methylene chloride is used as a solvent in the initial stages of manufacture of cellulose triacetate-immobilized
lactase. Subsequent to the use of methylene chloride, the resultant fibers are completely dried to eliminate any
remaining volatile contaminants (such as residual methylene chloride). Furthermore, before it is used in food,
the product is washed several times to ensure removal of any such residual contaminants. Data submitted by the petitioner
demonstrate that methylene chloride could not be detected in the final product immediately prior to its use in food
at a detection limit of 0.5 parts per million (ppm).
Nevertheless, the agency has used risk assessment procedures to estimate the upper-bound risk presented by methylene
chloride, a carcinogenic chemical, that may be present as an impurity in the additive. This risk evaluation has two
aspects: (1) Assessment of the hypothetical worst-case exposure to the impurity from the proposed use of the additive;
and (2) extrapolation of the risk observed in the animal bioassays to the conditions of hypothetical worst-case human
exposure.

FDA has estimated the hypothetical worst-case exposure to methylene chloride from the proposed use to be 6.0 nanograms
per person per day (ng/p/day) (Ref. 1). This estimate is based on the assumption that methylene chloride is present
in the additive at its detection limit, although it was not actually detected in any of the samples tested.

Using risk assessment procedures, FDA used data from the National Toxicology Program report (Ref. 2) of a bioassay
on methylene chloride to calculate the potency, or unit risk, from exposure to this chemical (Ref. 3). The results
of the bioassay on methylene chloride demonstrated that the material was carcinogenic for mice under the conditions
of the study. The test material induced benign and malignant neoplasms in both the liver and lung of both sexes when
administered by the inhalation route. 
The agency also evaluated data from a second study in mice of the same strain as used in the inhalation study. In this
study, methylene chloride was administered in the drinking water of the mice (Ref. 4). In this second study, there
was no significant increase in the incidence of neoplasms at any site examined. However, assuming that methylene
chloride would induce neoplasia at a dose just above the highest level tested in the drinking water study, a maximum
potency can be estimated. This estimate is approximately the same as the potency calculated from the data of the inhalation
study, providing confidence that using the inhalation study for upper bound risk assessment is not likely to underestimate
any potential risk due to ingested methylene chloride (Ref. 3).


Based on a calculated hypothetical worst-case potential exposure of 6.0 ng/p/day, FDA estimates that the upper-bound
limit of individual lifetime risk from the potential exposure to methylene chloride resulting from the use of cellulose
triacetate as an immobilizing agent in the production of reduced lactose milk to be 4.4x10

-11

, or approximately 4 in 100 billion (Ref. 5). Because there is no evidence to suggest, or any reason to believe, that
methylene chloride will be present in the final product at the assumed level, the calculated estimate of the upper-bound
limit of risk is likely to be substantially higher than any actual risk. Thus, the agency concludes that there is a reasonable
certainty of no harm from the exposure to methylene chloride that might result from the proposed use of cellulose triacetate
as an immobilizing agent in the production of reduced lactose milk.


III. Conclusion on Safety


Having evaluated data in the petition and other relevant material, the agency concludes that the proposed use of the
food additive is safe, and that the regulations in  173.357 (21 CFR 173.357) should be amended as set forth below.
The agency has considered whether a specification is necessary to control the amount of methylene chloride in the
food additive. The agency finds that a specification is not necessary for the following reasons: (1) The steps utilized
in the manufacture of cellulose triacetate that are intended to remove contaminants such as methylene chloride (drying
to completion and washing of the resin to remove volatile and nonvolatile components, respectively, either of which
could interfere with the intended enzymatic reaction) are a necessary part of the manufacturing process. Therefore,
the agency would not expect this impurity to become a component of food at other than extremely small levels; (2) when
the additive is manufactured under these conditions, methylene chloride could not be demonstrated to be present
in the additive at a level of detection of 0.5 ppm; and (3) the upper-bound limit of lifetime risk from exposure to this
impurity, even when calculated by using several worst-case assumptions, is extremely low, less than 4.4 in 100 billion.
In accordance with  171.1(h) (21 CFR 171.1(h)), the petition and the documents that FDA considered and relied
upon in reaching its decision to approve the petition are available for inspection at the Center for Food Safety and
Applied Nutrition by appointment with the information contact person listed above. As provided in 21 CFR 171.1(h),
the agency will delete from the documents any materials that are not available for public disclosure before making
the documents available for inspection.


IV. Environmental Impact


The agency has carefully considered the potential environmental effects of this action and has concluded that the
action will not have a significant impact on the human environment, and that an environmental impact statement is
not required. The agency's finding of no significant impact and the evidence supporting that finding, contained
in an environmental assessment, may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch (address above) between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m.,
Monday through Friday.


 V. Objections


Any person who will be adversely affected by this regulation may at any time on or before August 19, 1994, file with the
Dockets Management Branch (address above) written objections thereto. Each objection shall be separately numbered,
and each numbered objection shall specify the particular provisions of the regulation to which objection is made
and the grounds for the objection. Each numbered objection on which a hearing is requested shall specifically so state.
Failure to request a hearing for any particular objection shall constitute a waiver of the right to a hearing on that
objection. Each numbered objection for which a hearing is requested shall include a detailed description and analysis
of the specific factual information intended to be presented in support of the objection in the event that a hearing
is held. Failure to include such a description and analysis for any particular objection shall constitute a waiver
of the right to a hearing on the objection. Three copies of all documents shall be submitted and shall be identified
with the docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document. Any objections received in response to the
regulation may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

OSM is approving, with certain exceptions, a proposed amendment to the Pennsylvania regulatory program (hereinafter
referred to as the Pennsylvania program) approved under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA).
The proposed amendment establishes a self-bonding program as an alternative to the current financial instrument
options available to the permittee for posting a performance bond. The performance bond is required to be submitted
and approved by the regulatory authority before the permit is issued or mining initiated.

III. Director's Findings
IV. Summary and Disposition of Comments
V. Director's Decision
VI. Procedural Determinations



I. Background on the Pennsylvania Program



The Secretary of the Interior conditionally approved the Pennsylvania program on July 31, 1982. Background information
on the Pennsylvania program including the Secretary's findings, the disposition of comments, and a detailed explanation
of the conditions of approval can be found in the July 30, 1982, 

Federal Register 

(47 FR 33050). Subsequent actions concerning conditions of approval and program amendments can be found at 30 CFR
938.11, 938.12, 938.15 and 938.16.



II. Submission of the Proposed Amendment



On May 11, 1993, the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Resources (PADER) submitted to OSM the rules published
in the 

Pennsylvania Bulletin 

20 Pa. B. 2517 and 21 Pa. B. 5142 as an amendment (Administrative Record Number PA 823.00) to the approved regulatory
program. The amendment provides a permit applicant the option to use a self-bond as a financial instrument instead
of a surety or collateral bond for the performance bond required by PADER before a coal mine permit may be issued or coal
mining activities conducted. The proposed amendment also allows an eligible permittee to replace an existing surety
or collateral bond with a self-bond.

OSM announced receipt of the proposed amendment in the June 7, 1993, 

Federal Register 

(58 FR 31926), and, in the same document, opened the public comment period and provided an opportunity for a public
hearing on the adequacy of the proposed amendment. The public comment period closed on July 7, 1993.


By letter dated January 24, 1994 (Administrative Record No. PA 823.07), OSM provided comments to Pennsylvania on
the proposed amendment. By letter dated February 17, 1994 (Administrative Record No. PA 823.09), Pennsylvania submitted
responses to OSM's concerns.

III. Director's Findings


Set forth below, pursuant to SMCRA and the Federal regulations at 40 CFR 732.17, are the Director's findings concerning
the proposed amendment. Any revisions not specifically addressed below are found to be no less stringent than SMCRA
and no less effective than the Federal rules.



1. Section 86.142 Definitions


a. Adverse opinion. Pennsylvania proposes to add this definition to mean a statement by an independent certified
public accountant (CPA) that the financial statements of the applicant do not present fairly the financial condition
of the applicant in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. Although there is no counterpart
Federal definition, the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 800.23(b)(4)(i) require that the applicant submit a financial
statement for the latest complete fiscal year accompanied by a report by an independent certified public accountant
and containing the accountant's audit opinion or review opinion. If either opinion contains an adverse opinion,
the self-bond application must be denied. The independent CPA's audit or review opinion is required on the accuracy
of the information in the financial statement. An Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposed rule (52 FR 12786,
April 17, 1987) in discussing a firm's financial tests states that an ``adverse opinion, indicates that, in the opinion
of the auditor, a firm's financial statement does not present the firm's financial position, results of operations,
or changes in financial position in a manner that conforms to generally accepted accounting principles. . . .''
Although the EPA discussion is not controlling on OSM, it is being used for guidance. While there is no Federal definition,
the Director finds the proposed definition to be not inconsistent with the requirements of SMCRA and the Federal regulations
because the application of the definition will aid Pennsylvania in applying a uniform standard in determining whether
or not a self-bond application should be rejected.

b. Applicant. Pennsylvania proposes to add a definition for ``applicant'' to mean a permittee or an applicant for
a permit who is applying to self-bond under this subchapter. There is no corresponding Federal definition for ``applicant''
under the self-bonding rules. However, at 30 CFR 701.5 the Federal definition of ``applicant'' means any person seeking
a permit, permit revision, renewal, and transfer, assignment, or sale of permit rights from a regulatory authority
to conduct surface coal mining and reclamation operations or, where required, seeking approval for coal exploration.
Under section 86.1, the State's general definition of applicant means any person who seeks to obtain a permit from
the Department to conduct coal mining activities under this chapter. Pennsylvania is proposing an additional definition
of ``applicant'' at section 86.142 to include an existing permittee or applicant for a permit who is applying to utilize
a self-bond. At first blush it appears that the two definitions conflict with each other. Upon further examination,
the definition of ``applicant'' found at section 86.142 will not supersede the general definition of applicant found
at section 86.1 because the entity defined under section 86.142 already has to be a permittee or in the process of becoming
one. By its own terms, the section 86.142 definition only concerns the self-bonding regulations. Therefore, the
definition of ``applicant'' as it is applied in the self-bonding regulations is consistent with the self-bonding
regulations at 30 CFR 800.23.

c. Continuous business operations. Pennsylvania proposes to add this definition to mean operations in which the
applicant has been in business and operating for at least 10 years prior to the filing of its self-bonding application
unless the applicant's existence results from a reorganization, consolidation or merger involving a company with
this longevity. If the applicant is a majority-owned subsidiary of a corporation, it may rely upon its parent corporation's
business history, which has a 10-year business history.

<DOCNO> FR940720-0-00054 </DOCNO>

<TEXT>
 

The Pennsylvania definition allows applicants that were once one type of entity but that are now a different type of
entity, either as a result of a merger, consolidation or a reorganization, to become self-bonded so long as one of the
entities was in existence for 10 years. The Federal regulation at 30 CFR 800.23(b)(2) requires a self-bonding applicant
to be in continuous operation for a period of not less than 5 years immediately preceding the self-bond application.
Events beyond the control of the applicant and not affecting its continuance as an entity may be excluded. The purpose
behind the Federal rule was to ``show the business entity's intent and ability to remain in operation and undertake
the subsequent mining and reclamation.'' 48 FR 36418, 36420 (August 10, 1993). Thus, it appears that Pennsylvania's
use of its definition may not fulfill the purpose of the Federal rule if the new entity was not in existence for at least
5 years. However, this definition if taken in concert with sections 86.159(b)(5), (c)(4), and (j), which are discussed
below, insures as much as the 5-year continuous business operation requirement does, that the applicant will be in
existence to complete the mining and the subsequent reclamation. 

Section 86.159(b)(5), which requires that the applicant must have honored in the last 3 years all of its self-bonding
obligations and section 86.159(b)(6), which prohibits the acceptance of an applicant whose surety bonds were canceled
for nonpayment of premiums, fraud or failure to comply with the terms of the surety bond, are both indicators of a history
for compliance with bonding obligations and as such are good indicators of a continuance in the future of complying
with such obligations. Section 86.159(c)(4), which requires an applicant to certify that it will maintain its corporate
status for at least 5 years, is more than just a statement because this certification is subject to criminal penalties
for false swearing. Section 86.159(j), which requires the applicant, on a sliding scale of liability and net worth,
to submit a security interest to Pennsylvania is an expression of confidence of the company that it expects to be in
existence for the term of the permit and to have the security interest which was proffered to the State, released. Therefore,
based on the above discussion, the Director finds that the definition of ``continuous business operation'' in conjunction
with the above-noted sections is no less effective than 30 CFR 800.23(b)(2). 

d. Current asset. Pennsylvania is proposing a new definition to mean cash or other assets which are reasonably expected
to be converted to cash or sold or consumed within 1 year or within the normal operating cycle of the business. The Director
finds that the proposed definition is substantively identical to and no less effective than the Federal definition
of ``current asset'' at 30 CFR 800.23(a). 

e. Current liability. The State proposes this definition to mean an obligation which is reasonably expected to be
paid or liquidated within 1 year or within the normal operating cycle of the business. The Director finds that the proposed
definition is substantively identical to the Federal definition of ``current liabilities'' at 30 CFR 800.23(a).


f. Disclaimer of opinion. The State proposes this definition to mean a statement by an independent certified public
accountant (CPA) that he does not express an opinion on the financial statements of the applicant. Pursuant to section
86.159(g), an application will be rejected if a disclaimer of opinion is expressed by the CPA. There is no counterpart
Federal definition for this term. However, the EPA discussed this term when it was proposing financial responsibility
for owners of underground petroleum storage tanks. While EPA's discussions are not controlling on OSM's decision,
it is helpful. EPA stated that a disclaimer of opinion meant that ``the auditor does not express an opinion on the firm's
financial statement. Auditors issue disclaimers of opinion of their examinations of a firm's financial statements
have been limited in some way or if there are uncertainties regarding the firm's financial statements.'' 52 FR 12786
(April 17, 1987). The Director concludes that application of this definition will assist Pennsylvania in determining
whether or not the applicant is a suitable candidate for self-bonding. Therefore, the Director finds this definition
not inconsistent with the requirements of SMCRA and the Federal regulations. 

g. Financial statement. The State is proposing a new definition to mean a formal report of the applicant's status of
accounts at a particular time, prepared to show the operating results and financial condition of the applicant's
business. The term includes, but is not limited to, the balance sheet, income statement, and statement of change in
financial position prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. There is no counterpart
Federal definition for this term. However, the State's definition follows basic accounting principles. Therefore,
the Director finds the proposed definition to be not inconsistent with the requirements of SMCRA and the Federal regulations.

h. Fixed asset. The State proposes that this term includes plants and equipment, but does not include land or coal in
place. Since this proposed rule is substantively identical to the Federal definition of ``fixed asset,'' the Director
finds that it is no less effective than the Federal rule. 

i. Independent certified public accountant. Pennsylvania proposes this definition to mean a certified public accountant
not dependent on or subject to the direct control of the applicant. There is no counterpart Federal definition.

However, the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 800.23(b)(4) require an independent certified public accountant's (CPA)
audit or review opinion on the accuracy of the information in the financial statement. By letter of February 17, 1994
(Administrative Record No. 823.09), Pennsylvania stated that the purpose of the definition was to address those
circumstances where the CPA was a sole practitioner whose primary client was the applicant. The Director believes
the application of this definition to be an additional safeguard to Pennsylvania's self-bonding program. Therefore,
the Director finds the proposed definition to be not inconsistent with the requirements of SMCRA and the Federal regulations.



j. Liability. Pennsylvania proposes to add this definition to mean an obligation to transfer assets or provide services
to other entities in the future as a result of past transactions. The Director finds that the proposed definition is
substantively identical to the Federal definition of ``liability'' at 30 CFR 800.23(a).


k. Net worth. Pennsylvania proposes to modify its definition to mean total assets minus total liabilities and is equivalent
to owner's equity. The Director finds that the proposed definition is identical to the Federal definition of ``net
worth'' at 30 CFR 800.23(a).


l. Parent corporation. Pennsylvania proposes to add this definition to mean the corporation which directly owns
or controls the corporation which is the applicant. The Director finds that the proposed definition is substantively
identical to the Federal definition of ``parent corporation'' at 30 CFR 800.23(a).

m. Self-bond. Pennsylvania proposes to revise its definition of ``self-bond'' to mean an indemnity agreement in
a sum certain payable to the Department, executed by the permittee and by each individual and business organization
capable of influencing or controlling the investment or financial practices of the permittee by virtue of his authority
as an officer or ownership of all or a significant part of the permittee, and supported by agreements granting the Department
a security interest in real or personal property pledged to secure performance by the permittee. The proposed State
and Federal definitions of ``self-bond'' are similar with the additional requirements in the State's rule for indemnification
by the controllers and significant owners of the self-bonded permittee, and for the pledging of real or personal property
collateral to secure the self-bond. In addition, to those reasons discussed at Finding 1.c., the State's requirement
for collateralized self-bonds serves to provide security for the self-bonding obligation and elevates the State's
position to that of a secured creditor if there is a bankruptcy of the self-bonded permittee. Therefore, the Director
finds that the State's revised definition of ``self-bond'' is no less effective than the corresponding Federal requirements
at 30 CFR 800.5(c).



n. Tangible net worth. Pennsylvania proposes to add this definition to mean net worth minus intangibles such as goodwill
and rights to patents or royalties. The Director finds that the proposed definition is identical to and no less effective
than the Federal definition of ``tangible net worth'' at 30 CFR 800.23(a).


o. Liquidity ratio. Pennsylvania proposes to delete this definition. Since there is no counterpart Federal definition
for ``liquidity ratio,'' the Director finds that the deletion of this definition does not render the Pennsylvania
program less effective than the Federal requirements at 30 CFR 800.23
p. Quick assets. Pennsylvania proposes to delete this definition. There is no counterpart Federal definition for
``quick assets.'' Therefore, the Director finds that the deletion of this definition does not render the Pennsylvania
program less effective than the Federal requirements at 30 CFR 800.23.
q. Retained earnings. Pennsylvania proposes to delete this definition. Since there is no counterpart Federal definition
for ``retained earnings,'' the Director finds that the deletion of this definition does not render the Pennsylvania
program less effective than the Federal requirements at 30 CFR 800.23.




2. Section 86.159



Pennsylvania is proposing to revise section 86.159 to establish the procedures and criteria to be used by the regulatory
authority in determining whether a coal mine permittee is eligible to use self-bonding in lieu of a surety or collateral
bond.

The Federal self-bonding rules at 30 CFR 800.23 establish minimum standards of financial eligibility to self-bond
for States that wish to allow self-bonding. These rules also allow a regulatory authority to accept the guarantee
of a qualified parent corporation for its subsidiaries. ``States choosing to allow self-bonding may adopt more detailed
rules that reflect the financial structures of the local industry, if necessary to provide the regulatory authority
additional protection from risk of forfeiture.'' 48 FR 36418, 36419 (August 10, 1983).

a. Section 86.159(a). Pennsylvania proposes in paragraph (a) that the regulatory authority may accept a self-bond
to cover all or part of the permittee's liabilities arising from coal mining activities. The State also proposes that
an applicant which is a subsidiary may satisfy the requirements for eligibility to self-bond by relying on its parent
corporation. The corresponding Federal requirements are similar with the exception of conditions added by the State
to address mining activities that may not be self-bonded such as long-term facilities, acid mine drainage, and restoration
of prime farmland. The Federal self-bonding rules do not limit self-bond coverage to certain mining activities.
Pennsylvania stated in its May 12, 1990, 

Pennsylvania Bulletin 

that it was difficult to determine an applicant's financial eligibility to self-bond certain types of liabilities.
The acceptance of a self-bond by a state regulatory authority is discretionary and the Director finds it is within
the State's discretion to exclude certain liabilities from coverage by a self-bond. The Federal regulation at 30
CFR 773.15 prohibits a regulatory authority from issuing a permit if the permit applicant is, among other things,
in violation of SMCRA or state and federal laws pertaining to air or water environmental protection. Pennsylvania's
requirement that the applicant must have a positive compliance history with federal and state laws is not inconsistent
with the Federal regulations. There is also no Federal counterpart that applicants must pledge collateral (see Finding
1.c.) and provide required security agreements in order for the State to allow an applicant to self-bond. However,
the Director finds that these requirements are not inconsistent with the self-bonding regulations at 30 CFR 800.23.

b. Section 86.159 (b) (5), (6), and (c)(4). These sections, which have no Federal counterparts, are discussed at the
Director's Finding 1.c.

c. Sections 86.159 (b) (1), (2), (c) (1), (2), (3), (5), and (6) and (f). Pennsylvania is proposing that, to be acceptable,
the applicant or its parent corporation must (1) be authorized to do business in Pennsylvania, (2) designate a suitable
agent to receive service of process, (3) have a history of continuous business operation, (4) meet certain financial
criteria, and (5) submit financial statements of its most recent three fiscal years and any completed quarters in
the current fiscal year.

The State's proposed amendment at subsection (b)(1) establishes the requirement that the applicant must be incorporated
in or authorized to do business in Pennsylvania. There is no counterpart Federal regulation. However, the Director
finds that the proposed rule is not inconsistent with the requirements of SMCRA and no less effective than the Federal
regulations.

The State is proposing at subsection (b)(2) that the applicant designate suitable agents in Pennsylvania to receive
service of suits, claims, demands and other services of process. Since this provision is substantively identical
to paragraph (b)(1) of 30 CFR 800.23 of the corresponding Federal rule, the Director finds that it is no less effective
than the Federal rule.

The State proposes at subsection (b)(3) that the applicant's history of continuous business operation is met if the
applicant's existence is the result of a reorganization, consolidation or merger involving a company with a history
of continuous business operation or the applicant is a majority-owned subsidiary of a corporation with a history
of continuous business operation. The Federal regulations at 30 CFR 800.23(b) allow an applicant to qualify for a
self-bond even if it did not meet the 5 years of continuous business operation, so long as its parent corporation did
meet the 5-year requirement. Pennsylvania's approach, of allowing an applicant to rely on its parent's time of operation,
is consistent with 30 CFR 800.23(b). For a complete discussion of the term ``continuous business operation,'' see
the Director's Finding at 1.c.

Pennsylvania's proposed subsection (c) and the Federal regulations for financial statements are similar; however,
the State's proposed rule at subsection (c) requires 3 years of audited financial statements and the Federal regulations
require 1 year. Both require the submittal of unaudited quarters for the current year. Both require that the audited
financial statements must be accompanied by a report prepared by an independent certified public accountant (CPA)
that contains the accountant's audit or review opinion of the financial statements with no adverse opinion. In addition,
the State's proposed rule requires that forfeiture of the aggregate of Pennsylvania self-bonds would not affect
its ability to stay in business or endanger cash flow needed for its current obligations. There are no counterpart
Federal regulations for these proposed requirements; however, they have the effect of strengthening the proposed
self-bonding program and are no less effective than the Federal regulations. The Director, therefore, finds that
the proposed rule at subsection (c) is no less effective than the counterpart Federal regulations at 30 CFR 800.23(b)(4).

Pennsylvania is proposing at subsection (f) that the applicant for self-bonding meet one of the three following financial
criteria:

(1) A current rating for its most recent bond issuance of either: AAA, AA or A as issued by Standard and Poor's Corporation;
or Aaa, Aa or A as issued by Moody's Investor Services;

(2) A tangible net worth of at least 10 million, a ratio of total liabilities to net worth of 2.5 times or less, and a ratio
of current assets to current liabilities of 1.2 times or greater; or

(3) Fixed assets in the United States of at least 20 million and a ratio of total liabilities to net worth of 2.5 times
or less and a ratio of current assets to current liabilities of 1.2 times or greater.

<TEXT>
 

The State's proposed rules are essentially the same as the corresponding Federal regulations at 30 CFR 800.23(b)(3)
(i), (ii), and (iii). In addition to meeting one of the three basic tests, the State's proposed rules also require the
applicant to have a tangible net worth that is six times its total self-bonds in Pennsylvania and that amounts to 90
percent of its total assets. This requirement is similar to a financial assurance requirement of the EPA's regulations
for hazardous waste facilities (47 FR 15032, April 7, 1982). In it preamble, EPA stated that ``This requirement was
included to help ensure accessibility to funds in the event of bankruptcy or other default.'' There is no counterpart
Federal requirement for these additional tangible net worth components of the basic financial tests in OSM's regulations
at 30 CFR 800.23(b). However, this rule implements the Pennsylvania statute requiring the same. The rules add the
assurance of the financial stability of the applicant. Therefore, the State's proposed rules at subsection (f) are
no less effective than the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 800.23(b)(3) (i), (ii), and (iii).

d. Section 86.159(b)(4). Pennsylvania is proposing at subsection (b)(4) that, in the past 36 months, the applicant
has not defaulted on any payments of dividend or sinking fund installments, lease rentals and reclamation fees. There
are no counterpart Federal regulations. However, the Director finds that the proposed rule is not inconsistent with
the requirements of SMCRA and no less effective than the Federal regulations.

e. Section 86.159(d). The Federal regulations at 30 CFR 800.23(f) allow the regulatory authority to request update
information from the applicant within 90 days after the close of each fiscal year following the issuance of the self-bond
or corporate guarantee. This was intended to give the regulatory authority flexibility to require additional information
if it believed it was necessary. Pennsylvania has submitted a similar requirement at subsection (d) requesting some
of the financial information specified in the Federal rule. Since this is discretionary on the part of the regulatory
authority, the Director finds that the proposed rule is no less effective than the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 800.23(f).

f. Section 86.159(e). Pennsylvania is proposing at subsection (e) that if the applicant or the CPA submits false information
the application will be disallowed and render the applicant ineligible to self-bond. In addition, this section subjects
the applicant and the CPA to criminal penalties for false swearing. There is no direct Federal counterpart. However,
the Federal rules envision that an applicant will answer truthfully. Therefore, the Director finds that the proposed
rule is not inconsistent with the requirements of SMCRA and the Federal regulations.

g. Section 86.159(g). The State's proposed rule at subsection (g) is similar to the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 800.23(b)(4)(i)
which require submittal of an accountant's audit opinion or review opinion on the financial statements with no adverse
opinion. However, the State has expanded its rule at this section to disqualify an applicant on the basis of both an
adverse opinion and a disclaimer opinion by an accountant. In addition, an applicant may be determined to be ineligible
to self-bond on the basis of other qualifications in the opinion expressed by the CPA. The Director finds that the proposed
rule is no less effective than the counterpart Federal regulations at 30 CFR 800.23(b)(4)(i).

h. Section 86.159(h). Pennsylvania is proposing at subsection (h) that the total value of outstanding plus proposed
self-bonds for coal mining activities may not exceed 25 percent of the applicant's tangible net worth in the United
States. This is similar to the counterpart Federal rule at 30 CFR 800.23(d). However, the Federal rule also requires
for corporate guarantees that the total amount of the parent corporation guarantor's present and proposed self-bonds
and guaranteed self-bonds for coal mining activities shall not exceed 25 percent of the guarantor's net worth in the
United States. Under the proposed Pennsylvania self-bonding rules, the parent corporation is always a party to the
self-bond and is established as a co-indemnitor under the self-bond. In applying the proposed Pennsylvania rule,
an applicant may rely on its parent's qualifications to be accepted under the self-bonding rules. If this is so, the
parent is thus subject to the 25 percent requirements. The Director finds the proposed rule is no less effective than
the counterpart Federal regulations at 30 CFR 800.23(d).

i. Section 86.159(i). Pennsylvania is proposing at subsection (i) that the period of liability under a self-bond
is determined in accordance with the existing bonding regulations. Similarly, the release of a self-bond is to be
governed by the existing regulations. Pennsylvania also proposes that the liability under a self-bond is terminated
upon the Department's approval of alternative bonding submitted by the applicant. The Director finds the cross-references
to other rules is consistent with the Federal bonding regulations at 30 CFR 800.13 and 800.40 and its replacement provision
is similar to and no less effective than the counterpart Federal provision at 30 CFR 800.30.

j. Section 86.159(j). Pennsylvania's proposed rule at subsection (j) requires that part of all of the self-bond amount
be collateralized by the permittee's pledge of security interests in real or personal property. There are no counterpart
Federal requirements of this kind in the Federal self-bonding program. These regulations implement Pennsylvania's
statute requiring the same. Unlike collateral bonds, these security interests for self-bonds are not always the
full amount of the bond. The amount of collateral required by the State's proposed rules is determined on a sliding
scale of liability and net worth. This collateral is in addition to all the self-bonding rules. Also, as discussed
at the Director's Finding 1.c., the requirement that the applicant submit a security interest to Pennsylvania is
an expression of confidence of the company that it expects to be in existence for the term of the permit and to have the
security interest which was proffered to the State released. Therefore, the Director finds that the State's proposal
to require full or partial collateral is no less effective than the Federal regulations.
k. Section 86.159(k) (1), (2) and (3). Proposed subsections (k)(1) through (k)(3) provide the Department with the
authority to require appropriate forfeiture terms and conditions within the indemnity agreement that are in addition
to the general forfeiture requirements of Pennsylvania's bonding program.
Pennsylvania proposes a subsection (k)(1) that the self-bond will be forfeited if 90 days after the Department is
informed or determines that the applicant is no longer eligible to self-bond and within the 90-day period the applicant
fails to submit to the Department acceptable security as provided for in subchapter F to cover its self-bonded liability.
The Federal rules at 30 CFR 800.23(g) contain a similar requirement with the statement that if the permittee fails
to post an adequate substitute bond the provisions of 30 CFR 800.16(e) shall apply. Under 30 CFR 800.16(e) the operator
would have to cease coal extraction and immediately begin reclamation operations. At section 86.151(h) one of the
requirements is that the applicant complete the reclamation plan. At section 86.159(k)(2) liability under the self-bond
is conditioned on the applicant complying with the various environmental statutes and regulations including Pennsylvania's
Surface Mining Conservation and Reclamation Act. This obligation also falls upon the parent who under section 86.159(l)(2)
is co-indemnitor under the self-bond. This along with the requirement that the self-bond becomes due and payable
upon default is consistent with the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 800.23(e)(4), which require the applicant, parent
or non-parent corporate guarantor to complete reclamation or to pay costs of reclamation. Subsection (k)(2) also
requires the applicant or its parent to notify Pennsylvania if there is a material adverse change in its financial
condition. The Federal regulations at 30 CFR 800.23(g) also require a similar notification concerning the change
in financial condition. Therefore, the Director finds that the proposed amendment is no less effective than 30 CFR
800.23 (e)(4) and (g).
At subsection (k)(3) Pennsylvania specifies conditions that relate to performance under the mining permit and Pennsylvania
mining statutes and regulations and certain commercial lending based criteria relative to the value of the underlying
pledged assets. There are no counterpart Federal regulations. However, the Director finds that the proposed rules
are not inconsistent with SMCRA and no less effective than the Federal regulations.
l. Section 86.159(l). Pennsylvania is proposing that the applicant be a party to the self-bond, which is consistent
with the definition of self-bond at 30 CFR 800.5. In addition, at subsection (l)(2) Pennsylvania is requiring that
all parent corporations be a party to the self-bond whenever its subsidiary is an applicant for a self-bond. This is
different than the Federal rules at 30 CFR 800.23(e) which only require a parent to be a party to the bond when it is a parent
corporation guarantor. Nonetheless, the Director finds this requirement will reduce the risk of a bond forfeiture
and therefore finds it no less effective than 30 CFR 800.23(e)(1).

The Federal regulations at 30 CFR 800.23(e)(2) provide signature requirements for corporate indemnity agreements
as well as authorizations and affidavits to assure a corporation is bound to the terms of the agreement. The Federal
regulations require that two authorized corporate officers for the applicant as well as the parent corporation execute
the agreements; whereas the State's rule does not require two signatures of all the indemnitors. In the preamble to
the final self-bonding rules (48 FR 36418, August 10, 1983), OSM explained in response to a comment that ``OSM does
not consider it a burden on the corporation to obtain the signatures of two corporate officers on the indemnity agreement.
For such an infrequent and important action, the approval of two corporate officers will better assure that the corporation
and OSM are protected from possible unauthorized actions of an individual. This requirement is retained.'' The Federal
regulations require an affidavit from the corporation(s) certifying that entering into the indemnity agreement
is valid under all applicable Federal and State laws. Pennsylvania lacks this requirement for all of its indemnitors.
In addition, this section of the Federal regulations also requires that the signatories provide the regulatory authority
with documents that evidence their authority to bind the corporation (e.g. board of directors resolutions) and authorization
for the parent corporation to enter into the indemnity agreement. Again, Pennsylvania does not require this. Even
though the State requires the applicant and the parent to be co-indemnitors under the self-bond, the Director finds
that the proposed rule is less effective than the Federal rule because it lacks all the requirements discussed above.
Accordingly, the Director is requiring that Pennsylvania amend its program to be no less effective than 30 CFR 800.23(e)(2).
Finally, Pennsylvania at subsection 86.159(1)(3) requires each person with a beneficial interest in a partnership,
joint venture or syndicate to be a party and co-indemnitor under the self-bond. This is substantively identical to
the Federal requirement at 30 CFR 800.23(e)(3) and is, therefore, no less effective than the Federal regulation.
m. Section 86.159(m). Pennsylvania proposes at subsection (m) that each indemnitor under the self-bond shall be
jointly and severally liable. As the proposed amendment is substantively identical to language found at 30 CFR 800.23(e)(1),
the Director finds it no less effective than the Federal rule.
n. Section 86.159(n). Pennsylvania is proposing at subsection (n) the types of security interests that may be used
to secure the self-bond. In addition, this section sets out the standard the Department will use in determining the
acceptability of the security interest being pledged. There are no counterpart Federal regulations. However, the
Director finds the proposed rule is not inconsistent with the requirements of SMCRA and no less effective than the
Federal regulations.
o. Section 86.159(o). Pennsylvania is proposing at subsection (o) that during the period of the self-bond and until
released in writing by the Department, the parties to the self-bond who are indemnitors may not take action which would
adversely affect the Commonwealth's rights, title or interest in the security interests pledged to secure the self-bond.
This proposed rule provides for default if the applicant takes action that would reduce the value of the pledged assets.
There are no counterpart Federal regulations. However, this provision provides protection for Pennsylvania's
security interests, hence the Director finds the proposed rule is not inconsistent with the requirements of SMCRA
and no less effective than the Federal regulations.
p. Section 86.159(p). Pennsylvania proposes at section (p) that in addition to the indemnification and security
required in subsection (j), the Department may require a third-party guarantee of an applicant's self-bond. A third-party
guarantor shall guarantee and become surety for the performance of the parties who are indemnitors under the self-bond
required by subsection (j). The guarantor must submit a perfected security interest that is acceptable to Pennsylvania.
It should be noted that these third-party guarantors under the Pennsylvania program are not the same as a non-parent
corporate guarantor under 30 CFR 800.23(c)(2), since the applicant and/or its parent must still meet the financial
qualification regardless of any third-party guarantors. There are no counterpart Federal regulations. However,
the Director finds the proposed rule is not inconsistent with the requirements of SMCRA and no less effective than
the Federal regulations.
q. Section 86.159(q). Pennsylvania is proposing at subsection (q) that when the Department determines that an event
of default or forfeiture under the self-bond has occurred, the determination shall also constitute a determination
of the applicant's inability to self-bond. There are no counterpart Federal self-bonding regulations. However,
the Director finds that the provisions of the proposed rule are not inconsistent with the bonding requirements under
30 CFR Part 800.

r. Section 86.159(r). Pennsylvania proposes at subsection (r) that, at the request of the applicant, the Department
will maintain the confidentiality of the applicant's financial information and the terms and the conditions of the
security interests unless it is allowed to be disclosed under other laws. There is no comparable Federal counterpart.
These regulations implement Pennsylvania's statute at 52 P.S.   1396.4 and 1406.6, which prohibit such
disclosure. Therefore, the Director finds that the rule is not inconsistent with the requirements of SMCRA and the
Federal regulations.

s. Section 86.159(s). Pennsylvania is proposing at subsection (s) that applications for a self-bond and each annual
update of a self-bond shall be accompanied by a nonrefundable fee in the amount of $900. There are no counterpart Federal
regulations. However, in a comparable Federal rule at 30 CFR 777.17, permit fees are allowed so long as they do not exceed
the costs to the regulatory authority. Pursuant to the October 10, 1987, 

Pennsylvania Bulletin, 

Pennsylvania stated that the $900 fee was needed to cover the costs of reviewing and verifying the application and
to obtain the services of an outside consultant to analyze the applicant's eligibility or continuing eligibility.
Therefore, the Director finds that the fee is reimbursement of the costs to Pennsylvania and finds the proposed rule
is not inconsistent with SMCRA and the Federal regulations.

t. Section 86.159(t). Proposed subsection (t) establishes the regulatory authority of the Department to seek remedies
against a permittee or applicant apart from those specifically set forth in the proposed self-bonding rules. There
are no counterpart Federal regulations. However, it is not inconsistent with SMCRA and the Federal regulations because
it clarifies that the remedies under SMCRA are not the only ones available to Pennsylvania.

u. Section 86.166(b). Pennsylvania is revising this paragraph to correct the rule reference concerning release
of bonds from ``Part 4 of this subchapter'' to ``86.170-86.173 (relating to release of bonds).'' The Director
finds that this revision is nonsubstantive in nature and will not render the Pennsylvania program inconsistent with
the requirements of SMCRA and the Federal regulations.

v. Section 86.166(c). Pennsylvania prohibited a permittee from replacing its existing bond with a self-bond. Pennsylvania
is now proposing to delete this prohibition. Since the corresponding Federal rule at 30 CFR 800.30(a) allows permittees
to replace existing bonds with other bonds that provide equivalent coverage, the Director finds that the revised
State rule is no less effective than the Federal rule.



IV. Summary and Disposition of Comments



Public Comments



The Director solicited public comments and provided an opportunity for a public hearing on the proposed amendment.
No public comments were received, and because no one requested an opportunity to testify at a public hearing, no hearing
was held.



Agency Comments



Pursuant to 30 CFR 732.17(h)(ii)(i), the Director solicited comments from various Federal and State agencies with
an actual or potential interest in the Pennsylvania program. The Department of Labor, Mine Safety and Health Administration
(MSHA), commented that the proposed amendment would have no effect on MSHA operations or regulations. The Department
of Agriculture, Soil Conservation Service, stated that the proposed changes would not have any significant effects
on the environmental integrity of the regulations. The Department of the Interior, Bureau of Mines, and the U.S. Army
Corps of Engineers responded that they had no comments.

Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Concurrence



Pursuant to 30 CFR 732.17(h)(11)(ii), OSM is required to obtain the written concurrence of the EPA with respect to
those provisions of the proposed program amendment that relate to air or water quality standards promulgated under
the authority of the Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 

et seq.) 

or the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401 

et seq.). 

None of the revisions that Pennsylvania proposed to make in this amendment pertain to air or water quality standards.
Therefore, OSM did not request EPA's concurrence.

Pursuant to 30 CFR 732.17(h)(11)(i), OSM solicited comments on the proposed amendment from EPA (Administrative
Record No. PA 823.01). The EPA responded that it concurred with the proposed amendment.



V. Director's Decision



Based on the above findings, the Director approves the proposed amendment as submitted by Pennsylvania on May 11,
1993, and clarified on February 17, 1994. As discussed at Finding 2.1., the Director finds that, for the most part,
the Pennsylvania program does not have a counterpart to the Federal rules at 30 CFR 800.23(e)(2). The Director is,
therefore, requiring Pennsylvania to further amend its program to correct the identified deficiencies.

In accordance with 30 CFR 732.17(f)(1), the Director is also taking this opportunity to clarify in the required amendment
section at 30 CFR 938.16 that, within 60 days of the publication of this final rule, Pennsylvania must either submit
a proposed written amendment, or a description of an amendment to be proposed that meets the requirements of SMCRA
and 30 CFR Chapter VII and a timetable for enactment that is consistent with Pennsylvania's established administrative
or legislative procedures.

The Federal regulations at 30 CFR Part 938 codifying decisions concerning the Pennsylvania program are being amended
to implement this decision. This final rule is being made effective immediately to expedite the State program amendment
process and to encourage States to conform their programs with the Federal standards without undue delay. Consistency
of State and Federal standards is required by SMCRA.

For administrative reasons, the Director is reiterating the removal of required amendments (i), (j), and (k) as set
forth in 57 FR 48733 (October 28, 1992).



Effect of the Director's Decision



Section 503 of SMCRA provides that a State may not exercise jurisdiction under SMCRA unless the State program is approved
by the Secretary. Similarly, 30 CFR 732.17(a) requires that any alteration of an approved State program be submitted
to OSM for review as a program amendment. Thus any changes to the State program are not enforceable until approved by
OSM. The Federal regulations at 30 CFR 732.17(g) prohibit any unilateral changes to approved State programs. In the
oversight of the Pennsylvania program, the Director will recognize only the statutes, regulations and other materials
approved by him, together with any consistent implementing policies, directives and other materials, and will require
the enforcement by Pennsylvania of only such provisions.



VI. Procedural Determinations



Executive Order 12866



This rule is exempted from review by the Office of Management and Budget under Executive Order 12866.



Executive Order 12778



The Department of the Interior has conducted the reviews required by section 2 of Executive Order 12778 and has determined
that, to the extent allowed by law, this rule meets the applicable standards of subsections (a) and (b) of that section.
However, these standards are not applicable to the actual language of State regulatory programs and program amendments
since each such program is drafted and promulgated by a specific State, not by OSM. Under sections 503 and 505 of SMCRA
(30 U.S.C. 1253 and 1255) and 30 CFR 730.11, 732.15 and 732.17(h)(10), decisions on proposed State regulatory programs
and program amendments submitted by the States must be based solely on a determination of whether the submittal is
consistent with SMCRA and its implementing Federal regulations and whether the other requirements of 30 CFR parts

Regulatory Flexibility Act



The Department of the Interior has determined that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.

). The State submittal which is the subject of this rule is based upon corresponding Federal regulations for which
an economic analysis was prepared and certification made that such regulations would not have a significant economic
effect upon a substantial number of small entities. Accordingly, this rule will ensure that existing requirements
previously promulgated by OSM will be implemented by the State. In making the determination as to whether this rule
would have a significant economic impact, the Department relied upon the data and assumptions for the corresponding
Federal regulations.

Regulation of Fuels and Fuel Additives: Standards for Reformulated and Conventional Gasoline



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Direct final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Clean Air Act, as amended in 1990 (CAA or the Act), mandated that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA or the
Agency) promulgate regulations requiring that gasoline sold in certain areas be reformulated to reduce vehicle
emissions of toxic and ozone-forming compounds and that gasoline sold outside these areas would not be more polluting
than it was in 1990. On February 16, 1994, EPA published the final rule establishing performance standards and compliance
provisions for conventional and reformulated gasoline (RFG). This direct final rule (DFRM) makes minor corrections,
clarifications, and revisions to various provisions in the final reformulated gasoline rule.



This action addresses the following issues: Work-In-Progress (WIP) baseline adjustments; JP-4 baseline
adjustments; summer/winter season definition for baseline determination; complex model valid range extension
for conventional gasoline baselines; valid range limits for aromatics, oxygen, benzene, and RVP; clarifications
to the VOC and NO

X

 extrapolations in the complex model; clarifications of seasonal condition inconsistencies; and enforcement corrections/clarifications
associated with the reformulated gasoline and anti-dumping regulations, as well as several technical clarifications
and typographical corrections.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Public Comments



For parties that submit adverse or critical comments, notify EPA of intentions to submit adverse comments, or request
a public hearing, the Agency requests that commenters identify each of the items at issue by the specific preamble
section numbers that discuss those items. For instance, adverse comments on the change to the oxygen valid range limits
should include a reference to Section (Item Number) II.A.1 of the preamble. Adverse comments on any of the insubstantial
errors in Section I of the preamble should include a reference to the identification code associated with each change
in that section. For instance, adverse comments on the paragraph reference change in  80.41(h)(2)(iii) should
include a reference to Item Number I-A. The EPA will withdraw from this direct final action only those specific
provision(s) so identified. All other provisions included in today's notice will become effective on September
19, 1994.

EPA believes that the use of a direct final rule is appropriate because the changes made are generally minor in nature
and all are expected to be non-controversial. The DFRM will allow the Agency to finalize such changes in a timely manner.
For instance, many of the changes contained herein clarify issues relevant to the development and auditing of individual
baselines which, in general, must be submitted by either June 1, 1994 or September 1, 1994. Likewise, the reformulated
gasoline program will commence on December 1, 1994. The clarifications and changes contained herein will promote
successful implementation of this program.

I. Insubstantial Errors



The final rulemaking for the regulation of reformulated and conventional gasoline contained a number of errors,
ambiguities, and misrepresentations of Agency intent which are being addressed by this direct final rule. Of these
errors, many are minor in both form and effect. The minor errors do not require detailed discussions since they all
have at most a negligible effect on compliance with the regulations, and require only simple corrections. Such minor
errors took the form of typographical errors, grammatical errors, inadvertent omissions, and inadvertent insertions.
The table below lists all the insubstantial errors that are being corrected in this direct final rule. Other errors
are more substantial. The more substantial errors and the associated corrections have been discussed on an item-by-item
basis in the following sections.

II. Valid Range Limits 


The valid range limits in both the Simple and Complex Models 
specify the range for each fuel parameter outside of which the 
models cannot be used for the evaluation of emission 
performances. These limits ensure that the models will not be 
used for extremely high or low fuel parameter values which would 
compromise the validity of the models. Thus the valid range 
limits were instituted as a means toward maintaining the accuracy 
of the compliance calculations, and thus the integrity of the 
reformulated gasoline and anti-dumping programs. 
The Agency made every attempt to make the valid range limits 
as wide as possible to provide flexibility to refiners while 
maintaining a focus on the need for accurate performance 
estimates. This was especially true for the conventional 
gasoline valid range limits, as EPA wanted to avoid, to the 
extent possible, establishing provisions which would require 
refiners to reformulate their conventional fuels. To provide 
additional flexibility, the Agency also allowed the extension of 
the specified valid range for the Complex Model for conventional 
gasoline when a refiner's individual 1990 baseline fuel exceeds 
the valid range in one or more fuel parameters. 
Since publication of the final rule, the Agency has 
determined that the flexibility provided to refiners in the valid 
range limits requires some revision and clarification to avoid 
unnecessary and costly refinery modifications which have no long 
term environmental benefit. The changes to the regulations can 
be separated into two categories: changes to the specified valid 
range limits, and clarification of the provision for extending 
the valid range for individual refiner baseline fuels. Both of 
these topics will be described in detail below. 


A. Revised Valid Range Limits 


The valid range limits for the Simple and Complex Models 
were based on two different sets of data and were developed using 
different assumptions. The Simple Model valid range limits were 
determined following the regulatory negotiations held in 1991. 
The Complex Model valid range limits were based upon an 
examination of the sufficiency of data in the Complex Model 
database and the accuracy of extrapolations (See the Regulatory 
Impact Analysis for the final rule, Section IV.D). Because the 
valid range limits for the Simple and Complex Models were 
established independently and through different processes, the 
valid range limits for the two models were different from one 
another. Since promulgation of the final rule, the Agency has 
learned that the specified valid ranges may force refiners to 
make refinery modifications to comply with the regulations that 
are unwarranted under the Simple Model, and unnecessary under the 
Complex Model. Thus EPA is revising the valid range limits for 
oxygen content, RVP, aromatics content, and benzene content for 
the Simple Model, and oxygen content for the Complex Model. 



1. Change to High End of Oxygen Valid Range 


The high end of the valid range limit for oxygen in both 
the Simple and Complex Models was based on the maximum amount of 
oxygen that an oxygenated fuel was expected to lawfully contain. 
Of all the oxygenates that will likely be used in the 
reformulated gasoline program, ethanol has the highest oxygen 
content at 0.35 grams of oxygen per gram of ethanol. The Agency 
used this value as a benchmark in determining the high end of the 
valid range for oxygen, assuming a 10 volume percent ethanol 
blend. However, since promulgation of the final rule, the Agency 
has learned that density variations in gasoline blendstocks may 
result in wide variations in the oxygen content of an oxygenated 
fuel on a weight percent basis despite the fact that the volume 
percent remains fixed. For instance, blending 10 volume percent 
ethanol into a higher density gasoline could produce a blend with 
an oxygen content as low as 3.4 weight percent, while blending 10 
volume percent ethanol into a lower density gasoline could 
produce a blend with an oxygen content as high as 4.0 weight 
percent. 
Since the largest excise tax exemption available to refiners 
for the use of ethanol in gasoline blends is for oxygenated fuels 
that contain 10 volume percent, many ethanol blends will contain 
10 volume percent ethanol. Thus it is essential that the high 
end of the valid range for both the Simple and Complex Models be 
raised to 4.0 weight percent. This change will allow fuels which 
are already being produced to be evaluated with the Simple and 
Complex Models. The change will also guarantee that no fuel 
oxygenated with ethanol will be excluded from the reformulated 
gasoline program due to an oxygen content that is outside the 
range of the model, as long as it complies with the volume limits 
applicable in a waiver issued under section 211(f) of the Clean 
Air Act. Since fuels with oxygen contents of 4.0 weight percent 
are already being produced, the change will have no additional 
impact on vehicle driveability. Also, since the models continue 
to be accurate between 3.5 and 4.0 weight percent, and the 
emission standards are not being changed, this change to the high 
end of the valid range for oxygen content will have no adverse 
impact on the environment.

2. Change to Low End of RVP Valid Range in the Simple Model 


The low end of the valid range for RVP in the Simple Model 
was based on the distribution of data used in the model's 
development, as well as a consideration of the needs of the 
reformulated gasoline and anti-dumping programs under the Simple 
Model. Since VOC emission reductions under the Simple Model are 
accomplished primarily through limits on maximum RVP levels, the 
valid range for RVP in the Simple Model only affects toxics 
compliance calculations. In promulgating the final regulations, 
the Agency determined that refiners had no incentive to reduce 
RVP below 6.6 psi for the purposes of complying with the toxics 
standards since reductions in fuel benzene and aromatics are much 
more effective in reducing emissions of toxic compounds. 
In contrast to the Simple Model, the absence of RVP caps and 
the impact of other fuel parameters on emissions under the 
Complex Model will likely result in large variations in RVP 
levels in reformulated gasoline. RVP control will continue to be 
the primary mechanism through which VOC emissions are reduced 
because RVP is the most cost-effective fuel parameter to control, 
and because the RVP effect on VOC in the Complex Model is quite 
large. As in the Simple Model, the valid range for RVP in the 
Complex Model was determined from an examination of the 
distribution of data used in the model's development and the 
needs of the reformulated gasoline and anti-dumping programs. 
The low end of the valid range was set at 6.4 psi to accommodate 
large reductions in RVP while maintaining the accuracy of the 
Complex Model. Fuel RVPs are expected to reach this low level in 
Phase II of the reformulated gasoline program, and the potential 
exists for them to be reached in Phase I as well. 
California has been developing its own program in which 
reformulated gasoline must meet more stringent requirements than 
in the federal program during the years 1996 and 1997 that the 
Simple Model will be in effect. Given California's more 
stringent requirements, the potential exists for fuel having an 
RVP of less than 6.6 psi to be either sold or used as a 
blendstock in and outside of California. With the low end of the 
valid range for RVP set at 6.6 psi, these California reformulated 
gasolines might not be certifiable as federal reformulated 
gasoline. Also, refiners trying to blend down tanks quickly at 
terminals in the spring to meet summer volatility requirements 
may end up with fuels that have RVPs as low as 6.4 psi. 
Since the low end of the valid range for RVP under the 
Complex Model is 6.4 psi, the Agency has determined that the low 
end of the valid range for RVP under the Simple Model should 
likewise be 6.4 psi. The change from 6.6 psi to 6.4 psi makes 
the low end of the valid range for RVP consistent throughout 
Phase I of the federal reformulated gasoline program, and 
provides an additional element of flexibility for refiners to 
complement the already established blending and enforcement 
tolerances. The change should have no effect on the environment, 
since presumably only cleaner fuels would be allowed 
certification under the Simple Model. Both the Simple and 
Complex Models are linear with respect to RVP for all pollutants, 
and this linear relationship would simply be extended from 6.6 
psi down to 6.4 psi. 


3. Change to High End of Aromatics Valid Range in the Simple 
Model 


It was and is the intention of the Agency to avoid, to the 
extent possible, establishing regulations which require refiners 
to reformulate their conventional fuels. The anti-dumping 
program is designed to ensure that a refiner's or importer's 
conventional gasoline stays as clean as it was in 1990, and does 
not require reformulation beyond those levels. Thus the valid 
range limits for conventional gasoline in both the Simple and 
Complex Models were designed to be as wide as possible while 
simultaneously ensuring the accuracy of the models. As an 
additional level of flexibility, the Agency also allowed for the 
extension of the valid range for conventional gasoline if a 
refiner's individual 1990 baseline fuel exceeded the specified 
valid range limits (see discussion in Section II.B. below).

<PARENT> FR940720-0-00006 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Since promulgation of the final regulations for the anti-dumping program, the Agency has determined that the valid
range 
limits in the Simple Model for aromatics, which are more 
restrictive than those for conventional gasoline under the 
Complex Model, could be widened without any detrimental impacts 
on either the program or on the environment. Without such a 
change to the regulations, refiners may be forced to make changes 
to their refineries by 1995 that are not necessary in 1998 when 
compliance under the Complex Model is mandatory. Thus the Agency 
is changing the high end of the valid range for aromatics under 
the Simple Model from 45 volume percent to 55 volume percent. 
This change will ensure that the Simple Model can be used for as 
many conventional fuels as possible to show compliance under the 
anti-dumping program without the need to extend the valid range. 
The environment will not be adversely impacted since it was the 
Agency's intent to allow extensions of the valid range when a 
refiner's 1990 baseline fuel exceeded the specified valid range 
limits. The change will not affect RFG compliance, since 
aromatics are controlled by the reformulated gasoline standards 
for toxics. Driveability will not be affected since fuels with 
aromatics levels as high as 55 volume percent currently exist in-use. Also, consistency in the high end of the valid
range limits 
for aromatics will be maintained throughout Phase I of the 
program. Because the relationship between toxic emissions and 
fuel aromatics levels is linear in the Simple Model, the change 
will not result in an inaccurate application of the model to 
higher aromatics levels. 


4. Change to Low End of Aromatics Valid Range in the Simple 
Model 


The Agency has also determined that the low end of the valid 
range for aromatics in the Simple Model may not provide refiners 
with adequate flexibility under the reformulated gasoline 
program. For the Complex Model, the Agency determined that the 
relationships between aromatics and emissions could not be 
trusted at levels below 10 volume percent. However, the Agency 
determined that a flat-line extrapolation below 10 volume 
percent, in which no emission benefits or detriments result from 
lowering aromatics values below 10 volume percent, would provide 
greater flexibility without compromising the accuracy of the 
Complex Model equations in this range. Since promulgation of the 
final rule, the Agency has determined that the Complex Model 
approach to low values of aromatics can be appropriately applied 
to the Simple Model as well. Therefore, the Agency is changing 
the low end of the valid range for aromatics under the Simple 
Model from 10 volume percent to 0 volume percent, but will not 
allow any emission benefits in this range. The Agency did not 
intend to discourage the production of fuels that had very low 
levels of aromatics, and were, thus, qualitatively considered to 
be cleaner burning. If the low end of the valid range for 
aromatics is left at 10 volume percent, fuels with aromatics 
values of less than 10 volume percent that would otherwise be 
complying reformulated gasolines under the Simple Model will not 
be certifiable, despite the fact that those same fuels may be 
certifiable under the Complex Model. This change is expected to 
be environmentally benign, as few refiners will have any 
incentive to reduce aromatics below 10 volume percent for 
reformulated gasoline under the Simple Model. 


5. Change to High End of Benzene Valid Range in the Simple 
Model 


As stated in Section II.A.3, it was and is the intention of 
the Agency, to the extent possible, not to establish regulations 
that require the reformulation of conventional gasoline under the 
anti-dumping program. However, the valid range limits for 
benzene under the Simple Model may in fact force refiners to 
reformulate conventional gasoline. The Agency has determined 
that the valid range limits in the Simple Model for benzene, 
which are more restrictive than those for conventional 
gasoline under the Complex Model, can be widened without any 
detrimental impacts. Without such a change to the regulations, 
refiners may be forced to make changes to their refineries by 
1995 that are not necessary in 1998 when compliance under the 
Complex Model is mandatory. Thus the Agency is changing the high 
end of the valid range for benzene under the Simple Model from 
2.5 volume percent to 4.9 volume percent. This change ensures 
that the Simple Model can be used for as many conventional fuels 
as possible to show compliance under the anti-dumping program 
without the need to extend the valid range. The change will not 
affect RFG compliance, since benzene is controlled by the 
reformulated gasoline standards for fuel benzene content. In 
like manner to raising the high end of the valid range for 
aromatics, consistency in the valid range limits will be 
maintained throughout Phase I of the program. The environment 
will not be adversely impacted since it was the Agency's intent 
to allow extensions of the valid range when a refiner's 1990 
baseline fuel exceeded the specified valid range limits. As for 
aromatics, because the relationship between toxic emissions and 
fuel benzene levels is linear in the Simple Model, the change 
will not result in an inaccurate application of the model to 
higher benzene levels.

B. Extending the Valid Range for Conventional Gasoline 


Under the anti-dumping provisions of the final rule, 
refiners use their individual 1990 baselines to determine 
compliance with the regulations under both the Simple and Complex 
Models. Depending on the compliance model being used, the values 
for particular fuel parameters are restricted by the valid range 
limits. For instance, if a refiner is using the Simple Model to 
comply with the anti-dumping regulations, VOC and NO

X

 emissions 
are regulated through caps on the baseline levels of sulfur, 
olefins, and T90, while toxic emissions are regulated through an 
equation giving the benzene fraction of VOC emissions. Since the 
benzene fraction equation contains only benzene and aromatics as 
independent variables, the only valid range limits that apply to 
refiners using the Simple Model to comply with the anti-dumping 
regulations are those specified in  80.42(c)(1) for benzene and 
aromatics content. If, alternatively, a refiner is using the 
Complex Model to comply with the anti-dumping regulations, NO

X

 
and toxics emissions are regulated through the Complex Model. 
Thus the valid range limits that apply to refiners using the 
Complex Model to comply with the anti-dumping regulations are 
those specified in  80.45(f)(1)(ii) for oxygen content, sulfur 
content, RVP, E200, E300, aromatics content, olefins content, and 
benzene content. 
Section 80.91(f)(2)(ii) allows a refiner to extend the 
conventional gasoline valid range for the Complex Model if one or 
more of the fuel parameter values for its individual 1990 
baseline fuel falls outside of the valid range specified in 
 80.45(f)(1)(ii). However, the regulations did not adequately 
specify the method, applicability, or limitations of such a valid 
range extension. As written, the regulations state that, for 
each baseline fuel parameter value which is outside of the 
Complex Model conventional gasoline valid range, the Complex 
Model valid range is extended only for such fuel parameters. The 
only stated limitation is that such an extension is applicable 
only to the applicable summer or winter season. The Agency has 
determined that this portion of the regulations is ambiguous, and 
requires revision. 


1. Applicability of the Provision for Valid Range Extension 



The Agency has only been made aware of the potential need 
for extension of the valid range for olefins, aromatics, and 
benzene. Therefore, a provision for the extension of the valid 
range has only been made for the high end of the specified valid 
range for these three fuel parameters. In each case, if the valid 
range limit is extended, the refiner in question must still be 
limited by a valid range to eliminate the possibility that the 
Complex Model will be used for aromatics, olefins, and/or benzene 
values that are very high, which might compromise the primary 
objective of the anti-dumping program. As specified in the final 
regulations, a refiner is allowed to extend the Complex Model 
valid range for both baseline and compliance emissions 
calculations, but is not directed as to the specification of any 
new valid range limits. Such a provision for the extension of 
the valid range that does not include limitations on fuel 
parameter values that can be evaluated with the Complex Model 
would defeat the purposes of specifying a valid range, and was 
not the Agency's intent. 
The Agency has determined that the best approach to limiting 
the extension of the valid range is to allow target fuels to have 
values at least up to the baseline level. Since the baseline 
fuel is an ``average'' fuel of sorts, the Agency has also 
determined that refiners should be given some flexibility beyond 
the baseline value. For aromatics, this flexibility will be 
fixed at a value of 5.0 volume percent. For olefins this 
flexibility will be fixed at a value of 3.0 volume percent. And 
for benzene this flexibility will be fixed at a value of 0.5 
volume percent. Thus, for example, the extended valid range 
limit for aromatics would be equal to the individual refiner's 
baseline fuel value for aromatics, plus 5.0 volume percent. A 
similar calculation would be necessary for extending the valid 
range for olefins or benzene. 
The Agency has no reason to believe that provisions for the 
extension of the valid range for fuel parameters other than 
aromatics, olefins, and benzene on either the low or high ends 
are necessary. For instance, the Complex Model conventional 
gasoline valid ranges for oxygen, sulfur, aromatics, olefins, and 
benzene all have 0.0 as their lower limit. Thus no valid range 
extension would be required on the low end of the valid range for 
these fuel parameters. Similarly for E300, a fuel can have an 
E300 value of no higher than 100 percent, which is also the high 
end of the specified valid range. Other limitations, such as 
ASTM specifications and the volatility rule, should eliminate the 
need for valid range extensions in other cases. 


2. No-Benefit Limitation of the Provision for Valid Range 
Extension 


The Agency continues to believe that the valid range limits 
specified in  80.42(c)(1) and  80.45(f)(1)(ii) identify the fuel 
parameter values beyond which the compliance models are not 
considered accurate. Thus the Agency has determined that any 
extension of the specified valid ranges for conventional gasoline 
should incorporate flat-line extrapolation. Under flat-line 
extrapolation, the compliance models provide no emissions benefit 
or detriment when raising the value of either aromatics or 
olefins above the values specified in  80.42(c)(1) and 
 80.45(f)(1)(ii). This flat-line extrapolation will apply to 
both the baseline fuel and any target fuels evaluated with the 
compliance models under the anti-dumping regulations. 


3. Expanding the Applicability of the Valid Range Extension 
Provision to the Simple Model 


This direct final rule expands the applicability of the 
valid range extension provision given in  80.91(f)(2)(ii) to the 
Simple Model. However, as noted above, the only fuel parameters 
having valid range limits under the Simple Model anti-dumping 
regulations are aromatics and benzene content. The Simple Model 
valid ranges for both aromatics and benzene are being expanded to 
be equal to the corresponding ranges for the Complex Model, as 
described in sections II.A.3-5 of this rule. Thus the new valid 
range under the Simple Model will be 0-55 volume percent for 
aromatics and 0-4.9 volume percent for benzene. No valid range 
extension will be required for either of these fuel parameters on 
the low end of the valid range. Thus the only relevant valid 
range extensions that would be necessary for the Simple Model 
would be for the high end of aromatics and the high end of 
benzene.

III. Complex Model 


The Complex Model includes separate calculations for exhaust and nonexhaust emissions. The final regulations contained

errors in the model descriptions for both exhaust and nonexhaust. 
The errors in the exhaust portion of the Complex Model were 
limited to the linear extrapolation methodology, while the errors 
in the nonexhaust portion arose in the VOC equations themselves. 
Another error also arose in the calculation procedure for annual 
average toxics. Each of these errors and the associated 
corrections will be discussed in detail below. 



A. Extrapolation 



The exhaust portion of the Complex Model is a statistically-derived set of equations relating fuel parameters to
emissions of VOC, NO

X

, benzene, 1,3-butadiene, acetaldehyde, formaldehyde, and POM. The Agency determined the conditions under which
these exhaust equations must be linearly extrapolated based on the ranges for each fuel parameter within which the
equations were considered to be accurate. Linear extrapolation amounts to fixing the slope of the fuel parameter:emission
relationship at a constant value. It is used to extend the equations beyond the limits of the data on which they are based,
thereby making the reformulated gasoline and anti-dumping programs as flexible as possible. 

Of the six separate models in the exhaust portion of the 
Complex Model, all four toxic models are linear, and thus do not 
require linear extrapolation. Paragraph (c)(1)(iv) of  80.45 
specifies the conditions and limitations of linear extrapolation 
for VOC, while  80.45(d)(1)(iv) specifies the conditions and 
limitations of linear extrapolation for NO

X

. The details of the 
linear extrapolation methodology included in these two portions 
of the final regulations contained a number of errors which 
require correction. 



1. Correct Parenthetical Form of Extrapolation Equations 



In paragraphs (c)(1)(iv)(B) and (d)(1)(iv)(B) of  80.45, the 
linear extrapolation equations contained too many brackets in 
some regions of the equations, and missing parentheses in other 
regions. Although these inadvertent omissions and insertions did 
not change the mathematical nature of the equations, a literal 
copying of the equations into computer code would result in an 
error. Thus the Agency has corrected the linear extrapolation 
equations for both VOC and NO

X

 to contain the correct number of 
parentheses and brackets in the correct position and order. 



2. Correct Missing Sulfur Term in NO

X

 Extrapolation Equation 



A sulfur term was inadvertently left out of both the Phase I 
and Phase II NO

X

 extrapolation equations given in paragraph 
(d)(1)(iv)(B) of  80.45. This missing sulfur term represents the 
linear extrapolation of the NO

X

 model with respect to sulfur for 
high emitters. This correction will have a negligible impact on 
the emission performance estimates provided by the Complex Model 
because the NO

X

 equation for high emitters is essentially linear 
with respect to sulfur.
 The inclusion of the correct sulfur 
term in the NO

X

 extrapolation equation will result in the correct 
application of the edge target fuel to the NO

X

 extrapolation 
equations. 






3. Clarify E300 Extrapolation Above 95 Percent 



In the process of determining the valid range limits for the 
use of the Complex Model for both reformulated and conventional 
gasoline, the Agency determined that the emission changes 
estimated by the exhaust equations were not accurate above an 
E300 value of 95 percent. However, comments received from the 
refining industry indicated a need for an E300 valid range that 
extended up to 100 percent. The Agency concluded that, although 
the exhaust equation emission change estimates could not be 
considered accurate above an E300 level of 95 percent, allowing 
only a zero change in emissions above this E300 level would 
ensure that refiners could not receive inappropriate benefits for 
fuels with very high E300 levels. Therefore, the Agency allowed 
for flat-line extrapolations of all exhaust equations between the 
E300 values of 95 and 100 percent. However, some portions of the 
regulations that specified this allowance contained typographical 
errors which substantially changed the manner in which this flat-
line extrapolation for E300 was to be executed. Specifically, 
paragraphs (c)(1)(iv)(C)(

5

), (c)(1)(iv)(D)(

5

), and 
(d)(1)(iv)(C)(

5

) of  80.45 all indicated that the E300 value of 
the 

edge 

target fuel should be held constant at 95 volume percent 
for target fuels having an E300 value of greater than 95 volume 
percent. These paragraphs should not have refered to the 

edge

 
target fuel, but rather to the 

target

 fuel for the purposes of 
determining emissions performances with the Complex Model. These 
three paragraphs are thus changed accordingly.

4. Correct Value of 

D

ARO 







The regulations describing the linear extrapolation 
methodology for exhaust VOC and NO

X

 contained two other 
typographical errors that nevertheless were substantial in their 
effects. The first arose in paragraphs (c)(1)(iv)(C)(

9

), 
(c)(1)(iv)(D)(

9

), and (d)(1)(iv)(C)(

9

) of  80.45 in the 
specification of the value of 

D

ARO. The value of 

D

ARO should 
generally be set equal to (

D

ARO_18 volume percent) for any 
target fuel having an aromatics content of less than 18 volume 
percent. Thus 

D

ARO will be negative when the VOC or NO

X

 equation 
is linearly extrapolated with respect to aromatics at the low end 
of the valid range. However, for target fuels having an 
aromatics content of less than 10 volume percent, the VOC 
extrapolation should be flat-line instead of linear. In this 
case, 

D

ARO should be fixed at a value of ^8 volume percent. The 
value in the regulations was given incorrectly as +8 volume 
percent. 


5. Correct Specification of 

D

E300 



The second typographical error that requires explanation and 
correction involves the specification of 

D

E300 in paragraphs 
(c)(1)(iv)(C)(

13

) and (c)(1)(iv)(D)(

13

). The first sentence in 
each of these two paragraphs contains two conditions that must be 
met for 

D

E300 to be set equal to (E300_94 percent). The first 
condition incorrectly states that the E300 level of the target 
fuel must be 

less 

than 94 percent, when in fact the condition 
should state that the E300 level of the target fuel must be 


greater 

than 94 percent. The remainder of both of these 
paragraphs is correct. 



6. Eliminate References to E300 in NO

X

 Extrapolation 



Finally, the linear extrapolation methodology for NO

X

 in the 
final rule contained references to the allowable range for E300, 
despite the fact that the NOx equation is not extrapolated with 
respect to E300. Thus all references to E300 in paragraphs 
(d)(1)(iv)(A) and (d)(1)(iv)(B) are removed by this direct final 
rule. Note that, since all exhaust equations in the Complex 
Model are flat-line extrapolated for E300 values greater than 95 
percent, the flat-line extrapolation for E300 specified in 
paragraph (d)(1)(iv)(C)(5) is correct (except for the changes 
described above).



B. Nonexhaust Model 



The equations giving nonexhaust VOC as a function of RVP for 
the Complex Model were originally proposed in the February 1993 
NPRM (58 FR 17175). No changes to those equations were intended 
for the final rule on reformulated gasoline. However, 
typographical errors arose in a number of the coefficients in the 
nonexhaust VOC model when they were entered into the final 
regulations. These errors would have a small, but not 
insignificant impact on the VOC emission performances provided by 
the Complex Model. 

The errors in the nonexhaust VOC portion of the Complex 
Model lay in four places. The first was in the sign of the 
coefficient for RVP in the Phase I running loss equation for 
Region 1. The second was in the coefficient for RVP in the Phase 
II hot soak equation for Region 1. The third was in the 
coefficient for RVP in the Phase II refueling loss equation for 
Region 1. And the fourth was in the sign of the RVP coefficient 
for the Phase II running loss equation for Region 2. All the 
coefficients in the nonexhaust model have been returned to their 
proper values and signs by this direct final rule. 



C. Annual Average Calculations 



Since the averaging standards for toxics under the Complex 
Model are year-round standards, each refiner who is complying 
under an averaging scenario must determine the average year-round 
toxics emissions performance for the fuels that it sold during a 
given year. Each batch of fuel is uniquely associated with toxic 
emissions as estimated by the Complex Model. Thus refiners 
require a method for combining per batch emission performances 
into a single year-round value. The regulations provided two 
contradictory methods for combining per batch emission 
performances into such a single year-round value. 

Paragraph (g) 

et al.

 of  80.67 directs refiners to weight the 
emission performances by batch volume and then add them in order 
to determine a year-round value. In calculating emission 
performances with the Complex Model, fuels sold in the winter are 
evaluated with the winter model, while fuels sold in the summer 
are evaluated with the summer model. Thus this ``volume-weighted'' 
approach to determining year-round values correctly leads to an 
average toxic emissions value for the year. 

Paragraph (e)(3) of  80.45 incorrectly directs refiners to 
weight summer and winter toxic emissions by fixed values to 
obtain year-round averages. Under this portion of the 
regulations, summer batches of fuel would be individually 
weighted by their batch volumes to obtain average summer emission 
performance estimates. Likewise winter batches would be weighted 
by their batch volumes to obtain average winter emission 
performance estimates. However, the fixed weighting of summer 
and winter emission estimates for the purposes of determining a 
year-round value would not necessarily mimic a refiner's true 
ratio of summer to winter fuel. The fixed weightings given in 
paragraph (e)(3) were used to determine the performance 
standards, and are not relevant to determining compliance by 
individual refiners. Therefore, paragraph (e)(3) will be revised 
to refer to  80.67(g), and paragraphs (e)(3)(i) and (e)(3)(ii) of 
 80.45 will be removed. 



IV. Enforcement Corrections and Clarifications 



The following section contains corrections and 
clarifications to the enforcement portions of the final 
reformulated gasoline and anti-dumping regulations that were 
published on February 16, 1994 (59 FR 7716), and to enforcement 
portions of the preamble of the notice of final rulemaking.
 The reasons for the changes are listed below. 





A. Reformulated Gasoline Regulation (40 CFR Part 80, Subpart D)

1. Measurement of Reformulated Gasoline Fuel Parameters 
( 80.46) 


The table of aromatic compounds in  80.46(f)(1)(ii)(K) is 
being revised. The aromatic compounds listed in the final rule 
are those used by EPA during the development of the analytical 
method for the rulemaking. In this notice some compounds that no 
longer are available commercially have been deleted from the 
list, and several aromatic compounds that are found in commercial 
gasolines and are available commercially to make reference 
materials have been added to the list. Only materials of known 
purity or those specified as 99% pure or greater should be used 
as calibration standards. 
The number of calibration levels should be sufficient to 
bracket the expected concentration of each compound. Two 
calibration levels were used in the initial evaluation of the 
test method. In the future, however, EPA probably will use five 
calibration levels with at least three internal standards used in 
the standards and samples in order to improve precision. 
Initially EPA prepared standards by volume. Currently, 
however, EPA prepares standards, samples, and internal standards 
by weight. Conversion to volume percent is performed by using 
the density of the aromatic compound in question. Standards for 
gasoline that are prepared by weight are considered to be more 
accurate than standards that are prepared by volume. 
Neither the use of five calibration levels, nor the 
preparation of standards by weight, should be viewed as changes 
to the regulations, but rather as Agency recommendations intended 
to improve precision. 


2. General Requirements for Refiners, Importers and Oxygenate 
Blenders ( 80.65) 



a. 

Designation of Gasoline as Oxygenated Fuels Program 
Reformulated Gasoline (OPRG) or Non-OPRG.

 
Section 80.65(d)(2)(iii) is revised in order to clarify the 
categories of gasoline that may be designated as oxygenated fuels 
program reformulated gasoline, or OPRG. The final rule, at 
 80.65(d)(2)(iii), specifies that reformulated gasoline must be 
designated as OPRG, or not OPRG, to provide a mechanism to ensure 
reformulated gasoline outside of oxygenated fuels control areas 
during oxygenated fuels control periods has at least the 2.0 
weight percent oxygen content mandated by the Clean Air Act.

 The final rule requires parties who meet the oxygen standard on 
average to meet the oxygen standard separately for gasoline not 
designated as OPRG. If OPRG and non-OPRG gasoline could be 
averaged together for oxygen purposes, the gasoline in the OPRG 
areas_where 2.7 weight percent oxygen is required during the 
oxygenated fuels control period_could be used to offset gasoline 
with 1.5 weight percent oxygen intended for use in non-OPRG 
areas. 




Today's revision consists of two parts. First, the 
regulation is clarified to make specific that the OPRG/non-OPRG 
designation applies only to reformulated gasoline and not to 
RBOB. The final rule requires RBOB to be designated as OPRG or 
non-OPRG, but the OPRG designation for RBOB serves no purpose 
because RBOB does not become reformulated gasoline until 
oxygenate has been added. The final rule is unchanged regarding 
oxygenate blender responsibilities_oxygenate blenders who 
produce reformulated gasoline by combining RBOB with oxygenate 
are required to designate the gasoline as OPRG or non-OPRG, and 
to meet the oxygen standard separately for gasoline not 
designated as OPRG. 
The second change regarding OPRG-designated gasoline is the 
addition of a new provision, at  80.65(d)(2)(iii)(B), to clarify 
that reformulated gasoline that contains at least 2.0 weight 
percent oxygen may be designated as OPRG regardless of whether or 
not the gasoline is used in an oxygenated fuels program control 
area during an oxygenated fuels program control period. This 
change allows terminals that serve both oxygenated fuels areas 
and non-oxygenated fuels areas to stock a single reformulated 
gasoline that could be used in both areas, instead of having to 
stock both OPRG and non-OPRG designated reformulated gasoline. 
This change also allows all reformulated gasoline that meets the 
2.0 weight percent oxygen per-gallon standard to be designated as 
OPRG, without such gasoline being restricted to use in oxygenated 
fuel areas during oxygenated fuel control periods. 
A terminal thus could stock reformulated gasoline that 
contains 2.7 weight percent oxygen and, therefore, that meets the 
oxygenated fuels oxygen requirement, and deliver this gasoline 
into both OPRG and non-OPRG markets. A terminal also could stock 
reformulated gasoline that contains 2.0 weight percent oxygen for 
delivery into both OPRG and non-OPRG markets, and splash blend 
additional oxygenate with those batches of gasoline that are 
delivered into the oxygenated fuel area during the oxygenated 
fuel control period.

<DOCNO> FR940720-0-00073 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940720-0-00006 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

This change, however, keeps intact the regulatory mechanism 
for ensuring non-OPRG areas receive reformulated gasoline that 
contains at least 2.0 weight percent oxygen. Any reformulated 
gasoline used outside an oxygenated fuels control area during an 
oxygenated fuels control period that contains less than 2.0 
weight percent oxygen (and therefore must be designated as non-
OPRG) must be offset with other non-OPRG reformulated gasoline 
that contains more than 2.0 weight percent oxygen, such that the 
average oxygen content of the non-OPRG gasoline is greater than 
or equal to the 2.1 weight percent average standard. 
b. 

Designation of Complex Model Gasoline as Meeting NO

X

 


Standard on Per-Gallon or Average Basis. 

Section 80.65(d)(2)(v)(B) is revised in order to clarify 
that refiners and importers are required to specify whether the 
NO

X

 standard is being met on a per-gallon basis or on average 
only for gasoline certified under the complex model. There is no 
separate NO

X

 standard under the simple model. 
c. 

Designation of Reformulated Gasoline Blendstock for 
Downstream Oxygenate Blending (RBOB). 

Section 80.65(d)(2)(vi) is being revised in order to clarify 
that refiners and importers have three options regarding the 
designation of reformulated gasoline blendstock for downstream 
oxygenate blending (or RBOB). A refiner or importer has three 
options for the types of RBOB that may be produced or imported: 
as suitable for blending with any oxygenate, with ether only, or 
with a refiner- or importer-specified oxygenate type and amount. 
The gasoline designation requirements at  80.65(d)(2)(vi) as 
promulgated in the final rule did not include the refiner- or 
importer-specified oxygenate option for RBOB, making this 
provision inconsistent with the downstream oxygenate provisions 
at  80.69(a) that specifies the RBOB options and includes the refiner- or importer-specified option, and the
product transfer document 
requirements for RBOB at  80.77(i)(2) that includes all three 
options. In order to correct this inconsistency, today's 
revision adds the refiner- or importer-specified option to the 
RBOB designation requirement. 
d. 

Assignment of Batch Numbers. 

Section 80.65(d)(3) requires refiners and importers to 
assign a unique number to each batch of reformulated gasoline 
that is produced or imported, and this section includes an 
example of such a batch number. The numbers contained in the 
example are being modified to reflect the correct number of 
digits for the portion of the batch number that states the EPA-
assigned facility registration number (five digits) and the 
sequential batch number (six digits). 
e. 

Computer-Controlled In-Line Blending Exemption. 

Section 80.65(e)(1) requires each refiner or importer to 
obtain test results for each batch of reformulated gasoline prior 
to the gasoline leaving the refinery or import facility. 
Refiners who produce reformulated gasoline using a computer-
controlled in-line blending process in which the gasoline is 
blended directly to a pipeline, however, will not have the test 
results for the ``batch'' prior to the release of at least some, if 
not all, of the gasoline. To correct the incompatibility between 
this requirement and the nature of the computer-controlled in-line blending process, the  80.65(f)(4) exemption
from independent sampling and testing for refiners that produce reformulated gasoline using computer-controlled
in-line blending equipment is expanded to include an exemption from the  80.65(e)(1) requirement that refiners
have test results for each batch prior to the gasoline leaving the refinery. 
f. 

Release of Reformulated Gasoline Certified Under Simple 
Model as Not VOC-Controlled. 

Section 80.65(e)(1) is also revised in order to clarify that 
reformulated gasoline certified under the simple model that is 
not VOC-controlled may be released from the refinery or import 
facility after the refiner or importer has test results for 
oxygen and benzene only. The final rule requires refiners and 
importers to have RVP test results in hand prior to release of 
all simple model-certified reformulated gasoline, but the RVP 
standard applies under the simple model only to VOC-controlled 
gasoline.

g. 

List of Reformulated Gasoline Properties to be Established 
by Testing.

 Section 80.65(e)(2)(i) contains a list of reformulated 
gasoline properties that must be established by testing. This 
list in the final rule includes 50% distillation (T-50) and 90% 
distillation (T-90) (the temperatures in degrees F at which 50% 
and 90% of a liquid are evaporated). This list is being revised 
to add terms for E200 and E300 (the percent of a liquid that are 
evaporated at 200 and 300 degrees F). E200 and E300 are 
correlated with T-50 and T-90, and may be approximated from T-50 
and T-90 measurements using conversion equations. The most 
accurate way of determining the E200 and E-300 of gasoline, 
however, is using ASTM-86-90, the distillation test method 
specified at  80.46(d). As a result, the list of mandatory 
testing is being expanded to include the E-200 and E-300 terms. 

This expansion does not constitute a change from the 
mandatory testing requirements for reformulated gasoline, because 
the E200 and E300 terms are established as part of the ASTM-86-90 
distillation test that already is required. The correlation 
ranges for E-200 and E-300, 2.5 vol% and 3.5 vol% respectively, 
that are included in the  80.65(e)(2)(i) table are the 
reproducibility figures for these terms from the ASTM test, and 
are comparable to the five degrees F correlation range provided 
for the T-50 and T-90 terms. 

h. 

Reconciliation of Test Results. 


Section 80.65(e)(2)(ii)(A) is being revised to clarify one 
option for reconciling reformulated gasoline test results from a 
refiner's or importer's laboratory as compared with test results 
from an independent laboratory. Under this option, where the 
refiner's or importer's test result for any parameter is not 
confirmed, the refiner or importer would use the result for that 
parameter that is the ``worst case'' for the refiner or importer 
(``best case'' for the environment). Under this option in the 
final rule, the smaller of the two results for oxygenates is used 
for calculating all standards except RVP. 

This option is being revised to refer to oxygenates as a 
class without separately naming each oxygenate. This change will 
keep the option from becoming dated if any new oxygenates are 
used in reformulated gasoline. The option also is being revised 
to eliminate the larger oxygenate volume assumption in the case 
of RVP, because RVP is a parameter that is measured directly. 
Any oxygenate effect on RVP will be measured in the RVP test and 
would not be changed by a calculation using the ``worst case'' 
oxygenate level. 

i. 

Attest Engagement Requirement. 


Section 80.65(h) is being revised to specify that the attest 
engagement requirement applies to oxygenate blenders who meet the 
oxygen standard on average, and not to oxygenate blenders who 
meet the oxygen standard on a per-gallon basis. This change 
conforms  80.65(h) with  80.69(b)(4) which limits the attest 
engagement requirement to oxygenate blenders who average. 



3. Compliance Surveys ( 80.68) 



Section 80.68(c)(13) is being revised to clarify when VOC 
and NO

X 

emissions reduction calculations must be reported to EPA 
by the surveyor under the gasoline quality survey requirements.
 
VOC emissions reduction calculations must be reported only for 
surveys during June 1 through September 15 of each year, 
including simple model surveys where a specified simple model VOC 
emissions reduction equation is cross-referenced. NO

X 

 emission 
reduction calculations must be reported for all complex model 
surveys before January 1, 2000, and beginning on January 1, 2000 
for surveys outside the period June 1 through September 15. NO

X 

 
surveys are not required during June 1 through September 15 under 
Phase II (beginning on January 1, 2000) because the Clean Air 
Act's restriction on NO

X 

 increases is satisfied through the NO

X 

 reductions required for VOC-controlled reformulated gasoline 
under Phase II. The rationale for this approach for NO

X 

surveys 
is discussed at 59 FR 7773 (February 16, 1994). 





4. Covered Areas ( 80.70) 



a. 

Putnam and Orange Counties, New York. 

In order to correct an oversight in the final rule, 
 80.70(d)(3) is being amended to include Putnam and Orange 
Counties, New York, as part of the New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island-Connecticut ``covered area.'' These
counties are part 
of the New York City CMSA and are thus appropriately part of the 
New York City reformulated gasoline covered area. See 57 FR 
13444 (April 16, 1992). Putnam and Orange Counties are also 
included in the New York City CMSA for purposes of the oxygenated 
fuels program requirements.

Bullitt and Oldham Counties, Kentucky. 

Section 80.70(j) is being amended to specify the applicable 
boundaries for the portions of Bullitt and Oldham Counties, 
Kentucky, that are nonattainment areas. 

c. 

Essex County, New York.

 The listing of Essex County, New York, is also being amended 
to include a specific description of the nonattainment area. 

d. 

Smyth County, Virginia. 

Section 80.70(j) is also being amended to delete Smyth 
County, Virginia, as a covered area for the reformulated gasoline 
program. This area was expressly excluded from coverage in the 
Governor's opt-in request and should not have been included in 
the regulatory list of covered areas. 

e. 

Richmond, Virginia. 

An erroneous reference to the City of Richmond is also being 
corrected. 



5. Reporting Requirements ( 80.75) 




a. 

Sulfur, NO

X

 and T90 Averaging Reports 

Section 80.41(h)(2) of the final rule requires that refiners 
and importers subject to the simple model meet their 1990 
baseline sulfur, olefins and T90 levels on average for the entire 
year. However, it does not include a requirement to report the 
average values of these properties to EPA. It was the Agency's 
intention to have these values reported and so an additional 
reporting requirement for sulfur, olefins and T90 is being added 
at  80.75(b)(2). In addition, the RVP averaging reporting 
requirements are being renumbered, under  80.75(b)(1), so that 
the sulfur, olefin and T90 averaging reporting requirements may 
be included under  80.75(b). 

b. 

Oxygen Averaging Reports. 

Section 80.75(f)(2)(ii)(A) is being revised to conform the 
categories of reformulated gasoline that must be reported 
separately for oxygen averaging purposes to the categories that 
are specified in the oxygen averaging section, at 
 80.67(h)(1)(v)(A). 



6. Registration Requirements ( 80.76) 




The Agency is making several revisions to the registration 
requirements in  80.76(c) of the final rule. EPA is removing 
the requirement to indicate where off-site records are kept from 
the refiners', importers' and oxygenate blenders' registration 
information, and instead requiring that information be submitted 
for each refinery, oxygenate blending facility, and in the case 
of importers, operations within each PADD. The registration 
requirement to indicate what type of gasoline each refinery or 
oxygenate blending facility will produce (reformulated, RBOB, 
conventional or blendstocks) has been removed because the Agency 
believes that it is not necessary for registration purposes. The 
Agency intended that importers would identify the independent 
laboratories used to comply with the independent sampling and 
testing requirements, but there was no specific regulatory text 
requiring them to do so. This notice requires each importer to 
provide that information to EPA for its operations in each PADD.

a. 

Minimum and/or Maximum Standards. 

Section 80.77(g)(2), which requires that per-gallon minimum/maximums must be included in product transfer documents,

is being revised to clarify the categories of reformulated 
gasoline for which these values must be specified. Paragraphs 
(g)(2)(iii), (g)(2)(iv)(A), and (g)(2)(iv)(B) of  80.77 are 
being revised to specify that the RVP maximum and the VOC 
emissions performance minimum must be included only for VOC-
controlled reformulated gasoline, because these standards apply 
only to VOC-controlled gasoline. Paragraphs (g)(2)(iv)(A) and 
(g)(2)(iv)(B) of  80.77 also are being revised to specify that 
the NO

X

 minimum must be included only for reformulated gasoline 
certified using the complex model. There is no separate NO

X

 
standard under the simple model. 



b. 

VOC-Controlled Gasoline That Contains Ethanol. 

Section 80.77(g)(3) is being added to require that product 
transfer documents must identify any VOC-controlled reformulated 
gasoline that contains any ethanol as an ethanol-containing 
reformulated gasoline, so that downstream parties will have 
sufficient knowledge to avoid violation of the prohibition, at 
 80.78(a)(8), against combining VOC-controlled reformulated 
gasoline produced using ethanol with VOC-controlled reformulated 
gasoline produced using any other oxygenate during the period 
January 1 through September 15. 



c. 

Complex Model Gasoline Certified Prior to 1998. 

Section 80.77(h) is being revised to clarify that the 
product transfer document requirements related to gasoline 
certified using the complex model before January 1, 1998, apply 
to reformulated gasoline and RBOB. The final rule makes 
reference to ``gasoline'' and RBOB without specifying ``reformulated 
gasoline,'' which could have caused confusion. 




8. Controls and Prohibitions (Section 80.78) 





Section 80.78(a)(1)(v)(B) and (a)(1)(v)(C), concerning 
reformulated gasoline prohibited activities, are being revised to 
clarify that gasoline subject to the per-gallon RVP maximum must 
have an RVP that is less than or equal to this standard, and that 
gasoline subject to the VOC and NO

X

 emissions reduction minimum 
must have emissions reductions that are greater than or equal to 
these standards. The final rule describes these requirements 
only in terms of gasoline that is ``less than'' or ``greater than'' 
these standards, while gasoline that equals these standards also 
is in compliance. 




9. Enforcement Exemptions for California Gasoline ( 80.81) 





a. 

Definition of California Gasoline. 

The final rule was intended to extend the California 
enforcement exemptions to gasoline produced at refineries outside 
California that produce only California reformulated gasoline and 
federal conventional gasoline. See 59 FR 7759, col. 3 (February 
16, 1994). However, the regulatory definition of ``California 
gasoline'' could be read to exclude non-California refineries 
producing California reformulated gasoline from the enforcement 
exemptions. Therefore,  80.81(a)(2)(iii) is clarified to 
exclude from this definition only gasoline produced by non-California refineries that are also producing reformulated

gasoline for sale in covered areas outside California. 



b. 

Compliance Demonstration Submittal. 

Section 80.81(b)(4) requires refiners, importers, and 
oxygenate blenders to submit the compliance demonstration 
mandated by  80.81(b)(3) by May 31, 1996 ``along with reports 
required to be submitted under  80.75(a)(1).'' The quoted 
language is corrected to make clear that the compliance 
demonstration should accompany the report for the first quarter 
of 1996 due to be submitted on that date under  80.75(a)(1)(i).

c. 

Use of California Sampling and/or Testing Methodologies. 

Section 80.81(h) allows refiners and importers of California 
gasoline to use sampling and test methods that are set forth in 
the California reformulated gasoline regulations, in lieu of 
those methods prescribed under  80.46 for the federal 
reformulated gasoline program. This provision is being revised 
to clarify that these California-approved sampling and test 
methods may be used only with California gasoline, and that these 
methods may not be used to satisfy the sampling and testing 
requirements for reformulated or conventional gasoline that does 
not meet the definition of California gasoline. 




B. Anti-Dumping Regulations (40 CFR Part 80, Subpart E) 




1. Standards Applicable to Refiners and Importers ( 80.101) 





a. 

Compliance Baseline Formula. 

Section 80.101(f)(4) currently provides that refiners and 
importers who use an individual 1990 baseline, and who increase 
their gasoline production volume above a certain level, must 
calculate a compliance baseline for each averaging period. EPA 
has combined the separate formulas for ``V

eq

'' and ``CB

i

'' in 
 80.101(f)(4) into a single, simpler formula. 



In addition, EPA has specified that the denominator of the 
compliance baseline equation includes the volume of California 
gasoline. The final rule excluded the volume of California 
gasoline produced in 1995 and thereafter from the compliance 
baseline equation, but this exclusion rendered this equation 
invalid for refiners of California gasoline because the numerator 
of this equation includes gasoline produced for the California 
market in 1990. In order to constitute a valid comparison of the 
volume of gasoline produced in 1990 versus the volume produced in 
1995 and thereafter, both the numerator and the denominator of 
the compliance baseline equation must contain the volume of 
gasoline produced for the California market. This approach for 
including California gasoline in the compliance baseline equation 
is equivalent to the requirement that reformulated gasoline 
produced for use in covered areas outside the State of California 
must be included in the denominator of the compliance baseline 
equation. 



The definitions of the factors ``DB

i

,'' ``CB

i

,'' and ``B

i

,'' are 
clarified to bring them in conformance with the terms used in the 
complex model calculations under  80.101(g). 



b. 

Compliance Calculations. 

Section 80.101(g), entitled ``Compliance Calculations,'' is 
restructured to reverse the order of the simple model calculation 
formula currently in  80.101(g)(1)(i) and the formula for 
determining the average value for the parameter being evaluated 
currently in  80.101(g)(1)(ii). This organizational change is 
necessary because in order to perform the simple model 
calculation for exhaust benzene emissions, the refiner or 
importer must first determine the average value for certain 
parameters. In addition, and for purposes of clarity, the 
heading ``Simple Model Calculations'' is inserted as a new 
paragraph (i) under  80.101(g)(1), and the heading ``Complex 
Model Calculations'' is inserted as a new paragraph (ii) under 
 80.101(g)(1). These changes restructure the compliance 
calculations in a logical sequence that will make this section 
clearer for compliance purposes. 



The formula definition of ``SG

i

'' in  80.101(g)(1)(i)(A) is 
amended to clarify that the specific gravity term only applies to 
calculations involving sulfur. 



The definitions of the factors ``BZ'' and ``AR'' under 
 80.101(g)(1)(i)(B), pertaining to compliance calculations for 
exhaust benzene emissions under the simple model, are clarified 
as to how these are calculated by expanding them to read 
``calculated per paragraph (g)(1)(i)(A) of this section.'' 



Section 80.101(g)(1)(iii), (g)(1)(iv), and (g)(1)(v), 
pertaining to complex model calculations, are consolidated and 
simplified as a new  80.101(g)(1)(ii).

c. 

Sampling and Testing.

 Section 80.101(i)(1), which concerns requirements for sampling and testing of conventional gasoline and other
products to which the compliance standards apply, is being revised to 
delete the requirement that such sampling and testing be 
conducted prior to the gasoline or product leaving the refinery. 
This change is necessary because this requirement interferes with 
the ability of refiners and importers to do composite sampling 
and in-line blending. 



2. Controls Applicable to Blendstocks ( 80.102) 



Since gasoline produced for and marketed in California is 
subject to that State's stringent reformulated gasoline 
standards, it is not necessary to include such gasoline, or 
applicable blendstocks used in the production of such gasoline, 
in EPA's blendstock tracking requirements beginning in 1995. 
Thus, the definitions of the volume of gasoline, ``V

g

'' and ``V

g,i

,'' in the averaging period blendstock-to-gasoline ratio in 
 80.102(d)(1)(i) and the running cumulative compliance period 
blendstock-to-gasoline ratio in  80.102(d)(2)(i), respectively, 
are amended by adding an explicit exclusion for California 
gasoline. Similarly, an additional subparagraph (v) has been 
added under  80.102(d)(3) to exclude applicable blendstocks used 
to produce California gasoline in the blendstock ratio 
calculations. These corrections are necessary to make clear that 
the volumes of California gasoline, and applicable blendstocks 
used to produce California gasoline are not part of the ratio 
calculations.

3. Record Keeping Requirements ( 80.104) 



Under  80.104(a)(2)(ix), refiners and importers are 
required to retain documents to demonstrate that blendstocks were 
transferred for other than gasoline blending purposes as a basis 
for excluding such blendstocks from tracking. There are various 
other bases specified in  80.102(d)(3) for excluding blendstocks 
from tracking (e.g., exported, transferred as a feedstock) for 
which document support is not required in the final rule. EPA 
believes that the document support requirement should apply to 
all excluded blendstocks. Therefore,  80.104(a)(2)(ix) is 
expanded to require the retention of documents which demonstrate 
any of the specified bases for the exclusion of blendstocks from 
blendstock tracking. 



4. Reporting Requirements ( 80.105) 



Section 80.105(a)(2) in the final rule requires refiners and 
importers to report the overall volume of applicable blendstock 
produced or imported and transferred to others. This provision 
is being clarified to require separate reporting for those 
applicable blendstocks that are, and those that are not, excluded 
under  80.102(d)(3). 



C. Preamble 



The preamble of the February 16, 1994, notice of final 
rulemaking contains two errors in the sections discussing 
reformulated gasoline and anti-dumping enforcement provisions. 
The following corrections should be noted for these sections of 
the preamble: 

 On page 7759, in the second column, in the 12th and 13th 
lines of the second full paragraph, ``(March 1, 1996, through 
February 29, 1996)'' should read ``(March 1, 1996, through February 
28, 1998).'' 

 On page 7800, in the second column, in the 4th and 5th 
lines of the carryover paragraph, ``section 211(k)(c) of the Act'' 
should read ``section 211(k) and (c) of the Act.'' 



V. Summer/Winter Season 



Section 80.91 of the Reformulated Gasoline Final Rule (59 FR 
7716) defines summer and winter data and sampling requirements as 
follows: paragraph (d)(1)(i)(A) states that ``Data shall have 
been obtained for at least three months of the refiner's or 
importer's production of summer gasoline and at least three 
months of its production of winter gasoline.'' The regulation 
goes on to define a summer month as ``any month during which the 
refiner produced any gasoline which met the federal summer 
gasoline volatility requirements. Winter shall be any month 
which could not be considered a summer month.'' 

Several comments received by EPA since the rule was 
published indicate that this present definition severely 
restricts or eliminates the winter period in some cases, and 
inappropriately allocates winter data to the summer calculation. 
Further, the current rule inadvertently precludes the use of 
actual data in some calculations, even when such per batch actual 
data is available. 



</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940720-0-00079 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940720-0-00006 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Considering that the goal of the baseline is to most 
accurately reflect actual 1990 gasoline composition, the rule 
will be modified to more correctly allocate parameter data. 
Provision will be made for the use of actual RVP data to define 
summer and winter gasoline. When such Method 1, per batch actual 
data is not available, summer and winter months will be redefined 
to better approximate the seasonal gasoline fuel parameter and 
emission values. 

This modification to the reformulated gasoline regulation 
will satisfy several comments received since publication in the 


Federal Register

. EPA will redefine summer and winter months, 
for use when Method 1 actual batch data is not available, as 
follows. A summer month will be redefined as any month during 
which more than 50 percent (by volume) of the gasoline produced by 
a refiner met the federal summer gasoline volatility 
requirements. Winter shall remain defined as any month which 
could not be considered a summer month. This will correct 
situations in which small quantities of summer volatility 
gasoline are produced early in the year. Originally, data from a 
month in which even small quantities of summer volatility fuel 
was produced was considered a summer month. With this 
modification, such months in which the majority of fuel was 
winter volatility would be correctly allocated as a winter data 
month. 

Further, for any month for which both winter and summer 
gasoline were produced, if actual RVP (Method 1) data are 
available, that data will be accurately divided between the 
summer and winter calculations, as appropriate. If such per 
batch data is not available, all data for that month would be 
considered either summer or winter, based on the production 
volumes. 

When actual per batch data is used, for minimum data 
requirement purposes, a month is considered equivalent to 4 weeks 
of seasonal data. Therefore, 12 weeks of data sampling on summer 
volatility fuel satisfies the minimum three months of data 
collection required. If a refiner, such as the California 
refiners, still cannot provide three months of winter data, they 
may petition for less than minimum data, under the provisions 
outlined in  80.91(d)(1)(C). 



VI. Baseline Determination Adjustments 



A. Work-In-Progress (WIP) Adjustment 



The final reformulated gasoline rule provided criteria for 
allowing work-in-progress baseline adjustments (section 
80.91(e)(5)). Work-in-progress (WIP) refers to one or more major 
capital changes or commitment(s) made by a refiner prior to or in 
1990. A WIP adjustment allows a refiner to modify its baseline 
volume and fuel parameter values (which affect emissions) to 
account for the WIP. In order to obtain a WIP modification, a 
refiner must petition EPA and EPA must approve the petition. 

As indicated in the preamble to the final rule, EPA believes 
that the criteria for a WIP adjustment should be fairly 
stringent, as the adjustment was intended only for those for whom 
a significant investment had already been made in order to comply 
with another government mandate. Additionally, a broad program 
of adjustments could indicate that EPA exceeded its equitable 
discretion under 

Alabama Power

, as discussed in the Regulatory 
Impact Analysis (RIA) accompanying the final rule. 

In the final rule, EPA required that a refiner meet each of 
three criteria in order to qualify for a WIP baseline adjustment. 
A fourth criterion was also required to minimize environmental 
harm due to WIP adjustments, via simple model parameter caps and 
emissions caps for both the simple and complex models. 

Since promulgation of the final rule, EPA has re-evaluated 
this fourth criterion of the WIP provisions. EPA intended to 
allow WIP adjustments to relieve severe hardship where the 
adjustment did not allow emissions to increase significantly 
relative to the Clean Air Act baseline. The methods EPA chose to 
constrain WIP adjustments had inconsistent impacts depending on 
simple model or complex model use. The modification proposed in 
this Direct Final Rulemaking would ensure that the fuel parameter 
constraints on WIP adjustments under the simple model would be 
more consistent with the emissions performance constraints under 
the complex model. Specifically, WIP adjustments will be 
permitted to exceed the simple model parameter caps, but only to 
the extent the baseline still complies with the complex model 
emission caps. Without this change, a WIP adjustment would be 
more constrained in 1995 than would be the case in 1998, possibly 
requiring a refiner to make processing changes in 1995 that would 
not be necessary in 1998. While the emissions and parameter caps 
were set to minimize environmental harm due to the WIP (realizing 
that a WIP adjustment will actually increase baseline emissions 
relative to 1990) EPA believes this modification will increase 
compliance flexibility while maintaining the environmental goals 
of the program.

<TEXT>
 

With regard to the effect of WIP adjustments on reformulated 
gasoline compliance, the simple model caps stated in the 
regulations apply to reformulated gasoline as well as to 
conventional gasoline. As stated in the final reformulated 
gasoline rule, when the simple model is used for compliance, the 
WIP-adjusted annual average baseline values for sulfur, olefins 
and T90 are the actual WIP-adjusted values of those parameters, 
provided they do not exceed the unadjusted baseline values or the 
simple model parameter caps given in section 80.91(e)(viii)(B). 
However, baseline parameters may now exceed these caps if the WIP 
adjusted baseline does not result in exhaust emissions of VOC, 
toxics, and NO

X

 which exceed the emission levels specified in 
 80.91(e)(5)(vii)(B), namely 105% of the annual average statutory 
value. 
Based on questions received since promulgation of the final 
rule, two changes in the language of the Work-In-Progress (WIP) 
provisions are made to section 80.91(e)(5) to further clarify 
certain aspects of the WIP adjustment not explicitly addressed in 
the final rule. The regulatory language dealing with the 
emissions and parameter caps is unclear as to whether the caps 
apply to the actual values or to the change in emissions or 
parameter values. In addition, there appeared to be some 
confusion over what was meant by ``adjusted'' baseline. Paragraphs 
80.91(e)(5)(vi) and 80.91(e)(5)(vii) have been modified to 
clarify agency intent. 


B. JP-4 Adjustment 


In the final rule for reformulated gasoline, EPA allowed 
adjustments for specific extenuating circumstances. Baseline 
fuel parameters, volumes and emissions of a refinery can be 
adjusted due to the occurrence of specific extraordinary or 
extenuating circumstances which caused its 1990 gasoline 
production to be different than it would have been had the 
circumstance not occurred. However, the Agency's objective is 
not to establish a broad adjustment program. Allowable 
circumstances include unforeseen, unplanned downtime of at least 
30 days of one or more gasoline blendstock producing units due to 
equipment failure or natural cause beyond the control of the 
refiner, or for non-annual maintenance (turnaround) downtime 
which occurred in 1990. These types of adjustments reflect 
instances where the 1990 baseline truly deviated from the 
otherwise expected baseline (historic and future), had the 
incident not occurred. EPA also expects that allowed adjustments 
will have minimal environmental impact while relieving a large 
regulatory burden. 
In keeping with that policy objective, EPA promulgated 
provisions to permit baseline adjustments for certain refiners 
which produced JP-4 jet fuel in 1990, upon petition and approval. 
As discussed in the RIA for the reformulated gasoline final rule, 
EPA believes that it has authority to allow such adjustments due 
to the discretion afforded EPA by Congress. Additionally, 


Alabama Power 

v. 

Costle


 gives EPA ``case-by-case discretion'' to grant variances or even dispensation from a rule where imposition of the
requirement would result in minimal environmental benefit 
but would extremely burden a regulated party. Today's action 
changes two portions of the provisions for JP-4 adjustment: the 
multiple refinery requirement and the JP-4 to gasoline production 
ratio. In the final reformulated gasoline rule, JP-4 baseline 
adjustments are generally limited to single-refinery refiners 
because such refiners have no way to aggregate baselines
 so as 
to reduce the combined burden of a JP-4 phaseout and the anti-dumping requirements on their operations. In some
cases, if no 
relief were granted in this area, the viability of a refinery 
could be at stake.

1. Multiple-Refinery Requirement 


The final reformulated gasoline rule also promulgated 
baseline adjustment provisions for multi-refinery refiners where 
each refinery produced JP-4 in 1990. This adjustment provision 
assumes that multi-refinery refiners are predominantly in the 
business of fuel production and thus possess the means to offset 
the refinery's JP-4 volume and associated fuel parameter 
increases with fuels volumes at other locations. The adjustment 
also assumes that refiners with multiple-refineries have process 
units offering various processing options which support an 
average (or typical) fuel production operation. 
Today's action modifies the JP-4 baseline adjustment 
multiple refinery requirement. Every refinery of a multiple-refinery is no longer required to have produced JP-4.
Such 
multi-refinery refiners are allowed to average their 1990 JP-4 
production to 1990 gasoline production ratio across all of their 
refineries. However, all refineries of a multi-refiner must 
still meet the other two criteria specified for the JP-4 baseline 
adjustment in the reformulated gasoline final regulations. 
Specifically, only refiners that will not produce reformulated 
gasoline and that meet the 1990 JP-4 to gasoline production ratio 
are allowed to make a JP-4 baseline adjustment. The Agency is 
amending the requirement stipulating that each refinery of 
multiple-refineries produced JP-4 in 1990 because, essentially, 
the same environmental impact and economic hardship is expected 
regardless of whether a single refinery or all refineries of a 
multiple-refinery produced JP-4. 


2. JP-4 Baseline Adjustment Ratio 


The final reformulated gasoline rule promulgated baseline 
adjustment provisions which stipulate that 1990 JP-4 production 
must have constituted a specified portion of a refiner's 1990 
fuel production in order for a significant enough burden to exist 
to justify permiting baseline adjustments. Additionally, a 
baseline is neither unrepresentative of 1990, nor incalculable, 
because of post-1990 changes in crude availability, fuel 
specifications, fuel markets, etc. EPA is permitting baseline 
adjustments for certain refiners which produced JP-4 jet fuel in 
1990 because, as discussed in the Regulatory Impact Analysis for 
the reformulated gasoline final rule, EPA believes that it has a 
limited authority to allow such adjustments in certain extreme 
cases. The final reformulated gasoline regulations require that 
the ratio of the refinery's 1990 JP-4 production to its 1990 
gasoline production equal or exceed 0.5. 
Upon further evaluation of the baseline adjustment 
provisions, the Agency has concluded that the JP-4 to gasoline 
production ratio, as promulgated in the RFG final rule (0.5), is 
unnecessarily restrictive. Based on responses from affected 
refiners, under the December 1993 criteria only two refiners in 
the United States would likely qualify for the adjustment. In 
other words, very few refiners under contract to produce JP-4 
will have the relief intended by the provision. Today's action 
alters the refiner's 1990 JP-4 production to 1990 gasoline 
production ratio from 0.5 to 0.2. EPA believes this revised 
ratio indicates that a significant amount of the refinery 
feedstock used for JP-4 production would have to be converted in 
order to produce gasoline. Altering the JP-4 to gasoline 
production ratio will allow additional small refiners to qualify 
for the adjustment and not be forced to operate from a 
drastically less competitive position or be driven out of 
business. Based on feedback EPA has received, changing the ratio 
from 0.5 to 0.2 raises the number of affected refiners from 2 to 
6. If large refineries had such a ratio also, the regulatory 
burden would be just as great. Also, it would be more difficult 
to argue de minimis environmental impact for large refiners. In 
reality none do, such that the ratio is only an issue for small 
refiners. 
Several different ratio options were suggested by commenters 
during the reformulated gasoline rulemaking as to what minimum 
portion of a refinery's 1990 production JP-4 should have 
constituted for the circumstance to be extenuating, as follows: 
JP-4 production to total refinery production, 20%; JP-4 
production to gasoline production, 5%; JP-4 production to 
gasoline production, 75%; and, JP-4 production to gasoline plus 
JP-4 production, 10%. EPA's 0.2 JP-4 to gasoline ratio is in 
line with some of the commenters suggestions. 
At less than a 1990 JP-4 to gasoline production ratio of 
0.2, EPA believes the impact on benzene and aromatics may make it 
more costly for refiners to comply with the regulations, though 
it is unlikely that such refiners will be forced out of business 
or experience some similar extreme burden. For example, it is 
expected that no economic hardship will occur at a 
JP-4 to 
gasoline ratio of 0.1. Thus, the Agency discretion recognized in 


Alabama


 to grant variances or even dispensation from a rule 
where imposition of the requirement would result in minimal 
environmental benefit but would extremely burden a regulated 
party, would not apply. 




While the adjusted emission baselines of those approved for 
both amended 
JP-4 adjustments are likely to be higher than their 
actual 1990 baselines (primarily due to increased benzene and 
aromatics) EPA expects minimal negative environmental affects. 
First, the number of refineries meeting the criteria is still 
expected to be quite small. Second, the total production of all 
such refineries is also small. Thus, not very much additional 
gasoline will be affected by any baseline adjustments for JP-4 
than if the criteria were less stringent or adjustments were not 
allowed at all. The modification of the multi-refinery 
requirement and the reduction of the ratio requirement to 0.2 
both provide necessary flexibility to refiners and allow 
additional refiners (that are simultaneously burdened by the JP-4 
phaseout and the anti-dumping provisions) regulatory relief. 
As stated in the Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA) for the 
reformulated gasoline final rule, JP-4 baseline adjustments will 
be allowed only for those refiners which will not produce 
reformulated gasoline, which is the most critical factor in 
assessing environmental impact. While the anti-dumping 
requirements, in general, apply to all conventional gasoline 
whether or not reformulated gasoline is also produced, in these 
specific cases no dumping will occur due to reformulated gasoline 
production. The intent of Congress with regard to the anti-dumping program will be met while not unduly burdening
those that 
meet the specified criteria. Since both the unadjusted and 
adjusted baselines must be determined, if a refiner granted such 
an adjustment subsequently produces reformulated gasoline, its 
conventional gasoline compliance would immediately be subject to 
its original unadjusted baseline.

VII. Public Participation and Effective Date 


The Agency is publishing this action as a direct final rule because it views the changes contained within as non-controversial
and anticipates no adverse or critical comments. This action will be effective September 19, 1994 unless the Agency
receives notice by August 19, 1994 that adverse or critical comments will be submitted, or that a party requests the
opportunity to submit such oral comments pursuant to section 307(d)(5) of the Clean Air Act, as amended. If such notice
is received regarding a change to a particular regulatory provision, the provision in question will be withdrawn
before the effective date by publishing a subsequent 

Federal Register

 notice withdrawing the direct final rule for the identified provision.

Parties that submit adverse or critical comments, notify EPA of intentions to submit such comments, or request a public
hearing within the allotted time period should identify the specific provision(s) at issue by specifying the preamble
section numbers that discuss the provision(s). For instance, comments on the change to the oxygen valid range limits
should include a reference to Section (Item Number) II.A.1 of the preamble. Comments on any of the insubstantial errors
in Section I of the preamble should include a reference to the identification code associated with each change in that
section. For instance, adverse comments on the paragraph reference change in  80.41(h)(2)(iii) should include
a reference to Item Number I-A. 

The EPA will withdraw from final action only those specific provision(s) identified by the commenters or persons
who notify EPA of their intent to comment or who request an opportunity to submit oral comments. All provisions in today's
action that are not commented upon or for which EPA does not receive notice as described above will become effective
September 19, 1994.



VIII. Statutory Authority 



The statutory authority for the actions finalized today is granted to EPA by Sections 114, 211 (c) and (k) and 301 of
the Clean Air Act, as amended; 42 U.S.C. 7414, 7545 (c) and (k), and 7601. 



IX. Administrative Designation 



Pursuant to Executive Order 12866, (58 FR 51735 (October 4, 1993)) the Agency must determine whether the regulatory
action is ``significant'' and therefore subject to OMB review and the requirements of the Executive Order. The Order
defines ``significant regulatory action'' as one that is likely to result in a rule that may: 

(1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector
of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal
governments or communities; 

(2) Create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; 

(3) Materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations
of recipients thereof; or 

(4) Raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles
set forth in the Executive Order. 

Pursuant to the terms of Executive Order 12866, it has been determined that this direct rule is not a ``significant
regulatory action''.



X. Regulatory Flexibility Analysis 



The Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) of 1980 requires federal agencies to examine the effects of the renewable oxygenate
regulation and to identify significant adverse impacts of federal regulations on a substantial number of small entities.
Because the RFA does not provide concrete definitions of ``small entity,'' ``significant impact,'' or ``substantial
number,'' EPA has established guidelines setting the standards to be used in evaluating impacts on small businesses.
 For purposes of the renewable oxygenate requirement for reformulated gasoline, a small entity is any business which
is independently owned and operated and not dominant in its field as defined by SBA regulations under section 3 of the
Small Business Act. 





The Agency believes that the interpretations, clarifications, and corrections published in today's final action
are unlikely to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. In fact, the revisions
contained herein are designed to promote successful implementation of the reformulated gasoline program for all
regulated parties.

month is defined as any month during which more than 50 percent (by 
volume) of the gasoline produced by a refiner met the federal summer 
gasoline volatility requirements. Winter shall be any month which 
could not be considered a summer month under this definition.

(ii) If the baseline fuel value for aromatics, olefins, and/or 
benzene (determined per paragraph (e) of this section) is higher than 
the high end of the valid range limits specified in  80.42(c)(1) if 
compliance is being determined under the Simple Model, or in 
 80.45(f)(1)(ii) if compliance is being determined under the Complex 
Model, then the valid range limits may be extended for conventional 
gasoline in the following manner: 

(A) The new high end of the valid range for aromatics is 
determined from the following equation: 




NAROLIM=AROBASE+5.0 volume percent




where




NAROLIM=The new high end of the valid range limit for aromatics, in volume percent 

AROBASE=The seasonal baseline fuel value for aromatics, in volume percent 



(B) The new high end of the valid range for olefins is determined 
from the following equation: 




NOLELIM=OLEBASE+3.0 volume percent




where




NOLELIM=The new high end of the valid range limit for olefins, in volume percent 

OLEBASE=The seasonal baseline fuel value for olefins, in volume percent 



(C) The new high end of the valid range for benzene is determined 
from the following equation: 




NBENLIM=BENBASE+0.5 volume percent




where




NBENLIM=The new high end of the valid range limit for benzene, in volume percent 

BENBASE=The seasonal baseline fuel value for benzene, in volume percent 



(D) The extension of the valid range is limited to the applicable 
summer or winter season in which the baseline fuel values for aromatics, 
olefins, and/or benzene exceed the high end of the valid range as 
described in paragraph (f)(2)(ii) of this section. Also, the extension 
of the valid range is limited to use by the refiner whose baseline value 
for aromatics, olefins, and/or benzene was higher than the valid range 
limits as described in paragraph (f)(2)(ii) of this section. 

(E) Any extension of the Simple Model valid range limits is 
applicable only to the Simple Model. Likewise any extension of the 
Complex Model valid range limits is applicable only to the Complex 
Model. 

(F) The valid range extensions calculated in paragraphs 
(f)(2)(ii)(A), (B), and (C) of this section are applicable to both the 
baseline fuel and target fuel for the purposes of determining the 
compliance status of conventional gasolines. The extended valid range 
limit represents the maximum value for that parameter above which fuels 
cannot be evaluated with the applicable compliance model. 

(G) Under the Simple Model, baseline and compliance calculations 
shall subscribe to the following limitations: 

(

1

) If the aromatics valid range has been extended per paragraph 
(f)(2)(ii)(A) of this section, an aromatics value equal to the high end 
of the valid range specified in  80.42(c)(1) shall be used for the 
purposes of calculating the exhaust benzene fraction. 

(

2

) If the fuel benzene valid range has been extended per paragraph 
(f)(2)(ii)(C) of this section, a benzene value equal to the high end of 
the valid range specified in  80.42(c)(1) shall be used for the purposes 
of calculating the exhaust benzene fraction. 

(H) Under the Complex Model, baseline and compliance calculations 
shall subscribe to the following limitations: 

(

1

) If the aromatics valid range has been extended per paragraph 
(f)(2)(ii)(A) of this section, an aromatics value equal to the high end 
of the valid range specified in  80.45(f)(1)(ii) shall be used for the 
purposes of calculating emissions performances. 

(

2

) If the olefins valid range has been extended per paragraph 
(f)(2)(ii)(B) of this section, an olefins value equal to the high end 
of the valid range specified in  80.45(f)(1)(ii) shall be used for the 
target fuel for the purposes of calculating emissions performances. 

(

3

) If the benzene valid range has been extended per paragraph 
(f)(2)(ii)(C) of this section, a benzene value equal to the high end of 
the valid range specified in  80.45(f)(1)(ii) shall be used for the 
target fuel for the purposes of calculating emissions performances.

Air Pollution Control; Preemption of State Regulation for Nonroad Engine and Vehicle Standards 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).




</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 EPA is promulgating a final rule that sets forth requirements and procedures for EPA authorization of California
enforcement of standards and other requirements relating to the control of emissions from new nonroad vehicles or
engines under section 209(e) of the Clean Air Act (Act), as amended. 



The rule includes definitions of the categories of new nonroad engines and vehicles that the Act specifies as preempted
from state regulation. These definitions of ``farm equipment'', ``construction equipment'', and ``locomotive''
clarify which nonroad engines and vehicles may be subject to state regulation because such regulation is not preempted.
The definition of ``new'' in this rulemaking applies to all new nonroad engines and vehicles with the exception of
locomotives and engines used in locomotives. This rule also provides procedures by which EPA may authorize California
to enforce standards and provides guidance for states that adopt California standards. Finally, the rule discusses
the criteria to be used by EPA in its analysis of California authorization requests. The rule will provide guidance
to California, other states, and vehicle and engine manufacturers regarding new nonroad engine and vehicle preemption.

I. Statutory Authority and Background 



EPA is required under section 209(e) of the Clean Air Act (Act), as amended, 42 U.S.C. 7543, to ``issue regulations
to implement'' subsection (e). Section 209(e) of the Act addresses the state adoption of emission standards for new
nonroad vehicles and engines. 

Under section 209(e), all states are preempted from adopting emissions standards for ``[n]ew engines which are used
in construction equipment or vehicles or used in farm equipment or vehicles and which are smaller than 175 horsepower''
or for ``[n]ew locomotives or new engines used in locomotives''. In this final rule, EPA defines these preempted categories,
except that EPA does not define the term ``new'' with respect to locomotives and engines used in locomotives. For new
nonroad engines and vehicles not included in the preempted categories, EPA is directed to authorize California,
after notice and opportunity for public hearing, to enforce such standards and other requirements as California
adopts for the regulation of such engines and vehicles, if these regulations meet the criteria set forth in the Act.
Several of the criteria to be used for nonroad engine and vehicle authorizations are similar to the requirements applicable
to waivers of Federal preemption of emission standards for new motor vehicles under section 209(b). Section 209(a)
prohibits state adoption of emission standards for new motor vehicles and engines. Section 209(b) directs EPA to
waive this prohibition for California if certain criteria are met. Other states may adopt California nonroad vehicle
or engine emission standards under section 209(e) if they comply with several requirements. 

This rule was proposed at 56 FR 45866, Sept. 6, 1991. A public hearing was held on September 20, 1991. Many industries
presented comments through an association or individually. Represented in the comments presented at the hearing
and submitted in writing are the following: engine manufacturers; manufacturers and dealers of various types of
equipment including agricultural, construction, mining, utility, and lawn and garden; manufacturers of emission
controls; railroads; manufacturers of industrial trucks; the San Diego County Air Pollution Control District;
and the State of California.

A. Changes to Proposed Rule for Final Rule



After reviewing the comments received, EPA has made the following changes to the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM)
for the final rule. First, the final rule establishes one definition of ``new'' that applies equally to domestically
manufactured and imported vehicles and engines. Second, the definition of ``new'' applies to all nonroad engines
other than locomotives and engines used in locomotives. EPA will define ``new'' locomotives and ``new'' engines
used in locomotives in its locomotive standards promulgated under section 213 of the Act. Third, in the final rule
EPA defines the word ``commercial,'' as used in the definitions of ``farm equipment'' and ``construction equipment.''
Fourth, EPA makes minor modifications to the definitions of ``construction equipment'' and ``locomotive.'' Fifth,
the proposed federal labeling requirement is deleted. Sixth, EPA changes its interpretation of section 209(e) so
that California may adopt, but not enforce, nonroad standards prior to EPA authorization. Seventh, EPA changes the
standard of review of California's primary use determination to a preponderance of the evidence standard. Finally,
EPA changes its interpretation of ``consistent with this section'' in section 209(e)(2)(A)(iii) to include section
209(b)(1)(C). 



B. Nonroad Engines and Vehicles 



In the NPRM, EPA acknowledged that at some point it would be necessary to clarify whether certain internal combustion
engines, such as those used in movable pumps, generators, and compressors, are stationary sources and therefore
subject to regulations under Title I of the Act or are mobile sources and therefore potentially subject to nonroad
regulations under Title II of the Act. The issue is complex. The definitions of ``stationary source'' in sections
111(3) and 302(z) of the Act and of ``nonroad engine'' in section 216(10) of the Act do not make clear under which Title
certain internal combustion engines belong. The engines in question are those used in equipment for reasons other
than propulsion. 

Ingersoll-Rand, the Engine Manufacturers Association (EMA), and the Equipment Manufacturers Institute (EMI),
among others, commented that EPA should determine in this rulemaking that both self-propelled and transportable
equipment are mobile sources. This would clarify to manufacturers that transportable farm and construction equipment
are exempted from state regulation for purposes of control of emissions. 

EPA agrees that the above issue needs to be addressed and has resolved this issue in a rulemaking implementing section
213 of the Act.
 Section 213 requires EPA to ``conduct a study of emissions from nonroad engines and nonroad vehicles to determine
if such emissions cause, or significantly contribute to, air pollution which may reasonably be anticipated to endanger
public health or welfare.'' The section further provides that if the Administrator determines that nonroad emissions
are ``significant contributors'' in more than one ozone or carbon monoxide (CO) nonattainment area, the Administrator
shall promulgate standards for such nonroad engines. 





EPA studied nonroad emissions and issued a report in November 1991.
 In the June 17, 1994 rulemaking EPA determined, based on the study data and the docket of the rulemaking (A-91-24),
that emissions from nonroad sources are significant contributors to ozone and CO in more than one nonattainment area.
EPA's final rule also includes regulations that set forth emission standards for CO, hydrocarbon (HC), oxides of
nitrogen (NO

X

) and smoke emissions from large new nonroad compression-ignition engines at or above 37 kilowatts in power, with
the exclusion for certain types of engines.
 Within EPA's 37 kilowatt and above nonroad rule a definition of nonroad engine is provided. Section 89.2 of the 37 kilowatt
and above rule provides the following definition: 






Nonroad engine means: 

(1) Except as discussed in (2) below, a nonroad engine is any internal combustion engine: 

(i) in or on a piece of equipment that is self-propelled or serves a dual purpose by both propelling itself and performing
another function (such as garden tractors, off-highway mobile cranes and bulldozers); or

(ii) in or on a piece of equipment that is intended to be propelled while performing its function (such as lawnmowers
and string trimmers); or 

(iii) that, by itself or in or on a piece of equipment, is portable or transportable, meaning designed to be and capable
of being carried or moved from one location to another. Indicia of transportability include, but are not limited to,
wheels, skids, carrying handles, dolly, trailer, or platform. 

(2) An internal combustion engine is not a nonroad engine if: 

(i) the engine is used to propel a motor vehicle or a vehicle used solely for competition, or is subject to standards
promulgated under section 202 of the Act; or 

(ii) the engine is regulated by a federal New Source Performance Standard promulgated under section 111 of the Act;
or 

(iii) the engine otherwise included in (1)(iii) remains or will remain at a location for more than 12 consecutive months
or a shorter period of time for an engine located at a seasonal source. A location is any single site at a building, structure,
facility, or installation. Any engine (or engines) that replaces an engine at a location and that is intended to perform
the same or similar function as the engine replaced will be included in calculating the consecutive time period. An
engine located at a seasonal source is an engine that remains at a seasonal source during the full annual operating
period of the seasonal source. A seasonal source is a stationary source that remains in a single location on a permanent
basis (i.e., at least two years) and that operates at that single location approximately three ( or more) each year.
This paragraph does not apply to an engine after the engine is removed from the location. 

For purposes of consistency with section 213, and the reasons set forth in the 37 kilowatt and above regulation,
 EPA has decided to adopt and apply this definition to today's section 209(e) rulemaking. 





The California Air Resources Board's (CARB) utility engine regulation (the California Utility Rule) affects only
engines smaller than 25 horsepower. EPA believes that equipment that uses such small engines is intended to be mobile.
For example, equipment that uses engines smaller than 25 horsepower includes hand-held and portable equipment,
which EPA believes are clearly nonroad, mobile sources. 



C. Definition of ``New'' as Used in ``New Nonroad Engine,'' and ``New Nonroad Vehicle'' 



In the NPRM, EPA defined ``new nonroad engine'' and ``new nonroad vehicle'' to mean a nonroad engine or a nonroad vehicle
the equitable or legal title to which has never been transferred to an ultimate purchaser. Ultimate purchaser was
proposed to be defined as the first person who in good faith purchases such a new nonroad vehicle or nonroad engine for
purposes other than resale. Additionally, with respect to imported nonroad engines, EPA proposed to define ``new''
nonroad engine to be a nonroad engine manufactured after the effective date of a regulation issued under section 213
which would be applicable to such engine had it been manufactured for importation into the United States. These definitions
also applied to ``new locomotives'' and ``new engines used in locomotives.'' 

Comments on EPA's proposed definition of ``new'' were several. First, CARB, the San Diego Air Pollution Control Board
(SDAPCB), and the Manufacturers of Emissions Controls Association (MECA) supported EPA's definition. CARB asked
that EPA clarify which regulatory activities states may perform; for example, whether states may require in-use
testing and impose add-on or retrofit requirements. On the other hand, many commenters, including U.S. Representative
Terry Bruce, the Equipment Manufacturers Institute (EMI), the Engine Manufacturers Association (EMA), and the
Portable Power Equipment Manufacturers Association (PPEMA), opposed EPA's proposed definition and proposed that
``new'' should mean manufactured after either the effective date of the Clean Air Act Amendments, November 15, 1990,
or after federal regulations take effect. These commenters believe that Congress intended an ``absolute'' preemption.
That is, the nonroad engines and vehicles in the preempted categories manufactured after November 15, 1990 would
never be subject to any kind of state emission regulation. EMA commented that if EPA does not accept the latter definition,
it should expand its proposed definition so that engines remain ``new'' until they have exceeded their useful life.

Commenters in the railroad industry also supported a definition of ``new'' as ``manufactured after November 1990''
and stated further that the railroad industry has traditionally been preempted from state regulation, such as in
the area of safety. The same commenters indicated that they believe that state control of locomotive emissions or
state enforcement of federal standards would interfere with interstate commerce. Railroad commenters also stated
that any standards for rebuilt or remanufactured engines or locomotives should be uniform federal standards_not
state standards. Furthermore, if remanufactured engines were rebuilt to comply with such federal standards, they
should be considered ``new''. 

Commenters also opposed the proposed definition regarding imported vehicles and engines because the definition
of ``new'' was different depending upon whether the nonroad engine was produced domestically or abroad. 


These proposed definitions for ``new nonroad vehicles'' and ``new nonroad engines'' parallel the definitions of
``new motor vehicles'' and ``new motor vehicle engines'' in section 216 of the Clean Air Act. The definition of ``new''
proposed for imported nonroad engines was intended to address nonconforming engines which may become subject to
federal emission requirements at the time the engine or vehicle is imported into the United States. The Agency has
decided to delete this definition of ``new'' for imported engines. EPA agrees with the commenters that imports and
domestic products should generally be treated alike for regulatory purposes. The Agency has addressed the importation
of nonroad engines which do not conform to federal emission standards at the time of importation.

5

 Today's rule, in any event, treats domestic and imported nonroad engines the same way for purposes of determining
whether they are preempted from state regulation. 






This final rule establishes a definition for all domestically manufactured and imported ``new nonroad engines,''
``new nonroad vehicles,'' other than ``new locomotives'' and ``new engines used in a locomotive.''

6

 New nonroad engines and new nonroad vehicles are defined as engines and vehicles the equitable or legal title to which
has not been transferred to an ultimate purchaser. The ultimate purchaser is defined as the first person who in good
faith purchases such engine or vehicle for purposes other than resale. For some engines or vehicles the passage of
title in the United States may not formally occur or manufacturers may retain title and lease the engines or equipment.
In these cases, a domestic or imported nonroad engine or nonroad vehicle will retain its status as ``new'' until such
engine or vehicle is ``placed into service.'' An engine or vehicle is considered ``placed into service'' when the
engine or vehicle is used for its functional purposes. EPA believes that the definition of new should include the ``placed
into service'' addition to the motor vehicle definition of new found in section 216 of the Act because of the nature
of the nonroad market. Nonroad engines and nonroad vehicles are often leased and maintained by the manufacturer well
into the useful life of the nonroad equipment. A piece of equipment, the title of which has passed to the ultimate purchaser,
should not be treated differently than a piece of equipment which is being used but has not yet passed to an ultimate
purchaser. 





The Agency believes that this definition of ``new'' comports with the language, intent and structure of the Clean
Air Act and the definition of ``new'' contained in the 37 kilowatt and above regulation and is therefore a permissible
construction of the statute. Contrary to the assertion of some commenters, EPA's definition of ``new'' is consistent
with the dictionary definition of the word as ``having existed or been made but a short time.'' Webster's Ninth New
Collegiate Dictionary, 1990. Generally speaking, manufactured products are sold soon after they are made and are
considered new until they are sold or used. The commenters' definition of new_anything manufactured after the Clean
Air Act Amendments' enactment or an applicable regulation's promulgation_would mean, by contrast, that any engine
manufactured after a certain date would be new forever. This is certainly not the plain meaning of ``new.'' Congress
could have stated that the federal preemption applied to certain equipment manufactured after a certain date, but
Congress did not do so. Elsewhere in Title II, Congress specified that a provision only applied to products manufactured
after a certain date (

see

, section 218 requiring a ban on engines manufactured after the 1992 model year that require leaded gasoline) or first
introduced into commerce after a certain date (

see

, section 211(f) regarding prohibition on fuels that are not substantially similar to fuels used to certify vehicles
as meeting emission standards). The lack of such a date here further supports that Congress intended ``new'' to mean
newly manufactured and not yet sold. 


The legislative record also shows Congressional intent that ``new'' should refer to newly manufactured products.
In his colloquy with Senator Wilson explaining the final version of section 209(e), Senator Chafee notes that ``because
the preemption is limited to new engine standards only, States can continue to require existing

 and in-use

 nonroad engines to reduce emissions . . .'' [Emphasis added] 136 Cong. Rec. S17237 (October 26, 1990).
This language is echoed by similar language from Senator Baucus in his report to the Senate on the conference bill.
136 Cong. Rec. S16976 (October 27, 1990). If Congress intended the definition of new nonroad engines or equipment,
and as a result the preemption, to apply to an engine for its entire life, then it would appear that there would be no distinction
between new and in-use nonroad engines, as an engine manufactured after a certain date would always be new. Yet the
statements of Senator Chafee and Senator Baucus clearly contemplate such a distinction.

The Agency's definition of new is also consistent with the way the Act approaches motor vehicle emission control.
As noted earlier, section 216 defines new in the context of motor vehicles as ``a motor vehicle the equitable or legal
title to which has never been transferred to an ultimate purchaser.'' The Act applies federal emissions standards
to ``new'' vehicles. These federal standards are enforced through certification, assembly line, and recall testing.
States, on the other hand, have a role in motor vehicle emission control through inspection/maintenance programs
and are not restricted from controlling used vehicles. The section 209(a) prohibition of state regulation of motor
vehicles addresses only ``new'' motor vehicles and engines and prohibits state regulation that occurs before sale,
titling, or registration of the vehicle.

7

 





The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 take a parallel approach to nonroad standards and enforcement. Section 213 provides
EPA with authority to set standards for ``new'' engines and provides for federal enforcement of such standards in
the same manner as motor vehicle enforcement. Furthermore, nothing on the face of section 209(e) or section 213 indicates
that Congress intended ``new'' to be interpreted differently in the nonroad and motor vehicle contexts. Given that
the preemption provisions for new motor vehicles and new nonroad engines appear in the same section of the Clean Air
Act, it is reasonable to believe that Congress did not intend for the word ``new'' to be defined differently within
the same section without stating this intent explicitly.

8

 





There is not a compelling policy or factual justification for defining new differently in the nonroad and motor vehicle
contexts. State regulation of nonroad engines does not generally present any greater degree of disruption of the
movement of products, engines or equipment between states than does regulation of motor vehicles. The comments provide
little if any justification, in terms of relevant distinctions between motor vehicles and nonroad engines, to justify
such a significant departure from EPA's established practice for regulating mobile sources. 


The Agency's definition of new is also consistent with case law. 

In Allway Taxi, Inc.

 v. 

City of New York,



9

 the court held that where the exercise of local police power serves the purpose of a federal act_the Clean Air Act in
that case_the preemptive effect of the act should be narrowly construed. In keeping with that principle, EPA believes
that section 209(e) should be construed narrowly in order to protect states' rights, particularly in an area such
as public health in which states traditionally exercise control. California's nonroad regulations will serve the
purpose of the federal act by improving air quality. 





In 

Allway Taxi, 

the court discussed the federal preemption of new motor vehicles and interpreted the meaning of new motor vehicle
as defined in Section 216 of the Act. The court noted that this definition ``reveals a clear congressional intent to
preclude states and localities from setting their own exhaust emission control standards only with respect to the
manufacture and distribution of new automobiles.''

10

 The court stated further that the narrow purpose in the definition is reinforced by prohibiting states and localities
from setting emission standards before the initial sale or registration of an automobile. Congress specifically
declared that section 209 did not preempt states from regulation of the use or movement of motor vehicles after they
have reached their ultimate purchasers.

EPA believes that the further a state requirement is removed in time from the manufacture and distribution of new engines,
the less interstate commerce is likely to be burdened. Furthermore, the legality of particular regulatory controls
that a state may impose on nonroad vehicles or engines that are no longer new will depend upon the burden that such controls
place on interstate commerce. In fact, the court in 

Allway Taxi

 stated that a state or locality is not free to impose its own emission control measures the moment after a new car is bought
and registered. ``That would be an obvious circumvention of the Clean Air Act and would defeat the congressional purpose
of preventing obstruction to interstate commerce.''
 The court further stated that federal preemption does not, however, preclude a state from imposing its own exhaust
emission control standards upon the resale or reregistration of the automobile. Furthermore, states are not precluded
from setting standards for licensing of vehicles for commercial use. These types of regulations, which are more removed,
``would cause only minimal interference with interstate commerce, since they would be directed primarily to intrastate
activities and the burden of compliance would be on individual owners and in-state users and not on manufacturers
and distributors.''
 





EPA expects that the principles articulated in 

Allway Taxi 

will be applied by the courts to any State adoption of in-use controls. For example, manufacturers have voiced a concern
that California would attempt to impose in-use emission control measures that would apply immediately after a new
vehicle or engine were purchased. As the 

Allway Taxi 

court said, such standards applied to almost-new vehicles would be an attempt to circumvent section 209 preemption
and would obstruct interstate commerce.
 





It should be noted that section 209(e)(2) of the Act does not prevent California or other states from regulating nonroad
engines and vehicles in use.

15

 EPA believes that the requirements of section 209(e)(2) apply only to new nonroad engines and vehicles. The requirements
of section 209(e)(2) are only required for nonroad engines and vehicles the regulation of which has been preempted.
The language of section 209(e)(2) does not state any clear preemption, either for new or in use vehicles. The only clear
preemption of state regulation of nonroad engines occurs in section 209(e)(1) and section 209(a).

16

 Both of these subsections are limited to new engines and vehicles. Given the general legal presumption against reading
a preemption more broadly than explicitly required, as discussed in 

Allway Taxi,

 a preemption of state regulation of nonroad engines and vehicles in use should not be readily implied. 






Another indication that section 209(e)(2) was not intended to apply to most in-use regulations of nonroad engines
is the fact that neither the Senate nor the House version of the 1990 Act amendments would have preempted state regulation
of anything but new nonroad engines. Neither version would have expressly preempted regulation in use. It would be
unusual for a bill to come out of conference with a broader preemption than existed in either house and without any mention
in the legislative history that such broader preemption had been mandated. In fact, both Senators Chafee and Baucus
believed that the scope of the preemption had been narrowed from the House bill, not widened.

17

In fact, as the legislative history indicates, it appears that Congress intended the preemption provisions of section
209, as applied to nonroad engines, to be analogous to the preemption provisions as applied to motor vehicles, except
that California cannot request any waiver of the Federal preemption of state regulation of new small farm and construction
equipment and locomotives. 

Further indication that section 209(e)(2) was not intended to apply to in-use regulations is the fact that, if the
subsection were applied to in-use regulations, then California would be the only government (local, state or federal)
that could directly set regulations for nonroad engines in use. EPA's mandate under section 213 applies only to new
engines. Therefore, EPA will not promulgate standards for in-use regulation of nonroad engines under section 213,
beyond in-use regulations normally associated with new certified engines (

e.g

. in-use testing and recall requirements under section 207). States other than California would not be able to regulate
nonroad engines in use (

e.g

. operation controls under section 209(d)) until California regulates them and could only regulate them in a manner
identical to California's regulations. Nothing in the legislative history indicates such a dramatic departure
from the current ability of states and local authorities to regulate emissions of mobile sources in use. Therefore,
if section 209(e)(2) is determined to apply to in-use regulations, the entire United States regulatory scheme for
regulation of nonroad engines in use would be dependent on the actions of one state, California. Congress could not
have meant to grant such plenary power to a single state. 

This is especially true given the location-specific nature of in-use regulations. In-use regulations, such as time
of use or place of use restrictions (

e.g

. high occupancy vehicle lanes) are typically very site specific. An in-use regulation suitable for California,
or in part of California, may have little or no relevance or practicality to the type of in-use regulation suitable
for another area. Such regulations which primarily effect local users are more appropriately controlled and implemented
by local and state governments. 

Moreover, section 209(d) of the Act clearly limits the preemption of state regulation in use. It states that ``nothing
in this part shall preclude or deny to any other State or political subdivision thereof the right otherwise to control,
regulate, or restrict the use, operation or movement of registered or licensed motor vehicles.'' As was stated above,
section 209 as a whole applies equally to nonroad engines. Thus, section 209(d) should be interpreted to mean that,
unless state regulation of use of nonroad engines is specifically preempted, section 209 should not be interpreted
to grant any implicit preemption, except within the framework of 

Allway Taxi

. 

Given the language of section 209 and the lack of any express preemption, the legislative history of these provisions,
and the general presumption against providing broad preemption where such preemption is not made explicit, EPA believes
that it is clear that section 209(e)(2) does not apply to in use regulation of nonroad engines. 

While EPA recognizes the important principle of narrowly construing the preemptive effect of the Act as explained
in 

Allway Taxi

, EPA also notes that certain state regulations that may be characterized as ``in-use'' regulations may be preempted
because they are effectively regulations on the design of new engines rather than on the use of ``in-use'' engines.
Industry has expressed concern that states might impose retrofit requirements on nonroad engines and vehicles as
soon as they are introduced into commerce, or when such engines are being rebuilt, or at a date after which nonroad engines
are typically rebuilt.

18

 EPA recognizes that CARB does not envision a retrofit requirement and that, because of the nature of the nonroad market,
it is unlikely that other states would adopt such a requirement.

19

 However, given EPA's definition of new and the scope of the definition within this rulemaking, this issue could arise
when other states plan their in-use emission strategy. In such a case, EPA believes that a retrofit requirement mandating
a retrofit of a nonroad engine immediately after the engine is no longer new is adverse to the Congressional intent
of section 209(e) and the principles laid out in 

Allway Taxi

. Therefore, in this scenario, such a retrofit requirement would be deemed an in-use emission standard relating back
to the original design of the new engine by the original engine manufacturer (OEM) and would be subject to the waiver
criteria of section 209(e)(2). Within this same scenario, only California could adopt such a requirement and other
states could only adopt California's requirement if California subsequently was granted a waiver. However, after
a reasonable amount of time has passed and the engine is no longer new (most likely when an engine is being rebuilt),
modest retrofit requirements would most likely not be deemed to significantly affect the OEM and thus such requirements
would not be subject to subsection 209(e)(2). In this second scenario, the modest retrofit requirements would still
be subject to challenge in court under the 

Allway Taxi

 criteria.

Therefore, the Agency has determined that nonroad engines and nonroad vehicles will be ``new'' for purposes of the
Act until the equitable or legal title passes to the ultimate purchaser, or if title passage does not occur, then the
engine or vehicle will be new until placed into service. 


D. Definition of Farm Equipment 


The NPRM defined ``farm equipment'' to mean any internal combustion engine-powered machine primarily used in the
commercial production and/or harvesting of food, fiber, wood, or commercial organic products.

Several manufacturers and trade groups were concerned that the definition was too narrow. These commenters thought
it necessary to change the words ``primarily used in'' to ``designed for use in''. They asserted that the designer
is the only one who knows what tasks a particular machine was meant to perform. They also thought that the definition
should include engines used in post-harvest processing and storage that take place on the farm (the U.S. Department
of Agriculture had a similar comment) and transportation which takes place on the farm. Caterpillar, Inc., PPEMA,
EMI and others were concerned that the word ``commercial'' might exclude equipment used in the public sector (

e.g., 

state agricultural programs) or on cooperative or communal farms.

CARB, SDAPCB, and MECA, on the other hand, thought the definition was too broad. CARB and SDAPCB believed that the word
``commercial'' was not only necessary but needed to be defined. Suggestions for the definition were supplied. MECA
suggested that the definition should be site and use specific. CARB also thought the wording should be changed to ``production


and

 harvesting'' in place of 

``and/or''.

 CARB provided their characterization of typical farm equipment (self-propelled and operated independent of other
equipment) and a partial list of pieces of equipment that should not be included under the definition of farm equipment
(utility vehicles used by a farmer to check his crops or portable power units used to generate electricity for another
piece of equipment).

EPA does not believe that ``designed for use in'' should be added to the definition of nonroad engine. While a machine's
designer may have designed the machine with certain tasks in mind, EPA believes that the intention of the designer
is less important than the actual use to which the equipment is put. A machine may have been designed to assist farmers
in some process, but if more than 50 percent of these machines are now used by homeowners, it may fairly be considered
other than farm equipment. Requiring that equipment ``be designed for use'' on a farm would also leave the categorization
of farm equipment entirely up to the manufacturers who might, in turn, choose to categorize products as farm equipment
merely to avoid state regulation. Additionally, although requested, commenters have not provided examples of where
the absence of ``designed for'' in the definition would make a difference in the preemption of some engines.

EPA also did not agree with CARB's description of farm and non-farm equipment because it did not address the machines
which are likely to be used in both situations. Classifying equipment that is uniquely farm or non-farm related is
straightforward. The more difficult equipment to characterize is multiple use equipment. Whether and when such
equipment is preempted from state regulation is addressed under Section G_the Application of Definitions, Primary
Use Test section of this rule.

 CARB's further comment, that EPA should require that equipment be involved in both production and harvesting in order
to be considered farm equipment, does not account for the specialization of farm machinery. Most farm equipment is
used for a specific job: cultivating, planting, harvesting, etc., rather than for tasks involving both production
and harvesting. The impetus for CARB's comment is the desire to separate the harvest of tree farms from that of natural
forests which might contain no element of production and to ensure that landscaping and groundskeeping are not considered
farming.

Under EPA's definition, however, harvesting trees from a natural forest is considered farming. Plant nurseries
would also be considered farming, as plants are a product that is grown and gathered. The American Association of Nurserymen
supported the proposed definition. At the same time, CARB's concern that landscaping and groundskeeping might be
considered farming is alleviated. Although cutting and trimming are involved in these operations, production and
harvesting are not, so equipment used would not be farm equipment unless used primarily on farms. (See Scope of Preemption
section)

MECA suggested that the definition be changed to ``. . . used 

on a farm 

. . .'' to require site specificity. While most of the preempted equipment is operated on farms, EPA
has not included this suggestion out of concern that it may create ambiguity for some operations, like plant nurseries.

The SDAPCB was also concerned that the phrase ``commercial organic products'' would allow some chemical and man-made
products to be considered farm produce and thus their associated processing equipment to be considered farm equipment.
The list of acceptable farm products is broad and may include items not generally considered farm products. However,
the equipment used in any processing after the harvest is not considered farm equipment. Thus, equipment used to make
chemical or man-made products would not be considered farm equipment.

As noted in the NPRM, EPA intended harvesting to be the last operation in the farming process to be considered ``farming''
and, therefore, equipment that performed any function later in the process, 

i.e., 

processing or storing, would not be preempted. However, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) commented that
all activities associated with planting, harvesting and on-farm processing of agricultural products for use on
the farm should be considered farm activities. The Nisei Farmers League had similar comments with respect to on-farm
activities although they did not limit the operations to those preparing products for further use on the farm. Therefore,
EPA decided that equipment used in certain post-harvesting operations will be accepted within the preemption category
when they relate directly to the continued operation of the farm. Those activities include such things as grinding,
drying, and storage operations of products usually used in the future on the farm. Examples of crops subject to these
activities are hay, silage, and other animal feed. For less traditional agricultural operations such as nurseries,
equipment used in similar operations will also be considered farm equipment. Machinery that is used on crops for continued
use in that agricultural operation, such as conveyors (hay bale loaders) and ensiles, will be considered farm equipment.
Post-harvest processing of crops in preparation for sale will not be considered farm operations.

SDAPCB expressed the concern that the definition is so broad that it could limit the state's ability to regulate stationary
equipment used in the refining, handling, cleaning or processing of food products. We believe that the above discussion
of what post-harvesting processing may still be considered farming should alleviate that concern.

EMI supplied EPA with a proposed definition which many others supported.

21

 EPA's definition is nearly as inclusive as EMI's definition. One of the differences between the two was the inclusion
in the EMI definition of storage and processing activities of the harvested product. EPA's resolution of how such
activities should be treated is discussed above. Another difference was EMI's inclusion of off-road transportation.
We do not believe that such nonroad vehicles should usually be considered farm equipment as they are primarily used
to transport persons or property on or off farms and are not unique to farms. EMI's definition also could include vehicles
which are frequently used for property maintenance of a sort which is also not unique to farms. EMI noted at the public
hearing that under its definition such equipment as lawn mowers would be included.

22

 Such a definition of farm equipment is overly broad.






EPA has decided to define ``commercial'' in the final rule as ``an activity engaged in as a vocation.'' Farming does
not have to be the sole or primary vocation. If a person engages in vocations in addition to farming, farming would still
be a vocation. EPA believes that a dollar threshold would not serve the purpose of distinguishing residential from
commercial use. EPA defined farm equipment as equipment used for ``commercial'' purposes to prevent the inclusion
of such activities as backyard gardening in the definition of farming. There is no reason to believe that Congress
meant to include equipment used in these operations which are not conventionally considered to be farms. Thus, equipment
used on an agricultural school farm would fall under this definition of commercial because it is equipment used to
educate students to farm as a vocation. Also, equipment used on farms that grow crops only for livestock would be considered
to be farm equipment. Finally, equipment would be farm equipment if found on ``subsistence'' farms, defined by Webster's
New Collegiate Dictionary as farming that provides all or almost all the goods required by the farm family usually
without any significant surplus for sale. EMA and PPEMA's suggestion that any piece of equipment that is used on a farm
is farm equipment would preclude from potential CARB regulation many types of machines that are incidental to living
on a farm and not used in operations normally associated with growing or harvesting agricultural products. An example
would be the lawn mowers that EMI said should be deemed farm equipment.

In the final rule, farm equipment is defined as any internal combustion engine-powered machine primarily used in
the commercial production and/or harvesting of food, fiber, wood, or commercial organic products or for the processing
of such products for further use on the farm.



E. Definition of Construction Equipment 



The NPRM stated that ``construction equipment'' means any internal combustion engine-powered machine primarily
used on commercial construction sites.

Many of the comments concerning this definition were similar to those comments provided regarding the definition
of farm equipment. Several manufacturers and trade groups were concerned that the definition was too narrow. They
thought it necessary to change the words ``primarily used in'' to ``designed for use in.'' Caterpillar, the Construction
Industry Manufacturer's Association (CIMA) and others were concerned that the word ``commercial'' might exclude
equipment used on public works projects or in residential construction. The EPA exclusion of mining equipment from
this preempted category drew unfavorable comments from EMA, EMI, CIMA, and the American Mining Congress (AMC). The
American Association of Nurserymen (AAN) requested that EPA explicitly recognize that landscape contracting involves
earthmoving and is thus construction. 

CARB, SDAPCB and MECA, on the other hand, thought the definition was too broad. CARB and SDAPCB recommended that all
auxiliary equipment such as compressors and pumps be excluded from preemption. Both believed that the phrase ``commercial
construction sites'' be defined. MECA suggested that the definition should be site and use specific. Both CARB and
SDAPCB approved of our mining equipment exclusion. 

EPA's response to the comments that the phrase ``designed for'' should be part of the construction equipment definition
is identical to the Agency's response to the same comments under the Definition of ``farm equipment'' section of this
rule. Please refer to that section for further discussion. 

The comments on the use of the word ``commercial'' may be approached in a manner similar to the way they were addressed
under the definition of ``farm equipment.'' EPA believes that defining ``commercial'' in the final rule as ``an activity
engaged in as a vocation'' is as appropriate in the context of construction equipment as it is in the context of farm
equipment. ``Commercial'' in the construction equipment definition is meant to distinguish equipment that homeowners
typically use to perform repairs on their own property from equipment typically used by contractors. Construction
of public works projects is ``commercial'' under this definition. 

MECA suggested that the definition be changed to ``. . . used 

in construction and located

 on . . .'' to specify the activity involved. This is a reasonable suggestion. EPA believes that including
these recommended words in the definition will make it clear that the function of machinery is as important as its location
on a site on which construction occurs. 

EMA, EMI, CIMA, AMC and others pointed out that mining operations (surface mining) share with construction sites
the use of many of the same machines. While this may be true, Congress expressed no intent to preempt from state regulation
equipment used in mining operations. According to Webster's Third New International Dictionary (1971 unabridged)
construction is ``the act of putting parts together to form a complete integrated object.'' Although EPA's definition
includes operations such as demolition and painting which take place outside the actual structural fabrication,
the definition still would not include mining, which Webster's defines as ``getting ore, metals, coal or precious
stones out of the earth.'' These are not construction activities. Additionally, underground mining usually employs
uniquely designed equipment unlike equipment found on a construction site. Surface mining, while sharing some equipment,
is a separate activity not associated with construction. The regulation of equipment, however, that is used in surface
mining and is also primarily used in construction activities, as defined in this rule, would be preempted. 

As discussed in the NPRM, a number of diverse activities take place on a construction site. Earthmoving is one such
activity, and thus, landscape contracting could use construction equipment as AAN notes. AAN made no mention of the
specific earthmoving equipment in question; thus, the primary use test (See Scope of Preemption section) must be
applied to such machinery. Groundskeeping is not a construction activity. AAN did state its support of EPA's definition
of construction equipment. 

Ingersoll-Rand thought that the words ``commercial'' and ``primary use'' should be deleted and that the definitions
of farm and construction equipment should be broadened to include any machine that includes an engine belonging to
an engine family which is used in construction equipment. The issue of commercial is considered above. Ingersoll-Rand's
use of the engine family concept is addressed, as is the primary use issue, in the Application of Definitions, Primary
Use Test section.

SDAPCB and CARB thought that the definition should exclude ancillary equipment such as electrical generators and
air compressors. CARB argued that these machines are not specifically construction machines in that they perform
the same functions in other types of applications. While this is true, such equipment may be employed in construction
activity; the question then becomes one of primary use, which is discussed in the Application of Definitions, Primary
Use Test section. 

For the reasons discussed above, construction equipment is defined in the final rule as any internal combustion engine-powered
machine primarily used in construction and located on commercial construction sites. 



F. Definition of Locomotive 



The NPRM defined locomotive as a self-propelled piece of on-track equipment (other than equipment designed for operation
both on highways and rails, specialized maintenance equipment, and other similar equipment) designed for moving
other equipment or carrying freight or passenger traffic or both. 

EMA noted a difference between the NPRM definition and the definition given in the Locomotive Inspection Act (LIA)
upon which the EPA definition was based, but did not recommend EPA use the LIA definition in the definition EMA provided.
The only difference between the EPA definition and the LIA definition is that the LIA definition of locomotive includes
a piece of equipment without propelling motors but with one or more control stands. This item was not included by EPA
since if it has no propelling motors it will not be of concern for purposes of engine emissions regulations. It is noted
that neither the Association of American Railroads (AAR) nor any railroad companies that commented on the NPRM, such
as Union Pacific and Southern Pacific, had any specific comments on the definition of locomotive. 

EMA provided definitions for ``locomotive'' and ``locomotive engine.''
 Under this definition, the regulation of any engine mounted on a locomotive (such as an engine driving a crane or winch)
would be preempted. The dictionary definition of ``locomotive'' is a ``self-propelled vehicle, usually diesel
or electric, that travels on rails and moves railroad cars.''
 






EMA's definition of locomotive engine goes beyond the specific purpose of locomotion to include any other engine
that might be placed on a locomotive. EPA believes that the term ``locomotive engine'' is limited to the engine used
to propel the locomotive and other railroad cars. However, EPA does believe that the term ``engines used in locomotives,''
as found in section 209(e)(1)(B), can be defined to include other engines which are mounted on a locomotive regardless
of whether they are used for purposes of self-propulsion. EPA notes that under this definitional framework the ``locomotive''
is only that piece of on-track equipment which is self-propelling and is designed for moving other cars containing
equipment, freight, or passengers. ``Engines used in locomotives'' thus includes an engine placed in the locomotive
to propel the train and also includes other engines mounted on the locomotive for auxiliary power generation for the
train, but does not include engines mounted on the train elsewhere than the locomotive. An engine providing power
for a crane or winch, for example, would only be considered preempted from state regulation (if it otherwise met the
requirements for ``new'') as ``an engine used in [a] locomotive'' if such engine were mounted on the locomotive. EPA
believes these definitions reflect the intent of Congress to reduce the burden on interstate commerce for the railroad
industry, and address EMA's concerns regarding auxiliary engines.
 





Regulation of auxiliary engines whose primary function are not for propulsion is addressed by EPA in its final regulation
for nonroad engines 37 kilowatt (50 hp) and above under section 213 of the Act.
 





EPA has stricken the word ``carrying'' from the definition of locomotive. This was done to avoid implying that any
persons or property that were moved by the engine had to be located directly on the locomotive. The word ``moving''
in the definition is all that is needed to give the correct meaning.

For the final rule, EPA has decided that a ``locomotive'' means a self-propelled piece of on-track equipment (other
than equipment designed for operation both on highways and rails, specialized maintenance equipment, and other
similar equipment) designed for moving other equipment, freight or passenger traffic. EPA has also decided that
the term ``engines used in locomotives'' means either an engine placed in the locomotive to move other equipment,
freight, or passenger traffic, or an engine mounted on the locomotive to provide auxiliary power. 


G. Application of Definitions; Primary Use Test 


1. Introduction 


EPA is defining farm equipment as any internal combustion engine-powered machine primarily used in the commercial
production and/or harvesting of food, fiber, wood, or commercial organic products or for the processing of such products
for further use on the farm. EPA is defining construction equipment as any internal combustion engine-powered machine
primarily used in construction and located on commercial construction sites. Many types of equipment are used almost
exclusively for farming and construction (

e.g.

, tractors and bulldozers). In the case of such equipment, the applicability of EPA's definition is clear: they are
farm or construction equipment and thus preempted from state regulation. Other types of equipment, however, are
used not only for farming or construction, but for other purposes as well (

e.g.

, pumps used for irrigation and swimming pools). The issue thus arises whether or not such multi-purpose equipment
should be considered farm or construction equipment and thus preempted from state regulation. 


2. EPA's Proposal 


In the NPRM, EPA proposed a ``primary use'' test to assess whether state regulation of multiple use equipment would
be preempted. EPA proposed that in order for state regulation to be preempted, equipment must be ``primarily used''_used
51 percent_as farm or construction equipment. Under this test, for example, a compressor used 51 percent in farming
or construction applications would be preempted from state regulation. EPA proposed 51 percent as a reasonable use
cut-off point because it corresponds to a bare ``majority''. EPA believed that the preempted category would be unreasonably
expanded if state regulation could be preempted simply because a small fraction of such equipment was used in farm
or construction applications. 


3. Comments on and Alternatives to EPA's Proposal 


During the comment period following the hearing EPA received comments from industry and CARB opposing the primary
use test. EMI, EMA, PPEMA, Industrial Truck Association (ITA), Construction Industry Air Quality Coalition (CIAQC),
and Ingersoll-Rand Company stated that the primary use test is unauthorized and should not be employed. They stated
that the plain meaning of the preemption provision does not permit EPA to apply a percentage test to determine if equipment
is farm or construction equipment. Congress, they contended, meant to preempt state regulation of all nonroad engines
used in farm or construction equipment, even if only a small fraction of the equipment is represented in these preempted
categories. CIMA commented that the proposed test would be unworkable because the data on which to base a primary use
finding are unavailable, and Deere and Company and others similarly stated that accurate data cannot be obtained,
in part because of the rental market. 
On the other side of the issue, CARB argued that the 51 percent primary use test is contrary to Congressional intent.
CARB noted that it is unlikely that Congress intended to so limit California's authority to control emissions from
nonroad sources given the broad waiver of federal preemption it provides California in the area of motor vehicle emission
control. 
CARB initially supported a position that equipment should be defined as farm or construction equipment only if more
than 75 percent of the equipment is used in farming or construction. CARB noted, in its comments supporting a 75 percent
cutoff, that this would ensure that state regulation would be preempted only for equipment primarily used on farm
or construction sites. Commenters submitted alternative proposals. 
EMA and the Outdoor Power Equipment Institute (OPEI) proposed that EPA should define the scope of preemption in terms
of the primary use of the engine family, not the equipment. EMA proposed that the Agency consider preempting for state
regulation any engine line ``used in'' farm or construction equipment regardless of the extent which the engine line
is used in other types of equipment. CARB and MECA both commented that only regulation of the individual engines actually
used in farm or construction equipment should be preempted. CARB also proposed that preemption apply only to regulation
of engines exclusively designed for and used in the farm and construction industries. Failing that, both CARB and
MECA believed that the 51 percent test for determining how equipment was primarily used was too low. CARB recommended
that state regulation of multiple-use equipment be preempted only if more than 75 percent of the equipment is used
in farming or construction. CARB noted that this would ensure that any preempted equipment was primarily used on farms
or at construction sites. 
PPEMA proposed that EPA use a different test to determine whether multi-use equipment should be considered farm or
construction equipment for purposes of determining the scope of federal preemption. This test would be that federal
preemption applies whenever equipment is used in more than 

de minimis

 amounts for farming or construction, and such equipment is necessary to perform farming and construction activities.
PPEMA did not state any criteria to be used in determining such a ``

de minimis

'' amount or determining what ``necessary'' is. PPEMA supported this proposal with several arguments. 
First, PPEMA argued that a 

de minimis

 test follows the plain language of the statute. PPEMA argued that the ``plain language'' of the statute does not include
modifiers such as ``primarily'' or ``predominantly'' and thus does not in any way imply that Congress intended for
EPA to apply a percentage test to determine if equipment was used for farming or construction. PPEMA contended that
Congress intended to preempt state regulation of all nonroad engines used in farm and construction equipment. 
Second, PPEMA argued that Congress explicitly limited the scope of preemption by specifying that preemption would
apply to regulation of engines used in farm and construction equipment smaller than 175 horsepower. Thus, according
to PPEMA, there is no need for EPA to clarify the scope of preemption further. 
PPEMA's final argument is that a 

de minimis

 test would not unduly expand the scope of federal preemption. Equipment would be preempted only if it were found in
more than 

de minimis

 amounts and were necessary to the performance of farm and construction operations. 


4. Response to Comments 


a. 

Primary Use Test

 
EPA has decided to apply the primary use test to determine which multiple-use equipment will be considered farm or
construction equipment and thus preempted from state regulation. As explained in the NPRM, the ``primary use'' test
is the most appropriate method for classifying (as farm or construction, or other) multiple use equipment. Industry
commenters who believe EPA must consider multiple-use equipment to be farm or construction equipment beg the question
of what is farm and construction equipment. Some industry commenters stated that EPA could not use the primary use
test because the language of section 209(e)(1) refers to new engines which are used in construction or farm equipment
or vehicles, not to engines which are ``primarily'' used in construction of farm equipment or vehicles. These comments
miss the point of the primary use test. The test is not used to define ``used in'', but is used to define ``construction
equipment'' and ``farm equipment''. In order to identify an engine used in farm or construction equipment, EPA must
first determine whether a piece of equipment is farm or construction equipment. Equipment used only incidentally
(perhaps 10 percent) in farm or construction applications is not fairly considered to be farm or construction equipment.
A type of equipment such as a pump, for example, is not farm equipment merely because it is used on a handful of farms and
otherwise used exclusively in residential settings. Therefore, the engine used in this type of equipment is not an
engine used in farm or construction equipment and, therefore, regulation of that engine type is not preempted.

EPA believes that the terms ``farm equipment'' and ``construction equipment'' are best identified by referring
to the general use of the equipment. EPA does not believe that the 

de minimis

 approach suggested by PPEMA is an appropriate approach to defining these terms. EPA does not believe that a piece of
equipment primarily used in non-construction or non-farming activities should be defined as construction or farm
equipment merely because it is or could be used for some farm or construction applications. Such a definition would
inappropriately expand the preempted categories. 
Similarly, EPA does not agree with CARB's initial proposal that equipment should be defined as farm and construction
equipment only if more than 75 percent of the equipment is used in farm or construction. EPA believes that the 51 percent
cutoff is a better measure of whether or not a piece of equipment is farm or construction equipment, especially given
Congress's apparent intent to protect new farm and construction equipment from state regulation. If equipment is
used more than half the time in farm or construction applications, then it should be considered farm or construction
equipment even if it has some applications outside of the farm or construction area. A 75 percent threshold would be
inappropriate because equipment that may be used regularly and predominantly in farm and construction applications
could still be used enough in other applications to prevent a 75 percent threshold to be met. EPA believes its final
decision on this issue will not unduly limit California's authority to control emissions from nonroad sources. 
Thus, EPA has decided to retain the 51 percent criterion for the primary use determination. It believes this criterion
is in keeping with Congress's implicit goal of striking a balance between the competing interests of national uniformity
of regulatory requirements and state control over sources of in-state pollution. This test still permits California
to regulate new engines that are installed in machines used in farms or at construction sites if most of such engines
are in equipment not used in those situations. 
Since the frequency with which multiple use equipment is used on farms or at construction sites ranges from ``almost
never'' to ``every day'', it is clear that a line must be drawn somewhere along this continuum. Many comments were received
addressing the selection of 51 percent as the primary use cut-off point. EPA selected it because it corresponds to
a bare ``majority''. 
As noted previously, PPEMA would like to see this limit lowered to 

de minimis

 amounts. This would mean that equipment used more often than this small amount in preempted categories would be judged
farm or construction equipment and thus its regulation would be preempted. Therefore, under such a limit, items such
as lawn mowers and hedge trimmers could be judged farm or construction equipment. EPA believes that this result, and
such a low threshold by which a lawn mower could be considered a piece of farm or construction equipment, is not consistent
with Congressional intent of preempting state regulation of new farm and construction equipment. 
No matter what number is chosen as the cutoff there will always be some categories of equipment that fall just above
or just below the line. No commenter has made a strong case for why EPA should select a cut-off point other than the 51
percent cut-off. EPA notes CARB's most recent submittal, dated July 20, 1993,

27

 (see discussion below) which recognizes the use of a primary use test by EPA.

EPA believes the primary use test is in keeping with Congress' implicit goal of striking a balance between the competing
interests of national uniformity of regulatory requirements and state control over sources of in-state pollution.
Under this test, equipment used for a majority of the time in farming and construction is preempted from California
regulation. Conversely, equipment used primarily by consumers and in consumer settings would more than likely be
subject to California regulation since their use in farming or construction would most likely not meet the primary
use test. This test, therefore, preempts California from regulating new engines that are installed in any equipment
which is primarily used in the commercial production and/or harvesting of food, fiber, wood, or commercial organic
products or for the processing of such products for further use on the farm. This test also preempts California from
regulating new engines that are installed in equipment which is primarily used in construction and located on commercial
construction sites. 
EPA's application of the primary use test in this rule is similar to the proposed application of the 51 percent primary
use test found in the notice of proposed rulemaking. That is, EPA believes that it is appropriate for CARB to make a preliminary
determination of primary use for multiple-use equipment that is in question in a CARB regulation such as the Utility
Engine Rule. (EPA's discussion of CARB's role in such determinations is found below in Section K). CARB will be required
to come forward with evidence, data, agreements with industry, and analysis to support a finding that a category or
subcategory of equipment is primarily not used in farm or construction applications and is thus subject to state regulation.

CARB and the major industry commenters had a series of meetings during which they discussed whether various types
of equipment should fall into a preempted category or a non-preempted category should EPA adopt its proposed primary
use test based on 51 percent usage. As a result, on July 20, 1993, EPA received a letter from CARB explaining the process
by which it and major industry commenters

28

 reached agreement on lists of equipment which would or would not be considered as farm or construction equipment based
on the primary use test as set out in the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking for this section 209(e) rule.

29

 CARB noted that EMI had not reached agreement with the primary use test but apparently was in agreement with the categorized
lists of equipment and this seems to be supported by EMI's letter to CARB during this time period.

30








EPA recognizes the significance of these lists for several reasons. The lists are intended to be exhaustive of all
equipment currently in existence, according to CARB, and eliminates uncertainty regarding the categorization,
as farm or construction or other, of any equipment currently in production. For any currently existing equipment
under 25 horsepower that is not considered on the list, EPA believes manufacturers will have the ability to petition
CARB for the appropriate categorization. Further, the lists of equipment are generic such that any modifications
to existing equipment types would fall into existing categories, with appropriate review by CARB, and thereby reduce
any burden on manufacturers to produce large amounts of new information to support their position that such modified
equipment is farm or construction. 
For newly developed equipment, which is not a modification of existing equipment or included on the lists, CARB and
manufacturers will classify it as preempted or non-preempted based upon, among other things, a description of the
equipment, its intended application, and projected sales market. EPA believes the classification process will
be clear and predictable and will not require substantial new information. It is anticipated that CARB and the manufacturers
will continue to work together to minimize the information gathering burden for the small number of newly developed
types of equipment.

<TEXT>
 

The existence of these lists is noted here merely as an example of how CARB and industry foresee the future categorization
of nonroad equipment. As CARB noted in its July 20, 1993 letter, EPA maintains its independent authority under section
209(e) to review each separate CARB nonroad authorization request and to determine, by examining data as explained
in section II(K) of this preamble, whether such equipment is indeed farm or construction equipment. 
b. 

Subcategorization

The USDA commented that some of California's suggested categories might be too inclusive because they were not subcategorized
as to professional or non-professional use, particularly chain saws. 

As noted in the NPRM, unless there is a very clear delineation of types of equipment within a category, all similar pieces
of equipment could remain together in one group rather than being split into multiple sub-groups. Not every product
may be susceptible to subcategorization because there may not be clear delineations defining types of equipment.
However, in cases when subcategories of equipment can be identified they should be separately grouped and not subjected
to state regulation. It would be inappropriate for California to regulate a subcategory of multiple-use equipment
which is primarily used as farm or construction equipment. In preparing its use determination California should
look carefully at whether there are subcategories of equipment that are primarily used on farms or construction sites.
California should not aggregate a group of equipment that can be subcategorized that is primarily used as farm or construction
equipment with subcategories that are not used as farm or construction equipment in order to extend its reach into
federally preempted categories. When commenters bring to EPA's attention a product that is primarily used as farm
or construction equipment but is also used in other applications, EPA will carefully review California's categorization
determination as part of its authorization process. 
c. Data for use determination
The preamble to the NPRM provided that in determining primary use California would consider national sales data to
demonstrate whether CARB's various equipment categories were or were not preempted. PPEMA, ITA and others commented
that sales data do not correlate with actual use and that hours-of-use would be a better measure. EMI, CIMA and others
were concerned with the year-to-year variability of sales, while OPEI and Caterpillar stated that accurate sales
data were not available. 
CARB suggested that, if a primary use test were used, it be permitted to apply the best data available in making its determination
and requested that national sales data, mentioned in the NPRM, not be mandated. EPA agrees that California should
employ the most relevant information and data at hand to make its determination of primary use. The classes of equipment
in the Utility Engine Rule regulation and in any potential future California regulations that may employ a usage test
are so varied and unique that EPA is not in a position to specify the type of data to be used. Therefore, EPA is not mandating
CARB to use any specific type of data, e.g. national sales data; however, California should select the appropriate
data base keeping in mind that EPA will review any use determination as part of an authorization request by California
under the preponderance of the evidence standard of review. (See discussion in Section K below regarding this standard
of proof.) 
d. Equipment versus engine line
The primary use test described in the NPRM is based upon an assessment of whether multiple use equipment is primarily
used as farm or construction equipment. Several commenters suggested that the preemption should be based instead
on a primary use test of an engine manufacturer's engine line. (An engine line is all the engines produced by a manufacturer
with many common characteristics such as number of cylinders, displacement, calibration, etc.) Two rules would
be followed under their suggested system: (1) state regulation of all engines used in farm and construction equipment
would be preempted, and (2) state regulation of all engines from an engine line 

which is primarily used in farm and construction equipment (no matter what else they are installed in) would be preempted.

Primary use would mean 51% under the engine line test also. Under this suggested system, in a situation in which 70 percent
of an engine line went to farm and construction equipment and 30 percent went to other equipment, regulation of the
entire engine line would be preempted. Thus state control of the 30 percent fraction of the engines would be preempted
even though they would be installed in equipment that could not be considered farm or construction equipment and that
Congress intended the state be allowed to regulate. If the fractions were reversed, state control of the 30 percent
fraction would be preempted since it was used in farm and construction equipment while state regulation of the 70 percent
fraction would not be preempted and would be subject to state requirements. 
The commenters suggest that the engine-line test is preferable because engines are generally designed by engine-line,
not by equipment. Under the equipment-based test, engine manufacturers would have to divide their engine lines based
on the use of the engines in equipment. Thus, the exact same engines might have to be divided into two families. 
In the equipment application method, if an engine manufacturer has an engine line where 70 percent of the engines go
to farm and construction equipment (and their regulation would therefore be preempted) and 30 percent go to other
equipment (and state regulation would not be preempted), the manufacturer must decide whether to split the engine
line and manufacture the 30 percent portion of the engines to meet California's standards (and label them as such)
or discontinue the production of those engines for California.

31

 If the example is reversed with 70 percent of the engines going into other equipment and 30 percent going into farm and
construction, the manufacturer could decide to produce and certify its entire line to meet California's standards
or to split its engine line into two separate engine types_one certified for sale in California and one not. Therefore,
under the equipment-based test, equipment manufacturers would have to maintain an awareness of their California
and non-California markets and specify the number of engines of each type they will need. 




However, engine manufacturers may also have to divide their engine lines under their proposed engine-line approach.
If 30 percent of an engine line is used in farm and construction equipment and the remainder is used in non-preempted
equipment, then under the commenters' plan, the engine line would be split, because 30 percent of the engine line would
be preempted but the remainder would be subject to state regulation. Therefore, the problem the commenters sought
to avoid would not be avoided. 
On the other hand, there are several advantages of an equipment-based determination. The only requirement of an equipment-based
determination would be to develop two lists_one of farm and construction equipment and one of other equipment (non-farm
and non-construction equipment). With these two lists the equipment manufacturer knows the type of engine it needs
in each piece of equipment produced_either a preempted (farm or construction) engine or an engine that complies with
California emission requirements if California has such requirements.

<TEXT>
 

Enforcement under the equipment-based method would be relatively simple. An inspector would only have to determine
whether a piece of equipment was farm or construction equipment, or an other type of equipment. If it is farm or construction
equipment, nothing more need be done, as the piece of equipment would not be subject to state regulation. If it is not
farm or construction equipment, the inspector need only look for the required CARB label if there are California standards
for that type of equipment. Enforcement would require additional steps if an engine line based system were used: for
example, the inspector would have to determine whether a non-preempted piece of equipment contained an engine from
a manufacturer who claimed its entire engine line as preempt from state regulation. 

If the primary use determination were based on an engine line, EPA would have several concerns. As with the equipment
based method, two equipment lists would still be developed, but additionally each engine line for every engine manufacturer
must be determined to be preempted or not after gathering data on whether the engines were now installed in farm or construction
equipment. This would add another layer of calculations to the process. According to many of those who commented at
the public hearing, engine destination data are difficult to obtain. In a case where most engines in an engine line
are used in non-preempted equipment, the engine line would be split, causing the same burden as manufacturers stated
would occur in the equipment-based method and which they wanted to avoid. Additionally, this method would give a competitive
advantage to manufacturers who now make engine lines which are primarily used in farm and construction equipment.
Such manufacturers, who have engines for which state regulation is preempted, would enjoy an advantage over a manufacturer
whose engines are not preempted and therefore must meet California's emission standards. Ford Motor Company recognized
this issue and expressed its concerns and disagreement with EMA on this issue. 

EPA is also concerned that the commenters' method would be contrary to section 209 in that it is overinclusive and inconsistent
in its definition of farm and construction equipment. Under the commenters' method, if 70 percent of the engines in
an engine line were used in farm and construction equipment and 30 percent were used in other equipment, the entire
engine line would be preempted. Thus, the regulation of some engines would be preempted even though they are not used
in farm or construction equipment. This would create a preemption greater than that contemplated by the statute.
Moreover, the method is inconsistent in application: if 70 percent of the engines in an engine line were used in non-preempted
equipment but the remainder were used in farm or construction equipment, California could only regulate 70 percent
of the engines, not 100 percent. Therefore, the method gives engine manufacturers the benefit of full preemption
when the majority of the engines are preempted, but it does not allow full California regulation if the majority of
the engines are not preempted. This inconsistency appears arbitrary and could result in higher emissions (as noted
by Ford Motor Company) because California would be precluded from regulating engines that it would otherwise be able
to regulate under a more evenhanded approach. 

Furthermore, this approach does not solve the question that is at the heart of the ``primary use'' issue: 

i.e.,

 when should a multiple use piece of equipment be defined as farm and/or construction equipment? In order to determine
whether an engine line is being used 30 percent in farm and construction equipment or 70 percent in farm or construction
equipment, one still must know what is meant by farm and construction equipment. This approach, taken by itself, does
not provide an answer. Finally, manufacturers did not explain how a newly developed engine line would be judged (preempted
or non-preempted) since there would be no existing data upon which to base a determination. 

EMA stated that the equipment-based method would result in higher certification costs than the engine-line method.
EPA believes that under both methods, engine manufacturers could face additional costs for any engine they wished
to certify for sale in California. These costs would include research and development expenses to develop a cleaner
engine, and administrative and testing expenses associated with the state certification process. Those engine
manufacturers who chose to compete in the California market would face higher certification costs than those who
did not, but there should be little difference in certification costs between the two methods. 

In the final rule, rather than use the engine-line method, EPA is requiring a primary use test that preempts California
from regulating new engines that are installed in equipment that is primarily used in farming or construction settings.




H. Labeling Requirement 



The NPRM would require engine manufacturers to label new engines which are used in construction equipment or vehicles
or used in farm equipment or vehicles and which are smaller than 175 horsepower. The label would state to which standard
or standards (California, Federal, or both) the engine is certified. 

Most commenters opposed the labeling requirement. CARB stated that it intended to require labels on engines that
comply with California emission regulations. CARB, EMI, and EMA agreed that a federal labeling requirement was not
appropriate until EPA determined under section 213 whether federal standards were necessary. In fact, EMI argued
that authority for labeling lies in section 213, not section 209(e). 

EPA has decided to not implement a labeling requirement under section 209(e). It should be noted that the regulation
setting forth federal nonroad standards under section 213 contains a labeling requirement.

I. Authorization Criteria and Procedures 



In the NPRM, EPA noted that sections 209(b) and (e) are in many respects alike and in those respects should be similarly
interpreted. One difference between the two provisions that the Agency identified, however, was an apparent difference
in the sequence of California and EPA actions. In this regard, EPA focused on the following language of section 209(b):





  (b)(1) The Administrator shall, after notice and opportunity for public hearing, waive application
of this section to any State which 

has adopted standards

 . . . for the control of emissions from new motor vehicles or new motor vehicle engines 

prior to March 30, 1966.

 . . . (Emphasis added.) 




EPA interpreted the phrase ``has adopted'' to mean that the Administrator could waive the prohibition of section
209(a) after a state has adopted standards. By contrast, section 209(e)(2) provides that ``the Administrator shall
. . . authorize California to adopt and enforce motor vehicle emission standards.'' EPA concluded
that the difference in language indicated that California must receive authorization from EPA before it can adopt
any nonroad standards or requirements. 



CARB took issue with EPA's interpretation of section 209(e)(2) as requiring California to obtain authorization
before adopting regulations. It believed that for several reasons, EPA could and should follow the same process under
section 209(e) as it follows in granting motor vehicle waivers under section 209(b). First, CARB argued that although
section 209(e) states that ``the Administrator shall . . . authorize California to adopt and enforce
standards . . . ,'' sections 209(a) and (b) could be similarly construed when read together.
Section 209(a) states that ``no state . . . shall adopt or attempt to enforce. . . .''
The only exception to the prohibition is if the Administrator grants a waiver under section 209(b). Thus, considered
together, sections 209(a) and (b) could be construed to preclude prior adoption of a regulation by a state unless a
waiver is granted. 

CARB noted that despite this language, EPA has consistently interpreted sections 209(a) and (b) to provide that the
waiver process commences after state regulatory adoption. EPA's rationale has been that the Administrator should
consider a ``final'' regulation when making a determination to waive federal preemption of state regulations that
may differ from federal regulations. Between the time CARB holds a hearing on a proposed regulation and submission
of the final regulation to the California Office of Administrative Law (OAL), significant changes could be made to
the regulation. Under the California procedures for adopting regulations, CARB releases a ``Staff Proposal: Initial
Statement of Reasons for Proposed Rulemaking'' along with a Notice for Public Comment. The comment period is forty-five
days. A Board hearing takes place at the end of this forty-five day period. CARB makes modifications to the regulation
after the hearing. These modifications are made available for public comment for fifteen days. CARB then prepares
a ``Final Statement of Reasons for Rulemaking'' in which it addresses changes made to the regulation and summarizes
and responds to all comments received during the public comment period. This document is submitted to the Executive
Officer, who signs an Executive Order which formally adopts the final version of the regulations. Then CARB is required
to submit the final regulation to OAL, which reviews regulations adopted by state agencies. OAL has thirty days to
review and either approve or disapprove. It has authority to disapprove if (1) the regulation is inconsistent with
California law or (2) improper procedure has been followed. If OAL disapproves, CARB has 120 days to modify the regulation,
re-adopt, and re-submit the regulation to OAL.

33

 





Thus, significant changes could be made to a regulation between the CARB hearing and adoption as well as after CARB
adoption due to the review by OAL. If significant changes were to occur, the waiver California received would be insufficient
to cover the regulations as adopted and California would be forced to reapply for a waiver of a now final regulation.


EPA finds California's argument persuasive. As an initial matter, the Agency no longer believes that the difference
in language between sections 209(b) and (e) was intended to delineate a difference in the sequence of events surrounding
adoption and authorization. The use of the past tense in section 209(b) (``has adopted'') was merely intended to identify
the states that could obtain a waiver for motor vehicle standards. (In fact, California alone had adopted such standards
prior to March 30, 1966, and therefore, all other states have been prohibited from adopting emission control standards
for new motor vehicles except as provided under section 177.) EPA also acknowledges that sections 209(a) and (b) could
be read to require California to obtain a waiver prior to adopting motor vehicle standards, but the Agency has not so
interpreted these provisions. Therefore, sections 209(b) and (e) need not be interpreted as requiring different
adoption and authorization processes. 

Moreover, EPA believes section 209(e) should be interpreted to allow a process like that established under section
209(b) for the same reasons EPA construed 209(b) to permit California to seek a waiver after it has adopted motor vehicle
standards. It is inefficient for EPA to rule on a waiver or authorization request for what amounts to a regulatory recommendation.
Until California adopts its program, neither California nor EPA can be sure that the program for which a waiver or authorization
is requested is the program that the responsible official will sign into law. If there is a difference between the program
submitted to EPA by California and the program California eventually adopts, any waiver or authorization granted
may be insufficient to cover the enacted program. 

In fact, EPA received comments that illustrate the confusion that would result if California were required to receive
EPA authorization before it could adopt final regulations. Several commenters were concerned that CARB had modified
its proposed Utility Engine Rule twice since CARB had requested EPA authorization in December 1990. The commenters
requested that EPA clarify that it will grant authorization based on the most recent version it has received from CARB
and that if any changes are made after an authorization is granted, California must resubmit its authorization request.
EPA believes that today's change allowing California to adopt before receiving EPA authorization resolves this
confusion and inefficiency.

34

 





At the same time, EPA does not believe that section 209(e) may be interpreted to permit California to enforce any nonroad
regulations before receiving authorization. Were California to enforce its regulations before it receives authorization,
it would defeat the protection section 209(e) was established to provide_that California's nonroad program only
go forward if EPA authorizes it in accordance with the provisions of that section. Thus, EPA believes that while California
may adopt nonroad regulations before receiving EPA authorization, its adoption must be conditioned upon EPA's authorizing
those regulations under 209(e). In short, California may adopt, but not enforce, nonroad standards prior to EPA authorization.


Regarding the authorization criteria, EPA proposed that the first two criteria be interpreted the same as for section
209(b). These criteria are first, that no waiver or authorization shall be granted if EPA finds that California's
determination that its standards will be, in the aggregate, at least as protective of public health and welfare as
applicable Federal standards is arbitrary and capricious. Second, no waiver or authorization shall be granted if
California does not need such standards to meet compelling and extraordinary conditions. 

The language of the third criterion, however, was not as clearly similar to section 209(b). Section 209(e)(2)(A)(iii)
stated that no authorization shall be granted if ``California standards and accompanying enforcement procedures
are not consistent with this section.'' EPA proposed that ``this section'' be interpreted to mean consistent with
sections 209(a) and 209(e)(1). 

Commenters disagreed with EPA's proposed interpretation of ``consistent with this section,'' stating that ``consistent
with section 209'' should mean all of section 209, particularly section 209(b). Some commenters also proposed that
``consistent with this section'' should include section 213. 

EPA has determined that, given the plain language of section 209(e), interpreting ``consistent with this section''
to mean ``consistent with section 213'' is not a reasonable statutory interpretation. The phrase ``consistent with
this section'' clearly refers to section 209, not section 213. EMA proposed to interpret this phrase to refer to section
222 of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. This would require consistency with both sections 209 and 213 of the Act.
Absent any legislative history to explain the intent of ``consistent with this section'', however, this interpretation
would give to the phrase a meaning clearly different than its plain meaning in light of its placement in section 209
alone.

The Agency has decided, however, that it is reasonable and effects Congressional intent to interpret ``consistent
with this section'' to include all of section 209, including section 209(b)(1)(C). Hence, EPA believes that it should
review nonroad authorization requests under the same ``consistency'' criterion that it reviews motor vehicle waiver
requests. 
Under section 209(b)(1)(C), the Administrator shall not grant California a motor vehicle waiver if she finds that
California standards and accompanying enforcement procedures are not consistent with section 202(a) of the Act.
EPA has interpreted this criterion in previous motor vehicle waiver decisions. First, California's standards are
not consistent with section 202(a) if there is inadequate lead time to permit the development of technology necessary
to meet those requirements, giving appropriate consideration to the cost of compliance within that time frame. Second,
California's accompanying enforcement procedures would be inconsistent with section 202(a) if the federal and
California test procedures were inconsistent, that is, manufacturers would be unable to meet both the state and the
federal test requirements with one test vehicle or engine. 
EPA's review of nonroad authorization requests will include the following. First, CARB must request EPA authorization
of its adopted nonroad standards. Second, EPA shall not grant an authorization if (1) EPA determines that CARB's ``in
the aggregate'' determination is arbitrary and capricious; (2) California does not need such standards to meet compelling
and extraordinary conditions; and (3) if California's nonroad standards are not consistent with section 209, 

i.e.,

 that they not be inconsistent with section 209(a), section 209(e), and section 209(b), as EPA has interpreted that
subsection in the context of motor vehicle waivers. 


J. State Adoption of California Standards and Test Procedures 


EPA received comments on several aspects regarding how other states may adopt California nonroad standards and test
procedures. First, both EMA and EMI argued that other states that decide to adopt California standards should be subject
to the same process as California. However, the Act neither requires that states obtain EPA authorization to impose
California's nonroad engine standards nor authorizes the Agency to require that states do so. Under section 209(e)(2)(B),
any state which has plan provisions approved under part D of Title I of the Act (generally states within ozone nonattainment
areas) may adopt and enforce, ``after notice to the Administrator,'' California standards. Language requiring
that other states request and receive authorization from EPA is noticeably absent. Indeed, the statutory text reads
as 

authorizing states

 to adopt California standards on their own volition. In contrast, section 209(e)(2)(A) clearly states that California
must receive authorization from EPA. Moreover, the language of section 209(e)(2)(B) is nearly identical to section
177 which provides that ``any state which has plan provisions approved under this part may adopt and enforce'' California
motor vehicle emission standards. Under section 177 New York, Massachusetts and Maine have adopted California standards,
and other states are considering following suit. These States did not ask for EPA authorization before they adopted
the California standards, nor did EPA or the automobile industry suggest that they needed such authorization.
 




Several commenters stated that section 209(e)(2)(B) required that California be subject to a two-year lead time
requirement. EPA does not agree with this interpretation. Section 209(e)(2)(A) requires EPA to authorize California
regulation of nonroad engines unless the Administrator makes certain findings, including that California's standards
are ``not consistent with this section.'' As discussed earlier, EPA interprets that phrase as requiring that California's
standards are technologically feasible in the available lead time. Since California is thus required to provide
adequate lead time under section 209(e)(2)(A), it would not make sense to interpret section 209(e)(2)(B) as independently
requiring at least two years of lead time. Instead, EPA interprets section 209(e)(2)(B)'s reference to two years
of lead time in the same way it interprets the virtually identical provision in section 177: that an adopting state
must provide two years of lead time before the California standards take effect in the adopting state and California
must have adopted standards two years before commencement of the period for which the standards take effect in the
adopting state, but California may adopt standards having less than two years of lead time in California.


K. Rulemaking Procedure 


In the NPRM, EPA proposed definitions for the new engines used in the preempted categories: farm equipment, construction
equipment, and locomotives. For equipment types that are used in a variety of applications, EPA also proposed a primary
use test to assess whether such equipment is primarily used as farm or construction equipment. New engines used primarily
in this equipment would be preempted from state regulation. EPA proposed that in determining ``primary use'', CARB
would use sales data to show that an equipment type was or was not primarily used in farming or construction. When CARB
requested EPA to authorize its proposed regulations, EPA would review California's determination regarding the
primary use of particular equipment. 
In the Proposed Authorization Decision, 53 FR 45876, September 6, 1991, EPA proposed to review the decision California
made regarding the primary use of nonroad equipment under an arbitrary and capricious standard of review, the standard
of review that section 209(e)(2) requires that the Administrator use in reviewing California's determination that
its standards ``will be, in the aggregate, at least as protective of public health and welfare as applicable Federal
standards.'' 
Several commenters, including EMA, EMI, PPEMA, and the Railway Engineering-Maintenance Suppliers Association,
Inc. (REMSA) stated that EPA's proposed approach to determining the primary use of nonroad engines and equipment
inappropriately relinquished authority to California. They pointed out that the primary use determination goes
to the scope of the federal preemption accorded by section 209(e)(1), and argued that such a threshold determination
should be made by EPA, not California. To the extent that California did have a role in determining primary use, they
urged that EPA apply a clear and compelling evidence standard of review instead of the less strict arbitrary and capricious
test in reviewing California's determinations. 
EPA believes these commenters are essentially correct in that the scope of federal preemption is not for California
to decide and that EPA should have a greater role in making that determination than the Agency's proposal would have
required. At the same time, EPA sees nothing wrong with having California make a preliminary determination as to the
use of nonroad engines and equipment. California's coming forward with the evidence and analysis to support such
a determination is in keeping with the role California has with regard to other aspects of the waiver and authorization
requests it makes under section 209. 
Notably, sections 209(b) and (e) expressly place the burden of coming forward on California only with regard to the
determination of the aggregate protectiveness of California's program. Nevertheless, under section 209(b) California
has traditionally addressed not only the protectiveness determination but also the other two criteria set forth
in section 209(b)(1)(B) and (C). This approach simply reflects the fact that California is the party interested in
obtaining the waiver. Similarly, under section 209(e) EPA believes it appropriate for California to make a preliminary
use determination (primary use, as discussed above) based on the available evidence and for EPA to review that determination
in light of any public comments and additional evidence received. 
EPA agrees with the industry commenters that the arbitrary and capricious standard of review is not appropriate for
review of California's primary use determination. The arbitrary and capricious standard is generally applied in
two types of circumstances: (1) where the decision-maker must apply his expertise to resolve complex issues, or (2)
where the decision-maker has been accorded discretion in making the decision under review. Underlying the arbitrary
and capricious standard is a recognition that the reviewing authority either does not have as much expertise as the
decision-maker or that the judgment of the reviewing authority should not be substituted for that of the decision-maker
to whom discretion has been granted. An illustration of this approach to application of the arbitrary and capricious
standard of review is Congress' specification of that standard for California's protectiveness determination
under section 209. The legislative history of that section makes clear that Congress sought to give California broad
leeway to design a program that in California's judgment was best suited to the unique set of circumstances faced by
that state.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940720-0-00117 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940720-0-00007 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Neither reason for applying the arbitrary and capricious standard of review applies to California's primary use
determinations. California does not have unique expertise in determining the use of nonroad engines and equipment.
Nor is there any indication that Congress sought to accord California discretion to determine the scope of federal
preemption. Indeed the fact that Congress prohibited 

all

 state regulation of certain categories of new nonroad equipment and required California to obtain EPA authorization
to regulate any other categories suggests a strong congressional interest in limiting state regulation affecting
makers of new nonroad engines and equipment. While preemption provisions are generally construed narrowly, congressional
intent to prohibit states from regulating in certain areas must also be safeguarded. EPA believes the arbitrary and
capricious standard of review would not sufficiently reflect congressional intent to prohibit state regulation
of farm and construction equipment. 
At the same time, EPA does not believe that the much stricter clear and compelling evidence standard suggested by CIAQC
is the appropriate standard of review. CIAQC argued that in 

Motor and Equipment Manufacturers Association, Inc.,

 627 F.2d 1095, (D.C. Cir. 1979) (

MEMA I

), the court found that the Administrator's use of a clear and compelling evidence standard to evaluate California's
request for a waiver for enforcement procedures was valid. EPA disagrees with CIAQC's application of 

MEMA I. 
As an initial matter, MEMA I 

does not deal with the threshold matter of the scope of preemption. On such matters the court is silent as to the appropriate
standard of review beyond providing general guiding principles. Instead, the court focuses on the standard of review
to be employed by EPA on California's protectiveness determination. In fact, the section of the decision cited by
CIAQC focuses on this issue, not on the issue of preemption. There the court not only states that California's determination
is presumed to satisfy the waiver requirements, but that the burden of proving otherwise falls on the party attacking
the determination. It is in this context that the court notes that the Administrator determined that there must be
``clear and compelling evidence'' to show that California's proposed procedures 

undermine

 the protectiveness of California's standards. It is in the context of a party challenging California's protectiveness
determination that the clear and compelling standard comes into play. Thus, EPA believes that the clear and compelling
standard is neither applicable nor appropriate for its review of CARB's primary use determination. 
The Agency considers the preponderance of the evidence standard of review to be appropriate for its review of California's
primary use determination. If EPA were to make the determination itself, it would apply such a test in making it. There
is no reason to apply a different test simply because California has made an initial determination. Public commenters
may supplement the record assembled by California in support of its determination, and the Agency will weigh all the
evidence in reviewing California's determination. To the extent California's determination is supported by a preponderance
of the evidence in the record, EPA will accept it. 
Several commenters stated that EPA was denying interested parties their due process rights by attempting to consider
California's request for authorization for its Utility Engine Rule at the same time it is seeking comment on its proposed
criteria for authorizing nonroad requests. The commenters argued that a final rule under section 209(e) was necessary
to comment meaningfully on the CARB authorization request. 
EPA believes parties should be given another opportunity to comment on California's utility engine rule after today's
rule implementing section 209(e) has become final. Thus, EPA will publish in the 

Federal Register

 a Notice of Opportunity for Public Hearing and Request for Comments regarding California's request for authorization
of its Utility Engine Rule. Interested parties will have the opportunity to submit written comments, and if requested,
EPA will hold a hearing. This will provide interested parties with an opportunity to comment on California's request
after today's rule is finalized. 


L. Executive Order 12866 


In the NPRM, EPA stated it had determined that the proposed rule is not ``major'' within the criteria set forth in section
1(b) of Executive Order (E.O.) 12291 and was therefore not required to prepare a Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA).
Since the NPRM E.O. 12291 has been replaced by Executive Order 12866.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940720-0-00118 </DOCNO>

<TEXT>
 

Under Executive Order 12866, (58 FR 51735 (October 4, 1993)) the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action
is ``significant'' and therefore subject to OMB review and the requirements of the Executive Order. The Order defines
``significant regulatory action'' as one that is likely to result in a rule that may: 

(1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector
of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal
governments or communities; 

(2) Create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; 

(3) Materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations
or recipients thereof; or 

(4) Raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles
set forth in the Executive Order. 

Comments were received from EMI which suggested that an RIA be performed under the guidelines set forth in E.O. 12291.
EPA will examine these comments in the context of E.O. 12866. In connection with every ``significant regulatory action''
as defined at section 3(f)(1) (Annual effect on the economy of $100 million * * *), E.O. 12866 requires
an RIA be performed. EMI submitted that the second and third independent criteria for a ``major rule'' under E.O. 12291,
were met by both the NPRM and CARB's Utility Engine Rule currently before EPA. 

In relation to the second criterion for determining whether a rule is ``major'', EMI stated that its member manufacturers
of farm and construction equipment will incur costs in attempting to comply with EPA's rule and CARB's Utility Engine
Rule. EMI also states that both consumers of farm and construction equipment and California's economy will incur
costs as a result of geographically diverse emission standards. EMI makes reference to no evidence or cost data in
support of its claim. 

EMI points to the potential of diverse or multiple emission standards as its support that United States farm and construction
equipment manufacturers would be unduly hindered in the international marketplace as evidence that the rule meets
the third criterion for a ``major rule''. Again, EMI makes no reference to any examples of costs or evidence to support
its belief. 

EPA still believes that an RIA is not needed for the NPRM or the final rule. Today's rule does not itself impose any increase
in costs to individual industries or the State of California. Indeed, the rule merely sets out definitions and criteria
for nonroad authorization requests. California makes cost determinations as part of its own rulemaking and provides
the rulemaking record to EPA as part of an authorization request. At the same time, EPA notes that while its rule does
not impose any direct costs on equipment manufacturers, the more narrowly the scope of preemption is drawn, the more
opportunities California has to impose costs through regulations. 

Pursuant to the terms of E.O. 12866, OMB notified EPA that it considered the action a ``significant regulatory action''
within the meaning of the Executive Order. EPA has submitted this action to OMB for review. Changes made in response
to OMB suggestions or recommendations will be documented in the public record. 



M. Paperwork Reduction Act 



In the NPRM, EPA stated that the proposed rule did not contain any additional information collection requirements
subject to OMB review under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, 44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq. 

(PRA). The purpose of the PRA is ``to minimize and control burdens associated with the collection of information by
federal agencies from individuals, businesses and other private institutions, and State and local governments.''
5 CFR 1320.1. 

EPA received comments from two parties claiming that the PRA applied to the proposed rule and that such application
would require changes within the proposed rule. North American Equipment Dealers Association (NAEDA) and EMI indicated
that the ``primary use'' test would cause an increase of burdensome paperwork, with manufacturers dependent upon
dealers and end users to provide the requisite information to determine primary use. At the same time, EMI noted that
EPA did not specify any particular paperwork requirements. In addition, EMI did not indicate that any information
need be submitted to EPA. Instead, EMI apparently supposes that under the PRA a greater administrative burden would
be created by implementing a primary use information collection system as opposed to a ``designed for'' test and information
collection system, and thus claims the latter should be implemented. 

EPA finds these comments are not relevant to the question of whether the Paperwork Reduction Act applies to the proposed
and final rule. Although EPA finds the comments helpful in understanding the distinction between the ``primary use''
versus ``designed for'' issue, the comments fail to set forth any basis for asserting that the final rule, which adopts
the proposed primary use test, contains any additional information collection requirements. Indeed, the comments
presuppose the applicability of the PRA and focus on options to make information collection less burdensome without
recognizing the significance of the fact that EPA has not required any information collection from manufacturers,
dealers, or any private entity. EPA did not propose and has not included in the final rule any paperwork requirements
and thus imposes no burden upon manufacturers, dealers or end users of nonroad equipment to submit to EPA any information
regarding the use of nonroad equipment. EPA recognizes that in order for California to receive authorization from
EPA for non-preempted nonroad equipment, California must present sufficient information that nonroad equipment
is not used more than 51 percent as farm or construction equipment. California may thus require submission of relevant
information to determine primary use, but EPA has not. 

EPA has determined that the Paperwork Reduction Act does not apply towards this rulemaking. EPA has not set forth any
specific requirements for these entities to collect or submit any data to EPA. 



N. Regulatory Flexibility Act 



In the NPRM, EPA stated that the proposed regulation would not have a significant impact on a substantial number of
small entities. EPA determined that the proposed rule would affect manufacturers of nonroad equipment, a group without
a substantial number of small entities. 

EPA received public comments which suggested that the proposed rule would in fact affect small entities. One small
business equipment dealer commented that if the proposed rule and CARB's Utility Engine Rule are enacted, and nonroad
farm and construction equipment is separately regulated by California, then it would be adversely impacted. This
same dealer, along with the Far West Equipment Dealers Association (FWEDA), stated that a scenario would arise where
new and used nonroad farm and construction equipment purchased outside California would cost less than that found
in California, and would thus adversely affect dealers of such equipment within California. FWEDA provided examples
of several pieces of farm or construction equipment, and their projected cost increases in order to meet proposed
CARB emission standards, in an effort to present the price differential for California dealers of such equipment.
In addition, FWEDA states that the purchasers/users of their farm and construction equipment within California
will be at an unfair cost disadvantage in relation to users outside of California's boundary. 

For purposes of Regulatory Flexibility Act analysis, the issue is whether the final rule will have a significant impact
on a substantial number of small entities. EPA makes no change in 
its determination in the NPRM that the final rule will have no significant impact on a substantial number of small entities
since the rule imposes no burden on 

any

 entities. However, EPA 
reminds the parties which submitted comments on the applicability of the Regulatory Flexibility Act that California
is specifically preempted from regulation of farm and construction equipment under 175 horsepower. The pieces of
equipment cited by FWEDA as being potentially affected are preempted from regulation by California. Thus, the apprehension
that such equipment will cost less outside of California is unfounded, as such equipment will be subject only to the
federal regulations.

As a result, EPA has determined, as required under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, that the final rule does not have
a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities.

 means a self-propelled piece of on-track equipment (other than equipment designed for operation both on highways
and rails, specialized maintenance equipment, and other similar equipment) designed for moving other equipment,
freight, or passenger traffic. 


New

 means a domestic or imported nonroad vehicle or nonroad engine the equitable or legal title to which has never been
transferred to an ultimate purchaser. Where the equitable or legal title to an engine or vehicle is not transferred
to an ultimate purchaser until after the engine or vehicle is placed into service, then the engine or vehicle will no
longer be new after it is placed into service. A nonroad engine or vehicle is placed into service when it is used for its
functional purposes. The term 

ultimate purchaser

 means, with respect to any new nonroad vehicle or new nonroad engine, the first person who in good faith purchases such


new

 nonroad vehicle or new nonroad engine for purposes other than resale. This definition of 

new

 shall not apply to locomotives or engines used in locomotives. 


Nonroad engine

 means: 
(1) Except as discussed in paragraph (2) of this definition, a nonroad engine is any internal combustion engine:

(i) In or on a piece of equipment that is self-propelled or serves a dual purpose by both propelling itself and performing
another function (such as garden tractors, off-highway mobile cranes and bulldozers); or 

(ii) In or on a piece of equipment that is intended to be propelled while performing its function (such as lawnmowers
and string trimmers); or 

(iii) That, by itself or in or on a piece of equipment, is portable or transportable, meaning designed to be and capable
of being carried or moved from one location to another. Indicia of transportability include, but are not limited to,
wheels, skids, carrying handles, dolly, trailer, or platform. 

(2) An internal combustion engine is not a nonroad engine if: 

(i) The engine is used to propel a motor vehicle or a vehicle used solely for competition, or is subject to standards
promulgated under section 202 of the Act; or 

(ii) The engine is regulated by a federal New Source Performance Standard promulgated under section 111 of the Act;
or 

(iii) The engine otherwise included in paragraph (1)(iii) of this definition remains or will remain at a location
for more than 12 consecutive months or a shorter period of time for an engine located at a seasonal source. A location
is any single site at a building, structure, facility, or installation. Any engine (or engines) that replaces an engine
at a location and that is intended to perform the same or similar function as the engine replaced will be included in
calculating the consecutive time period. An engine located at a seasonal source is an engine that remains at a seasonal
source during the full annual operating period of the seasonal source. A seasonal source is a stationary source that
remains in a single location on a permanent basis (i.e., at least two years) and that operates at that single location
approximately three (or more) each year. This paragraph does not apply to an engine after the engine is removed from
the location. 



Primarily used

 means used 51 percent or more. 



 85.1603 

Application of definitions; scope of preemption. 



(a) For equipment that is used in applications in addition to farming or construction activities, if the equipment
is primarily used as farm and/or construction equipment or vehicles, as defined in this subpart, it is considered
farm or construction equipment or vehicles. 

(b) States are preempted from adopting or enforcing standards or other requirements relating to the control of emissions
from new engines smaller than 175 horsepower, that are primarily used in farm or construction equipment or vehicles,
as defined in this subpart. 

(c) States are preempted from adopting or enforcing standards or other requirements relating to the control of emissions
from new locomotives or new engines used in locomotives. 

(d) No state shall enforce any standards or other requirements relating to the control of emission from new nonroad
engines or vehicles except as provided for in this subpart. 



 85.1604 

Procedures for California nonroad authorization requests.

the control of emissions from new nonroad vehicles or engines that are otherwise not preempted by  85.1603(b)
or 85.1603(c) from the Administrator of EPA and provide the record on which the state rulemaking was based. 

(b) After receipt of the authorization request, the Administrator shall provide notice and opportunity for a public
hearing regarding such requests. 



 85.1605 

Criteria for granting authorization. 



(a) The Administrator shall grant the authorization if California determines that California standards will be,
in the aggregate, at least as protective of public health and welfare as applicable Federal standards. 

(b) The authorization shall not be granted if the Administrator finds that: 

(1) The determination of California is arbitrary and capricious; 

(2) California does not need such California standards to meet compelling and extraordinary conditions; or 

(3) California standards and accompanying enforcement procedures are not consistent with section 209. 



 85.1606

Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants; Final Rule To List the Rio 
Grande Silvery Minnow as an Endangered Species 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Fish and Wildlife Service, Interior. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) determines the Rio 
Grande silvery minnow (

Hybognathus amarus

) to be an endangered species under 
the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (Act), as amended. This fish occurs only 
in the middle Rio Grande from Cochiti Dam downstream to the headwaters of 
Elephant Butte Reservoir, New Mexico. Threats to the species include 
dewatering, channelization and regulation of river flow to provide water for 
irrigation; diminished water quality caused by municipal, industrial, and 
agricultural discharges; and competition or predation by introduced non-native 
fish species. Currently, the species occupies about five percent of its known 
historic range. This action will implement Federal protection provided by the 
Act for the Rio Grande silvery minnow. The Service further determines that 
finalization of proposed critical habitat will not occur at this time, as 
critical habitat is not now determinable because the required economic 
analysis has not been completed. Pursuant to section 4(b)(6)(C)(ii) of the 
Act, a final determination on critical habitat may be delayed up to 1 year beyond 
the normal deadline. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Background 


The Rio Grande silvery minnow is one of seven species in the genus 


Hybognathus 

found in the United States (Pflieger 1980). The species was first 
described by Girard (1856) from specimens taken from the Rio Grande near Fort 
Brown, Cameron County, Texas. It is a stout silvery minnow with moderately 
small eyes and a small, slightly oblique mouth (Pflieger 1975). Adults may 
reach 90 mm (3.5 in) in total length (Sublette et al. 1990). Its dorsal fin 
is distinctly pointed with the front located slightly closer to the tip of the 
snout than to the base of the tail (Pflieger 1975). Life color is silver with 
emerald reflections. Its belly is silvery white, fins are plain, and barbels 
are absent (Pflieger 1975, Sublette et al. 1990). 
This species was historically one of the most abundant and widespread 
fishes in the Rio Grande basin, occurring from Espanola, New Mexico, to the 
Gulf of Mexico (Bestgen and Platania 1991). It was also found in the Pecos 
River, a major tributary of the Rio Grande, from Santa Rosa, New Mexico, 
downstream to its confluence with the Rio Grande in south Texas (Pflieger 
1980). Collection data indicate the species presently occupies about five 
percent of its historic range (Platania 1993). It has been completely 
extirpated from the Pecos River and from the Rio Grande downstream of Elephant 
Butte Reservoir. Currently, it is found only in a 275 km (170 mi) reach of 
the middle Rio Grande, New Mexico, from Cochiti Dam, Sandoval County, to the 
headwaters of Elephant Butte Reservoir, Socorro County (Bestgen and Platania 
1991). Throughout much of its historic range, decline of 

H. amarus 

may be 
attributed to modification of stream discharge patterns and channel 
desiccation by impoundments, water diversion for agriculture, and stream 
channelization (Bestgen and Platania 1991, Cook et al. 1992). 
The Rio Grande silvery minnow no longer exists in the Pecos River where 
it was replaced by a congener, the introduced plains minnow (

H. placitus

) 
(Hatch et al. 1985, Bestgen et al. 1989, Cook et al. 1992). It is believed 
that the plains minnow was introduced into the Pecos drainage during 1968, 
probably the result of the release of ``bait minnows'' that were collected from 
the Arkansas River drainage. The replacement that ensued was complete in less 
than one decade (Cowley 1979). The plains minnow may be more tolerant of 
modified habitats and therefore able to replace 

H. amarus 

in the modified 
reaches of the Pecos River where it was introduced. It is also believed the 
two species hybridized (Cook et al. 1992). Habitat alteration and resulting 
flow modification could have also contributed to extirpation of the Rio Grande 
silvery minnow in the Pecos River. 

Decline of the species in the Rio Grande probably began in 1916 when the 
gates at Elephant Butte Dam were closed. Elephant Butte was the first of five 
major mainstream dams constructed within the Rio Grande silvery minnow's 
habitat (Shupe and Williams 1988). These dams allowed the flow of the river 
to be manipulated and diverted for the benefit of agriculture. Often this 
manipulation resulted in the desiccation of some river reaches and elimination 
of all fish. Concurrent with construction of the mainstream dams was an 
increase in the abundance of non-native and exotic fish species, as these 
species were stocked into the reservoirs created by the dams (Sublette et al. 
1990). Once established, these species often completely replaced the native 
fish fauna (Propst et al. 1987). Development of agriculture and the growth of 
cities within the historic range of 

H. amarus 

resulted in a decrease in the 
quality of water in the river that may have adversely affected the range and 
distribution of the species.

Most land bordering the river where the species currently exists is 
owned by the Middle Rio Grande Conservancy District, which is a quasi-public 
agency of the State of New Mexico. Other landowners include six Native 
American Pueblos, the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, the Service, the U.S. Bureau 
of Land Management, New Mexico State Parks, New Mexico Department of Game and 
Fish, New Mexico State Lands Department, and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers 
(Corps). 
Water flow in the middle Rio Grande is controlled by the Rio Grande 
Compact Commission. Established in 1929 for the purpose of permanently and 
equitably apportioning the flows of the Rio Grande, the Commission is composed 
of a Federal chairperson appointed by the President of the United States and 
three voting members_a representative designated by the Texas Governor and 
the State Engineers of New Mexico and Colorado. The Commission meets annually 
to review compliance with the compact over the preceding year, to hear reports 
from Federal water management agencies, and to consider water management 
decisions that have interstate implications. Federal agencies that also 
determine timing and amount of flow in the river include the International 
Boundary and Water Commission, the Bureau of Reclamation, and the Corps. 


Previous Service Actions 


The Rio Grande silvery minnow was listed on the Service's Animal Notice 
of Review (56 FR 58804; November 21, 1991) as a category 1 species. A 
category 1 species is one for which the Service has on file substantial 
information on biological vulnerability and threat(s) to support a proposal to 
list it as an endangered or threatened species. A proposed rule to list the 
Rio Grande silvery minnow as endangered with critical habitat was published in 
the 

Federal Register

 on March 1, 1993 (58 FR 11821). 


Summary of Comments and Recommendations 


In the March 1, 1993, proposed rule and associated notifications, all 
interested parties were requested to submit factual reports or information 
that might contribute to the development of a final rule. The comment period 
originally scheduled to close on April 30, 1993, was extended until August 25, 
1993, (58 FR 19220; April 13, 1993) to conduct public hearings and allow 
submission of additional comments. Appropriate Tribal governments, State 
agencies, county governments, Federal agencies, scientific organizations, and 
other interested parties were contacted and requested to comment. Newspaper 
notices inviting public comment were published in New Mexico in the 
Albuquerque Journal on May 2, 1993; Las Cruces Sun News on April 30, 1993; 
Socorro Defensor Chieftain on April 28, 1993; Santa Fe New Mexican on April 
20, 1993; and in Texas in the El Paso Times on March 20, 1993. 
Because of anticipated widespread public interest, the Service held two 
public hearings that were announced in an April 13, 1993, 

Federal Register

 
notice. Interested parties were contacted and notified of the hearings. 
Thirty-seven people attended the hearing in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and 58 
attended the hearing in Socorro, New Mexico. Oral or written comments were 
received from 25 parties at the hearings; none directly supported the proposed 
listing. Transcripts of these hearings are available for inspection (see 


ADDRESSES

). Briefing sessions were also held for tribal leaders on May 18, 
1993, in Albuquerque, New Mexico; and for a number of northern pueblos at 
Santo Domingo Pueblo, New Mexico, on September 9, 1993. 
A total of 40 written comments were received at the Service's Ecological 
Services State Office in Albuquerque, New Mexico: 13 supported the proposed 
listing; 14 opposed the proposed listing; and 13 commented on information in 
the proposed rule but expressed neither support nor opposition. 
Oral or written comments were received from 7 Federal and 5 state 
agencies, 14 local officials, and 36 private organizations, companies, and 
individuals. Written comments and oral statements presented at the public 
hearings and received during the comment periods are covered in the following 
summary. Comments of a similar nature or point are grouped into a number of 
general issues. These issues, and the Service's response to each, are 
discussed below. 


Issue 1: 

The Service has come to the conclusion that only instream flow 
will assure the species' existence. Will the Service propose a program for 
the purchase of water rights in order to provide water for the species? 


Response: 

The Service has not reached this conclusion. Possible 
instream flow requirements of the species are among several factors that need 
to be considered in the recovery planning process. If, during the recovery 
planning process, the Service determines that the purchase of water rights 
will enhance recovery of the species, the Service would explore with other 
State and Federal entities the possible purchase of water rights from willing 
sellers. 


Issue 2: 

The United States, under the terms of the Convention of 1906, 
has the obligation to deliver 60,000 acre-feet of water annually to the 
Republic of Mexico. The U.S. International Boundary and Water Commission 
(IBWC) is responsible for ensuring that the U.S. government meets those 
obligations. The IBWC is concerned that the listing may interfere with their 
ability to meet these treaty requirements. 


Response: 

The Service recognizes the treaty obligation of the United 
States to provide to the Republic of Mexico 60,000 acre-feet of water annually 
from the Rio Grande. Measures taken to protect and recover the Rio Grande 
silvery minnow will take into consideration this treaty obligation and IBWC's 
ability to meet treaty requirements. 


Issue 3: 

Completion of the dams above Elephant Butte Dam has had the 
effect of extending stream flow. Flood control and conservation storage 
operations do not, cannot, and have not been used to create or extend reaches 
of no flow in the riverbed. 


Response: 

The Service agrees with the statement. Availability of flow 
is likely not the only factor affecting decline of the silvery minnow. These 
operations change the natural flow regime of the river and thus may affect 
survival of the Rio Grande silvery minnow. The final rule recognizes these 
other factors in the ``Summary of Factors Affecting the Species.''

Issue 4: 

Reservoirs do not, as implied, store all spring runoff and 
summer inflows. Water is normally released during summer, not winter months. 
Diversion dams and canals have limited capacities to divert flows. They 
cannot ``completely divert all flows . . . into irrigation ditches'' under flood 
conditions. 



Response: 

The Service agrees with the statement that reservoirs do not 
store all spring runoff and summer inflow. While most water is released 
during the spring and summer, a fall and winter release does occur in the 
Middle Rio Grande Valley when conditions permit (Beal and Gold 1988, Borland 
and Gold 1989). Under flood conditions, the irrigation diversions do not have 
the capacity to divert all flows. Under non-flood flows they do have the 
capacity to divert all flows. United States Geological Survey (USGS) records 
substantiate the occurrence of no-flow periods downstream of the various 
irrigation diversion dams. 



Issue 5: 

The proposed regulation is unsupported by any hydrological 
study as to the statements that irrigation uses have depleted the water flow. 
Not a single source of information is cited for comments regarding hydrology 
of the river. Depletions of water in the system may be the result of the 
construction of wildlife watering impoundments by the Forest Service and 
Bureau of Land Management. 



Response: 

It can be readily documented by examining USGS flow gage 
records that river flows decrease when the irrigation season starts. In 
addition, the Service reviewed Bullard and Wells (1992), which provides 
information on the hydrology of the middle Rio Grande. This reduction in flow 
is most noticeable in mid-summer after the spring to early summer peak flow 
has passed. Wildlife impoundments are often very small (less than one acre in 
size) and are considered to be insignificant in the amount of water they 
deplete from the drainage. 



Issue 6: 

Economic considerations should be given more weight when 
communities may be affected. 



Response: 

Section 4(a)(1) of the Act identifies five factors that are 
considered in making a determination of whether a species should be listed as 
threatened or endangered. Section 4(b)(1)(A) of the Act requires that listing 
determinations be based solely on the best available scientific and commercial 
data, and prohibits the Service from considering economic factors (50 CFR 
424.11(b)). However, because economics are considered in the designation of 
critical habitat, the Service will conduct an economic analysis in the process 
of evaluating proposed critical habitat for the Rio Grande silvery minnow. 



Issue 7: 

The Service needs to ensure public input before listing the 
Rio Grande silvery minnow. The Service is required to notify counties and 
other affected parties to solicit their input prior to listing a species under 
the Act. The Service failed to meet this obligation. 



Response: 

On February 19, 1991, about 80 pre-proposal letters of 
inquiry were mailed to various governmental agencies, knowledgeable 
individuals, and the New Mexico Congressional delegation. On March 20, 1992, 
the Service held a meeting in Albuquerque, New Mexico, with various interested 
governmental and private entities to explore existing or potential flexibility 
in water delivery schedules that might avoid dewatering of the Rio Grande 
within the range of the Rio Grande silvery minnow. The Service also published 
notices of the proposal in 5 local newspapers and mailed copies of the 
proposed rule to 148 different government agencies, private organizations, and 
interested individuals, including all counties having lands that border the 
area being proposed for critical habitat designation. Two public hearings 
were also held. The Service has fully met or surpassed the requirements of 
the Endangered Species Act for public notification. 



Issue 8: 

The Service held public hearings only to fulfill a legal 
obligation and will not pay attention to any public comment. The Service 
should have held public hearings in El Paso and Las Cruces. 



Response: 

The Service disagrees. All comments are carefully evaluated 
before the Service makes a determination on whether to proceed with a final 
rule. Numerous notifications of the proposed rule and extension of the 
comment period were distributed, and Service biologists traveled to several 
areas, including El Paso and Las Cruces, to present briefings on the proposed 
rule and accept comments. 



Issue 9: 

The Service should establish a coordinating committee composed 
of interests below Elephant Butte Reservoir whose task would be to develop a 
full-scale report on the existing data available on the Rio Grande silvery 
minnow and how the river could be managed for the benefit of all, including 
the Rio Grande silvery minnow. 



Response: 

After the species is listed the Service will consider, 
through the recovery planning process, establishing a coordinating committee 
to develop a report on the Rio Grande silvery minnow and how the river could 
be managed for the benefit of all, including the Rio Grande silvery minnow. 



Issue 10: 

During periods of dewatering of the river, the ditches 
provide habitat for the species. The Service should consider exploring with 
the Middle Rio Grande Conservancy District, the counties, and other agencies 
the multiple use of riverside drains for the species and the preservation of 
bosque habitat. 



Response: 

The Service agrees that during periods of drought, which 
result in the dewatering of the mainstream Rio Grande, the various irrigation 
ditches and drains may provide a temporary place of refuge for the Rio Grande 
silvery minnow. However, these areas do not contain suitable habitat for 
long-term use by the species. Few Rio Grande silvery minnows are found in the 
ditches and drains. Those that are found are believed to represent Rio Grande 
silvery minnows that became entrapped due to the diversion of irrigation water 
from the mainstream. The Service intends to investigate, with all interests, 
the potential use of the riverside drains for recovery of the species.

Issue 11: 

Few data exist on the abundance of the species on Pueblo lands or whether it can survive in the mud and sand when the river
bed is dry. 



Response: 

The Service used all available biological information in 
making the determination to list the Rio Grande silvery minnow as an endangered species. Recent census data from Pueblo
lands are reported by Bestgen and Platania (1991), Platania and Bestgen (1988), Platania and Clemmer (1984), and
the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation (1992). As additional information becomes available, including information from
Pueblo waters, the Service will use that information in the recovery planning process. The Service hopes that, through
initiation of recovery efforts for the species, and in cooperation with the Pueblos, additional information can
be obtained on the status of the species on Pueblo lands. The Service has no scientific data indicating that the species
survives in the mud and sand during periods when the river is dry. 



Issue 12: 

Competition between 

H. amarus 

and its congener 

H. placitus 

could have also contributed to extirpation of the species from the Pecos River. Studies should be conducted to determine
if predation or competition by non-native fishes impacts the species. The studies should not just determine if it
is a problem, they should also determine where and to what extent it is a problem. 



Response: 

The Service has no data to substantiate any reasons for extirpation of the Rio Grande silvery minnow from the Pecos
River and replacement by its congener 

H. placitus. 

Competition may have been a factor in its extirpation; however, it is more likely that hybridization between the two
species was the primary factor. Studies designed to determine if predation or competition by non-native fishes impacts
the survival of the Rio Grande silvery minnow will be conducted as part of recovery efforts for the species. 



Issue 13: 

Recent biological studies have been conducted during a period of high flow; therefore, the results of those studies
do not accurately reflect the distribution of the species under normal conditions. 



Response: 

It is true that, other than 1989, recent data have been collected during a period of higher than normal flow. However,
even these data show that the species is not as abundant as it was during other periods of above-normal flow. This leads
to a conclusion that factors other than flow may be impacting the species and its habitat. 



Issue 14: 

It seems a fair conclusion that the Cochiti downstream reach is no longer favorable habitat because of lowered water
temperatures and degradation of favored 

H. amarus 

substrate. This further limits the area in which the species has to survive.



Response: 

Although the reach immediately downstream of Cochiti Dam may not be favorable habitat for the Rio Grande silvery minnow,
it is not known how far downstream these conditions persist. As part of recovery efforts for the species, studies will
be conducted on this question, and attempts may be made to correct the unfavorable conditions. 



Issue 15: 

Since little is known of feeding habits or reproduction, the claim that channel modification would adversely affect
the Rio Grande silvery minnow is not supported by the best scientific evidence. Changes in food supply, not water supply,
may be a factor affecting the species in the Rio Grande. Also, the effects of non-native plants upon the habitat need
to be investigated. 



Response: 

Recent data have shown that spawning activity occurs during peak spring and early-summer flows. The fertilized eggs
drift with the current for about 24 hours and then hatch. The larval fish continue to drift downstream until they are
swept into calm backwater and edge areas where food is abundant and they can continue to grow. Because of this spawning
behavior, any modifications to the channel that result in changes that sweep the eggs and larval fish into less favorable
habitats would adversely affect the species. There are no data presently available to support the contention that
a reason for decline of the species was a decrease in the species' food supply or the invasion of non-native plants.
As part of recovery efforts, the impacts of all habitat modifications will be investigated to determine if and how
they impact the species. 



Issue 16: 

Very little information was presented at the public hearing or in the 

Federal Register

 to show a cause-and-effect relationship between water quality and decline of the species.

Response:

 Limited information exists on the relationship between 
water quality and the decline of the species. A better understanding of 
this relationship will be developed as a result of recovery efforts. 




Issue 17:

 The proposed listing of the Rio Grande silvery minnow is 
just a part of a much larger problem_the modification of the floodplain. 
Are activities at Bosque del Apache National Wildlife Refuge (NWR) 
affecting the species? 



Response:

 The Service agrees. Listing the species will invoke 
protective provisions of the Act, such as those contained in section 7. 
The Service has no information that indicates activities at Bosque del 
Apache NWR impact the species. The Service will work with Federal 
agencies, including Bosque del Apache NWR, to ensure that their actions do 
not jeopardize the species through adverse effects on the floodplain. In 
addition, the Service is involved in several cooperative efforts with 
Federal, State, and private entities to protect the Rio Grande Bosque and 
associated floodplain. 



Issue 18:

 The facts presented in the status report do not support 
the conclusion that ``anticipated additional modifications'' would limit 
prospects of survival for the species in the middle Rio Grande. 



Response:

 The facts presented in the status report do support the 
conclusion that ``anticipated additional modifications'' would limit 
prospects of survival for the species in the middle Rio Grande. According 
to the authors of the status report, ``Conservation measures are necessary 
as continued habitat and flow modifications, introductions of non-native 
species, and lack of refugia threaten survival of 

H. amarus.

'' The present 
status of the species is such that any activity that could negatively 
impact the species may limit prospects for its survival. 



Issue 19:

 Only two facts support listing; that the species is 
presently found in only 5 percent of its historic range, and that other 
fish native to the middle Rio Grande (Rio Grande bluntnose shiner, phantom 
shiner, Rio Grande shiner, and speckled chub) have been extirpated from the 
river. The Service does not have adequate data to support the conclusion 
that the Rio Grande silvery minnow is endangered and should be listed under 
the Act. 



Response:

 The Service agrees that the above two facts support 
listing. However, other facts that support listing include the species' 
decrease in abundance within the area it presently occupies, and its 
extirpation from the Pecos River after the introduction of the plains 
minnow into that system. The Service concludes, as detailed in the 
``Summary of Factors'' section, that there is sufficient evidence to support 
listing the species as endangered under the Act. The Service reviewed the 
best scientific and commercial data available to make this determination.

Issue 20:

 The Rio Grande silvery minnow is not a distinct species. It is just a local population of the Mississippi silvery minnow.
The Service should consider conducting studies for two years on the species' taxonomy. 



Response:

 The Service has taxonomic information that verifies the Rio Grande silvery minnow as a distinct species. The Rio Grande
silvery minnow is recognized by the American Fisheries Society, which is considered the scientific authority for
the names of fishes, as a full species (American Fisheries Society 1991). Cook et al. (1992), using starch gel electrophoretic
methods, found that phenetic and phylogenetic analyses corroborated the hypothesis that 

H. amarus

 is distinct at the species level from 

H. nuchalis

 and 

H. placitus

, with which it was previously grouped. 



Issue 21:

 The Service has not conducted in-depth studies to determine the number of silvery minnows that exist in the Middle
Rio Grande Valley and associated drainage ditches. The species may be doing well without protection of the Federal
government. 



Response:

 Since 1987, studies have been conducted to document the population of Rio Grande silvery minnows in both the Middle
Rio Grande Valley and its associated irrigation and drainage ditches from Velarde to Elephant Butte Reservoir, New
Mexico. These studies have shown that very few Rio Grande silvery minnows survive in the drainage ditches. The listing
is based, in part, upon the extirpation of the species from about 95 percent of its historic range. The species was once
thought to be one of the most numerous fish in the Rio Grande. In 50 fish collections made between Bernalillo and Elephant
Butte Reservoir between 1987 and 1988, the Rio Grande silvery minnow was the second most abundant species, comprising
18 percent of the total fish collected. From 1989 to 1992, 56 collections were made in the same area and only 3 Rio Grande
silvery minnows were collected. During that period, the Rio Grande silvery minnow went from being the second most
abundant native fish species to the least abundant native species (Platania 1993). The Service believes that without
the protection afforded through Federal listing, the species is likely to become extinct. Two native Rio Grande fish
species have already become extinct. 



Issue 22:

 The fish exist in stretches of the river that have been subject to drying for at least 50 years, but have disappeared
from areas where there has been instream flow for the past 50 years. 



Response:

 The Service agrees that the species has persisted in reaches of the river that have experienced seasonal drying during
the past 50 years and has been extirpated from reaches where there has been continual flow during the last 50 years.
In the past, during periods of extremely low flow, the species survived in areas where irrigation water returned to
the river, in seepage and leakage pools located downstream of irrigation diversion dams, and, prior to construction
of Cochiti Dam, in the canyon reach of the Rio Grande upstream of Cochiti. Prior to the construction of irrigation and
flood control dams in the southwest, it was not unusual for portions of major rivers to become dry during periods of
drought. During these drought periods, native fishes would retreat to canyon reaches where permanent water existed.
After the drought ended, they would re-inhabit the reaches of river that had formerly been dry. There was a constant
expansion and contraction of fish populations. Construction of mainstream dams prevented this movement and may
have contributed to the extitirpation of downstream populations of native fishes. 

The reasons for the extirpation of the species from continual flow reaches of the river are not known but probably relate
to factors other than flow. Changes in species composition, flow regimes, and water quality could all have been causative
factors in the decline of the Rio Grande silvery minnow from these areas. Even in those areas where the species presently
persists, its abundance has been substantially reduced (Platania 1993). 



Issue 23:

 Listing is not necessary because of existing protection that is afforded the species by the requirements of the Coordination
Act, National Environmental Policy Act, and other habitat protection regulations, such as section 404 of the Clean
Water Act. Any activity that could affect the habitat of the species would have to undergo these reviews, including
the Middle Rio Grande Conservancy District's work on its structures. Such work could not be done with impunity. Protection
is also provided to the species because of its listing as endangered by the State of New Mexico.

Response:

 To date, the species has declined even with these regulations in place. These regulations do not ensure that habitat
for the Rio Grande silvery minnow will be protected. Listing of the species by the State of New Mexico only regulates
collecting of the species. It does not provide protection for its habitat or for its recovery. The Service believes
the protective mechanisms of the Act are necessary to prevent the species' extinction. 



Summary of Factors Affecting the Species 



After a thorough review and consideration of all information available, the Service has determined that the Rio Grande
silvery minnow should be classified as an endangered species. Procedures found at section 4(a)(1) of the Act (16 U.S.C.
1531 

et seq

.), and regulations (50 CFR Part 424) promulgated to implement the listing provisions of the Act were followed. A species
may be determined to be an endangered or threatened species due to one or more of the five factors described in section
4(a)(1). These factors and their application to the Rio Grande silvery minnow (

Hybognathus amarus

) are as follows: 



A. The Present or Threatened Destruction, Modification, or Curtailment of Its Habitat or Range 



The only existing population of 

H. amarus

 continues to be threatened by annual dewatering of a large percentage of its habitat. This dewatering is primarily
the result of diversion of river flow for agriculture within the Middle Rio Grande Valley of New Mexico. During a year
when an average or above-average amount of water is available, the impacts of the diversions are not severe. During
a below-average water year, the river channel may be dry from Isleta Diversion Dam downstream about 179 km (111 mi)
to the headwaters of Elephant Butte Reservoir for two months or more. When two below-average flow years occur consecutively,
a short-lived species such as 

H. amarus

 can be severely affected, if not completely eliminated from the dry reaches of river. During the 94 years for which
flow records have been maintained for the middle Rio Grande, it has not been unusual for the 245 km (153 mi) reach of the
Rio Grande from the Angostura Diversion Dam downstream to Elephant Butte Reservoir to experience periods of no flow.
Even before construction of mainstream dams, the middle Rio Grande frequently experienced periods of no flow. During
such periods, it is suspected 

H. amarus

 survived in areas where irrigation return flows re-entered the river, in the pools formed by water leaking through
the gates of the diversion dams, in the irrigation ditches and drains, and in the reaches of stream above the diversions
from which their offspring could repopulate downstream reaches when conditions permitted. It is not known why these
same factors do not provide sufficient habitat to support 

H. amarus

 under current conditions. Other factors, such as an increase in non-native and exotic fish species, or an increase
in contamination may be exacerbating the stress placed upon the species during low-flow periods. 
Mainstream dams permit the artificial regulation of flow, prevent flooding, trap nutrients, alter sediment transport,
prolong flows, and create reservoirs that favor non-native fish species. These changes may affect the Rio Grande
silvery minnow by reducing its food supply, altering its preferred habitat, preventing dispersal, and providing
a continual supply of non-native fishes that may compete with or prey upon the species. Altering flow regimes may also
improve conditions for other native fish species that occupy the same habitat as the Rio Grande silvery minnow and
may thereby cause their populations to expand at the expense of the Rio Grande silvery minnow. 

Since completion of Elephant Butte Dam in 1916, four additional mainstream dams have been constructed on the middle
Rio Grande, and two dams have been constructed on one of its major tributaries, the Rio Chama (Shupe and Williams 1988).
Construction and operation of these dams, which are either irrigation diversion dams such as Angostura, Isleta,
and San Acacia; or flood control and water storage dams such as Elephant Butte, Cochiti, Abiquiu, and El Vado, have
modified the natural flow of the river. The dams make it possible during a low-flow year to completely divert all of
the flow from the river channel into irrigation ditches. The species does not persist in the irrigation ditches or
the low-flow conveyance channel. Platania (1993) collected fish samples from 11 locations along the low-flow conveyance
channel between 1987-1989 and failed to locate any Rio Grande silvery minnows. The dams also store spring runoff
and summer inflow, which would normally cause flooding, and release this water back into the river channel over a prolonged
period of time. This release is often made during the winter months when low flows would normally occur. Artificially-controlled
flows depart significantly from natural conditions. Reduced flows may limit the amount of preferred habitat available
to the species and may limit dispersal of the species. Although the mechanisms of how the decline of the species occurred
are not fully understood, manipulation of flow may be one of the primary reasons 

H. amarus

 has been extirpated from portions of its historic range. 

Channelization of the middle Rio Grande has resulted primarily from the placement of Kellner jetty fields, or jacks,
along the river. They are designed to protect the levees by retarding flood flows, trapping sediment, and promoting
the establishment of vegetation. Since 1951, the Bureau of Reclamation and Corps have installed in excess of 100,000
individual jetties occupying more than 2,000 ha (5,000 ac) (Bullard and Wells 1992). 

From Elephant Butte Dam downstream about 325 km (200 mi) to its confluence with the Rio Conchos, the Rio Grande is fully
controlled by reservoir releases and irrigation return flows. Meanders, oxbows and other components of historic
aquatic habitat have been eliminated in order to pass water as efficiently as possible for agricultural irrigation
and downstream deliveries. These changes affected the Rio Grande silvery minnow by altering its habitat to the extent
that its survival was not possible. The sandy substrate, which it prefers, has been replaced by gravel and cobble,
and no backwater areas exist where the young can develop. Winter flows released from Caballo Dam often equal .06 cubic
meters per second (2 cubic feet per second), which is not enough flow to maintain habitat for fishes.

In 1958, in an effort to meet Rio Grande Compact water delivery requirements, the Bureau of Reclamation initiated
operation of a 97 km (60 mi) long conveyance channel from San Acacia to Elephant Butte Reservoir. The purpose of the
conveyance channel is to divert all flow less than 63 cubic meters per second (2000 cubic feet per second) in order to
prevent loss of the Rio Grande flow to seepage and evaporation from the aggraded riverbed. Prior to 1985, the conveyance
channel had been operated to its full capacity for about 28 years. Since 1985, it has not been operated at full capacity.
If, however, the channel were to be operated at full capacity, the natural stream bed downstream of San Acacia would
be dry more frequently and for longer periods of time. Both the Corps and the Bureau of Reclamation are drafting plans
to rehabilitate and protect the conveyance channel in order to bring it into full operation. Should the conveyance
channel be placed in full operation, the portion of the Rio Grand
