Imported Fire Ant; Addition of Authorized Chemical Treatment 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, USDA. 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 We are proposing to amend the appendix to the imported fire ant regulations to add the insecticide tefluthrin (FORCE

 

) to the list of authorized chemicals for the treatment of containerized nursery stock that is to be certified for interstate
movement from quarantined areas. We are also proposing to add provisions regarding the proper use of tefluthrin.
This action would give nurseries another choice of insecticides with which to meet the certification requirement
for interstate movement of containerized nursery stock. 



</SUMMARY>

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Background 


Imported fire ants, 

Solenopsis invicta

 Buren and 

Solenopsis richteri

 Forel, are aggressive, stinging insects that, in large numbers, can seriously injure or even kill livestock, pets,
and humans. Imported fire ants feed on crops, and their large, hard mounds damage farm and field machinery.
The restrictions in ``Subpart_Imported Fire Ant'' (7 CFR   301.81 through 301.81-10, referred
to below as ``the regulations'') prevent the spread of the imported fire ant (IFA) on articles moving interstate by
quarantining IFA-infested States or IFA-infested areas within States and imposing restrictions on the interstate
movement of certain articles, known as regulated articles, from these quarantined States or areas. 
Sections 301.81-4 and 301.81-5 of the regulations provide, among other things, that regulated articles
requiring treatment before interstate movement must be treated in accordance with the methods and procedures prescribed
in the Appendix to Subpart ``Imported Fire Ant''_Portion of ``Imported Fire Ant Program Manual'' (referred to below
as ``the Appendix''). The Appendix sets forth the treatment provisions of the ``Imported Fire Ant Program Manual.''

Research recently conducted by the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) Imported Fire Ant Methods
Development Station in Gulfport, MS, has shown that the insecticide tefluthrin, in granular form, is effective at
a dosage rate of 25 parts per million (ppm) in treating soil or potting media to prevent the spread of the imported fire
ant. Based on this research, APHIS has determined that containerized nursery stock could be certified for interstate
movement after treatment with granular tefluthrin at a dosage rate of 25 ppm. 

The insecticide tefluthrin is registered with the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). In May 1993,
EPA approved a label, providing for a dosage rate of 25 ppm, for the use of granular tefluthrin in treating soil or potting
media for the imported fire ant. We are proposing to revise the Appendix by adding granular tefluthrin to the list of
authorized chemicals for the treatment of regulated articles under the regulations. 

We are also proposing to: (1) Amend paragraph III.C.3. of the Appendix by adding provisions regarding the material
to be treated, the dosage rate, and the exposure period, and by adding a new ``Method E_Granular Incorporation (Tefluthrin);''
(2) amend paragraph III.C.4., under the ``Exclusion'' heading, to allow tefluthrin to be used as an alternative to
bifenthrin in treating soil or potting media for plants grown on the premises to prevent infestation with or spread
of the imported fire ant; and (3) amend paragraph III.C.4., under the ``Enforcement'' heading, by adding ``tefluthrin''
to a reference to chemical treatments that are described in paragraph III.C.3. of the Appendix. 

We are not proposing that tefluthrin be used as an alternative to bifenthrin for treating plants received from outside
sources (under the ``Exclusion'' heading). Drench applications are used to treat plants received from outside sources,
and tefluthrin is only approved for granular incorporation. Drench application is more thorough than topical application
or granular incorporation, and is therefore the most effective treatment for plants received from outside sources
which may not have already been treated for the imported fire ant. 

In addition, we are proposing to make two miscellaneous changes in paragraph III.C.4. The first, under the ``Exclusion''
heading, would add the word ``drench'' immediately after the word ``bifenthrin'' in paragraph (b), to make it clear
that only drench applications are to be used in treating plants received from outside sources. The second miscellaneous
change, under the ``Enforcement'' heading, would remove the word ``liquid'' before the phrase ``liquid chlorpyrifos
and bifenthrin'' to make it clear that the bifenthrin can be in either liquid or granular form. 



Executive Order 12866 and Regulatory Flexibility Act 



This proposed rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12866. This rule has been determined to be not significant
for purposes of Executive Order 12866, and, therefore, has not been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget.


This proposed rule would amend the Appendix to the imported fire ant regulations to allow the use of the insecticide
tefluthrin (FORCE

 

), in granular form, for the treatment of containerized nursery stock that is to be certified for interstate movement
from areas quarantined for imported fire ant. 

Approximately 2,645 nurseries move containerized nursery stock interstate from quarantined areas each year. Twelve
of these nurseries would be considered large; 2,633 would be considered small, with annual sales below $500,000.


Current regulations allow for the incorporation of granular bifenthrin for the treatment of containerized nursery
stock that is to be certified for interstate movement from quarantined areas. A 50-pound bag of granular bifenthrin
currently retails for about $38.50. The expected retail price for tefluthrin is not available, but should be comparable
to that of bifenthrin. For this reason, APHIS anticipates that the economic impact to nurseries that use these products
would not be significant. 

The addition of tefluthrin to the list of authorized chemicals would give nurseries another choice of insecticides
so they could choose whichever product best suits their needs, and would provide a backup in case one of the insecticides
is taken off the market or is unavailable for any reason. The addition of tefluthrin could also stimulate competition
for imported fire ant insecticides, which could drive down prices for all chemicals authorized under the IFA program.
If this were to happen, nurseries would benefit by lower treatment costs. 

We do not anticipate that there would be a noticeable impact on small entities that distribute agricultural chemicals.
Distributors of agricultural chemicals are diversified businesses that sell a wide variety of chemicals, fertilizers,
and other farm and nursery supplies. 

Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that
this action would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.

Executive Order 12372 


This program/activity is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic 
Assistance under No. 10.025 and is subject to Executive Order 12372, which 
requires intergovernmental consultation with State and local officials. (See 
7 CFR 3015, subpart V.) 


Executive Order 12778 


This proposed rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil 
Justice Reform. If this proposed rule is adopted: (1) All State and local 
laws and regulations that are inconsistent with this rule will be preempted; 
(2) no retroactive effect will be given to this rule; and (3) administrative 
proceedings will not be required before parties may file suit in court 
challenging this rule. 


National Environmental Policy Act 


An environmental assessment and finding of no significant impact have 
been prepared for this proposed rule. The assessment provides a basis for our 
conclusion that use of tefluthrin at the dosage rate of 25 ppm would not 
present a risk of disseminating plant pests and would not have a significant 
impact on the quality of the human environment. Based on the finding of no 
significant impact, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health 
Inspection Service has determined that an environmental impact statement need 
not be prepared. 
The environmental assessment and finding of no significant impact were 
prepared in accordance with: (1) The National Environmental Policy Act of 
1969 (NEPA) (42 U.S.C. 4321 

et seq.

), (2) Regulations of the Council on 
Environmental Quality for Implementing the Procedural Provisions of NEPA (40 
CFR Parts 1500-1508), (3) USDA Regulations Implementing NEPA (7 CFR Part 1b), 
and (4) APHIS Guidelines Implementing NEPA (44 FR 50381-50384, August 28, 
1979, and 44 FR 51272-51274, August 31, 1979). 
Copies of the environmental assessment and finding of no significant 
impact are available for public inspection at USDA, room 1141, South Building, 
14th Street and Independence Avenue SW., Washington, DC, between 8 a.m. and

Airworthiness Directives; Aerospatiale Model ATR42-200, -300, and -320 Series Airplanes 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM). 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive that is applicable to certain Aerospatiale
Model ATR42-200, -300, and -320 series airplanes. This proposal would require modification of
the wiring in the elevator controls and the pitch trim dissymmetry monitoring equipment. This proposal is prompted
by a report of loss of a propeller and engine gearbox, which resulted in damage to the fuselage. There has also been a
report that a modification was implemented in the elevator control cables during manufacture, which reduced the
maximum physical separation between the elevator controls and the monitoring equipment. The actions specified
by the proposed AD are intended to prevent reduced controllability of the airplane in the event that debris from an
engine burst or propeller failure were to strike the fuselage and sever the elevator flight controls.

Discussion 


The Direction G&eacute;n&eacute;rale de l'Aviation Civile (DGAC), which is the airworthiness authority for France,
recently notified the FAA that an unsafe condition may exist on certain Aerospatiale Model ATR42-200, -300,
and -320 series airplanes. The DGAC advises of a recent incident involving a Model ATR42-300 in which loss
of a propeller and engine gearbox damaged the fuselage in the right-hand propeller plane of rotation. The DGAC also
advises that a modification was implemented in the elevator control cables during manufacture that reduced the maximum
physical separation between the elevator controls and the monitoring equipment. This reduced separation could
allow severing of the elevator flight controls in the event that debris from an engine burst or propeller failure were
to strike the fuselage. This condition, if not corrected, could result in reduced controllability of the airplane.

Aerospatiale has issued Service Bulletins ATR42-27-0068, and ATR42-27-0069, both dated
January 25, 1994, that describe procedures for rerouting the wiring between the normal mechanical pitch controls
and the normal electric pitch trim controls, and between the normal mechanical pitch controls and the pitch trim dissymmetry
monitoring equipment. Accomplishment of this modification is intended to restore maximum physical separation
between the elevator controls and the monitoring equipment. The DGAC has issued French Airworthiness Directive
93-205-052(B), as revised by Erratum, dated February 2, 1994, to assure the continued airworthiness
of these airplanes in France. 
This airplane model is manufactured in France and is type certificated for operation in the United States under the
provisions of  21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations and the applicable bilateral airworthiness agreement.
Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, the DGAC has kept the FAA informed of the situation described
above. The FAA has examined the findings of the DGAC, reviewed all available information, and determined that AD action
is necessary for products of this type design that are certificated for operation in the United States. 
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes of the same type
design registered in the United States, the proposed AD would require modification of the wiring in the elevator controls
and the pitch trim dissymmetry monitoring equipment. The actions would be required to be accomplished in accordance
with the service bulletins described previously. 
The FAA estimates that 110 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD, that it would take approximately
49 work hours per airplane to accomplish the proposed actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour.
Required parts would be provided by the manufacturer at no cost to operators. Based on these figures, the total cost
impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $296,450, or $2,695 per airplane. 
The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the
proposed requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this
AD were not adopted. 
The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) Is not a ``significant regulatory action''
under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44
FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative,
on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft
regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting
the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption

Computing Benefit Amounts, Disposing of Underpayments, Resolving Overpayments, and Payment Restriction



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Social Security Administration, HHS.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Proposed rules.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

We are proposing to revise our rules on computation of benefits to define the term ``first becomes eligible'' as it
relates to a pension based on noncovered employment. We are also revising the computation rules to provide that we
will consider all government service used by a pension-paying agency when we determine whether an individual first
became eligible before 1986 for a pension based on noncovered employment. We are also revising our rule on determining
fault regarding overpayments to state that benefit deductions because of net earnings from self-employment are
not applicable after an individual attains age 70. Additionally, we are revising our rules on underpayments to clarify
a misleading cross reference. Finally, we are updating the list of countries to which benefit payments are withheld
because of Treasury Department restrictions.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Section 215(a)(7) of the Social Security Act (the Act) requires us to perform a modified computation of the primary
insurance amount (the basic benefit amount) of an individual's old-age or disability insurance benefit if the individual
first becomes eligible after 1985 for such a benefit and for a monthly periodic payment based on noncovered employment.
The modified computation affects individuals who are concurrently entitled to such a monthly periodic payment and
to old-age or disability benefits under title II of the Act. It results in a lower primary insurance amount that would
have been computed if the monthly periodic payment had been considered. However, neither the Act nor our regulations
at 20 CFR 404.213 define the phrase ``first becomes eligible.''



In defining ``first becomes eligible,'' we have identified two interpretations which pertain to the date creditable
service is acquired. One interpretation is that an individual first becomes eligible when he or she has currently
acquired enough service to qualify for a pension. The other interpretation is that an individual first becomes eligible
when he or she has acquired enough service to qualify for a pension, regardless of when the service was acquired. 

We recently became aware that some individuals have purchased credit for prior service, e.g., military service,
which could affect their eligibility date and allow them to become eligible before 1986 for a monthly pension based
on noncovered employment. Such an individual would thus be excluded from the modified computation because he or she
first became eligible for the monthly pension before 1986. There is no restriction in the Act which precludes using
purchased credit to establish eligibility before 1986 for a monthly pension based on noncovered employment and we
see no reason not to consider purchased credits when deciding whether the modified computation applies. 

We have adopted the interpretation that we will consider all applicable service used by the pension-paying agency,
regardless of when the service was acquired. Under this interpretation, an individual ``first becomes eligible''
for a monthly periodic payment for the first month (including a past month) that the individual meets all the requirements
for the payment except stopping work or applying for the payment. We, therefore, propose to amend  404.213(a)
to include the definition of ``first becomes eligible'' and our policy on applicable service.

Regarding underpayments, the current  404.503(b), which reflects section 204(d) of the Act, provides that
if an individual dies before receiving a title II benefit payment, the underpayment so created is payable to a person
or persons in an order of priority as specified in that section. Paragraph (3) of  404.503(b) provides that if
there is no one higher in the order of priority, the underpayment may be paid to the ``parent or parents of the deceased
individual (as defined in  404.374) entitled to monthly benefit on the basis of the same earnings record as was
the deceased individual'' in the month of death. Under paragraph (6) of  404.503(b), if there is no one higher
in the order of priority, the underpayment may be paid to the ``parent or parents of the deceased individual (as defined
in  404.374) who do not qualify under paragraph (b)(3).''
Section 404.374 defines ``parent'' as the natural, adoptive, or stepparent of an 

insured

 person and is based on the statutory requirements for eligibility for benefits as the parent of an insured worker.
However, these stringent criteria are not required for purposes of receiving an underpayment. Section 204(d) (3)
and (6) of the Act require only that the individual be the parent of the deceased underpaid beneficiary. The cross reference
to  404.374 in  404.503(b) (3) and (6) results in an unduly restrictive definition of a parent who is eligible
for an underpayment. We are, therefore, proposing to revise  404.503(b) (3) and (6) so that for purposes of eligibility
for an underpayment, the definition of ``parent'' in  404.374 is extended to a parent of any deceased individual
who was entitled to social security benefits.
Regarding overpayments, we are amending  404.510, which lists the situations where an individual may be considered
to be ``without fault'' for accepting an incorrect benefit payment. Paragraph (

l

) of that section explains that the overpaid individual may be ``without fault'' in causing the overpayment if he or
she reasonably believed that net earnings from self-employment after attaining age 72 in a taxable year would not
be cause for deductions from benefits for months in the year of attaining age 72 that are before the month of attainment.
For months after 1982, the age at which social security beneficiaries are no longer subject to an earnings test has
been reduced from age 72 to age 70. This reduction from age 72 to 70 is based on section 302 of Pub. L. 95-216 (the
Social Security Amendments of 1977) which became effective for months after December 1982, as provided in section
2204 of Pub. L. 97-35 (the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981). We are, therefore, revising  404.510(

l

) to change age 72 to age 70 for months after December 1982.

Our final amendment in these regulations is to delete Albania and the German Democratic Republic from the list in  404.460
of countries to which the Department of the Treasury will not send benefit checks. On November 7, 1991, The Department
of the Treasury removed the German Democratic Republic from the Withheld Check List set out in 31 CFR 211.1 by publishing
final rules in the 

Federal Register

 at 56 FR 56931. On September 30, 1992, the Department removed Albania from the list by publishing final rules in the


Federal Register

 at 57 FR 44998.

Regulatory Procedures



Executive Order No. 12866



We have consulted with the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and determined that these rules do not meet the criteria
for a significant regulatory action under E.O. 12866. Thus, they were not subject to OMB review.



Regulatory Flexibility Act



We certify that these proposed rules will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities
since these rules affect only individuals. Therefore, a regulatory flexibility analysis as provided in Pub. L. 96-354,
the Regulatory Flexibility Act, is not required.



Paperwork Reduction Act



These proposed rules impose no additional reporting or recordkeeping requirements subject to Office of Management
and Budget clearance.

Federal Old-Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance; Changes in Evidence Required To Presume a Person Is Dead



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Social Security Administration, HHS.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Proposed rules.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

These proposed regulations would provide that, under title II of the Social Security Act (the Act), a presumption
of death arises when the claimant established an individual has been absent from his or her residence and not heard
from for 7 years. Once the presumption is made, the burden then shifts to us to rebut the presumption either by presenting
evidence that the missing individual is still alive or by providing an explanation to account for the individual's
absence in a manner consistent with continued life rather than death.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Background



Under title II of the Act, a lump sum death payment and monthly survivors' benefits may be payable based on the earnings
of a deceased insured person. In order to ensure that these benefits are not paid based on mere desertion, any inquiry
into entitlement begins with an assumption that a person last known to be alive is still living, and that a person's
failure to communicate with a few people and to return to a particular place do not, in themselves, give rise to a presumption
of death. To establish eligibility for such benefits, the claimant must establish that the insured person is dead.
If proof of death (as described in   404.720(b) and (c)) is unavailable, we will presume an insured person
is dead if certain evidence is presented. Under the present  404.721(b), such evidence includes signed statements
by those in a position to know and other records which show that the person has been absent from his or her residence 

for no apparent reason, 

and has not been heard from for at least 7 years.

This evidentiary requirement has yielded two very different interpretations. It has long been our policy that the
claimant must present the evidence necessary to establish that he or she is entitled to benefits. Accordingly, for
us to presume that an insured person is dead, the claimant must establish that the insured person not only has not been
heard from for at least 7 years, but also that he or she has been absent from his or her residence for no apparent reason.
If the insured person's absence can be attributer to known domestic or financial difficulties or to some other rational
reason for leaving home, death is not presumed. We are not required to establish that the insured person is still alive
to explain the person's absence.

In contrast to our interpretation, a number of United States Courts of Appeals have issued decisions which have presumed
the death of a missing person despite the existence of other reasonable explanations for the person's absence. These
court decisions have held that a presumption of death arises under our regulations when the claimant shows that a person
has been absent from his or her residence and not heard from for 7 years. Once the claimant has made this showing, these
decisions state that the Secretary bears the burden of rebutting the presumption of death either by presenting evidence
showing that the missing person is alive or by providing an explanation to account for the individual's absence in
a manner that is consistent with continued life. As a result of these court decisions, we published Social Security
Acquiescence Rulings applicable in the Third, Fifth, Sixth, Eighth, Ninth, Tenth, and Eleventh Circuits which adopt
this interpretation of  404.721.

We published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) on February 29, 1984, (49 FR 7405-7406), containing proposed
revisions of  404.721 which we hoped would clarify the regulation to avoid the varying interpretations of the
regulation made by the courts. Under the previously proposed regulation, we would presume the death of the insured
person if signed statements by persons, who were in a position to know, and other evidence showed that all three of the
following requirements were met:

(1) The insured person has not had contact of any kind with any relatives, dependents, employers, or friends for at
least 7 years.

(2) A diligent search was conducted with the air of the appropriate authorities reasonably soon after the insured
person's disappearance, but the search failed to locate or explain the absence of the insured person.

(3) Circumstances surrounding the insured person's disappearance allow no reasonable explanation of that person's
absence other than death.

After much deliberation, we have decided that we will not adopt the rule published in the NPRM. This NPRM withdraws
the NPRM published at 49 FR 7405-7406 on February 29, 1984.

In light of the Social Security Acquiescence Rulings, we are now administering two different standards with respect
to presumption of death for entitlement purposes. One standard is based on our historical interpretation of the regulation;
the other on the Social Security Acquiescence Rulings issued for the seven different circuits as the result of appellate
court decisions. We have reevaluated our policies and are proposing to revise the existing regulation and establish
a national policy based on the interpretation set forth by the courts.

Also, we propose to revise the regulations to include a new section which will contain information on evidence which
will rebut a presumption of death. Current regulations do not provide guidance on what constitutes evidence to rebut
a presumption of death.

The proposed regulations will provide that the presumption of death arises when the claimant establishes an individual
has been absent from his or her residence and not heard from for 7 years. Once the presumption is made, the burden then
shifts to us to rebut the presumption either by presenting evidence that the missing individual is still alive or by
providing an explanation to account for the individual's absence in a manner consistent with continued life rather
than death.

We will remove reference to establishing no apparent reason for the absence from  404.721(b). We will provide
rules concerning the rebuttal of a presumption of death in proposed  404.722, a new section to the regulations.
This section will provide that a presumption of death made based on  404.721(b) will be rebutted if there is evidence
available that the person is still alive or the absence can be explained in a manner consistent with continued life
rather than death. We will also make a conforming change to  404.988 (conditions for reopening) to reflect the
proposed change in  404.721(b).

We will rescind the following Social Security Acquiescence Rulings by publishing a notice in the 

Federal Register

 when we publish these rules as final in the 

Federal Register

 AR 86-6(3); AR 86-7(5); AR 86-8(6); AR 86-9(9); AR 86-10(10); AR 86-11(11); and
AR 93-6(8).

We have consulted with the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and determined that these proposed rules do not meet
the criteria for a significant regulatory action under E.O. 12866. Thus, they were not subject to OMB review.



Regulatory Flexibility Act



We certify that these regulations will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities because
these rules will only affect individuals. Therefore, a regulatory flexibility analysis as provided in Pub. L. 96-354,
the regulatory Flexibility Act, is not required.

These proposed regulations impose no new reporting or recordkeeping requirements requiring Office of Management

For the reasons set out in the preamble, we are proposing to amend Subparts H and J of Part 404 of 20 CFR Chapter III as follows:



PART 404_FEDERAL OLD-AGE, SURVIVORS AND DISABILITY INSURANCE (1950- )



1. The authority citation for Subpart H of Part 404 continues to read as follows:






Authority: 

Secs. 205(a) and 1102 of the Social Security Act; 42 U.S.C. 405(a) and 1302.



 404.721

[Amended]



2. Section 404.721(b) is amended by removing ``for no apparent reasons,'' and by removing the comma between ``from''
and ``for'' in the first sentence; and by removing ``If there is no evidence available that he or she is still alive''
in the second sentence and substituting the words ``If the presumption of death is not rebutted pursuant to  404.722''
in its place.

3. New section 404.722 is added to read as follows:



 404.722

Rebuttal of a Presumption of Death.



A presumption of death made based on  404.721(b) can be rebutted by evidence that establishes that the person
is still alive or explains the individual's absence in a manner consistent with continued life rather than death.

Example 1: Evidence in a claim for surviving child's benefits showed that the worker had wages posted to his earnings
record in the year following the disappearance. It was established that the wages belonged to the worker and were for
work done after his ``disappearance.'' In this situation, the presumption of death is rebutted by evidence (wages
belonging to the worker) that the person is still alive after the disappearance.

Example 2: Evidence shows that the worker left the family home shortly after woman, whom he had been seeing, also disappeared,
and that the worker phoned his wife several days after the disappearance to state he intended to begin a new life in California.
In this situation the presumption of death is rebutted because the evidence explains the worker's absence in a manner
consistent with continued life.

4. The authority citation for Subpart J of Part 404 continues to read as follows:






Authority: 

Secs. 201(j), 205(a), (b), and (d)-(h), 221(d), and 1102 of the Social Security Act; 31 U.S.C. 3720A; 40 U.S.C.
401(j), 405(a), (b), and (d)-(h), 421(d), and 1302.




5. Paragraph (c)(4) introductory text and (c)(4)(i) of  404.988 are revised to read as follows:



 404.988

Conditions for reopening.



* * * * *



(c) * * *

(4) Your claim was denied because you did not prove that a person died, and the death is later established_

(i) By a presumption of death under  404.721(b); or,

(ii) * * *

Notice of proposed rulemaking.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Coast Guard proposes to amend certain technical lighting provisions and interpretive regulations supplementing
the Inland Navigation Rules. These proposed changes will bring certain U.S. technical rules into conformity with
amendments to the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea (72 COLREGS) scheduled to become effective
in November, 1995. In addition, at the request of the Navigation Safety Advisory Council (NAVSAC), the Coast Guard
is proposing several interpretive regulations to clarify ambiguities in the rules.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Request for Comments



The Coast Guard encourages interested persons to participate in this rulemaking by submitting written data, views,
or arguments. Persons submitting comments should include their name and address, identify this rulemaking (CGD
94-011) and the specific section of this proposal to which each comment applies, and give a reason for each comment.
Please submit two copies of all comments and attachments in an unbound format, no larger than 81/2 by 11 inches, suitable
for copying and electronic filing. Persons wanting acknowledgment of receipt of comments should enclose a stamped,
self-addressed postcard or envelope.
The Coast Guard will consider all comments received during the comment period. It may change this proposal in view
of the comments.
The Coast Guard plans no public hearing. Persons may request a public hearing by writing to the Marine Safety Council
at the address under ADDRESSES

. The request should include reasons why a hearing would be beneficial. If it determines that the opportunity for oral
presentations will aid this rulemaking, the Coast Guard will hold a public hearing at a time and place announced by
a later notice in the 

Federal Register.




Drafting Information


The principal persons involved in drafting this document are Jonathan Epstein, Project Manager, Office of Navigation
Safety and Waterway Services, and Ms. Helen Boutrous, Project Counsel, Office of Chief Counsel.


Background and Purpose


The Inland Navigation Rules and the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea (72 COLREGS) provide
Rules governing all vessels on inland waters and on the high seas, respectively. In order to maintain consistency
between the 72 COLREGS and the Inland Navigation Rules, the Coast Guard is proposing to revise certain technical rules
to conform with amendments to the 72 COLREGS scheduled to become effective in November 1995. The Coast Guard anticipates
that these proposed revisions, if adopted, would also become effective November 1995 to coincide with the effective
date of the COLREGS amendments. In no case would the amendments become effective before November, 1995.

In addition, the Navigation Safety Advisory Council (NAVSAC), a congressionally mandated advisory group, has been
reviewing the Inland Navigation Rules for consistency with the 72 COLREGS. As part of this ongoing review, NAVSAC
has recommended several regulatory changes to clarify ambiguities in practical application of the rules as well
as to bring the Inland Navigation Rules into closer conformity with the 72 COLREGS.



Discussion of Proposed Amendments to Conform to 72 COLREGS Changes



In November 1995, eight amendments to the 72 COLREGS will become effective. NAVSAC has endorsed amending the Inland
Navigation Rules technical annexes to reflect these changes to the 72 COLREGS. These proposed amendments deal primarily
with light placement requirements.



Masthead Lights for Vessels Less Than 20 Meters in Length ( 84.05)



The Coast Guard is proposing to revise 33 CFR 84.05 to allow vessels less than 20 meters in length to carry their masthead
light as far forward as is practicable. This would result in no substantive change for mariners because Inland Navigation
Rule 23(a) already provides that vessels less than 20 meters in length may carry their masthead lights as far forward
as is practicable. However, this proposed change to  84.05 would maintain parallel language between the Inland
Navigation Rules and the 72 COLREGS. Although the 72 COLREGS amendment was originally based on a U.S. proposal to the
International Maritime Organization (IMO) to amend Rule 23(a)(i), the IMO Subcommittee chose to amend technical
Annex I rather than Rule 23(a)(i). The proposed revision will ease compliance for mariners who will be able to refer
to parallel language in Annex I of the 72 COLREGS and Annex I of the Inland Rules.



Use of Two Lights To Meet Angular Sector Requirements ( 84.17)



This proposed amendment would allow the pairing of light fixtures to ensure all round visibility of navigation lights.
This change would maintain consistency with the corresponding 72 COLREGS amendment. On a vessel with a mast of large
diameter, such as a warship or a vessel with a combined smoke stack and mast configuration, it is often structurally
impractical to mount a single all around light at a sufficient distance from the mast to meet the 6
  angular cutout requirements of the Navigation Rules, which prescribe a maximum 6
  blind zone. This problem can be addressed either through the use of two separate lights adequately screened,
or two lights close enough together that they appear, for all practical purposes, as one light. This proposed regulation
will specifically allow the use of two lights sufficiently screened or placed near enough together that they appear
as one light at a distance of one mile. Two unscreened all-around lights that are 1.28 meters (4.2 feet) apart or less
will appear as one light to the naked eye at a distance of one mile.



High Speed Craft ( 84.27)



This proposed amendment would allow modern high speed catamarans and other craft of unusually wide design to carry
masthead lights at a lower level than would otherwise be prescribed by the rules. This change will keep the Inland Annex
I in conformity with an amendment to the 72 COLREGS Annex I. The proposal would create a new provision for high speed
craft. The proposed definition of high speed craft is the same as is used in IMO's ``Draft Code of Safety of High Speed
Craft''. This change recognizes that existing light placement requirements based on traditional ship design are
often impractical when dealing with non-traditional designs such as catamarans and SWATH (Small Waterplane Area
Twin Hull) craft. The proposed definition of high speed craft includes a formula which captures those vessels, such
as hydrofoils and hovercraft, that can exceed conventional craft hull speed through use of dynamically supportable
hull designs. The corresponding 72 COLREGS amendment was drafted such that modern catamaran and non-displacement
craft that are unusually wide relative to their length and capable of speeds generally in excess of 25 knots, would
not be required to carry their masthead light at a heights unreasonable for the size of the vessel. This new provision
would apply to vessels that meet the definitional requirements for both high speed craft and have a length to breadth
ratio of less than three-to-one. The following example illustrates the calculations for mast height on a vessel meeting
the definitional requirements: A high speed catamaran ferry, 59 meters in length with a 20 meter beam, may carry its
forward masthead light 5.1 meters above the sidelights, instead of 8 meters above the hull. (Sidelights need only
be placed above the hull high enough so as not to be interfered with by deck lights). The definition of ``high speed craft''
is based on a formula that compares displacement to maximum speed. Generally hydrofoils, surface effect ships, some
light monohulls and catamarans will meet this definition, while conventional displacement vessels, tankers, fishing
vessels and container ships, will not. Certain high powered displacement vessels such as frigates or destroyers
may meet this definition but would not meet the length to breadth ratio requirements. Because compliance with the
proposed provision for high speed craft would be required only in lieu of compliance with  84.03(a)(1), existing
vessels need not modify their light configurations.

IMO considered extending the use of the yellow light provided for in Rule 23(b) for air-cushioned vessels to all high
speed craft. However, this light is intended to draw to the attention of other vessels the possibility that an air-cushioned
vessel may be proceeding at a large yaw angle. Thus, the navigation lights may not give an accurate indication of the
track made good. Therefore, the IMO determined that extending the use of the yellow light to all high speed craft would
be inappropriate.

Radar Transponders ( 87.1)


In order to maintain consistency with the 72 COLREGS, this rulemaking proposes to add the use of survival craft radar
transponders to the list of distress signals included in 33 CFR 87.1. The 1988 amendments to the Safety of Life at Sea
Convention (SOLAS), in Regulation III/26.1.4, require that cargo and passenger ships subject to SOLAS carry Search
and Rescue Transponders (SARTS) for use in survival craft. A SART is a radar transponder that responds automatically
to most surface navigation radars allowing rescuers to quickly locate a vessel or survival craft. Carriage requirements
and specifications for SARTS are codified in Federal Communication Commission regulations at 47 CFR 80.1095, which
are referenced in the proposed revision.


Discussion of Other Proposed Regulations


Lights on Moored Barges ( 82.5, 88.13, 90.5)


These proposed amendments to the Pilot Rules, the interpretive rules of the 72 COLREGS and the interpretive rules
of the Inland Rules, will clarify the responsibilities of vessels moored to mooring buoys or other similar devices.
Rule 30 of the 72 COLREGS and Rule 30 of the Inland Navigation Rules provide lighting requirements for vessels at anchor,
without specifically mentioning vessels moored to mooring buoys. The Coast Guard proposes interpretive rules to
clarify that the term ``vessels at anchor'' in Rule 30 of the 72 COLREGS and the Inland Rules rules is to be interpreted
to include vessels moored to a mooring buoy.
Recognizing the need to specify safe lighting procedures for vessels moored to a mooring buoys, the Coast Guard presented
this issue first to the Navigation Safety Advisory Council (NAVSAC), and then, at their request, to the Towing Safety
Advisory Council (TSAC) and the National Boating Safety Advisory Council (BSAC). Although reaching different formulations,
all three advisory groups agreed that a vessel moored to a mooring buoy or other similar device should be lighted as
a vessel at anchor in accordance with Rule 30.
The groups also agreed however, that barges should be lighted on the corners in a scheme to that provided in 33 CFR 88.13
for barges moored to a bank or dock. Information indicates that most barge operators already light barges on the corners.
Not only does this lighting scheme provide better definition of the size and dimensions of the barge(s) than a single
anchor light, but by placing the lights near the sides, it allows a better vertical visibility of small boats. Additionally,
the Coast Guard has determined that it would be appropriate to require such lights on barges to be visible for one nautical
mile, and to otherwise meet the technical standards for marine lights as provided in 33 CFR 84.15 (Annex I to the Inland
Navigation Rules). Currently, barges moored along banks or docks are required to carry two unobstructed white lights
of an intensity to be visible for at least one mile on a clear dark night (33 CFR 88.13(b)). This requirement has led to
confusion in the maritime community. In a recent allision between a tug and tow and moored barges, the limited visibility
of the lights on the moored barges was a contributing factor in the allision. Barge operators can easily meet the proposed
requirement. Marine light fixtures meeting this standard are required for recreational vessels operating at night.
Therefore, these fixtures are readily available and inexpensive.
In consideration of the foregoing, the proposed interpretive rules of  90.5 (Inland) and  82.5 (COLREGS)
provide that a vessel moored to a mooring buoy be lighted as a vessel at anchor, in accordance with Rule 30, except that
barges, unless otherwise authorized by the Coast Guard Captain of the Port (COTP), shall be lighted in accordance
with  88.13. However, the exception provided in Inland and COLREGS Rule 30(e) for vessels less than 7 meters
in length, and Inland Rule 30(g) for vessels less than 20 meters in length in special anchorage areas would also apply
to vessels moored to mooring buoys.
The proposed additions to the Pilot Rules at  88.13 will prescribe, unless otherwise authorized by the Coast
Guard Captain of the Port (COTP), a different lighting scheme for barges (generally, a white light on each corner).
This scheme is already customary practice in many parts of the country. However, in particular circumstances the
COTP could authorize that a barge be lighted in another manner. For example, the COTP could authorize a barge to be lighted
as a vessel at anchor. This could arise where it would be safer for a barge moored in relatively open water to light with
fore and aft anchor lights with a visibility of three miles in lieu of four lights with a visibility of only one mile.
The Coast Guard, through proposed  82.5, intends to require these lighting schemes for barges on all U.S. navigable
waters including COLREGS waters, specifically, Alaskan waters, Puget Sound and other heavily trafficked U.S. waters
which are COLREGS waters for the purposes of the Rules. This type of special regulation for U.S. navigable waters is
within the special rules exception of COLREGS Rule 1(b).

Barge Sidelights ( 82.7, 90.7)


Improper lighting of barges has been a contributory factor in some accidents involving recreational boaters and
has been the subject of periodic Congressional interest. This interpretative regulation will clarify the requirements
of Rule 24 of the 72 COLREGS and Rule 24 of the Inland Rules for barge sidelights and thereby help to reduce the incidence
of improper lighting of barges.
The U.S. delegation to the IMO raised the issue of sidelights on unmanned barges with the Subcommittee on Safety of
Navigation. It was agreed that sidelights powered with existing battery technology could not meet the vertical sector
requirements for larger vessels under the 72 COLREGS. It was further agreed that an unmanned barge, unable to meet
the technical lighting requirements, could meet the requirements under COLREGS Rule 24(h). Rule 24(h) allows a vessel
or object being towed to exhibit alternative lighting where it is impracticable to light the vessel as prescribed
in paragraphs (e) or (g) of Rule 24. A Commandant Instruction to this effect was issued on May 10, 1989. (Commandant
Instruction 16672.3A International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea, 1972 (72 COLREGS); Lights for
Unmanned Barges.). The instruction indicates that those lighting unmanned barges may avail themselves of the Rules
24(h) exception. This exception pertains to the ``vertical sector'' technical requirements only. This has been
the source of some confusion to mariners who have asserted that paragraph (h) exempts them from other provisions of
Rule 24 as well. The proposed interpretive rules will make clear that in all other respects, the sidelights must meet
all the technical requirements of the Inland Rules for vessels of that size. This would preclude the use of known non-marine
light fixtures. Failure to comply with Inland Rule technical requirements, except the vertical sector requirements
under Rule 24(h), where appropriate, could subject a mariner to civil penalties. Including this interpretation
in   82.7 and 90.7 will help to ensure that mariners are aware of the correct interpretation of Rule 24 and
its exception in paragraph (h).


Corrections to COLREGS Demarcation lines ( 80)


This proposal also includes corrections to several errors in the description of COLREGS demarcation lines in 33 CFR
part 80. COLREGS demarcation lines are codified boundaries that delineate the applicability of either the Inland
Navigation Rules or COLREGS. These lines are marked on navigational charts. The first correction is to the geographic
coordinates in  80.501 and  80.520. While these lines are correctly depicted on navigational charts,
their description in the Code of Federal Regulations includes inadvertent errors. This rule also proposes to correct
several errors in  80.1495, which misspells Johnston Island; refers to Canton Island, which was returned to
the Republic of Kirbati in the late 1970s, as a U.S. Possession; and refers to the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands
which was dissolved in 1987.


Regulatory Evaluation


This proposal is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does not require
an assessment of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that order. It has not been reviewed by the Office
of Management and Budget under that order. It is not significant under the regulatory policies and procedures of the
Department of Transportation (DOT) (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979).
The Coast Guard expects the economic impact of this proposal to be so minimal that a full Regulatory Evaluation under
paragraph 10e of the regulatory policies and procedures of DOT is unnecessary. The only proposed provision involving
potential costs to mariners is the proposed rule that would require moored barges to display lights in accordance
with prescribed lighting schemes meeting certain minimum standards. This lighting scheme is consistent with existing
industry practice. The Coast Guard estimates that a relatively small proportion of bargetowboat owners are not equipped
to light their barges as prescribed by this NPRM. For those persons that do not have lights meeting appropriate standards,
the cost is de minimus. An all-round white light fixture costs approximately $12.00. Because most barge lights are
placed onboard temporarily by fleeting or towboats when necessary, and barges fleeted together would be lighted
as one unit, it is difficult to accurately estimate the number of lights that would be required to be purchased by an
individual mariner or maritime company. However, because of the low unit cost, the impact on any one operator will
be minimal. The Coast Guard specifically requests comments from the industry regarding the expected costs of the
proposed rules.


Small Entities


Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.), the Coast Guard must consider whether this proposal will
have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. ``Small entities'' include (1) small
not-for-profit organizations that are independently owned and operated and are not dominant in their fields and
(2) governmental jurisdictions with populations of less than 50,000.

<DOCNO> FR940720-1-00020 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940720-1-00006 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The only potential economic impact would be cost of marine type fixtures. As discussed above, that cost is de minimus.
Because it expects the impact of this proposal to be minimal, the Coast Guard certifies under 5 U.S.C. 605(b) that this
proposal, if adopted, will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.



Collection of Information



This proposal contains no collection of information requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501


et seq

.). 



Federalism



The Coast Guard has analyzed this rule in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order
12612 and has determined that this proposal does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation
of a Federalism Assessment. Under federal law, authority to issue regulations to implement the Inland Navigational
Rules is vested in the Secretary of transportation and delegated to the Coast Guard. Therefore, if this rule become
final, the Coast Guard intends it to preempt State action addressing this subject matter. 



Environment 



The Coast Guard considered the environmental impact of this rule and concluded that, under section 2.B.2 of Commandant
Instruction M16475.1B, this rulemaking is categorically excluded from further environmental documentation.
A Categorical Exclusion Determination is available in the docket for inspection or copying where indicated under

Expanded Remote Access to Computerized Veterans Claims Records by Accredited Representatives 


<AGENCY>

 Department of Veterans Affairs.

 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is proposing to establish policy, procedures and criteria governing when,
and under what circumstances, VA will grant authorized claimants' representatives read-only access to the automated
claims records of claimants whom they represent from approved office locations away from the VA Regional Offices
of jurisdiction for the claimants' records. Access will be granted only for the purpose of representing those claimants
before VA on claims-related matters. In order to help safeguard the confidentiality of claimants' automated claims
records, the proposed rules also set out responsibilities and restrictions on claimants' representatives in exercising
their remote access to VA's automated claims records. These procedures and criteria will provide for better and more
timely representation of claimants in claims matters by allowing their representatives to have faster, easier and
more efficient access to the claimants' records than they currently have when they have to travel to the Regional Offices.
The proposed regulations will also ensure more efficient use of VA resources in meeting the agency mission in that
VA employees will have to spend less time providing access to those representatives who do not have their own computers
in Regional Offices.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 VA is proposing to incorporate into its regulations policies, criteria and procedures governing access to certain
Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) computerized claimants' records by individuals and organizations which
represent those claimants from locations away from the Regional Offices of jurisdiction for those claimants' records.



Currently, accredited representatives of veterans service organizations who hold a valid, current, VA power of
attorney to assist claimants in the presentation of claims for benefits administered by VA may have on-line, remote
access to certain information about those claimants contained in VA's automated claims records if the representatives
and their computers are located in office space provided within VBA Regional Offices under 38 U.S.C.  5902(a)(2).
Accredited veterans' representatives not located at a VBA Regional Office who do not have such remote, on-line access
are expected to go to the Regional Office and arrange with VA employees using VA computers to view a veteran's automated
claims records. 
VA has decided to provide the same on-line, remote access capability to all individuals and organizations accredited
under 38 CFR 14.626-.635 who represent claimants on VA claims for benefits and who request such access. Access
will also be provided to attorneys of record for claimants before the Court of Veterans Appeals who request such access.

The proposed rules concern when, and under what circumstances, VA will grant access, the responsibilities of those
granted access, and the bases to revoke or suspend access. VA will grant no more than read-only access to authorized
claimants' representatives for the purpose of assisting claimants for whom they hold a valid power of attorney (or
equivalent designation) in presenting their claims for VA benefits. Read-only access necessarily includes the
ability to print or down-load the information. 
Qualified representatives will be granted access by the Regional Office of jurisdiction for the particular claimant's
records. In order for VBA to grant access, the Regional Office must first approve the equipment and software the applicant
will use to obtain access, as well as the location from which the representative will access the VBA computer system.
Approval of the hardware and software is intended to ensure that access can be accomplished while maintaining the
necessary security. Approval of the location is intended to ensure that access is only from the representative's
customary and usual or primary place of representation, and not from other locations. This avoids the use of unapproved
equipment and limits the possibility of unauthorized access to the data by individuals not approved for access by
VA. The applicant must also sign a notice that contains the security requirements applicable to the system. 
Certain confidentiality statutes, namely, the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C.  552a, and 38 U.S.C.   5701
and 7332 generally govern the VA's disclosure of claimants' records, whether paper or automated, to their representatives.
Accredited representatives and agents may see the claims folders of those individuals whom they represent for two
reasons: the claimant has indicated in advance in writing to the Department that the named individual or organization
represents him or her on a claim for benefits, and the claimant has given prior written consent to VA's release of information
to the claimant's representative. Attorneys, as officers of the court, need only file documentation that they represent
the claimant. A routine use then permits the disclosure. 
These requirements also are designed to provide audit and accountability records for those who access the system,
as well as ensuring the integrity and confidentiality of the system and data from unauthorized access.

In order to oversee access activities properly which provide for the security of the data and system, VBA may, without
notice, inspect the accessor's computer systems, review its security procedures, and monitor its access activities.

VBA may revoke access privileges in two circumstances. The first is based on applicable confidentiality statutes,
e.g., the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C.  552a, and 38 U.S.C.   5701 and 7332. Whenever an individual or organization
is no longer entitled to access a particular claimant's records as a matter of law under the applicable confidentiality
statutes, VA will terminate that individual's access privileges to that particular claimant's automated claims
records. VA may also revoke access privileges based upon failure to comply with the regulations. 


Regulatory Flexibility Act 


The Secretary of Veterans Affairs has certified that these proposed rules, if promulgated, will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities as they are defined in the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5
U.S.C. 601-612. Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the regulations, therefore, are exempt from the initial and final
regulatory flexibility analyses requirements of sections 603 and 604. 
This certification can be made because the regulations facilitate representative access to their claimants' information
while imposing little in the way of cost or administrative burden. Further, the rules affect only the small number
of entities and individuals which represent claimants in claims before VA. 
This regulation is subject to review under Executive Order 12866. 
There are no Catalog of federal Domestic Assistance numbers for this program.

and Records Location Subsystem) Inquiry), SINQ (Status Inquiry), MINQ (Master Record Inquiry), PINQ (Pending Issue
Inquiry) and TINQ (Payment History Inquiry). The identifying information received from BIRLS to representative
inquiries will be limited to file number, veteran's name, date of death, folder location and transfer date of folder,
insurance number, insurance type, insurance lapse date and insurance folder jurisdiction. 

(d) Sections 14.640 through 14.643 are not intended to, and do not: 

(1) Waive the sovereign immunity of the United States; or 

(2) Create, and may not be relied upon to create, any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law
against the United States or the Department of Veterans Affairs. 



 14.641 

Qualifications for access. 



(a) An applicant for read-only access to VBA automated claims records from a location other than a VA Regional Office
must be: 

(1) An organization, representative, attorney or agent approved or accredited by VA under 38 CFR 14.626 through 14.635;
or 

(2) An attorney of record for a claimant in proceedings before the Court of Veterans Appeals or subsequent proceedings
who requests access to the claimant's automated claims records as part of the representation of the claimant. 

(b) The hardware, modem and software utilized to obtain access, as well as their location, must be approved in advance
by VBA. 

(c) Each individual and organization approved for access must sign and return a notice provided by the Regional Office
Director (or the Regional Office Director's designee) of the Regional Office of jurisdiction for the claim. The notice
will specify the applicable operational and security requirements for access and an acknowledgment that the breach
of any of these requirements is grounds for disqualification from access. 



 14.642 

Utilization of access. 



(a) Once an individual or organization has been issued the necessary passwords to obtain read-only access to the automated
claims records of individuals represented, access will be exercised in accordance with the following requirements:


(1) The individual or organization will obtain access only from equipment and software approved in advance by the
Regional Office from the location where the individual or organization primarily conducts its representation activities
which also has been approved in advance; 

(2) The individual will use only his or her assigned password to obtain access; 

(3) The individual will not reveal his or her password to anyone else, or allow anyone else to use his or her password;

<TEXT>
 

(4) The individual will access only the VBA automated claims records of VA claimants who are represented by the person
obtaining access or by the organization employing the person obtaining access; 

(5) The individual will access a claimant's automated claims record solely for the purpose of representing that claimant
in a claim for benefits administered by VA. 

(6) Upon receipt of the password, the individual will destroy the hard copy; no written or printed record containing
the password will be retained; and 

(7) The individual and organization will comply with all security requirements VBA deems necessary to ensure the
integrity and confidentiality of the data and VBA's automated computer systems. 

(b) An organization granted access shall ensure that all employees provided access in accordance with these regulations
will receive regular, adequate training on proper security, including the items listed in  14.643(a). Where
an individual such as an attorney or registered agent is granted access, he or she will regularly review the security
requirements for the system as set forth in these regulations and in any additional materials provided by VBA. 

(c) VBA may, at any time without notice: 

(1) Inspect the computer hardware and software utilized to obtain access and their location; 

(2) Review the security practices and training of any individual or organization granted access under these regulations;
and 

(3) Monitor an individual's or organization's access activities. By applying for, and exercising, the access privileges
under   14.640 through 14.643, the applicant expressly consents to VBA monitoring the access activities
of the applicant at any time. 



 14.643 

Disqualification. 



(a) The Regional Office Director or the Regional Office Director's designee may revoke an individual's or an organization's
access privileges to a particular claimant's records because the individual or organization no longer represents
the claimant, and, therefore, the beneficiary's consent is no longer in effect. The individual or organization is
no longer entitled to access as a matter of law under the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C.  552a, and 38 U.S.C.   5701
and 7332. Under these circumstances, the individual or organization is not entitled to any hearing or to present any
evidence in opposition to the revocation. 

(b) An individual or organization granted access privileges to VBA automated claims benefits systems may have such
access privileges revoked either to an individual claimant's records or to all claimants' records if the individual
or organization: 

(1) Violates any of the provisions of   14.640 through 14.643; 

(2) Accesses or attempts to access data for a purpose other than representation of an individual veteran; 

(3) Accesses or attempts to access data other than the data specified in these regulations; 

(4) Accesses or attempts to access data on a VA beneficiary who is not represented either by the individual who obtains
access or by the organization employing the individual who obtains access; 

(5) Utilizes unapproved computer hardware or software to obtain or attempt to obtain access to VBA computer systems;


(6) Modifies or attempts to modify data in the VBA computer systems. 

(c) If VBA is considering revoking an individual's access, and that individual works for an organization, the Regional
Office of jurisdiction will notify the organization of the pendency of the action. 

(d) After an individual's access privileges are revoked, if the conduct which resulted in revocation was such that
it merits reporting to an appropriate governmental licensing organization such as a State bar, the VBA Regional Office
of jurisdiction will immediately inform the licensing organization in writing of the fact that the individual's
access privileges were revoked and the reasons why. 

(e) The VBA Regional Office of jurisdiction may temporarily suspend access privileges prior to any determination
on the merits of the proposed revocation where the Regional Office Director or the Director's designee determines
that such immediate suspension is necessary in order to protect the integrity of the system or confidentiality of
the data in the system from a reasonably foreseeable compromise. However, in such case, the Regional Office shall
offer the individual or organization an opportunity to respond to the charges immediately after the temporary suspension.

Revisions to Standards for Walk-Sequenced Bulk Third-Class Mail 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Postal Service.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This proposed rule will amend the standards for walk-sequence rate mail to require an identifying marking on each
piece.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Postal Service uses the In-Office Cost System (IOCS) and the Carrier Cost System (CCS) as tools to develop cost
information for each class and subclass of mail, and for special services. This information is used to develop proposals
for new postal rates and to assist in management evaluation of new rate structures. The IOCS uses work sampling to provide
data for attributing labor cost to each class, subclass, and special service. The CCS is used to collect data regarding
the volume of each type of mail on sampled delivery routes. These data are used to assign delivery costs to the pertinent
categories of mail. 


In order for the IOCS and CCS to be used to examine the costs of distinct groupings of mail, each piece in the grouping
must have a distinctive marking. When an individual sample is conducted, information regarding markings on the mailpiece
is recorded. To better quantify the value of mailer walk-sequencing, the Postal Service would like to track the cost
of third-class pieces claiming the 125-piece and saturation walk-sequence rates using IOCS and CCS. Currently this
is not possible because walk-sequenced mail can be identified as such simply by including a facing slip with the phrase
``WALK-SEQUENCE CARRIER ROUTE MAIL'' on the top of each package. The proposed change would require that each individual
piece contain a ``WS'' marking either on the carrier route identification line or as part of the carrier route presort
endorsement. Although facing slips would still be allowed, they would no longer fulfill the requirement for identifying
the mail as walk-sequenced. 
Although exempt from the notice and comment requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553(b), (c))
regarding proposed rulemaking by 39 U.S.C. 410(a), the Postal Service invites comments on the following proposed
revisions of the DMM, incorporated by reference in the Code of Federal Regulations. See 39 CFR Part 111.

In addition to the markings required by M303, each piece claimed at a walk-sequence rate must be marked ``WS'' immediately
preceding either the carrier route information on the carrier route information line (e.g., **WS CARRIER ROUTE 017)
or the carrier route presort marking shown in M303 (e.g., WS CAR-RT SORT). Pieces not claimed at a walk-sequence rate
must not bear the ``WS'' marking.

3.2 Labeling 


In addition to the labeling required in M303, a facing slip with a phrase identifying the mail, such as ``WALK-SEQUENCED

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This proposal would revise the present standards in the Domestic 
Mail Manual (DMM) on materials eligible for mailing at second-class rates with 
authorized second-class publications. The proposal would remove the current 
advertising limitation on loose supplements to bound publications and adopt a more 
objective test for determining what material can be mailed as a supplement. The 
proposal would revise the regulations on pages with ``novel'' characteristics, giving 
publishers more latitude in page design. The provisions concerning the mailing of 
products and product samples have been liberalized. A new provision has been 
added specifying how advertising content of second-class publications is to be 
measured. A provision has also been added defining public service 
announcements. Finally, the proposal would reorganize and clarify a number of 
additional standards for second-class mail concerning addressing, mailpiece 
construction, rate eligibility, and postage payment. These additional changes are 
editorial rather than substantive in nature. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 In the mid-1980s the Postal Service undertook 
an extensive review of the regulations governing what could be mailed as part of a 
periodical publication at second-class postage rates, with a special focus on 
supplements to second-class publications. Beginning in September 1986, the 
Postal Service published four proposed rules, culminating in a final rule that was 
published 2 years later. 53 FR 35813 (September 15, 1988). The final rule 
explained that then-recent changes in technology_specifically the introduction of 
equipment making it practical to insert a publication into a sealed plastic wrapper 
(polybag)_made it possible for publishers of bound second-class publications to 
include with their publications additional materials that are separate and distinct 
from the publication. A number of publishers were in favor of taking advantage of 
this new technology, but others were concerned that allowing separately prepared 
material to be enclosed loose in a polybag at second-class rates would cause an 
undesirable movement of printed advertising materials from third-class mail to 
second-class mail. 





The Postal Service noted the difficulty in reaching an appropriate balance between 
the conflicting concerns and interests in this area, and was hopeful that the 
rulemaking would resolve these issues. To counter arguments that second-class 
mail would be harmed by the inclusion of too much advertising in the form of loose 
supplements riding along with bound second-class publications, the final rule 
adopted, among other things, requirements that a loose second-class supplement 
and its host bound publication must be enclosed in an envelope or wrapper, that 
the supplement must contain a minimum of 25 percent nonadvertising content, 
and that the supplement must be marked ``Supplement to'' followed by the name 
of the publication or the publisher. 
Although that rulemaking was at least partially successful in achieving its goals, 
experience over the past 6 years indicates that further revisions may be 
appropriate. Technological advancements, such as selective binding, continue to 
affect the design of publications, and publishers continue to seek to include 
materials with second-class publications that were not contemplated at the time 
the current regulations were adopted. Many publishers consider the 25 percent 
nonadvertising rule for loose supplements to be burdensome and inappropriate as a 
means of curbing the influx of advertising in second-class mail. Many publishers 
also consider the current restrictions on the use of pages with ``novel'' 
characteristics and the inclusion of products and product samples to limit unduly 
their creativity in designing publications that appeal to their readers and 
advertisers. These publishers also point out that private delivery companies do not 
impose similar restrictions on their delivery of publications. 
The most significant problem with the current regulations from the Postal Service's 
perspective is the difficulty in applying these standards. This problem is not limited 
to customers, but exists for postal personnel as well, as is demonstrated by the 
relatively large number of revenue deficiencies and decisions overturned on 
administrative appeal that concern the mailing of supplements, novelty pages, and 
products with second-class publications. This difficulty of application creates 
additional expense for the Postal Service in training and in mail acceptance, and it 
compromises the ability of the Postal Service to collect consistently the correct 
postage on second-class mailings.

Accordingly, the Postal Service undertook a review of the standards that pertain to 
the content of second-class mail. This included review of the terminology involved 
(e.g., supplements, enclosures, attachments, novelty pages, independent 
publications), the substantive rules concerning eligibility of these materials for 
second-class rates, the clarity of the existing rules, and the organization of these 
rules in the DMM. The result of this review is the instant proposal for substantive 
and editorial changes to, and deletion of a number of, existing rules with the 
renumbering and reorganizing of these rules for clarity and ease of use. 
The Postal Service believes that the proposed rules, if adopted, will reduce the 
costs of mail acceptance and training, and facilitate timely collection of the 
appropriate postage on second-class mailings. The Postal Service also believes 
that the proposed elimination of a number of restrictions on publication design will 
promote publishers' continued use of the Postal Service for delivery of their 
periodical publications. Moreover, the proposed changes are not expected to have 
any adverse operational effect on the Postal Service. 
To provide clarity and improve the organization of the mailing standards governing 
the contents and characteristics of second-class mail, Domestic Mail Manual 
(DMM) C200 has been completely reorganized and renumbered under four main 
headings: 1.0 Permissible Mailpiece Components, 2.0 Impermissible Components, 
3.0 Mailpiece Construction, and 4.0 Printed Features. Within these sections are 
subsections that specifically identify what may and may not be included in a 
mailpiece claimed at second-class rates. The following discussion identifies the 
significant changes being proposed in C200. 
The reference to pages of a second-class publication in proposed C200.1.1 is new 
and describes those printed sheets that form the second-class mailpiece. Rather 
than addressing advertising and ``novelty pages'' in separate standards (as is 
currently done in C200.5.0 and 6.0), this proposed section sets forth a general rule 
that provides that the pages in a second-class publication, whether they contain 
advertising or nonadvertising matter or both, may be prepared with novel or 
unusual characteristics, i.e., different size, shape, or construction. This proposed 
change would limit the number of these pages to a minor portion of the publication 
so that the general appearance of the material as a ``periodical publication'' is 
maintained. In proposing this greater latitude on the preparation of pages to a 
publication, the Postal Service is concerned that publishers might create 
publications whose physical characteristics would encumber efficient postal 
processing. Therefore, this provision includes a requirement that no page may 
have dimensions (when folded) that exceed the dimensions of the cover of the 
publication. 
In another change from current standards, this new pages section would allow the 
use of grommets, string, rubber bands, and similar types of fastening materials in 
minor amounts in the production of printed sheets. The Postal Service has 
concluded that allowing the use of minor amounts of these fastening materials in 
the preparation of pages is consistent with the existing practice of allowing 
second-class publications to be bound with staples, saddle stitching, or spiral 
binding. 
The mailing standards governing the preparation of parts and sections in proposed 
C200.1.2 remain unchanged, although current C200.2.0, 2.1, 2.2, and 2.3 have 
been condensed into one paragraph. The provision governing parts or sections 
produced by someone other than the publisher has been retained in 1.2 to preserve 
the distinction between parts and sections of a publication and supplements to a 
publication. 
Nonincidental enclosures at First- and third-class rates are covered in proposed 
C200.1.3, which is composed of former 8.1, 8.3b, 8.4, 8.6, and 10.2. The 
wording has been changed for clarity. 
Proposed C200.1.4 incorporates current sections (C200.3.2, 3.3, 7.1, 7.2, and 
7.3) governing enclosures and attachments mailable at second-class rates. The 
last sentence of current 3.2f (proposed C200.1.4b) is deleted to remove the 
single-fold limitation on a printed sheet accompanying a receipt, request, or order 
for a subscription. The Postal Service does not believe that it is necessary to limit 
the method used by publishers in producing this material.

The proposal allows all items listed in C200.1.4 as permissible second-class 
enclosures to be treated as neither advertising nor nonadvertising, but instead to 
be accounted for in the weight of the host publication when determining postage. 
This is a change in the interpretation of current rules that distinguish between the 
subscription order or requester form and any additional material that promotes the 
publisher's publications. Allowing these permissible enclosures to be accounted for 
only in the weight of the host publication will simplify the acceptance review 
process without any significant effect on postal revenues. 
The proposed supplements section in C200.1.5 would change the standard 
concerning loose supplements to bound publications to eliminate the current 
requirement that such a supplement contain at least 25 percent nonadvertising 
content. If adopted, this change would allow publishers to include loose 
supplements with bound publications that could consist of up to 100 percent 
advertising. This change is being proposed in response to widespread requests 
from publishers for an elimination of this provision. These publishers argue that 
this provision is an unnecessary restriction on their ability to choose whether to 
place advertising matter in the host publication or in an accompanying loose 
supplement. They argue that competitors of the Postal Service impose no such 
restrictions on the nonpostal delivery of publications. They also argue that the 
responses by some publishers to the 25 percent nonadvertising requirement (e.g., 
the use of such devices as public service announcements that say such things as 
``Just Say No To Drugs'') demonstrate the uselessness of the provision as a means 
to increase the ``editorial'' content of second-class publications. These publishers 
argue that the overall requirement that second-class publications contain a 
substantial amount of nonadvertising content and the need to provide substantial 
editorial content to satisfy their subscribers are sufficient safeguards of the 
integrity and value of second-class mail. These publishers also correctly state that 
all advertising in supplements will be accounted and paid for at the advertising 
rates because the determination of a publication's advertising/nonadvertising 
content is based on the host piece and any supplements. The Postal Service finds 
that these arguments have merit and has determined to propose the elimination of 
the 25 percent nonadvertising content requirement for comment by all interested 
parties. 
The proposed supplements section also includes clarifying provisions, based on 
current standards and on Postal Service rulings, restricting the inclusion of loose 
sheets of advertising as a supplement. These provisions describe the permissible 
preparation of supplements for the four different methods of second-class 
mailpiece preparation_a bound publication not enclosed in a wrapper, a bound 
publication enclosed in a wrapper, and an unbound publication not enclosed in a 
wrapper, an unbound publication enclosed in a wrapper. Bound and unbound 
publications are defined in C200.3.1. The standards proscribing the use of mailing 
wrappers are set forth in C200.3.3 and 3.4. 
A bound publication that is not enclosed in a wrapper may not have any 
supplements included loose with it. Only enclosures under C200.1.4 may be 
included loose in a bound publication. A bound publication with one or more 
supplements must be enclosed in a wrapper. If a supplement to a bound 
publication is made up of more than one printed sheet, all sheets making up the 
supplement must be bound together to form one piece. If not, each loose sheet 
must separately qualify as a supplement. A supplement to an unbound publication 
that is not enclosed in a wrapper must be combined with, and inserted within, the 
publication. A loose supplement may be included with an unbound publication only 
if the entire mailpiece is enclosed in a wrapper. 
The proposed supplements section will retain the requirement that loose 
supplements to bound publications contain the identification ``Supplement to'' 
followed by the name of the publication or the publisher. This requirement to 
identify a supplement will also apply to any loose supplement mailed with an 
unbound publication enclosed in a wrapper. The presence of the ``Supplement to'' 
statement is an objective demonstration that the publisher designed the material to 
be included as a supplement to the host publication. The Postal Service believes 
that the retention of this identification requirement, the retention of the general 
requirement in C200.4.3 that all advertisements in bound publications must be 
permanently attached, and the clarification in C200.1.5 that any multisheet 
supplement to a bound publication must also be bound together will effectively 
limit the inclusion of miscellaneous loose advertising pieces with second-class 
publications enclosed in wrappers. 
The section on attachments (proposed C200.1.8) consolidates the wording 
contained in current 4.3 pertaining to the addition of stickers on covers of second-class publications or on mailing
wrappers. Additionally, proposed 1.8 includes 
information currently contained in 10.1 and 10.4, regarding the required markings 
for nonincidental First- and/or third-class enclosures. 
Except for its movement from A200.2.0 to C200.1.10, the provision allowing label 
carriers remains unaltered. Placement in C200 is more appropriate for these 
standards because they will be with the sections governing what may be combined 
loose in a polybag or plastic wrapper and mailed at the second-class rates (a 
mailing practice that commonly uses a label carrier).

Publishers have also complained about the subjective nature of the current 
standards concerning what material may not be included as a loose supplement at 
second-class rates. For example, current rules state that an independent 
publication may not be sent at second-class rates. Those rules then require the 
reviewer to determine the independence of material by making a subjective 
judgment based on a number of factors. Although the specified items (such as 
independent publications) remain ineligible for mailing at second-class rates (even if 
bound into publications), the Postal Service has undertaken to respond to 
publishers' concerns by explaining these restrictions more clearly. For this reason, 
proposed C200.2.1 sets forth a general standard that all the impermissible 
components in 2.2 to 2.5 are prohibited from being mailed at second-class rates 
whether they take the form of a run-of-press page, supplement, bound-in 
advertisement, or other component of the publication. Proposed C200.2.2 would 
base the decision on what constitutes impermissible matter on a review of the 
questionable material against a list of objective criteria, any one of which will 
automatically make that material ineligible for mailing at second-class rates. These 
criteria are a separate price or subscription instructions;
the
word
``catalog'';
a
First-, 

third-, or fourth-class permit imprint; an International Standard Book Number 
(ISBN); or an International Standard Serial Number (ISSN). The Postal Service 
believes that this change will simplify the determination of what constitutes 
impermissible second-class matter. This change is expected to benefit publishers 
by reducing the uncertainty and confusion they have experienced with regard to 
the current and more subjective standards. 


Current standards restrict the inclusion of products and product samples (see 
C200.1.8) in items mailed at the second-class rates. Proposed C200.2.3 would 
continue to exclude products, such as stationery, cassettes, and floppy disks, that 
are not printed sheets, but the proposed section would no longer prohibit product 
samples that are otherwise formed of printed sheets. The Postal Service believes 
that applying the general requirement that all second-class matter must be formed 
of printed sheets is a sufficient standard to limit the inappropriate mailing of 
products and product samples at second-class rates. Additionally, this section 
would relax current interpretations on what constitutes a product or merchandise 
when the item is a printed sheet. For example, under specific conditions, a 12-month calendar or a poster will now be
eligible to be mailed at second-class rates if 
it is not separately distributed or offered for sale. Including the name of the host 
publication, issue or issue date, and relating such a piece to advertising or 
nonadvertising within the content of the host publication would provide further 
proof that the piece is properly prepared as a page of the publication. 
To ensure that second-class mail is transported and delivered intact, proposed 
C200.3.3 specifies what may be included loose within a second-class publication 
without requiring wrapping. For consistency, proposed C200.3.4 has been added 
to provide guidance on when wrappers are required. 
Proposed C200.3.5 includes all the standards governing protective covers in 
current C200.4.1. In recognition of the practicalities of publication production, the 
requirement that a protective cover cover completely a publication is changed to 
allow the cover to be smaller than the publication if it extends to within 3/4 inch of 
the edge of the publication opposite the fold or binding. No similar allowance has 
been proposed for the top and bottom edges of a protective cover because the 
Postal Service has had no indication from publishers that there is any problem with 
covers matching a publication's top and bottom edges. 
The proposed advertising standard in C200.4.3 blends the contents of current 
C200.6.1 and 6.4 and explains that all advertisements must be prepared as an 
integral part of the publication and that, except for advertisements prepared as 
supplements and advertisements on printed matter included as part of a receipt or 
order for subscriptions (or requests), all advertisements in a bound publication must 
be permanently attached. The provision in current C200.6.3 concerning the types 
of material that can comprise printed sheets has been moved to E211.3.0, the 
eligibility section that includes the printed sheet standard. 
Additionally, several new proposed sections have been added to provide clarifying 
definitions, such as C200.1.6 (covers), 1.7 (mailing wrappers), and 3.1 
(bound/unbound). Other sections have been proposed to clarify further what is 
allowable and what is excluded at second-class rates, e.g., the proscription against 
combining fourth-class mail with second-class mail. 
The proposed rule also contains an expanded definition of public service 
announcements in E211.11.2, to clarify those announcements that do not have to 
be treated as advertising matter. An expanded standard explaining procedures to 
be followed when measuring advertising in second-class publications is proposed in 
new P070.1.7. This provision, which is based on Postal Service rulings, is 
designed to ensure uniform treatment of blank space in publications. Section 
E211.7.3 has been revised to clarify that materials such as annual reports, 
directories, and lists may be included as supplements to second-class publications. 
Minor nonsubstantive changes have also been proposed to DMM modules A, E, 
and P. 
Although exempt from the notice and comment provisions of the Administrative 
Procedures Act (5 U.S.C. 553(b) and (c)) regarding proposed rulemaking by 39 
U.S.C. 410(a), the Postal Service invites public comments on the following 
proposed amendments of the Domestic Mail Manual, which is incorporated by 
reference in the Code of Federal Regulations. See 39 CFR part 111.1.

7.2 Address Labels 


[Insert text of existing A200.1.2.] 


7.3 Address Placement 


The delivery address must be clearly visible on or through the outside of the mailpiece, whether placed on a label or
directly on the host publication, a component, or the mailing wrapper. If placed on the mailing wrapper, the address

must be on a flat side, not on a fold (see Exhibit 7.3). If a polybag is used, the 
address must not appear on a component that rotates within the bag, and the 
address must remain visible throughout the addressed component's range of 
motion. 


7.4 Return Address 


The return address must appear on any mailing wrapper that is also endorsed 
``Return Postage Guaranteed.'' 
3. Revise all Domestic Mail Manual C200, Second-Class Mail, to read as

1.0 PERMISSIBLE MAILPIECE COMPONENTS 


1.1 Pages 


Pages are the printed sheets forming the publication or one of the mailpiece's 
components, bearing advertising, nonadvertising, or both, including those having 
textual and graphic matter (see E211.2.4); blank spaces for writing or marking; 
and material to be completed or used by the reader. A minor portion of the pages 
in a second-class mailpiece may have unusual characteristics, such as a different 
size, shape, or construction, or portions that may be wholly or partially separable; 
and pages prepared for folding out. No page may have dimensions (when folded, if 
folded) that exceed the dimensions of the cover of the publication. Pages are also 
subject to these standards: 
a. A detachable coupon, application, or order form must relate directly to 
advertising or nonadvertising matter printed on the page of which it is a part or to 
which it is attached. 
b. Multilayer pages, including those formed by sheets glued together and 
those that have unusual shapes, such as cutouts, movable flaps, or ``pop-ups,'' 
may include small amounts of fastening material such as grommets, string, or 
rubber bands as needed to assemble the page. Multilayer pages may also be 
formed as pouches or pockets but may contain only permissible loose enclosures 
(see 1.4) or other securely affixed permissible components. 
c. Multiple pages may be held together by staples or other means separate 
from and in addition to the regular binding of the publication. 
d. Oversized pages may be used for illustrations, charts, maps, and other 
advertising and nonadvertising content. 


1.2 Parts and Sections 


Parts and sections are pages (subject to 1.1) that are physically separate 
subdivisions of the publication, as identified by the publisher. Each part or section 
must show the name of the publication, and the number of parts or sections in the 
issue must be stated on the cover of the first part or section. Parts or sections 
produced by someone other than the publisher may not be mailed at second-class 
rates if these parts or sections are prepared by or for advertisers or if they are 
provided to the publisher free or at a nominal charge. On request, publishers must 
submit to the RCSC serving the known office of publication contracts entered into 
with producers of parts or sections. 


1.3 Enclosures at First- or Third-Class Rates 


Matter to be paid at the applicable First- or third-class rate may be enclosed in a 
second-class mailpiece subject to these conditions: 
a. The total weight of all enclosed third-class matter must be less than 16 
ounces. 
b. Postage and fee payment is subject to P070. A permit imprint that may 
appear on a First- or third-class enclosure must not be visible when the mailpiece is 
prepared for mailing except as provided under P070. 
c. When enclosing nonincidental First- or any third-class mail, combination 
envelopes or containers with separate parts for the two classes of mail may be 
used. If both the sender's and addressee's names and addresses are not on both 
pieces, the sender's name and address must be placed on one and the addressee's 
name and address on the other. Combination containers with inseparable parts 
may bear the names and addresses on only one part.

<PARENT> FR940720-1-00009 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

d. The applicable ``First-Class Mail Enclosed'' or ``Third-Class Mail Enclosed'' 
marking must be placed on or in the host publication if it contains a nonincidental 
First- or third-class enclosure. If placed on the outer wrapper, polybag, envelope, 
or cover of the host publication, the marking must be set in type no smaller than 
any used in the required ``POSTMASTER: Send change of address . . .'' statement. If 
placed in the identification statement, the marking must meet the applicable 
standards. The marking must not be on or in copies not accompanied by a First- or 
third-class enclosure unless additional information is provided under the applicable 
postage payment standards in P070. 


1.4 Enclosures at Second-Class Rates 


Only the following material may be included loose as an enclosure in a second-class mailpiece and be paid at second-class
rates, subject to the corresponding 
conditions: 
a. An incidental First-Class piece that must be closely related but secondary 
to the second-class publication with which it is enclosed, and that consists of 
matter that, if mailed separately, would require First-Class postage. Examples of 
an incidental First-Class enclosure are a bill for the publication, a statement of 
account for past publication purchases, or a personal message or greeting included 
with the publication. 
b. A receipt, request, or order for a subscription that may be printed or 
written; prepared as a card or envelope, including business reply, or as a 
combination form for the host and one or more second-class publications issued by 
the same publisher; arranged to include a coin receptacle; and inserted in an 
envelope within the publication. The receipt or request may be part of or 
accompanied by a single sheet of printed matter containing information related exclusively to a receipt or request
or order for a subscription to the host second-class 
publication (or a combination of the host and other second-class publications of the 
same publisher), if that printed matter does not advertise, promote, or offer for sale 
other products or services. 
c. A card or form for the recipient's use in providing address correction 
information to the publisher that may be printed or written; prepared as a card or 
envelope, including business reply, or as a combination form for two or more 
second-class publications issued by the same publisher; inserted in an envelope 
that is attached to, bound in, or loose within the publication; or prepared as a 
detachable part of another permissible enclosure. Enclosures listed in 1.4b and 
1.4c are not counted when determining the percentage of advertising in the 
publication, but they are included in the total weight of the publication reported on 
the mailing statement. If the publication otherwise consists entirely of 
nonadvertising matter, an incidental First-Class enclosure as described in 1.4a may 
be treated as nonadvertising matter. In all other cases, an incidental First-Class 
enclosure is considered part of the advertising portion of the publication. 


1.5 Supplements 


A supplement is one or more pages (subject to 1.1) formed by one or more printed 
sheets that are not bound into a publication. A bound publication with one or 
more supplements must be enclosed in a wrapper (see 3.3 and 3.4). If a 
supplement to a bound publication is formed of more than one sheet, all sheets 
comprising the supplement must be bound together. Except where the mailpiece is 
enclosed in a wrapper (see 3.4), a supplement to an unbound publication must be 
combined with, and inserted within, the publication. A loose supplement may be 
included with an unbound publication only if the mailpiece is enclosed in a wrapper 
(see 3.4). A supplement may be devoted to a single topic, and may contain 
material different from that in the host publication. The external dimensions of a 
supplement (i.e., its length and height) may not exceed those of the host 
publication. Each supplement to a bound publication and loose supplements 
included with unbound publications must bear the printed endorsement 
``Supplement to'' followed by the name of the publication or publisher. 


1.6 Covers 


A cover may be placed on the outside of a second-class publication. A protective 
cover is an additional cover placed around the outside of a publication; preparation 
is subject to 3.5. Advertising, nonadvertising, or both may be printed on the 
cover or protective cover. The cover and protective cover on a publication are 
included when measuring advertising percentage. Nothing may be attached to the 
cover or protective cover except as permitted under 1.8.

1.7 Mailing Wrappers



A mailing wrapper is an envelope, sleeve, or polywrap used to enclose the mailpiece. Advertising may be printed on
the mailing wrapper and is included when measuring advertising percentage. Nothing may be attached to the mailing
wrapper except as permitted under 1.8.



1.8 Attachments



The following may be attached to a page, cover, protective cover, or mailing wrapper of a publication, subject to the
corresponding standards:

a. Stickers of any size and shape. If attached to the cover, protective cover, or mailing wrapper, no portion of the
publication's name may be obscured.

b. Material that is allowed as a loose enclosure described in 1.3 or 1.4. When nonincidental First- and/or third-class
enclosures (see 1.3) are attached, the marking ``First-Class'' or ``Letter Enclosed'' must be on a First-Class attachment;
``Third-Class,'' on a third-class attachment.



1.9 Printed Additions



Only the following may be printed on a copy of a second-class publication after it is printed, or placed on its cover,
protective cover, or mailing wrapper:

a. The name and address of the intended recipient or of the publisher or sender.

b. The printed title of the publication and its place of publication.

c. The date the subscription ends.

d. Requests for address-correction information from the addressee.

e. The words ``Sample Copy'' (on a sample), ``Marked Copy'' (when the copy contains a marked item or article), or ``Return
Postage Guaranteed'' (when the copy is to be returned to the sender if undeliverable as addressed).

f. The number of copies enclosed (on the outside of a package) or a package count (e.g., ``2 of 4'') (on a package wrapper).

g. Corrections of typographical errors or a mark, except by written or printed words, to call attention to a word or
passage.

h. Printed messages not required to be mailed as First-Class or Express Mail.



1.10 Label Carriers



A label carrier is a single unfolded, uncreased sheet of card or paper stock, securely affixed to the cover of the publication
or large enough so that it does not rotate inside the wrapper or cover the publication title (if placed over the front
cover), that is used to carry the delivery address for the mailpiece, subject to these conditions:

a. It must bear the title of the second-class publication; the second-class imprint or ``Second-Class'' endorsement
in the upper right corner of the address side (unless ``Second-Class'' is printed on the address side of the polybag);
and the address to which the mailpiece can be returned if undeliverable (if endorsed ``Return Postage Guaranteed'').

b. If the address remains clearly visible, the label carrier may also bear a request for address correction from the
addressee; information for requesting or subscribing to the publication; or a subscription or request form.

c. As applicable, the label carrier may show the endorsement ``First-Class Mail Enclosed'' or ``Third-Class Mail
Enclosed'' or the permit imprint used to pay postage for the First- or third-class enclosure if the imprint is below
the second-class imprint or the endorsement ``Second-Class.''

d. Other printed information, whether advertising or nonadvertising, is permitted only on the back of the label carrier
and is subject to measurement and postage payment accordingly. A single line of text calling attention to information
on the reverse may be placed on the front of the label carrier. If any information on the reverse of the label carrier
is advertising, the line of text on the front is also treated as advertising.



2.0 IMPERMISSIBLE COMPONENTS



2.1 General Standard



Regardless of preparation or characteristics, or whether otherwise meeting the standards in 1.0, the materials
described in 2.2 through 2.5 are not eligible for second-class rates and may not form, or be included, in a second-class
mailpiece.



2.2 Prohibited Matter

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940720-1-00035 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940720-1-00009 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Material that either contains any one of the following printed items, or that is referred to in a component of the second-class
mailpiece (by the use of one of these items), is ineligible to be mailed at second-class rates:

a. A separate price or subscription instructions different from the host publication.

b. The word ``Catalog.''

c. A First-, third-, or fourth-class permit imprint.

d. An ISBN (International Standard Book Number).

e. An ISSN (International Standard Serial Number) different from the ISSN of the host publication.



2.3 Products



Products may not be mailed at second-class rates. Examples include stationery (pads of paper or blank printed forms);
cassettes; floppy disks; merchandise; envelopes containing enclosures, other than receipts, orders for subscriptions,
and incidental First-Class matter; and wall, desk, and blank calendars. Printed pages, including oversized pages
and calendars, are not considered products if they are not separately distributed or offered for sale, bear the name
of the host publication and the issue or issue date, and relate to other advertising or nonadvertising content of the
host publication.



2.4 Fourth-Class Mail



Fourth-class mail may not be combined with a second-class publication.



2.5 Nonprinted Sheets



Any matter not formed of printed sheets (except as permitted under 1.1b) is not eligible for second-class rates.



3.0 MAILPIECE CONSTRUCTION



3.1 Bound/Unbound



Publications may be prepared in either a bound or unbound form, with or without wrappers unless required by 3.6. A bound
publication is a publication whose pages are securely held together by two or more staples, spiral binding, glue,
stitching, or other permanent fastening. All other publications are unbound, including folded multisheet and single-sheet
publications and those whose pages are loose and collated or ``nested,'' or whose pages are held together by a single
staple.



3.2 Physical Size



Standards for size or weight may apply to publications claimed at certain rates. Requester publications must contain
at least 24 pages per issue.



3.3 Without Wrapper



When the mailpiece does not have a mailing wrapper, all the components of an unbound publication must be combined with
and inserted inside the publication. Only enclosures mailable at second-class rates under 1.4 may be included loose
inside a bound unwrapped publication. An enclosure under 1.3 or 1.4 may be securely attached on the outside of an unwrapped
publication along the bound edge if it does not exceed any dimension of the cover of the publication.



3.4 With Wrapper



Except as provided in 4.1, when the mailpiece is completely enclosed in a mailing wrapper, there are no restrictions
on where the components may be located within that wrapper. When a sleeve or other partial wrapper is used, the components
must be secured so that they do not fall out during handling. Bound publications carrying loose supplements or prepared
in physically separate parts or sections either must be totally enclosed in an envelope, plastic wrapper (polybag)
or paper wrapper, or they must be inserted within a sleeve so that the component parts do not become separated while
in the mail.



3.5 Protective Cover



If the mailpiece is not completely enclosed in a mailing wrapper, any protective cover must cover both the front and
back of the host publication and extend to within at least 3/4 inch of the edge opposite the fold or binding. If the host
publication is bound, the protective cover must be permanently attached to the publication.

3.6 APO/FPO Copies 


Any single copy of an unbound publication that includes any enclosures, 
supplements, or more than one part or section and that is mailed to an APO/FPO 
address must be completely enclosed in a mailing wrapper. 


3.7 Sealing 


Second-class mail must be prepared so that it can be easily examined. Mailing 
publications at second-class postage rates represents consent by the sender to 
USPS inspection of the contents whether loose or inserted in envelopes, wrappers, 
or other covers. Mailers who want to ensure that publications are not opened for 
postal inspection must pay First-Class rates and mark such mail accordingly. 


4.0 PRINTED FEATURES 


4.1 Publication Name; Notices 


The publication name must be displayed prominently on the publication, and the 
name must be visible through or displayed prominently on any protective cover or 
mailing wrapper. The publication name, followed immediately by the USPS 
publication number, and the mailing address to which undeliverable copies or 
change-of-address notices are to be sent, may be shown in the upper left corner of 
the address side of a mailing wrapper, or directly on the outside of the host 
publication if it can be read when the mailing wrapper is in place. The publication 
number includes an alpha prefix and is to be within parentheses, e.g., THE 
NATIONAL WEEKLY (ISSN 9876-543X) or THE COMMUNITY (USPS 123-456). 


4.2 Endorsements 


Mailing wrappers that completely enclose the host publication must bear the words 
``Second-Class'' in the upper right corner of the address area. If a clear plastic 
wrapper is used, those words may appear anywhere on the address side of the 
wrapper or the topmost item inside. 


4.3 Advertising 


Advertising (as defined in E211) may be printed on the pages of any component of 
a publication, subject to the corresponding standards. Regardless of location, an 
advertisement must be prepared as an integral part of the publication. Except for 
advertisements in supplements, and on printed matter included as part of a receipt 
or order for subscriptions (or requests), all advertisements in a bound publication 
must be permanently attached. Except as provided in C200.1.4d, all advertising 
must be included in the advertising portion of the issue measured under P200. 
Different advertising may occupy the same space in different editions of the same 
issue. 


4.4 Marking of Paid Reading Matter (18 USC 1734) 


If a valuable consideration is paid, accepted, or promised for the publication or any 
editorial or other reading matter in a second-class publication, that matter must be 
plainly marked ``advertisement'' by the publisher. When a single item of paid 
editorial or other reading matter occupies more than one page, it need only be 
marked ``advertisement'' on the first page. The word ``advertisement'' may be 
included in a statement that explains why the material is marked ``advertisement.'' 
Such a statement must be prominent on the first page of the material and the word 
``advertisement'' in the statement must be in bold or italicized print, or otherwise 
emphasized so that it can be plainly seen. Editors or publishers who print such 
matter without plainly marking it ``advertisement'' are subject to a fine of not more 
than $500.

Public service announcements are announcements for which no valuable 
consideration is received by the publisher, which do not include any matter related 
to the business interests of the publisher, and which promote programs, activities 
or services of federal, state, or local governments or of nonprofit organizations, or 
matters generally regarded as in the public interest. Public service announcements 
are not treated as advertising.

The enclosure is eligible for the rate for its class of mail that is most comparable to 
the presort, automation, and destination discounts that apply to the second-class 
host piece. For example, a third-class enclosure is eligible for the SCF entry 
discount if the publication is deposited at the destinating SCF. When more than 
one enclosure of the same class of mail is enclosed with a publication, they are 
treated as a single enclosure for computing postage.

1.0 BASIC INFORMATION 


* * * * * 


1.7 Measuring Advertising 


The total advertising and nonadvertising portions may be determined by column 
inches, square inches, pages, or by another recognized unit of measure, if the 
same unit of measure is used for both. One full page of advertising must equal 
one full page of nonadvertising regardless of the amount of blank space between 
each advertisement or nonadvertising article on a page. If measured in column 
inches, nonadvertising inches are determined by subtracting the total measured 
advertising inches from the total column inches of the publication. A blank page, 
portion of a page, or blank border or margin is counted as advertising if consideration was received for the whole page,
the blank portion, or the blank border or 
margin. The border of a page is otherwise considered neither advertising nor 
nonadvertising and is not measured, but it is included in the total weight of the 
publication for purposes of postage calculation. When measuring nonrectangular 
sheets, the measurement is based on the smallest rectangle that could contain the 
irregular sheet; exact measurement is not attempted. When two or more sheets or 
parts thereof are glued together, the surface area of each sheet (front and back) is 
included when measuring the advertising or nonadvertising portion. 


* * * * * 


An appropriate amendment to 39 CFR 111.3 to reflect these changes will be 
published if the proposal is adopted.

Redesignation of the Yavapai-Apache Reservation to a PSD Class I Area; State of Arizona 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).

 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule; extension of public comment period. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The purpose of this action is to extend the period for public comment on the request by the Yavapai-Apache Tribal Council
to redesignate the Yavapai-Apache Reservation (``the Reservation'') in the State of Arizona to Class I under EPA's
regulations for prevention of significant deterioration of air quality. The Class I designation will result in lowering
the allowable increases in ambient concentrations of particulate matter, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen dioxide
on the Reservation.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Part C of the Clean Air Act (``the Act'') provides for the prevention of significant deterioration (PSD) of air quality.
The intent of this part is to prevent deterioration of existing air quality, particularly in areas considered to be
pristine. The Act provides for three basic classifications applicable to all lands of the United States. Associated
with each classification are increments which represent the maximum allowable increase in ambient air pollutant
concentrations above a baseline concentration. A Class I designation is the most protective of the three classifications,
with the lowest amount of allowable increases in pollutant concentrations. Class II applies to areas in which pollutant
increases accompanying moderate growth would be allowed. Class III applies to those areas in which considerably
more air quality deterioration would be considered acceptable. 


Section 164 of the Act and the federal regulations set forth at 40 CFR 52.21(g) contain the procedural requirements
for redesignation of areas under the PSD program. The Act provides that lands within the exterior boundaries of reservations
of federally recognized Indian tribes may be redesignated only upon request by the appropriate Indian Governing
Body. Under section 164(b)(2) and 40 CFR 52.21(g)(5), EPA may disapprove a request for redesignation only if it finds,
after notice and opportunity for hearing, that the redesignation request does not meet the procedural requirements
of section 164 and 40 CFR 52.21(g). 
On December 17, 1993, the Yavapai-Apache Tribal Council (herein referred to as ``the Tribal Council'') submitted
to EPA a request to redesignate the Yavapai-Apache Reservation from Class II to Class I. EPA reviewed this request
and determined that it met the procedural requirements of Section 164 of the Act and 40 CFR 52.21(g). On April 18, 1994,
EPA published a notice of proposed rulemaking in the 

Federal Register

 which proposed to approve the request and solicited public comment regarding whether the Tribal Council had met the
procedural requirements. 59 FR 18346. Please refer to this 

Federal Register

 notice for further information regarding this proposed rulemaking. 
EPA held a public hearing on the request for redesignation on June 22, 1994. Following the public hearing, a request
to extend the public comment period was made. By this notice, the public comment period is extended to August 22, 1994.
The public is invited to comment on whether the Tribal Council has met all the procedural requirements of section 164
of the Act and 40 CFR 52.21(g). Comments should be submitted to the address listed in the 

ADDRESSES

 section of this document. Public comments received by August 22, 1994 will be considered in the final rulemaking action
taken by EPA. 


Administrative Review 


The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the requirements of section 6 of Executive Order 12866.

Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. Section 600 et. seq., EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis
assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities. 5 U.S.C. sections 603 and 604. Alternatively,
EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities
include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises and government entities with jurisdiction over populations
of less than 50,000. The proposed action affects only major stationary sources, as defined by 40 CFR 52.21, will not
result in any additional requirements for small entities. Therefore, I certify that this action does not have a significant
impact on a substantial number of small entities.

Tetrachlorvinphos, Terbutryn, and Etridiazole; Removals




<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document proposes to remove tolerances for residues of tetrachlorvinphos (2-chloro-1-(2,4,5-trichlorophenyl)
vinyl dimethyl phosphate), terbutryn (2-tert-butylamino-4-ethylamino-6-methylthio-

s

-triazine), and etridiazole (5-ethoxy-3-(trichloromethyl)-1,2,4-thiadiazole) in or on certain raw agricultural
commodities (RAC's). EPA is initiating this action because there are no current registrations associated with these
food uses. The applicable registrations for these pesticide uses have been cancelled for nonpayment of maintenance
fees and/or by company request.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 This document proposes the revocation of certain tolerances established under section 408 of the Federal, Food,
Drug and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) (21 U.S.C. 346a) for residues of the insecticide tetrachlorvinphos, the herbicide
terbutryn, and the fungicide etridiazole in or on certain RAC's. Since a tolerance is generally not necessary for
a pesticide chemical which is not registered for a particular food use, EPA is initiating this action because all registered
food uses associated with these tolerances have been cancelled.


I. Discussion of Chemicals


A. Tetrachlorvinphos


EPA proposes to revoke the tolerances established for residues of the insecticide 2-chloro-1-(2,4,5-trichlorophenyl)
vinyl dimethyl phosphate (tetrachlorvinphos) as listed in 40 CFR 180.252 in or on th following RAC's: (1) 110 parts
per million in or on and corn fodder and forage (including field corn, sweet corn, and popcorn); (2) 10 parts per million
in or on apples, cherries, corn grain, fresh corn including sweet corn (kernels plus cob with husk removed), cranberries,
and pears; (3) 5 parts per million in or on tomatoes; (4) 0.1 part per million in or on peaches.
Registered uses of the parent compound on these commodities were cancelled August 20, 1987.
Action levels to replace revoked tolerances are not necessary based on: (1) the small number of detectable residues
that were found during a period of time the tetrachlorvinphos was registered for use; (2) the low levels in the samples
that were indicated in the findings; (3) the long period of time that had elapsed since tetrachlorvinphos was last
registered for use in the U.S. (over 6 years); and (4) the fact that FDA did not detect any tetrachlorvinphos residues
in its monitoring programs in recent years.


B. Terbutryn


EPA proposes to revoke the tolerances established for negligible residues (N) of the herbicide terbutryn (2-tert-butylamino-4-ethylamino-6-methylthio-

s

-triazine) as listed in 40 CFR 180.265 in or on the following RAC's:




Action levels to replace revoked tolerances are not required because: (1) Uses of terbutryn on these crops were all
cancelled on or prior to October 10, 1989; (2) the tolerances for terbutryn on these commodities all reflect non-detectable
residues in or on the treated commodities indicating that residues are minuscule even in the treated crop; and (3)
FDA did not detect any terbutryn residues in its monitoring programs in recent years. Therefore, detectable residues
are not likely to be found in subsequent crops as a result of past uses of terbutryn.


C. Etridiazole


EPA proposes to amend 40 CFR 180.370 to revoke the tolerance established for residues of the fungicide 5-ethoxy-3-(trichloromethyl)-1,2,4-thiadiazole
(etridiazole) and its monoacid metabolite 3-carboxy-5-ethoxy-1,2,4-thiadiazole as listed in 40 CFR 180.370 in
or on the following RAC:




An action level to replace the revoked tolerance is not required because: (1) Use of etridiazole on the crop was cancelled
in the mid-1980's; (2) the tolerance for etridiazole on the commodity reflects very low residues in or on the treated
commodity, indicating that residues are low even in the treated crop; and (3) residues have degraded and dissipated
from prior use. Therefore, detectable residues are not likely to be found in subsequent crops as a result of past uses
of etridiazole.


II. Solicitation of Comments


Any person who has registered or submitted an application for registration of a pesticide chemical under the Federal
Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act, as amended, that contains tetrachlorvinphos, terbutryn, and etridiazole
may request, within 60 days after the publication of the document in the 

Federal Register

, that this rulemaking proposal be referred to an Advisory Committee in accordance with section 408(e) of the FFDCA.
Interested persons are invited to submit written comments on the proposed regulation. Further, EPA is soliciting
comments from anyone adversely affected by revocation of these tolerances. EPA requests that anyone adversely affected
by these revocations submit information pertaining to why and provide specific information: (1) Are there any existing
stocks of the chemicals?; (2) What amount of existing stocks remains?; (3) When will the stocks be depleted?; (4) How
long would the commodities treated with these chemicals be in the channels of trade?; (5) Are any of these three pesticide
chemicals used in foreign countries?; (6) Would residues of any of these three pesticide chemicals be present in or
on commodities grown in foreign countries and imported into the United States?
Comments must bear a notation indicating the document control number [OPP-300346]. All written comments filed in
the Public Response to this document will be available for public inspection in the Public Response Section, at the
Virginia address given above, from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m., Monday through Friday, except legal holidays.
The Agency has conducted an anaylsis in order to satisfy requirements as specified by Executive Order 12866 and the
Regulatory Flexibility Act. This analysis is available for public inspection in Rm. 1128 at the Virginia address
given above.


III. Other Regulatory Requirements


A. Executive Order 12866


Executive Order 12866 requires the Agency initially to determine whether a proposed regulatory action being proposed
or issued is a ``significant'' rule and therefore subject to the requirements of the Executive Order (i.e., Regulatory
Impact Analysis, review by the Office of Management and Budget [OMB]). Under section 3(f), the order defines ``significant''
as those actions likely to lead to a rule: (1) Having an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely
and materially affecting a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health
or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments or communities (also known as ``economically significant'');
(2) creating serious inconsistency or otherwise interfering with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3)
materially altering the budgetary impacts of entitlement, grants, user fees, or loan programs; or (4) raising novel
legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in this
Executive Order.
Pursuant to the terms of this Executive Order, EPA has determined that this rule is not ``significant'' and is therefore
not subject to OMB review.


B. Regulatory Flexibility Act


This proposed rule has been reviewed under the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-354; 94 Stat. 1164, 5
U.S.C. 601 et seq.), and it has been determined that it will not have an economic impact on small businesses, small organizations,
or small governmental jurisdictions.

This regulatory action is intended to prevent the sale of food commodities containing pesticide residues where the
subject pesticide has been used in an unregistered or illegal manner.

Since all domestic registrations associated with these food uses of tetrachlorvinphos, terbutryn, and etridiazole
have been cancelled, it is expected that no economic impact would occur at any level of business enterprise if these
tolerances were revoked.

Accordingly, I certify that this action does not require a separate regulatory flexibility analysis under the Regulatory
Flexibility Act.

Air Brake Systems; Denial of Petition for Rulemaking 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, Transportation.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Denial of petition for rulemaking. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This notice denies a petition for rulemaking, submitted by the California Highway Patrol, that requests the agency
to amend the air pressure warning signal requirements in Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard No. 121, 

Air Brake Systems.

 After conducting its review, the agency has determined that the petition should not be granted because the situation
described by the petition does not raise a significant safety problem. The agency further notes that establishing
an upper limit to the operating range of the low pressure warning signal would not correct the problem of the signal's
failure to warn a driver of low pressure in the trailer brake system. Since there is no reasonable possibility that
the requested amendment would be issued at the conclusion of a rulemaking proceeding, the agency is denying the petition.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard No. 121, 

Air Brake Systems,

 establishes performance requirements for braking systems on vehicles equipped with air brakes. The purpose of the
standard is to ensure safe braking performance under normal and emergency braking conditions. 


The standard requires vehicles equipped with air brakes to have certain equipment. Section S5.1.5 requires that
each vehicle equipped with an air brake system be equipped with a ``signal, other than a pressure gage, that gives a
continuous warning to a person in the normal driving position when the ignition is in the ``on'' or ``run'' position
and the air pressure in the service reservoir system is below 60 p.s.i.'' The purpose of this requirement is to inform
the driver of situations in which there may be low, potentially unsafe levels of air pressure in the service brake system.

On June 7, 1993, the California Highway Patrol (CHP), submitted a petition for rulemaking that requested the agency
to amend the low air pressure warning signal requirements in S5.1.5 of Standard No. 121. The petitioner contended
that:



this subsection permits a warning signal that is activated at any pressure above 60 psi as long as it also produces the
signal at pressures below 60 psi. This would permit a device that activates a warning in the normal operating range
of the system, approximately 85-115 psi. This could result in a false signal where the driver would not be warned
of a true low air pressure situation. Though unlikely, a warning device that was activated whenever the ignition key
was in the ``on'' or ``run'' position would comply with the existing regulation, while fulfilling neither the intent
of the regulation nor any useful purpose.



Based on its concern, CHP requested that the agency initiate rulemaking to specify an upper limit to the warning signal
operating range, so that it would give a ``true warning'' of a low air pressure condition. CHP recommended that the
upper cutoff be 75 p.s.i. 
After reviewing the petition, NHTSA has decided not to establish an upper limit to the low pressure warning signal
requirement. The agency disagrees with CHP's claims that establishing such an upper limit would improve safety.
The agency notes that under the current requirement, some valves may activate at slightly higher air pressures than
60 p.s.i. since the valves are typically designed with a tolerance of about 

# 

6 p.s.i. Nevertheless, activation at 65 p.s.i. rather than 60 p.s.i. also indicates a relatively low pressure level
about which the driver should be concerned. The agency believes that the modification requested by the petition is
not warranted, since the agency is aware of no safety problems related to this requirement which has been in effect
since 1971. The agency further notes that setting an upper limit might unreasonably restrict the potential for designing
new air brake systems, since the valve manufacturers would be faced with the unnecessary task of redesigning the valves,
even though such a modification would not provide any safety benefits. 
Based on the above considerations, NHTSA has determined that CHP's petition should not be granted. In accordance
with 49 CFR Part 552, the agency has completed its technical review of the petition and determined that there is no reasonable
possibility that the requested amendment would be issued at the conclusion of a rulemaking proceeding. Accordingly,
the agency is denying the petition. 
Notwithstanding NHTSA's decision to deny the petition, the agency is reviewing the pressure setting requirements
for the low pressure warning switch in light of possible problems with a recent amendment to Standard No. 121. On October
8, 1991, NHTSA issued a final rule that eliminated the requirements for a separate protected reservoir capable of
releasing the parking brakes. (56 FR 50666) Among other things, that amendment added a requirement for 70 p.s.i. supply
line pressure retention and established the air pressure at which automatic application of the parking brakes would
commence during loss of air pressure. 
In comments on a separate rulemaking on the parking brake requirements applicable to air-applied, mechanically
held systems (58 FR 13437, March 11, 1993), the American Trucking Associations (ATA) and Allied Signal contended
that the 70 p.s.i. requirement prevents tractor low air pressure warning systems from warning drivers of the loss
of service air pressure and thus loss of service brakes on trailers. Allied requested that the agency raise the governor
cut-in pressure to 100 p.s.i., which it believed would enable manufacturers to provide low pressure warnings. It
stated that the pressure switch is currently limited by the 85 p.s.i. minimum governor cut-in pressure requirement.
In addition, ATA has informed the agency that it is conducting tests to determine whether it should petition the agency
to raise the cut-in requirements from the present 85 p.s.i. minimum and the low pressure warning limits from 60 p.s.i.
to 75 p.s.i. or 80 p.s.i. Based on these test results, NHTSA may consider initiating rulemaking to raise the lower limit
for the low pressure warning signal.

Refuge-Specific Hunting and Fishing Regulations 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Fish and Wildlife Service, Interior. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) proposes to 
amend certain regulations that pertain to migratory game bird hunting, upland game hunting, big game hunting and
sport fishing on individual national wildlife refuges. Refuge hunting and fishing programs are reviewed annually
to determine whether the individual refuge regulations governing these programs should be modified, deleted or
have additions made to them. Changing environmental conditions, State and Federal regulations, and other factors
affecting wildlife populations and habitat may warrant modifications to ensure the continued compatibility of
hunting and fishing with the purposes for which the individual refuges were established. Modifications are designed,
to the extent practical, to make refuge hunting and fishing programs consistent with State regulations.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 50 CFR part 32 contains provisions governing hunting and fishing on national wildlife refuges. Hunting and fishing
are regulated on refuges to (1) ensure compatibility with refuge purposes, (2) properly manage the wildlife resource,
(3) protect other refuge values, and (4) ensure refuge user safety. On many refuges, the Service policy of adopting
State hunting regulations is adequate in meeting these objectives. On other refuges, it is necessary to supplement
State regulations with more restrictive Federal regulations to ensure that the Service meets its management responsibilities,
as outlined under the section entitled ``Conformance with Statutory and Regulatory Authorities.'' Refuge-specific
hunting and fishing regulations may be issued only after a wildlife refuge is opened to migratory game bird hunting,
upland game hunting, big game hunting or sport fishing through publication in the 

Federal Register

. These regulations may list the wildlife species that may be hunted or are subject to sport fishing, seasons, bag limits,
methods of hunting or fishing, descriptions of open areas, and other provisions as appropriate. Previously issued
refuge-specific regulations for hunting and 
fishing are contained in 50 CFR part 32. Many of the proposed amendments to these sections are being promulgated to
standardize and clarify the existing language of these regulations. 


Request for Comments 


Department of the Interior policy is, whenever practicable, to afford the public a meaningful opportunity to participate
in the rulemaking process. A 60-day comment period is specified in order to facilitate public input. Accordingly,
interested 
persons may submit written comments concerning this proposed rule to the person listed above under the heading 

ADDRESSES.

 All substantive comments will be reviewed and considered. 


Statutory Authority 


The National Wildlife Refuge System Administration Act (NWRSAA) of 1966, as amended (16 U.S.C. 668dd), and the Refuge
Recreation Act of 1962 (16 U.S.C. 460k) govern the administration and public use of national wildlife refuges. Specifically,
Section 4(d)(1)(A) of the NWRSAA authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to permit the use of any area within the Refuge
System 
for any purpose, including but not limited to, hunting, fishing 
and public recreation, accommodations and access, when he determines that such uses are compatible with the major
purpose(s) for which the area was established.

The Refuge Recreation Act authorizes the Secretary to administer areas within the Refuge System for public recreation
as an appropriate incidental or secondary use only to the extent 
that it is practicable and not inconsistent with the primary purpose(s) for which the areas were established. The
Refuge Recreation Act also authorizes the Secretary to issue regulations to carry out the purposes of the Act. Hunting
and sport fishing plans are developed for each refuge prior to opening it to hunting or fishing. In many cases, refuge-specific
hunting and fishing regulations are included in the hunting and sport fishing plans to ensure the compatibility of
the hunting and sport fishing programs with the purposes for which the refuge was established. Initial compliance
with the NWRSAA and Refuge Recreation Act is ensured when hunting and sport fishing plans are developed, and the determinations
required by these acts are made prior to the addition of refuges to the lists of areas open to hunting and fishing in 50
CFR part 32. Continued compliance is ensured by annual review of hunting and sport fishing programs and regulations.



Paperwork Reduction Act 


The information collection requirements for part 32 are found in 50 CFR part 25 and have been approved by the Office
of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq.

 and assigned 
clearance number 1018-0014. The information is being collected to assist the Service in administering these
programs in accordance with statutory authorities which require that 
recreational uses be compatible with the primary purposes for which the areas were established. The information
requested in the application form is required to obtain a benefit. 
The public reporting burden for the application form is estimated to average six (6) minutes per response, including
time for reviewing instructions, gathering and maintaining data, and completing the form. Direct comments on the
burden estimate or any other aspect of this form to the Service Information Collection Clearance Officer, U.S. Fish
and Wildlife Service, 
1849 C Street NW., MS 224 ARLSQ, Washington, DC 20240; and the Office of Management and Budget, Paperwork Reduction
Project (1018-0014), Washington, DC 20503. 


Economic Effect 


This rulemaking was not subject to the Office of Management and Budget review under Executive Order 12866. In addition,
a review under the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.) has been done to determine whether the rulemaking
would have a significant effect on a substantial number of small entities, which include businesses, organizations
or governmental jurisdictions. This proposed rule would have minimal effect on such entities.

Federalism 


This proposed rule will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national
government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government.
Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this rule does not have sufficient Federalism
implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 


Environmental Considerations 


Compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) (42 U.S.C. 4332(C)) and the Endangered Species
Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1531-1543) is ensured when hunting and sport fishing plans are developed, and the determinations
required by these acts are made prior to the addition of refuges to the lists of areas open to hunting and fishing in 50
CFR part 32. The amendment of refuge-specific hunting and fishing regulations are subject to a categorical exclusion
from the NEPA process if they do not significantly alter the existing use of a particular national wildlife refuge.
The B.(5) Service exclusion is employed here as these amendments are considered ``[m]inor changes in the amounts
or types of public use on FWS or State-managed lands, in accordance with regulations, management plans, and procedures.''
These proposed refuge-specific hunting and fishing revisions to existing regulations simply qualify or otherwise
define an existing hunting or fishing activity for purposes of resource management. The changes proposed in this
rulemaking would not substantially alter the existing uses of the refuges involved. Information regarding hunting
and fishing permits and the conditions that apply to individual refuge hunts, sport fishing activities and maps of
the respective areas are retained at refuge headquarters and can be obtained from the regional offices of the U.S.
