<DOCTITLE>Forest Plan Amendment, Ouachita National Forest, Scott and Polk Counties, Arkansas; Renewal of the Shortleaf Pine/Bluestem
Grass Ecosystem and Recovery of the Red-cockaded Woodpecker</DOCTITLE>



<ACTION>
action: 

Notice of intent to prepare an environmental impact statement.





Pursuant to 36 CFR 219.10(f), the Forest Supervisor for the Ouachita National forest gives notice of the agency's
intent to prepare an environmental impact statement (EIS) for the decision to amend the Land and Resource Management
Plan for the Ouachita National Forest. This notice includes a summary of the proposed changes to the Forest Plan, an
explanation of the need for these changes, identifies preliminary issues, and a brief description of potential alternatives
to these changes. This notice also provides estimated dates for filing the draft and final EIS; information about
future public involvement; the name and address of the responsible official; and the name of the person who can provide
additional information.




decision to be made: 

The Forest Service will decide whether or not to amend the existing Forest Plan. Specifically, the Forest Service
will decide whether or not to amend the Forest Plan to create a new management area (Management Area 22) that will encompass
155,010 acres of National Forest. Whether or not this will be a significant amendment to the Forest Plan will be part
of the analysis and decision. The new management area will provide for the renewal of the Shortleaf Pine/Bluestem
Grass ecosystem and implement the Regional EIS for 

Management of the Red-cockaded Woodpecker and its habit on National Forest in the South.



No irreversible or irretrievable commitment of resources (site specific actions) will be made as a result of this
decision. Projects to implement the Amended Forest Plan will involve site specific environmental analysis and appropriate
documentation.



</ACTION>
<ACTION>
proposed action: 

The goal of this proposal is to renew the historic shortleaf pine/bluestem grass ecosystem on a portion of the Ouachita
National Forest. Renewal includes recovery of the Red-cockaded Woodpecker (RCW). This EIS will document the analysis
of alternatives to the proposed action and disclose the effects of designating a Shortleaf Pine/Bluestem Grass Ecosystem
Management Area and implementing the Regional EIS for 

Management of the RCW and its Habitat on National Forests in the South. 



Recovery of the RCW includes changing the current Forest Plan goal of 50 breeding groups to a minimum of 250 breeding
groups on the Forest. Designation of Management Area 22 affects the management direction for 155,010 acres of National
Forest. There will be no change in the amount of land classified as suitable for timber harvest.

Ecosystem management of the proposed area would include a broad variety of forest conditions and management practices.
Resource outputs such as timber production would be a product of managing to restore the shortleaf pine/bluestem
grass ecosystem. To feature older stands, regeneration cycles will be lengthened to a minimum of 120 years. Regeneration
areas would retain indefinitely a portion of the overstory trees.

Management Area 22 would occur in portions of the Ouachita National Forest in Scott and Polk counties, Arkansas. Included
within this management area would be the proposed Habitat Management Area (HMA) for the RCW, containing 84,312 acres
of which 66,606 acres is suitable for timber management. A new desired future condition, management area goals and
standards and guidelines would be formulated for this new Management Area.



Preliminary Issues



Through our informational meetings and meetings with other citizens, the following issues relating to the effects
of the proposal have been identified. These are preliminary 

issues. Additional scoping and public participation will be used to refine and add to this list to develop a complete
understanding of the significant issues related to this proposal.

1. People are concerned that this proposal will result in a reduction in the local supply of timber products from the
National Forest. This could have a direct and indirect effect on local communities.

2. People are concerned that hardwood trees would be eliminated in the proposed Management Area. Hardwood tree retention
and forest diversity in pine-dominated areas of the Forest has been an issue that has been addressed many times in the
past. This proposal stresses that current hardwood tree retention guidelines will not be changed.

3. There are concerns that smoke from an increased prescribed burning program could lower air quality and visibility.

4. There is a concern that this proposal will increase costs to taxpayers. Costs, both direct and indirect, would have
to be estimated. Timber receipts from projects in the proposed area will help pay expenses through the Knutson-Vandenberg
Act of 1930.

6. There is a concern that if the population of Red-cockaded Woodpeckers (RCW) on the Forest increases, the RCW's will
move to adjoining private lands. Since they are a federally listed endangered species, this could lead to limitations
on the management of that private land under Section 9 of the Endangered Species Act.

7. There is a concern that portions of the Forest might be closed to uses such as hunting, fishing, berry picking or firewood
gathering in the future.

8. There is a concern that evenaged timber management techniques will be the only harvest techniques used in this area.



Preliminary Alternatives: 

The Forest Service will evaluate a wide range of alternatives to the proposal in response to the issues identified
in the scoping process. The agency expects to consider at least the following alternatives, which respond to preliminary
issues identified to date. As new issues are identified through public participation, new alternatives may be created,
and existing alternatives modified. Some of these preliminary alternatives may not be analyzed in detail.



Alternative A (No Action) 

This alternative would not change the management area allocations, activities or desired future condition of the
existing Forest Plan. The rotation age for shortleaf pine would remain at 70 years. The current goal of 50 groups of
RCW would remain. There would be no change in fire control or prescribed fire activities. Revenues and expenditures
would remain at or near current levels, as would the supply of timber products. Hardwood tree retention rates would
not change.

<DOCNO> FR940720-2-00004 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940720-2-00002 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 



Alternative B

. This alternative would respond to the issues related to the supply of timber products from the project area by not
including the extended portion of the area. The new management area would be limited to the HMA portion of the proposal,
84,312 acres. Ecosystem management practices such as increased use of prescribed fire, increasing rotation age
to a minimum of 120 years, retention and creation of snag trees, and all the requirements specified in the Regional
EIS for 

Management of the Red-cockaded Woodpecker and its habitat on National Forests in the South

 would be featured in this area.



Alternative C

. This alternative would respond to the issue of cost to the taxpayer by doing most of the prescribed burning in the growing
season and not doing mechanical (chainsaw) midstory reduction. The acreages in this alternative would be the same
as the proposed action. Ecosystem management practices would be the same as the proposed action and would implement
the direction of the Regional EIS.



Alternative D

. This alternative would respond to the issue of dominant forest harvest technique by harvesting 75% of the area that
is suitable for timber harvest using an unevenaged management system. Areas needed for RCW nesting, replacement,
and recruitment stands would be the only areas using the evenaged management system. These same stands would be the
only ones to receive midstory treatments or prescribed burning. The rotation age of the evenaged stands would be 120
years.



Public Comments on the Draft EIS:

 After the DEIS has been published, the Forest Service will again be actively seeking information, comments, and assistance
from Federal, State and local agencies and from individuals and organizations who may be interested in or affected
by the proposed action. It is now important that those interested in this proposed action participate at that time.
The DEIS should be available for public review in August 1994. After a minimum comment period of 45 days, the Final EIS
and Forest Plan Amendment should be completed in September 1994. If in the analysis it is determined that this will
be a significant amendment to the Forest Plan, the comment period will be 90 days.

The comment period for the DEIS will commence on the day the Environmental Protection Agency publishes the ``Notice
of Availability'' in the 

Federal Register

.

The Forest Service believes, at this early stage, it is important to give reviewers notice of several court rulings
related to public participation in the environmental review process. First, reviewers of draft environmental impact
statements must structure their participation in the environmental review of the proposal so that it is meaningful
and alerts an agency to the reviewer's position and contention. 

Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corp.

 v. 

NRDC, 435 U.S. 519, 553 (1978). 

Also, environmental objections that are not raised during the draft environmental impact stage but rather after
completion of the final environmental impact statement may be waived or dismissed by the courts. 

City of Angoon

 v. 

Hodel,

 803 F.2d 1016, 1022 (9th Cir. 1986) and 

Wisconsin Heritages, Inc.

 v. 

Harris,

 490 F. Supp. 1334, 1338 (E.D. Wis. 1980). Because of these rulings, it is very important that those interested in this
proposed action participate by the close of the comment period. This will assure that substantive comments and objections
are made available to the Forest Service at a time when it can meaningfully consider them and respond to them in the final
environmental impact statement.

To assist the Forest Service in identifying and considering additional issues and concerns about the proposed action,
comments about the draft environmental statement should be as specific as possible. It is also helpful if comments
refer to specific pages or chapters of the draft statement. Comments may also address the adequacy of the draft environmental
impact statement or the merits of the alternatives formulated and discussed in the statement. Reviewers may wish
to refer to the Council on Environmental Quality Regulations for implementing the procedural provisions of the National
Environmental Act at 40 CFR 1503.3 in addressing these points.

Initiation of Antidumping Duty Investigations: Small Diameter Circular Seamless Carbon and Alloy Steel Standard,
Line and Pressure Pipe From Argentina, Brazil, Germany and Italy

Seamless line pipes are intended for the conveyance of oil and natural gas or other fluids in pipe lines. Seamless line
pipes are produced to the API 5L specification. 

Seamless pipes are commonly produced and certified to meet ASTM A-106, ASTM A-53 and API 5L specifications.
Such triple certification of pipes is common because all pipes meeting the stringent A-106 specification necessarily
meet the API 5L and ASTM A-53 specifications. Pipes meeting the API 5L specification necessarily meet the ASTM
A-53 specification. However, pipes meeting the A-53 or API 5L specifications do not necessarily meet
the A-106 specification. To avoid maintaining separate production runs and separate inventories, manufacturers
triple certify the pipes. Since distributors sell the vast majority of this product, they can thereby maintain a single
inventory to service all customers. 

The primary application of ASTM A-106 pressure pipes and triple certified pipes is in pressure piping systems
by refineries, petrochemical plants and chemical plants. Other applications are in power generation plants (electrical-fossil
fuel or nuclear), and in some oil field uses (on shore and off shore) such as for separator lines, gathering lines and
metering runs. A minor application of this product is for use as oil and gas distribution lines for commercial applications.
These applications constitute the majority of the market for the subject seamless pipes. However, A-106 pipes
may be used in some boiler applications. 

The scope of these investigations includes all multiple-stenciled seamless pipe meeting the physical parameters
described above and produced to one of the specifications listed above, whether or not also certified to a non-covered
specification. Standard, line and pressure applications are defining characteristics of the scope of these investigations.
Therefore, seamless pipes meeting the physical description above, but not produced to the A-106, A-53,
or API 5L standards shall be covered if used in an A-106, A-335, A-53 or API 5L application. 

For example, there are certain other ASTM specifications of pipe which, because of overlapping characteristics,
could potentially be used in A-106 applications. These specifications include A-162, A-192, A-210,
A-333, and A-524. When such pipes are used in a standard, line or pressure pipe application, such products
are covered by the scope of these investigations. 

Specifically excluded from these investigations are boiler tubing, mechanical tubing and oil country tubular goods
except when used in a standard, line or pressure pipe application. Also excluded from these investigations are redraw
hollows for cold-drawing when used in the production of cold-drawn pipe or tube. 

Although the HTS subheadings are provided for convenience and customs purposes, our written description of the scope
of these investigations is dispositive. 



Request for Comments From Interested Parties 



The scope contained in the petitions, which has been slightly clarified in the above ``Scope of Investigations''
section, contains the clause that products used in standard, line or pressure pipe applications be included in the
scope, regardless of whether they meet A-106, A-335, A-53 or API 5L standards. Implementing this
clause would require some type of end-use certification. Given the burden on Customs and the difficulty involved
in administering end-use certifications, the Department generally avoids end-use as a scope criterion. 

See Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Certain Alloy and Carbon Hot-Rolled Bars, Rods, and Semifinished
Products of Special Bar Quality Engineered Steel from Brazil, 

58 FR 31496 (June 3, 1993). However, because petitioner has alleged that circumvention may occur if end-use is not
part of any order resulting from these investigations, we are requesting comments regarding end-use as a criterion
for the scope of these investigations. Petitioner has based its allegation on circumstances that occurred in the
investigations of 

Preliminary Affirmative Determination of Scope Inquiry on Antidumping Duty Orders on Certain Circular Welded Non-Alloy
Steel Pipe from Brazil, the Republic of Korea, and Mexico, 

59 FR 1929 (January 13, 1994). Petitioner has identified specific possible substitution products for the scope merchandise.
Petitioner has also indicated that, while it is not aware at this time of substitution occurring, it may occur in the
future should antidumping duties be assessed on seamless standard, line and pressure pipe. Therefore, we are including
end-use in the scope for purposes of initiation; however, we intend to consider its appropriateness further and we
invite comments from interested parties regarding the scope information presented above under the ``Scope of Investigations''
section of this notice. Specifically, we will examine comments that address ``end-use'' as a scope criterion. Interested
parties are invited to comment on the following: (1) Whether or not end-use is an appropriate criterion for the merchandise
described in the ``Scope of Investigations'' section of this notice; (2) how the Department would be informed when
substitution is occurring, 

i.e.

, a trigger mechanism; (3) at what point the Department should implement suspension of liquidation and use of end-use
certificates for products meeting the physical parameters described in the scope other than those stenciled A-106,
A-335, A-53 and/or API 5L; (4) what specific characteristics or factors the Department should evaluate
regarding end-use as a scope criterion; (5) what information should be provided on an end-use certificate; (6) precise
details as to how the Department and Customs should administer any antidumping duty orders that result from these
investigations given end-use as a scope criterion; and (7) the universe of products that could possibly be substituted
for the subject merchandise. 

Finally, we invite comments from parties on whether the products within the scope of these investigations constitute
more than one class or kind of merchandise. Parties should include an analysis using the following factors: (1) The
physical characteristics of the merchandise; (2) the expectations of the ultimate purchaser; (3) the channels of
trade; (4) the ultimate use of the product; and (5) the cost. 

Parties interested in commenting on the items mentioned above should submit their comments no later than close of
business October 21, 1994. Rebuttal comments will be accepted no later than close of business October 31, 1994. 


United States Price and Foreign Market Value 



For purposes of these initiations, no adjustments were made to petitioner's calculations. If it becomes necessary
at a later date to consider these petitions as a source of best information available (BIA), we may review all of the
bases for the petitioner's estimated dumping margins in determining BIA. 



Argentina 



For Argentina, petitioner based United States price (USP) on U.S. price quotes to an end-user. Petitioner made adjustments
for transportation and insurance charges, port and handling charges, and U.S. duties paid. Petitioner adjusted
USP to account for the tax levied on seamless pipe in the home market. Petitioner also calculated the amount of the tax
adjustment that was due solely to the inclusion of price deductions in the original tax base. 

Petitioner based foreign market value (FMV) on home market prices to end-users. Petitioner made adjustments for
distributor mark-up, transportation, home market taxes, and a tax offset to account for the amount of tax that was
due solely to the inclusion of price deductions in the original tax base.

<PARENT> FR940720-2-00005 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The range of dumping margins of seamless pipe from Argentina based on a comparison of USP to FMV alleged by petitioner
is 66.57 percent to 108.13 percent. 



Brazil 



For Brazil, petitioner based USP on U.S. price quotes to a distributor. Petitioner made adjustments for freight and
insurance, port and handling charges and U.S. duties paid. Petitioner adjusted USP to account for the tax levied on
seamless pipe in the home market. Petitioner also calculated the amount of the tax adjustment that was due solely to
the inclusion of price deductions in the original tax base. Finally, petitioner adjusted USP to account for the difference
in level of trade between the home market and U.S. market. 

Petitioner based FMV on home market price quotes to an end-user. Petitioner adjusted the prices for home market taxes
not included in the prices. Petitioner made a tax offset for the amount of tax that was due solely to the inclusion of
price deductions in the original tax base. 

The range of dumping margins of seamless pipe from Brazil based on a comparison of USP to FMV alleged by petitioner is
79.83 percent to 130.08 percent. 



Germany 



For Germany, petitioner based USP on U.S. price quotes to an end-user. Petitioner made adjustments for distributor
mark-up, freight and insurance, port and handling charges and U.S. duties paid. 

Petitioner was unable to obtain home market prices. Moreover, petitioner was unable to develop a meaningful constructed
value as petitioner claims it operates a substantially different production process than the German manufacturer
of the subject merchandise. Therefore, petitioner based FMV on third country prices in Britain, which was the only
information reasonably available to it. Petitioner obtained ex-warehouse and delivered prices from three British
distributors of subject merchandise from Germany. Petitioner made adjustments for the distributor mark-up, delivery
charges, where appropriate, and transportation charges. 

The range of dumping margins of seamless pipe from Germany based on a comparison of USP to FMV alleged by petitioner
is 11.67 percent to 57.72 percent. 



Italy 



For Italy, petitioner based USP on U.S. price quotes to an end-user. Petitioner made adjustments for distributor
mark-up, transportation and insurance charges, port and handling charges, and U.S. duties paid. Petitioner adjusted
the prices for home market taxes. Petitioner made a tax offset for the amount of tax that was due solely to the inclusion
of price deductions in the original tax base. 

Petitioner based FMV on home market price quotes to an end-user. Petitioner made adjustments for discounts on cash
sales, distributor mark-up and freight charges. Petitioner adjusted the prices for home market taxes and made a tax
offset for the amount of tax that was due solely to the inclusion of price deductions in the original tax base. 

The range of dumping margins of seamless pipe from Italy based on a comparison of USP to FMV alleged by petitioner is
4.57 percent to 11.26 percent. 



Initiation of Investigations 



We have examined the petitions on seamless pipe from Argentina, Brazil, Germany and Italy, and have found that these
petitions meet the requirements of section 732(b) of the Act and 19 C.F.R. 353.12. Therefore, we are initiating antidumping
duty investigations to determine whether imports of seamless pipe from Argentina, Brazil, Germany and Italy are
being, or are likely to be, sold in the United States at less than fair value. 



Preliminary Determination by the International Trade Commission 



The International Trade Commission (ITC) will determine by August 8, 1994, whether there is a reasonable indication
that imports of seamless pipe from Argentina, Brazil, Germany and Italy are materially injuring, or threaten material
injury to, a U.S. industry. A negative ITC determination will result in the investigations being terminated; otherwise,
the investigations will proceed according to statutory and regulatory time limits. 

This notice is published pursuant to section 732(c)(2) of the Act and 19 CFR 353.13(b).

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

On March 4, 1994, the Department published in the 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 10368) a notice of ``Opportunity to Request Administrative Review'' on the countervailing duty order on certain
lead and bismuth carbon steel products from Germany (58 FR 15325; March 22, 1993) for the period September 17, 1992,
through December 31, 1993. On March 31, 1994, respondent Saarstahl AG, a producer of the subject merchandise, requested
that the Department conduct a review of the subject countervailing duty order. No other interested party requested
a review.




On April 15, 1994, the Department published a notice of initiation of a review of the order (59 FR 18100). On March 20,
1994, Saarstahl AG withdrew its request for an administrative review. Because the request for withdrawal was timely
pursuant to 19 CFR 355.22(a)(3), the Department is terminating this review.

This notice is published in accordance with 19 CFR 355.22(a)(3).

Seamless standard pipes are most commonly produced to the ASTM A-53 specification and generally are not intended
for high temperature service. They are intended for the low temperature and pressure conveyance of water, steam,
natural gas, air and other liquids and gasses in plumbing and heating systems, air conditioning units, automatic
sprinkler systems, and other related uses. Standard pipes (depending on type and code) may carry liquids at elevated
temperatures but must not exceed relevant ASME code requirements. 
Seamless line pipes are intended for the conveyance of oil and natural gas or other fluids in pipe lines. Seamless line
pipes are produced to the API 5L specification. 
Seamless pipes are commonly produced and certified to meet ASTM A-106, ASTM A-53 and API 5L specifications.
Such triple certification of pipes is common because all pipes meeting the stringent A-106 specification necessarily
meet the API 5L and ASTM A-53 specifications. Pipes meeting the API 5L specification necessarily meet the ASTM
A-53 specification. However, pipes meeting the A-53 or API 5L specifications do not necessarily meet
the A-106 specification. To avoid maintaining separate production runs and separate inventories, manufacturers

These applications constitute the majority of the market for the subject seamless pipes. However, A-106 pipes
may be used in some boiler applications. 
The scope of this investigation includes all multiple-stenciled seamless pipe meeting the physical parameters
described above and produced to one of the specifications listed above, whether or not also certified to a non-covered
specification. Standard, line and pressure applications are defining characteristics of the scope of this investigation.
Therefore, seamless pipes meeting the physical description above, but not produced to the A-106, A-53,
or API 5L standards shall be covered if used in an A-106, A-335, A-53, or API 5L application. 
For example, there are certain other ASTM specifications of pipe which, because of overlapping characteristics,
could potentially be used in A-106 applications. These specifications include A-162, A-192, A-210,
A-333, and A-524. When such pipes are used in a standard, line or pressure pipe application, such products
are covered by the scope of this investigation. 
Specifically excluded from this investigation are boiler tubing, mechanical tubing, and oil country tubular goods
except when used in a standard, line or pressure pipe application. Also excluded from this investigation are redraw
hollows for cold-drawing when used in the production of cold-drawn pipe or tube. 
Although the HTSUS subheadings are provided for convenience and customs purposes, our written description of the
scope of this investigation is dispositive.

Request for Comments From Interested Parties 


The scope contained in this investigation, which has been slightly clarified in the above ``Scope of the Investigation''
section, contains the clause that products used in standard, line or pressure pipe applications be included in the
scope, regardless of whether they meet A-106, A-335, A-53 or API 5L standards. Implementing this
clause would require some type of end-use certification. Given the burden on Customs and the difficulty involved
in administering end-use certifications, the Department generally avoids end-use as a scope criterion. 

See Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Certain Alloy and Carbon Hot-Rolled Bars, Rods, and Semifinished
Products of Special Bar Quality Engineered Steel from Brazil, 

58 FR 31496 (June 3, 1993). However, because petitioner has alleged that circumvention may occur if end-use is not
part of any order resulting from this investigation, we are requesting comments regarding end-use as a criterion
for the scope of this investigation. Petitioner has based its allegation on circumstances that occurred in the investigations
of 

Preliminary Affirmative Determination of Scope Inquiry on Antidumping Duty Orders on Certain Circular Welded Non-Alloy
Steel Pipe from Brazil, the Republic of Korea, and Mexico, 

59 FR 1929 (January 13, 1994). Petitioner has identified specific possible substitution products for the scope merchandise.
Petitioner has also indicated that, while it is not aware at this time of substitution occurring, it may occur in the
future should countervailing duties be assessed on seamless standard, line and pressure pipe. Therefore, we are
including end-use in the scope for purposes of initiation; however, we intend to consider its appropriateness further
and we invite comments from interested parties regarding the scope information presented above under the ``Scope
of the Investigation'' section of this notice. Specifically, we will examine comments that address ``end-use''
as a scope criterion. Interested parties are invited to comment on the following: (1) Whether or not end-use is an appropriate
criterion for the merchandise described in the ``Scope of the Investigation'' section of this notice; (2) how the
Department would be informed when substitution is occurring, i.e., a trigger mechanism; (3) at what point the Department
should implement suspension of liquidation and use of end-use certificates for products meeting the physical parameters
described in the scope other than those stenciled A-106, A-335, A-53 and/or API 5L; (4) what specific
characteristics or factors the Department should evaluate regarding end-use as a scope criterion; (5) what information
should be provided on an end-use certificate; (6) precise details as to how the Department and Customs should administer
any countervailing duty orders that result from this investigation given end-use as a scope criterion; and (7) the
universe of products that could possibly be substituted for the subject merchandise. 
Finally, we invite comments from parties on whether the products within the scope of this investigation constitute
more than one class or kind of merchandise. Parties should include an analysis using the following factors: (1) The
physical characteristics of the merchandise; (2) the expectations of the ultimate purchaser; (3) the channels of
trade; (4) the ultimate use of the product; and (5) the cost. 
Parties interested in commenting on the items mentioned above should submit their comments no later than close of
business October 21, 1994. Rebuttal comments will be accepted no later than close of business October 31, 1994. 


Allegation of Subsidies 


Section 702(b) of the Act requires the Department to initiate a countervailing duty proceeding whenever an interested
party files a petition, on behalf of an industry, that (1) alleges the elements necessary for an imposition of a duty
under section 701(a), and (2) is accompanied by information reasonably available to petitioner supporting the allegations.



Initiation of a Countervailing Duty Investigation 


The Department has examined the petition on seamless pipe from Italy and found that it complies with the requirements
of section 702(b) of the Act. Therefore, in accordance with section 702 of the Act, we are initiating a countervailing
duty investigation to determine whether manufacturers, producers, or exporters of seamless pipe from Italy receive
subsidies. 
We are including in our investigation the following programs alleged in the petition to have provided subsidies to
producers of the subject merchandise in Italy:

 

1. 

1988/89 Equity Infusion. 
2. Subsidized Loans under Law 675/77. 
3. Grants under Law 193/84. 
4. Retraining Grants. 
5. Preferential Export Financing under Law 227/77. 
6. Exchange Rate Guarantee Program under Law 796/76. 
7. European Coal and Steel Community (``ECSC'') Loans and Interest Rebates.

 

We are not including the following programs alleged to be benefitting producers of the subject merchandise in Italy:

<TEXT>
 

1. ``Indirect'' Equity Infusion 


Petitioner has named Dalmine S.p.A. (``Dalmine'') as the producer in Italy of the subject merchandise. Until 1989,
Dalmine owned 51 percent of a subsidiary, Tubificio Dalmine Italsider S.p.A. (``Tubificio''). The remaining 49
percent was owned by Dalmine's parent company ILVA S.p.A. (``ILVA''), which is a government-owned steel producer.
In 1989, Dalmine sold its shares in Tubificio to ILVA. Petitioner alleges that in return, Dalmine received a cash payment
from ILVA which should be treated as an ``indirect'' equity infusion. The reasons cited by petitioner are that (1)
Tubificio was essentially a worthless company because it made losses in the three years immediately prior to the sale,
and (2) the cash paid by ILVA served as an indirect pass-through of illegal subsidies received by ILVA. 
In previous cases involving the Italian steel industry, we have treated capital infusions into unequityworthy companies
by government-owned holding companies such as Finsider S.p.A. (``Finsider'') and the Istituto per la Ricostruzione
Industriale (``IRI'') as countervailable equity infusions. However, in those cases, the recipient companies were
offering their own shares in exchange for cash. (See, e.g., Final Affirmative Countervailing Duty Determination:
Grain-Oriented Electrical Steel from Italy, 

(``

Electrical Steel

''), 59 FR 18357 (April 18, 1994).) 
In the instant case, however, Dalmine sold shares in its subsidiary, Tubificio, to ILVA, Dalmine's parent and the
other owner of Tubificio. ILVA's holding in Dalmine did not increase (absolutely or relatively) as a result of this
transaction. Therefore, we do not view this as a direct or indirect equity infusion into Dalmine. Moreover, ILVA is
not a holding company like IRI or Finsider, but an operating company. While the Department found in 

Electrical Steel 

and 

Final Affirmative Countervailing Duty Determinations: Certain Steel Products from Italy, 

(``

Certain Steel from Italy''

), 58 FR 37327 (July 9, 1993), that ILVA benefitted from subsidies, those subsidies were allocated to ILVA S.p.A.'s
operations and not to its subsidiaries. Beyond its simple claim that the cash paid by ILVA served as an indirect pass-through
of illegal subsidies received by ILVA, petitioner has provided no basis for believing that ILVA was channelling government
funds to Dalmine. 
On this basis, we are not including the ``indirect'' equity infusion in the investigation. 


2. Secured and Unsecured Loans From Italian Banks 


Petitioner maintains that Dalmine was uncreditworthy from 1978 through 1992. According to petitioner, all secured
and unsecured loans obtained by Dalmine from Italian banks during these years are, therefore, countervailable.
Petitioner states that, while it cannot outline the terms of the financing provided, the loans are countervailable
because they were provided at interest rates lower than the rates that should have been charged to an uncreditworthy
company. 
Petitioner has not specified under which laws or programs the secured and unsecured loans are being provided, nor
has petitioner provided information as to how this funding is specific to the steel industry (

see

 the petition requirements in  355.12(b)(7) of the Department's regulations). On this basis, we are not including
the secured and unsecured loans in our investigation. 


3. Debt Forgiveness in Connection With the 1981 and 1988 Restructuring Plans 


Petitioner claims that in 

Certain Steel from Italy, 

the Department found that Finsider (the government-owned holding company for the steel industry until 1989) benefitted
from government assumption of debt in connection with the 1981 and 1988 restructurings of the state-owned steel industry.
Because Dalmine was a subsidiary of Finsider in those years, petitioner alleges that Dalmine benefitted from the
debt forgiveness provided to Finsider in connection with these restructurings. 
Regarding the 1981 debt forgiveness, the Department established in 

Certain Steel from Italy 

that Finsider assumed the debts of its subsidiary Italsider which we treated as a countervailable subsidy to Italsider.
In the present case, however, petitioner has not provided any evidence that Dalmine benefitted from this debt forgiveness
or that Finsider forgave Dalmine's debts.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940720-2-00015 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940720-2-00007 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

With respect to the 1988 debt forgiveness, we found in 

Certain Steel from Italy 

that a portion of Finsider's liabilities was forgiven in connection with another restructuring of the state-owned
steel industry undertaken from 1988-1990. We treated this forgiveness as a countervailable subsidy to ILVA,
which was the respondent company in that investigation. However, in 

Electrical Steel, 

we focused our investigation on subsidies provided directly to the producer of the subject merchandise, rather than
subsidies received by its parent company. Therefore, we did not treat the debt forgiveness provided to Finsider as
a countervailable benefit in 

Electrical Steel. 
In this case, petitioner has not shown that any debt forgiveness was provided directly to Dalmine or that a portion
of the debt forgiven to Finsider in 1988 can be attributed to Dalmine. On this basis, we are not including the 1981 or
1988 instances of debt forgiveness provided to Finsider in our investigation. 


4. European Investment Bank (``EIB'') Loans 


Petitioner claims that Dalmine received loans from the EIB in the early 1980s. While petitioner has not alleged that
the EIB loan program itself represents a countervailable subsidy, petitioner contends that Dalmine received EIB
loans at interest rates below the rates that should have been applied to an uncreditworthy company. 
The Department has previously found EIB loans to be not countervailable (see, e.g., Certain Steel Products from Belgium,


58 FR 37273 at 37285 (July 9, 1993)). Because petitioner has not provided any new information that would cause us to
change our earlier determination, we are not including the EIB loans in our investigation. 


5. European Regional Development Fund (``ERDF'') Subsidies 


Petitioner claims that some loans obtained by Dalmine from the EIB and ECSC may have been subsidized by the ERDF, but
has not presented any evidence in support of this allegation. 
At verification of the responses submitted by the European Community (``EC'') in 

Certain Steel from Italy, 

we found that ERDF grants are provided to regions whose development is lagging behind and to regions seriously affected
by industrial decline. In addition, we found that rural regions with certain development problems are eligible for
ERDF aid. In the instant case, however, petitioner has not demonstrated that Dalmine has production facilities in
the regions that are eligible for ERDF assistance. Moreover, there is no evidence in the petition or in previous investigations
that ERDF grants are used to subsidize ECSC or EIB loans. For these reasons, we are not including the ERDF grants in our
investigation. 


6. Early Retirement Under Law 193/84 


Petitioner alleges that Dalmine has used the early retirement provisions under Law 193/84 and that this program provided
a countervailable subsidy to Dalmine. Petitioner requests that the Department treats benefits under Law 193/84
as non-recurring grants. 
Dalmine's Annual Reports show that the company used early retirement pursuant to Law 193/84 in 1984 through 1987.
In 

Certain Steel from Italy, 

the Department found early retirement, including the program provided under Law 193/84, to be countervailable.
Because early retirement is a program we typically consider to be recurring (

see 

the 

General Issues Appendix 

to 

Final Affirmative Countervailing Duty Determination: Certain Steel Products from Austria, 

58 FR 37217 at 37226 (July 9, 1993), we countervailed the program as a recurring grant in 

Certain Steel from Italy. 
At verification in Electrical Steel, 

Italian government officials explained that there were two laws providing for early retirement in 1992: Law 223/91
and Law 406/92. We found early retirement under Law 223/91 to be not countervailable in our final determination. We
did not make a determination with respect to any other early retirement laws, including Law 193/84, because these
laws were not used by the 

Electrical Steel 

respondent in the period of investigation. Petitioner has requested that, because the Department did not make a determination
with respect to Law 193/84 in 

Electrical Steel, 

we should investigate whether Dalmine used early retirement under Law 193/84. However, information collected in


Electrical Steel 

suggests that Law 193/84 has been superseded and petitioner has not presented any evidence to the contrary. There
is no evidence in the petition that Dalmine used early retirement under Law 193/84 after 1987. Rather, petitioner
apparently believe that we should change our practice and treat early retirement as a non-recurring benefit. 
The last year for which we have been able to establish that Dalmine used early retirement is 1991. The Annual Report
for that year shows that Dalmine used the early retirement program under Law 223/91, which we found to be not countervailable
in 

Electrical Steel. 

Moreover, petitioner has not presented any information that would cause us to change our earlier determination that
early retirement, if found countervailable, should be treated as a recurring grant. For these reasons, we are not
including early retirement in our investigation.

7. Grants From the Cassa per il Mezzogiorno 


Petitioner alleges that Dalmine has received grants from the Cassa per il Mezzogiorno (``Cazmez'') which are directed
to southern Italy. In 

Certain Steel

, we found such grants to be countervailable because they were provided on a regional basis. Petitioner is not aware
of any Dalmine plants outside of Bergamo, which is in the North, but points to Dalmine's Annual Reports which show that
the company received Cazmez grants in the early and mid-1980s. Based on this finding, petitioner states that Dalmine
must have a plant located in the South. Therefore, petitioner requests that the Department, in addition to the Cazmez
grants, investigate a large number of other subsidy programs directed to the South, should we find that Dalmine maintains
production facilities there. 
From Dalmine's Annual Reports, we have found that the company formerly had two production facilities in the South,
both of which produced welded pipe. Apart from these two plants, which were spun off in 1989, we have not found any other
production facilities in the South. Because both the plants in the South produced welded pipe, which is not included
in the scope of this investigation, we are not including the Cazmez grants or any other programs directed to the South
in our investigation. 


ITC Notification 


Pursuant to section 702(d) of the Act, we have notified the ITC of this initiation. 


Preliminary Determination by the ITC 


The ITC will determine by August 8, 1994, whether there is a reasonable indication that an industry in the United States
is being materially injured, or is threatened with material injury, by reason of imports from Italy of seamless pipe.
Any ITC determination which is negative will result in the investigation being terminated; otherwise, the investigation
will proceed according to statutory and regulatory time limits. 
This notice is published pursuant to 702(c)(2) of the Act and 19 CFR 355.13(b).

<DOCTITLE>Intent To Prepare an Environmental Impact Statement for the Proposed Construction of New Military Family Housing
at the Fort MacArthur Upper Reservation, San Pedro, CA </DOCTITLE>


In an effort to meet the current deficit of military family housing (MFH) units, the U.S. Air Force (USAF) is proposing
to construct new housing units for military personnel that will be assigned to the Space and Missile Systems Center
(SMC) at Los Angeles Air Force Base (LAAFB), California. The USAF is proposing to construct approximately 150 MFH
units on a leased parcel of Angels Gate Park in the community of San Pedro within the boundaries of the City of Los Angeles.
On 10 October 1993, the USAF, the State of California, and the Unified School District of Los Angeles County (LAUSD)
signed a 50-year lease for the use of 23 acres of land on the Fort MacArthur Upper Military Reservation for the development
of up to 150 MFH units. 
A public scoping meeting is scheduled for 7:00 p.m. on Tuesday, August 2, 1994 at the Doubletree Hotel and Marina, Madeo
Ballroom, 2800 Via Cabrillo Marina, San Pedro, California. Notice of the meeting will also be published in the local
news media. 
Public input is requested to assist in defining the scope of issues to be addressed, concerning the environmental
impacts of the proposed action and reasonable alternatives. The Air Force is open to public comments on this EIS throughout
the Environmental Impact Analysis Process (EIAP). 
The USAF point of contact is Mr. Howard Antelis, Public Affairs Officer, Department of the Air Force, Space and Missile
Systems Center, SMC/PA, 2430 E. EL Segundo Blvd., Suite 4049, Los Angeles AFB, CA 90245-4687.

<DOCTITLE>Domestic Personal Property Rate Solicitation_Proposed Changes</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Military Traffic Management Command, DOD.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of proposed change.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Military Traffic Management Command is proposing changes to the Domestic Personal Property Rate Solicitation.
This solicitation is the guidelines for interstate and intrastate household services for Department of Defense
sponsored shipments.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

There have been considerable changes in the geographical operating areas where personal property shipments have
been traditionally picked up and delivered. These changes have been caused by a myriad of operational revisions within
the DOD infrastructure, to include military base closures and realignments and the growth of suburban areas surrounding
military installations which have resulted in DOD personnel relocating to areas which are more distant from military
installations. Requirements such as those necessitate change to storage-in-transit (SIT) rules in the delivery
of domestic household goods.




The following changes are proposed to section 7. All related items in D-3 impacted by this provision will be changed
accordingly.

a. Paragraph 3. Change 30 miles or less to 50 miles or less.

b. Note 1. Change 30 milies or less to 50 miles or less.

c. Note 5. The carrier should use a DOD-approved agent's available storage facility within a 50-mile radius of the
location shown in Block 18 on the personal property Government Bill of Lading (PPGBL). If no agent's facility is available
within a 50-mile radius, the carrier must obtain authorization from the PPSO to use a more distant facility.

(1) If no authorization is given, the charges will be assessed as if the shipment was placed in SIT at the location shown
in Block 18 of the PPGBL.

(2) If an alternate location to Bock 18 on the PPGBL is used for carrier convenience, as shown on the DD Form 619, the Government
will pay the lower of the SIT and related service charges.

(3) A DOD-approved facility is defined as follows: An agent's storage facility which has DOD approval and is accepting
DOD traffic from a carrier. If the agent refuses to accept a shipment, e.g., because of the carrier's refusal to provide
a waiver and/or to the carrier's poor payment history, the agent's facility will be considered ``available'' for
purpose of determining charges irrespective of what destination warehouse the carrier uses.

<DOCTITLE>Financial Assistance Award; Intent To Award a Grant to National Urban Coalition</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Department of Energy (DOE).



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of intent.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Department of Energy announces that pursuant to 10 CFR 600.6(a)(5), it is making a discretionary financial assistance
award based on the criteria set forth at 10 CFR 600.7(b)(2)(i)(D) to National Urban Coalition, Washington, DC under
grant number DE-FG01-94MI10319. The DOE intends to make a noncompetitive financial assistance award
in establishing the Say Yes to a Youngster's Future Program (Say Yes) in the Oakland, California Public School System.
The Say Yes program is an educational and training program for elementary school students, parents, teachers, and
school administrators. The period of performance contemplated is for three years. DOE will provide funding in the
amount of $120,000 for the first budget period estimated to be August 30, 1994-August 29, 1995. There will be
no cost sharing.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The proposed grant will provide funding to National Urban Coalition (NUC), a nonprofit organization of business,
civil rights, religious and government leaders founded in 1967 to seek workable answers to urban problems. The Say
Yes program was started in 1985 by the NUC because of the growing realization that, in a world where jobs, higher education
and everyday life are increasingly dependent on math, science and technology, the children of minority groups_African
Americans, Hispanic American and Native Americans, as well as females of all races_are being left further and further
behind. The Say Yes program is reaching out with a national network of school districts, teachers, administrators,
families, churches, civic organizations and businesses committed to improving mathematics and science education
for minority children. The project to be funded is for the Oakland School district, and will include the six most economically
disadvantaged school communities.




The program is meritorious because the program combines student interest development activities with family involvement
and teacher training into a program which prepares students early at the Kindergarten to Sixth Grade educational
level to be receptive to further study in the technical fields. The DOE knows of no other entity which is conducting
or is planning to conduct such an activity.

Based on the evaluation of relevance to the accomplishment of a public purpose, it is determined that the application
is highly likely of achieving its objective through the completion of some supporting objectives, including fostering
the development of natural student interest in math and science, enhancing family involvement in the students' learning
process and providing more comprehensive teacher training which focuses on math and science. A recent study reported
that over 78% of responding student program participants indicated that they like math and science better than before.

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The U.S. Department of Energy announces that pursuant to 10 CFR 600.6(a)(2) it is making a financial assistance award
under Grant Number DE-FG01-94CE15548 to Gentrex-Nevada, Inc. The proposed grant will provide funding in the
estimated amount of $97,351 by the Department of Energy for the purpose of saving energy through development of a foundation
insulation system, the ``Forms PLUS

TM

'' system of Mr. M. Dean Gardner, the inventor.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Department of Energy has determined in accordance with 10 CFR 600.14(e)(1) that the unsolicited application
for financial assistance submitted by Gentrex-Nevada, Inc., is meritorious based on the general evaluation required
by 10 CFR 600.14(d) and the proposed project represents a unique idea that would not be eligible for financial assistance
under a recent, current or planned solicitation. The inventor, Mr. M. Dean Gardner, who will be principal investigator,
will use his skills, experience and equipment to analyze an existing initial prototype, improve the prototype, and
test it in a wide range of climactic and construction conditions. For new construction annual savings are estimated
to be 119,000 barrels of oil equivalent. The proposed project is not eligible for financial assistance under a recent,
current or planned solicitation because the funding program, the Energy Related Invention Program (ERIP), has been
structured since its beginning in 1975 to operate without competitive solicitations because the authorizing legislation
directs ERIP to provide support for worthy ideas submitted by the public. The program has never issued and has no plans
to issue a competitive solicitation.

<DOCTITLE>Public Meetings on National Energy Policy</DOCTITLE>


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Office of Policy, Energy.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of public meetings.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The U.S. Department of Energy is announcing a series of public meetings around the country to solicit public input
in the development of the President's National Energy Policy Plan. The Department is also requesting that interested
parties submit written input for use in developing the Plan.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Section 801 of the Department of Energy Organization Act of 1977 requires the President to submit a National Energy
Policy Plan to Congress every two years. The 1993 requirement was waived because of the change of Administration,
and the next National Energy Policy Plan is required in 1995. In developing this Plan, the Administration will solicit
input from the public on all issues involved with energy. In order to gain input from a diverse set of stakeholders,
the Department will conduct a series of regional town meetings and roundtable discussions. Information from related
outreach efforts of the Administration will also be compiled to expand the record of public input.


The concept of sustainable development will provide a framework for developing a 1995 National Energy Policy Plan.
The most common definition of sustainable development is ``to meet the needs of the present without compromising
the ability of future generations to meet their own needs'' (Bruntland Commission_Our Common Future 1987). The Administration
intends to use this guiding principle to evaluate energy policy options, recognizing the interdependence of economic
growth and environmental progress, and considering how the production, distribution, and consumption of energy
affects current and future generations.
In developing the National Energy Policy Plan, the Administration will also consider the recommendations of the
Energy and Transportation Task Force of the President's Council on Sustainable Development. The Council is an advisory
committee comprised of several cabinet-level Administration officials and senior representatives of industry
and interest groups. By charter, the Council shall ``advise the President on matters involving sustainable development.
In furtherance of the mission, the Council will develop and recommend to the President a national sustainable development
action strategy that will foster economic vitality.''
A kick-off meeting for the National Energy Policy Plan is scheduled for Washington, DC and will be followed by seven
public meetings in cities across the United States. All meetings will be open to the general public. Additionally,
written comments on any subject area related to energy are welcome and will be considered valuable input to the formulation
of the National Energy Policy Plan.
All stakeholders are invited to participate in the meetings as well as to submit written input. This includes state,
local, territorial and tribal governments; industry; interest groups; minority groups and the general public.

for a new collection.


Abstract:

 EPA's Office of Solid Waste (OSW) is requesting approval to collect information from respondents that participate
in EPA's voluntary WasteWise program. The program encourages businesses to engage in waste reduction activities
and focuses on three waste reduction areas: waste prevention, recycling collection, and purchasing or manufacturing
items with recycled content.
To participate in the program, an organization must complete and submit a registration form to EPA. The registration
form provides EPA with general company information and specifies the facilities committed to the WasteWise program:
it must be signed by a senior official who has authority to commit the company to the program. In addition, each participant
must develop waste reduction goals and complete and submit a one-time Goals Identification Form to EPA; participants
must also report annually on the progress made toward achieving those goals in the Annual Reporting Form.
The information collected will be used by EPA to develop and provide targeted technical information to assist organizations'
waste reduction programs, identify and exchange waste reduction opportunities, and gauge the program's progress.


Burden Statement:

 The respondent burden for this collection is estimated to average 16 hours per response for the Registration Form;
48 hours per response for the Goals Identification Form; and 78 hours per response for the Annual Reporting Form: for
an estimated annual respondent burden of 142 hours in the first year and 78 hours each subsequent year. These estimates
include all aspects of the information collection including the time for reviewing instructions, searching existing
data sources, gathering the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information.


Respondents:

 Businesses and non-governmental organizations.


Estimated Number of Respondents:

 200 in Year 1; 300 in year 2; and 400 in year 3.


Estimated Number of Responses per Respondent:

 3 during first year of program participation; 1 in subsequent years.


Estimated Total Annual Burden on Respondents:

 28,500 hours in Year 1; 29,850 in Year 2; and 37,650 in Year 3.


Frequency of Collection:

 One-time and annual.

I appoint Dr. Mary S. Thrall and Dr. Charles C. Capen to serve as members of the FIFRA Scientific Advisory Panel. Dr.
Thrall is Professor of Pathology at the College of Veterinary at Medicine and Biomedical Sciences at Colorado State
University. She will provide the experience and technical background needed in the area of clinical pathology. Dr.
Capen is Professor and Chair, Department of Veterinary Pathobiology, Ohio State University and will provide expertise
in endocrinology. My decision to appoint Drs. Thrall and Capen is based upon several factors, including comments
received, their expertise in many facets of laboratory animal bioassays, particularly interpretation of clinical
chemistries, hematology, clinical pathology and endocrinology, the consequences of such effects in relation to
potential adverse effects in humans, the need for a disciplinary mix, and the need for broader scientific views.
Furthermore, I reappoint Dr. John T. Wilson to an additional year on the Panel. Dr. Wilson is a pediatrician and pharmacologist
with an extensive background in developmental and clinical pharmacology, clinical toxicology, immunology, and
endocrinology as they relate to laboratory animals and to human infants and young children. He has provided invaluable
scientific counsel to the Agency in addressing the concerns for pesticide residues in food and exposure to infants.

Meetings of the Scientific Advisory Panel are always announced in the 

Federal Register

 at least 15 days prior to each meeting, in accordance with the directives of the Federal Advisory Committee Act.

<DOCTITLE>State of Nebraska Plan for Certification of Pesticide Applicators</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of approval, on a contingent basis, a certification plan.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 In the 

Federal Register

 of April 21, 1994, notice was published of the intent of the Regional Administrator, EPA Region VII, to approve, on
a contingency basis, the State of Nebraska's ``A Plan for the Certification of Pesticide Applicators.'' Copies of
the plan were made available to the public. Comments were received on the State of Nebraska plan during the allowed
comment period. This notice announces the contingent approval of the Plan. A notice will be published at a later date
announcing the full approval of the plan. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 In accordance with the provisions of section 4(a)(2) of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act
(FIFRA), as amended, and 40 CFR part 171, the Governor of the State of Nebraska, E. Benjamin Nelson, has submitted the
State of Nebraska's ``A Plan for Certification of Pesticide Applicators'' to EPA for approval.


In the 

Federal Register

 of April 21, 1994 (59 FR 19010), notice was published of the intent of the Regional Administrator, EPA Region VII, to
approve, on a contingency basis, the State of Nebraska's ``A Plan for the Certification of Pesticide Applicators.''

Approval was requested by the State of Nebraska. Contingent approval is being established by EPA pending the promulgation
of appropriate regulations, the development of agreements by the State Lead Agency with the Cooperating State Agencies
which are involved in the certification process, and the development of certain specific standards of competency
for commercial applicators required at 40 CFR 171.4(c)(7). 
Copies of the State of Nebraska Plan were made available for public inspection at the Nebraska Department of Agriculture
office in Lincoln, Nebraska, the USEPA Region VII Lincoln, Nebraska field office, and the Office of Pesticide Programs,
EPA Headquarters, Arlington, Virginia. 
Comments were received from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln Cooperative Extension concerning the State of Nebraska
Plan during the allowed comment period. The commenter expressed three concerns. Each of those has been discussed
between the cooperating parties and the responses indicated here are consistent with those discussed. 
The commenter's first concern is that the two new categories (01A_Fumigation of Soil and 12_Aerial Pest Control)
will require the development of new training materials for the Nebraska certification and training program. As part
of the contingency approval, a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) is being established with the Nebraska Department
of Aeronautics to train applicators in aerial pest control which will alleviate the need for additional resources.
States have been identified that have developed training materials for applicators who fumigate soil. The training
materials developed by those States will be used with little or no modification. The resources required for this minimal
modification will be addressed in the MOU between the University of Nebraska Cooperative Extension and the Nebraska
Department of Agriculture. 
The commenter also was concerned that reconstructed categories will require resources to accomplish substantial
revisions to the training program. This concern will be addressed in the MOU that is being developed between the University
of Nebraska Cooperative Extension and the Nebraska Department of Agriculture. 
Lastly, the commenter was concerned that the restriction allowing a noncertified applicator to work under the direct
supervision of a certified applicator for only 60 days before needing to become certified would require additional
resources for training to be provided on an ongoing basis. The commenter suggested that self-study be available prior
to the certification examination during periods when formal training is not accessible. This suggestion is a present
option that will continue to be available to applicators and will not require additional resources. 
Therefore, it has been determined that the State of Nebraska Plan will satisfy the requirements of FIFRA and of 40 CFR
part 171, if the proposed State of Nebraska pesticide regulations are promulgated, and agreements by the State Lead
Agency with the Cooperating State Agencies, and certain specific standards of competency for commercial applicators
required at 40 CFR 171.4 are developed.
This contingent approval shall expire January 1, 1995, if these terms and conditions are not satisfied by that time.
If the terms and conditions are satisfied, EPA will publish a notice in the 

Federal Register

 announcing full approval of the plan. 
Pursuant to section 4(d) of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 553(d), the Agency finds that there is good
cause for providing that the contingent approval granted herein to the State of Nebraska Plan shall be effective immediately.
Neither the State of Nebraska Plan nor this Agency's contingent approval of the Plan create any new obligations on
pesticide applicators or other persons in the State of Nebraska. Delays in starting the work necessary to implement
the Plan, such as may be occasioned by providing some later effective date for this contingent approval, are inconsistent
with the public interest. Accordingly, this contingent approval is effective July 20, 1994.

<DOCTITLE>Notice of Receipt of Requests to Voluntarily Cancel Certain Pesticide Registrations </DOCTITLE>





<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 




</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice. 






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 In accordance with Section 6(f)(1) of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA), as amended,
EPA is issuing a notice of receipt of requests by registrants to voluntarily cancel certain pesticide registrations.





</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 



I. Introduction 



Section 6(f)(1) of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA), as amended, provides that a
pesticide registrant may, at any time, request that any of its pesticide registrations be cancelled. The Act further
provides that EPA must publish a notice of receipt of any such request in the 

Federal Register

 before acting on the request. 



II. Intent to Cancel 



This Notice announces receipt by the Agency of requests to cancel some 41 pesticide products registered under section
3 or 24(c) of FIFRA. These registrations are listed in sequence by registration number (or company number and 24(c)
number) in the following Table 1. 







 




Unless a request is withdrawn by the registrant within 90 days of publication of this notice, orders will be issued
cancelling all of these registrations. Users of these pesticides or anyone else desiring the retention of a registration
should contact the applicable registrant directly during this 90-day period. 

The following Table 2 includes the names and addresses of record for all registrants of the products in Table 1, in sequence
by EPA Company Number.





 






III. Procedures for Withdrawal of Request 



Registrants who choose to withdraw a request for cancellation must submit such withdrawal in writing to James A. Hollins,
at the address given above, postmarked before October 18, 1994. This written withdrawal of the request for cancellation
will apply only to the applicable 6(f)(1) request listed in this notice. If the product(s) have been subject to a previous
cancellation action, the effective date of cancellation and all other provisions of any earlier cancellation action
are controlling. The withdrawal request must also include a commitment to pay any reregistration fees due, and to
fulfill any applicable unsatisfied data requirements. 



IV. Provisions for Disposition of Existing Stocks 



The effective date of cancellation will be the date of the cancellation order. The orders effecting these requested
cancellations will generally permit a registrant to sell or distribute existing stocks for 1-year after the
date the cancellation request was received. This policy is in accordance with the Agency's statement of policy as
prescribed in Federal Register

 No. 123, Vol. 56, dated June 26, 1991. Exceptions to this general rule will be made if a product poses a risk concern,
or is in noncompliance with reregistration requirements, or is subject to a data call-in. In all cases, product-specific
disposition dates will be given in the cancellation orders. 

Existing stocks are those stocks of registered pesticide products which are currently in the United States and which
have been packaged, labeled, and released for shipment prior to the effective date of the cancellation action. Unless
the provisions of an earlier order apply, existing stocks already in the hands of dealers or users can be distributed,
sold or used legally until they are exhausted, provided that such further sale and use comply with the EPA-approved
label and labeling of the affected product(s). Exceptions to these general rules will be made in specific cases when
more stringent restrictions on sale, distribution, or use of the products or their ingredients have already been
imposed, as in Special Review actions, or where the Agency has identified significant potential risk concerns associated
with a particular chemical.

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This order reopens the proceeding and modifies the Commission's 1976 consent order by deleting the administrative
provisions that required the respondent to distribute a copy of the 1976 order to its funeral homes and affected employees;
provide prior notice to the Commission of certain changes in its corporate organization; and periodically notify
the Commission regarding the acquisition or sale of any funeral homes. The Commission concluded that these provisions
were no longer warranted or were essentially duplicative of requirements in provisions in more recent Commission
orders against the respondent and therefore, warranted reopening and modifying the order.

Notice of Determination Concerning Funds Available for Reallotment.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

In accordance with section 2607(b)(1) of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981 (42 U.S.C. 8621 et seq.), as
amended, a notice was published in the 

Federal Register

 on June 6, 1994 announcing the Secretary's preliminary determination that $22,591 in FY 1993 LIHEAP funds may be reallotted.
After further evaluation, the Secretary has determined that no funds from FY 1993 would be reallotted. This determination
was based on the fact that a large number of grantees would receive grant awards of less than one dollar ($1.00). Other
grantees would receive grant awards of less than one hundred dollars ($100.00). It would not be cost effective to reallot
these small amounts of funds.

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Bureau of Reclamation (BOR) proposes to withdraw for a period of 50 years, 1,988.27 acres of public land in Maricopa
and Yavapai counties contiguous to existing Lake Pleasant which is an integral part of the Central Arizona Project.
The purpose of the withdrawal is to reserve, from all forms of settlement, sale, location, or entry, the lands lying
within the normal operating levels of the New Waddell Dam which are/would be prone to periodic inundation and/or water
storage regimes. Any form of entry onto these lands, except for temporary uses of extremely short duration, could
be hazardous to the health and safety of the public land users. Additionally, the enlarged lake will allow for increased
recreational use and the BOR proposes to construct several new recreational developments to meet this demand. This
notice closes the land for up to 2 years from surface entry and mining. The land will remain open to mineral leasing.




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On June 24, 1994, the petition was approved allowing the BOR to file the application to withdraw the following described
public land from settlement, sale, location, and entry under the general land laws and the mining laws, but not the
mineral leasing laws. The withdrawal would be issued subject to valid existing rights. Lands proposed for withdrawal
are described as follows: 



Gila and Salt River Meridian

Sec. 12, lot 1, E1/2NW1/4NE1/4; 

Sec. 13, E1/2 and that portion of the W1/2 lying east of the east right-of-way boundary of the Castle Hot Springs Road.




T. 7 N., R. 1 W., 



Sec. 13, W1/2SW1/4SE1/4, SW1/4NW1/4SE1/4; 

Sec. 23, E1/2NE1/4, E1/2W1/2NE1/4, NE1/4SE1/4, E1/2NW1/4SE1/4, SE1/4SE1/4, SW1/4SE1/4; 

Sec. 24, NW1/4, W1/2W1/2NE1/4; 

Sec. 25, W1/2,NE1/4. 





The areas described aggregate approximately 1,988.27 acres in Maricopa and Yavapai Counties, Arizona. 

The purpose of the withdrawal is to reserve the lands within the normal operating levels of New Waddell Dam which are/will
be prone to periodic inundation and/or water storage regimes and to protect the Federal investment in the Lake Pleasant
project. 

For a period of 90 days from the date of publication of this notice, all persons who wish to submit comments, suggestions,
or objections in connection with the proposed withdrawal may present their views in writing to the undersigned officer
of the BLM. 

Notice is hereby given that an opportunity for a public meeting is afforded in connection with the proposed withdrawal.
All interested persons who desire a public meeting for the purpose of being heard on the subject must submit a written
request to the undersigned officer within 90 days from the date of publication of this notice. Upon a determination
by the authorized officer that a public meeting will be held, a notice of the time and place will be published in the 

Federal Register

 at least 30 days before the scheduled date of the meeting. The application will be processed in accordance with the
regulations set forth in 43 CFR 2300. 

For a period of 2 years from the date of publication of this notice in the 

Federal Register

, the land will be segregated as specified above unless the application is denied or canceled or the withdrawal is approved
prior to that date. The temporary uses which will be permitted during this segregative period are only those temporary
land uses which are compatible with the proposed use of the land by the BOR. 

The temporary segregation of the land in connection with the withdrawal application or proposal shall not affect
administrative jurisdiction over the land, and the segregation shall not have the effect of authorizing any use of
the land by the BOR.

Each parcel of National Forest System land is occupied by a Hut/Lodge of the Tenth Mountain Trail System or the Summit
Association System. The geographical position at the center of the Hut/Lodge facility at each site has been determined
with a 2-channel, sequencing, code phase Global Positioning System, nonsurvey quality receiver. The position is
based on North American Datum-1927 (NAD27). The dimensions and relationship of the boundaries of each parcel to the
Hut/Lodge is identical: 
Beginning at Corner No. 1, from which the northeast corner of the hut/lodge bears S. 45 
 W. 212 feet. 


From Corner No. 1, by metes and bounds, 


W. 300 feet to corner No. 2; 
S. 300 feet to corner No. 3; 
E. 300 feet to corner No. 4;

<DOCTITLE>Notice of Inventory Completion for Native American Human Remains from Maine in the Possession of the Robert Abbe Museum,
Bar Harbor, ME</DOCTITLE>


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

National Park Service, Interior.

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 



 Notice.





Notice is hereby given in accordance with provisions of the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act,
25 U.S.C. 3003(d), of the completion of an inventory of human remains from four sites in Hancock County, ME, in the possession
of the Robert Abbe Museum, Bar Harbor, ME.
A detailed inventory and assessment of these human remains has been made by the curatorial staff of the Robert Abbe
Museum and contracted specialists in physical anthropology, in consultation with representatives of the Penobscot
Nation, Aroostook Bank of Micmac, Houlton Band of Maliseet, and the Passamaquoddy Nation, collectively identified
hereafter as the Wabanaki Tribes of Maine.
The partial remains of six individuals were acquired by the Robert Abbe Museum between 1931 and 1945 in archeological
excavations of three prehistoric shell middens in Hancock County, ME. Partial remains from three individuals were
recovered between 1931 and 1936 from ME Site 44.12A. The partial remains of one individual were recovered in 1939 from
ME Site 44.25. Partial remains of two individuals were recovered between 1941 and 1945 from ME Site 44.6. Radiocarbon
dates from ME Site 44.6 yielded dates of 955 BP +/- 75 years and 1,120 BP +/- 80 years. The radiocarbon dates and other
archeological evidence indicate that all six individuals lived during the Late Prehistoric Period (1000 AD_1500
AD).
A human cranium and maxilla were acquired via donation from H. Lawrence Angel in 1946. Mr. Angel indicated that he had
collected the human remains from ME Site 31.31, another prehistoric shell midden in Hancock County, ME. These remains
are also judged to be associated with the Late Prehistoric Period occupation of ME Site 31.31.
Inventory of the human remains and review of the accompanying documentation indicates that no funerary objects associated
with the above mentioned human remains are part of the collections of the Robert Abbe Museum. No known individuals
were identifiable.
The Archaeological Advisory Committee of the Maine Historic Preservation Program has found it reasonable to trace
a shared group identity from the Late Prehistoric Period inhabitants of Maine as an undivided whole to the four modern
Indian tribes known collectively as the Wabanaki Tribes of Maine on the basis of geographic proximity; survivals
of stone, ceramic and perishable material culture skills; and probable linguistic continuity across the Late Prehistoric/Contact
Period boundary.
Based on the above mentioned information, officials of the Robert Abbe Museum have determined that, pursuant to 25
U.S.C. 3001 (2), there is a relationship of shared group identity which can be reasonably traced between these human
remains and the Wabanaki Tribes of Maine.
This notice has been sent to officials of the Wabanaki Tribes of Maine. Representatives of any other Indian tribe which
believes itself to be culturally affiliated with these human remains should contact Rebecca Cole-Will, Curator,
The Robert Abbe Museum, P.O. Box 286, Bar Harbor, ME 04609, telephone: (207) 288-3519 before August 19, 1994.

<DOCTITLE>Notice of Intent to Repatriate a Cultural Item in the Possession of the Denver Art Museum</DOCTITLE>


<ACTION>
ACTION:

 



 Notice





Notice is hereby given under the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act of 1990 of the intent to repatriate
a cultural item in the possession of the Denver Art Museum, Denver, CO, that meets the definition of ``sacred object''
under section 2 of the act.
The Elk Tongue Beaver Bundle consists of animal bodies or skins, a beaver tail, a buffalo tail, a feather fan, a pipe
stem and catlinite bowl, beaded bags, forked sticks, split sticks, and eight rawhide rattles in a corn husk bag, all
surrounded by a painted leather wrapping and a red plaid shawl. The original owner was Elk Tongue, a northern Piegan.
The bundle was subsequently transferred through a series of bundle keepers_Hairy Belly, Not Good, Scraping White,
Wolf Bull, and Little Dog_before being sold to Madge Hardin Walters of San Diego, CA. The Denver Art Museum purchased
the bundle from Ms. Walters in 1940.
Evidence provided by the Blackfeet Tribal Business Council, on the behalf of Mr. George G. Kipp, III, and Mrs. Melinda
Kipp, confirms that the Elk Tongue Beaver Bundle is needed by traditional Blackfeet religious leaders for the practice
of traditional Blackfeet religion by present day adherents. The Pikuni Traditionalist Association, Chief Leonard
Bastien of the Piegan Nation, Alberta, Canada, and the Blackfeet Tribal Business Council unanimously support Mr.
and Mrs. Kipp as the appropriate bundle keepers. The Denver Art Museum's Collection Committee and Board of Trustees
has reviewed the request for repatriation and has no objection. The Elk Tongue Beaver Bundle has been loaned to the
Blackfeet Tribal Business Council, on the behalf of Mr. and Mrs. Kipp, pending publication of this notice.
Authorities of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service have been contacted regarding applicability of Federal
endangered species statutes to this transfer and have concurred in the conclusion that the object is not covered due
to its age.
Representatives of any other Indian tribe that believes itself to be culturally affiliated with this object should
contact Dr. Nancy J. Blomberg, Curator of Native Arts, Denver Art Museum, 100 W. 14th Avenue Parkway, Denver, CO 80204,
telephone: (303) 839-4806 before August 19, 1994. Repatriation of the object to the Blackfeet Nation, on behalf
of George and Melinda Kipp, may begin after that date if no additional claimants come forward.

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 Notice is hereby given that the U.S. International Trade Commission has determined not to review the presiding administrative
law judge's (ALJ's) initial determination (ID) in the above-captioned investigation terminating the investigation
because of the collateral estoppel effect of the district court judgment in

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>

 On April 12, 1994, respondent-intervenor Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) and respondents Twinhead Int'l Corp.
and Twinhead Corp. (Twinhead) filed a motion for summary determination terminating the investigation in view of
a U.S. district judgment which collateral estops complainant Intel Corporation (Intel) from asserting its claims
against AMD and Twinhead in the subject investigation. On May 16, 1994, Intel filed an opposition to the motion. The
Commission investigative attorney (IA) filed a response supporting the motion on May 16, 1994. On May 24, 1994, AMD
and Twinhead filed a motion to file a reply and a reply. The presiding ALJ granted the motion to file a reply. 


On June 6, 1994, the ALJ issued an ID (Order No. 25) granting the motion of AMD and Twinhead. Intel filed a petition for
review of the ID on June 15, 1994, which was opposed by Twinhead, AMD, and the IA on June 22, 1994. No agency comments were
received. 
This action is taken under the authority of section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930, 19 U.S.C.  1337, and section
210.53(h) of the Commission's Interim Rules of Practice and Procedure, 19 CFR 210.53(h).

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission has issued a final design approval (FDA) to GE Nuclear Energy (GE) pursuant
to 10 CFR Part 52, Appendix O. This FDA allows the U.S. advanced boiling water reactor (ABWR) standard design to be referenced
in an application for a construction permit or operating license pursuant to 10 CFR Part 50, or in an application for
a combined license pursuant to 10 CFR Part 52.

In addition, GE has completed the technical review stage of design certification pursuant to the applicable requirements
of Subpart B of 10 CFR Part 52. The staff performed its technical review of the U.S. ABWR standard safety analysis report,
certified design material, and technical specifications in accordance with the standards for review of design certification
applications set forth in 10 CFR Section 52.48 that are applicable and technically relevant to the U.S. ABWR standard
design, including the exemptions and applicable regulations identified in Section 1.6 of the final safety evaluation
report (FSER). On the basis of its evaluation and independent analyses, as discussed in the FSER, the staff concludes
that, subject to satisfactory completion of the ABWR design control document and certified design material, GE's
application for design certification meets those portions of 10 CFR Section 52.47 that are applicable and technically
relevant to the U.S. ABWR standard design.

Therefore, the staff and the Advisory Committee on Reactor Safeguards will utilize the U.S. ABWR standard design
and will reply on it in the administrative review phase of the design certification process in accordance with 10 CFR
52.51.

A copy of the FDA has been placed in the NRC's Public Docket Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, N.W., Washington,
D.C. 20555, for review by interested persons.

<DOCTITLE>Toledo Edison Company, et al.; Davis-Besse Nuclear Power Station, Unit No. 1; Environmental Assessment and Finding
of No Significant Impact </DOCTITLE>



The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an amendment to Facility Operating
License No. NPF-3, issued to the Toledo Edison Company, Centerior Service Company, and the Cleveland Electric
Illuminating Company (the licensees), for operation of the Davis-Besse Nuclear Power Station, Unit No. 1, located
in Ottawa County, Ohio. 



Environmental Assessment 



Indentification of Proposed Action 



The proposed action would revise the operating license to reflect the proposed merger of the Toledo Edison Company
into the Cleveland Electric Illuminating Company. These companies are currently wholly owned subsidiaries of the
Centerior Energy Corporation. As described in the application, the company formed from the merger is intended to
be renamed. The name of the combined operating company has yet to be determined (hereinafter referred to as ``NEWCO'')
and the licensees indicate it will be provided by supplemental letter. The proposed amendment would (1) replace the
Toledo Edison Company and Cleveland Electric Illuminating Company with NEWCO as a licensee, (2) designate NEWCO
as owner of Davis-Besse Nuclear Power Station, Unit 1, and (3) make other associated changes to the license as indicated
in the amendment application. Centerior Service Company would be unaffected by the amendment and would remain in
a licensee. 

The proposed action is in accordance with the licensee's amendment application dated June 6, 1994. 



The Need for the Proposed Action



The proposed action in the form of an amendment application is needed to reflect the result of the proposed merger of
the Toledo Edison Company into the Cleveland Electric Illuminating Company. This action is also intended to maximize
the operating efficiencies of the two affiliated companies. 



Environmental Impacts of the Proposed Action



The Commission has completed its evaluation of the proposed action and concludes that there will be no changes to the
facility or to the operating, maintenance, engineering or other nuclear-related personnel as a result of the proposed
merger and license amendment. The proposed merger would not change the technical qualifications and responsibilities
of personnel. All of the Toledo Edision Company personnel in the Davis-Besse organization would be transferred to
NEWCO upon completion of the merger. This organization would continue to report to Centerior Service Company. After
the merger, NEWCO and Centerior Service Company would be required to continue to operate, manage, and maintain the
Davis-Besse Nuclear Power Station in accordance with the conditions and requirements of the NRC. No changes resulting
from merger are expected with regard to the following: lines on authority and responsibility, essential nuclear
support functions provided to Davis-Besse, effectiveness of the organization, priorities and ongoing plant improvement
projects, technical qualifications, and corporate financial resources presently available in support of Davis-Besse
operations. 

The change will not increase the probability or consequences of accidents, no changes are being made in the types of
any effluents that may be released offsite, and there is no significant increase in the allowable individual or cumulative
occupational radiation exposure. Accordingly, the Commission concludes that there are no significant radiological
environmental impact associated with the proposed action. 

With regard to potential nonradiological impacts, the proposed action does not affect the nonradiological plant
effluents and has no other environmental impact. Accordingly, the Commission concludes that there are no significant
nonradiological environmental impacts associated with the proposed action. 



Alternatives to the Proposed Action



Since the Commission has concluded that there is no measurable environmental impact associated with the proposed
action, any alternatives with equal or greater environmental impact need not be evaluated. The principal alternative
to the action would be to deny the request. Such action would not enhance the protection of the environmental and would
result in the Facility Operating License No. NPF-3 not appropriately reflecting the effect of the merger. 




Alternate Use of Resources




This action does not involve the use of any resources not previously considered in the Final Environmental Statement
for the Davis-Besse Nuclear Power Station, Unit 1, documented in NUREG-75/097 (October 1975). 



Agencies and Persons Consulted 



The NRC staff consulted with the Ohio State Official regarding the environmental impact of the proposed action. The
State official had no comments. 





Finding of No Significant Impact 




Based upon the environmental assessment, the Commission concludes that the proposed action will not have a significant
effect on the quality of the human environment. Accordingly, the Commission has determined not to prepare an environmental
impact statement of the proposed action. 

For further details with respect to the proposed action, see the licensee's letter dated June 6, 1994, which is available
for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, The Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington,
DC 20555, and at the local public document room located at the University of Toledo Library, Documents Department,
2801 Bancroft Avenue, Toledo, Ohio 43606.

<DOCTITLE>Biweekly Notice; Applications and Amendments to Facility Operating Licenses Involving No Significant Hazards
Considerations </DOCTITLE>




I. Background 




Pursuant to Public Law 97-415, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission or NRC staff) is publishing
this regular biweekly notice. Public Law 97-415 revised section 189 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended
(the Act), to require the Commission to publish notice of any amendments issued, or proposed to be issued, under a new
provision of section 189 of the Act. This provision grants the Commission the authority to issue and make immediately
effective any amendment to an operating license upon a determination by the Commission that such amendment involves
no significant hazards consideration, notwithstanding the pendency before the Commission of a request for a hearing
from any person. 


This biweekly notice includes all notices of amendments issued, or proposed to be issued from June 24, 1994, through
July 8, 1994. The last biweekly notice was published on July 6, 1994 (59 FR 34657). 




Notice of Consideration of Issuance of Amendments to Facility Operating Licenses, Proposed No Significant Hazards
Consideration Determination, and Opportunity for a Hearing 




The Commission has made a proposed determination that the following amendment requests involve no significant hazards
consideration. Under the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facility in accordance
with the proposed amendment would not (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an
accident previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident
previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The basis for this proposed determination
for each amendment request is shown below. 


The Commission is seeking public comments on this proposed determination. Any comments received within 30 days after
the date of publication of this notice will be considered in making any final determination. 


Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendment until the expiration of the 30-day notice period. However,
should circumstances change during the notice period such that failure to act in a timely way would result, for example,
in derating or shutdown of the facility, the Commission may issue the license amendment before the expiration of the
30-day notice period, provided that its final determination is that the amendment involves no significant hazards
consideration. The final determination will consider all public and State comments received before action is taken.
Should the Commission take this action, it will publish in the 

Federal Register

 a notice of issuance and provide for opportunity for a hearing after issuance. The Commission expects that the need
to take this action will occur very infrequently. 


Written comments may be submitted by mail to the Rules Review and Directives Branch, Division of Freedom of Information
and Publications Services, Office of Administration, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555,
and should cite the publication date and page number of this 

Federal Register

 notice. Written comments may also be delivered to Room 6D22, Two White Flint North, 11545 Rockville Pike, Rockville,
Maryland from 7:30 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. Federal workdays. Copies of written comments received may be examined at the NRC
Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555. The filing of requests for a hearing
and petitions for leave to intervene is discussed below. 


By August 19, 1994, the licensee may file a request for a hearing with respect to issuance of the amendment to the subject
facility operating license and any person whose interest may be affected by this proceeding and who wishes to participate
as a party in the proceeding must file a written request for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene. Requests
for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's ``Rules of Practice
for Domestic Licensing Proceedings'' in 10 CFR Part 2. Interested persons should consult a current copy of 10 CFR 2.714
which is available at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington,
DC 20555 and at the local public document room for the particular facility involved. If a request for a hearing or petition
for leave to intervene is filed by the above date, the Commission or an Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, designated
by the Commission or by the Chairman of the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board Panel, will rule on the request and/or
petition; and the Secretary or the designated Atomic Safety and Licensing Board will issue a notice of a hearing or
an appropriate order. 


As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall set forth with particularity the interest of the
petitioner in the proceeding, and how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding. The petition
should specifically explain the reasons why intervention should be permitted with particular reference to the following
factors: (1) the nature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made a party to the proceeding; (2) the nature and
extent of the petitioner's property, financial, or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect
of any order which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest. The petition should also identify
the specific aspect(s) of the subject matter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Any person
who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has been admitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting
leave of the Board up to 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended
petition must satisfy the specificity requirements described above. 


Not later than 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file
a supplement to the petition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions which are sought to be litigated
in the matter. Each contention must consist of a specific statement of the issue of law or fact to be raised or controverted.
In addition, the petitioner shall provide a brief explanation of the bases of the contention and a concise statement
of the alleged facts or expert opinion which support the contention and on which the petitioner intends to rely in proving
the contention at the hearing. The petitioner must also provide references to those specific sources and documents
of which the petitioner is aware and on which the petitioner intends to rely to establish those facts or expert opinion.
Petitioner must provide sufficient information to show that a genuine dispute exists with the applicant on a material
issue of law or fact. Contentions shall be limited to matters within the scope of the amendment under consideration.
The contention must be one which, if proven, would entitle the petitioner to relief. A petitioner who fails to file
such a supplement which satisfies these requirements with respect to at least one contention will not be permitted
to participate as a party. 


Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subject to any limitations in the order granting leave
to intervene, and have the opportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, including the opportunity
to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses. 


If a hearing is requested, the Commission will make a final determination on the issue of no significant hazards consideration.
The final determination will serve to decide when the hearing is held. 





If the final determination is that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration, the Commission
may issue the amendment and make it immediately effective, notwithstanding the request for a hearing. Any hearing
held would take place after issuance of the amendment.

Verde Nuclear Generating Station (PVNGS), Unit Nos. 1, 2, and 3, Maricopa County, Arizona 





Date of amendment requests: 

June 17, 1994.



Description of amendment requests: 

The proposed changes would enhance the PVNGS technical specifications (TS) by removing five tables of component
lists in accordance with NRC Generic Letter (GL) 91-08, ``Removal of Component Lists from Technical Specifications.''
The affected tables are 3.3-9B, 3.3-9C, 3.6-1, 3.8-2, and 3.8-3. The references to these
five tables will also be removed from the text of the TS in accordance with the sample TS change amendment provided by
the NRC in GL 91-08. These five removed tables will be incorporated into a new document, which will be administratively
controlled according to the change controls provisions of the TS. 



Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensees have provided their analysis about the issue of no significant hazards
consideration, which is presented below: 



Standard 1_

Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequence of an accident previously evaluated: 

The proposed amendment will remove five tables of component lists from the TS and add them to an administratively controlled
document which is subject to the change controls provisions of the TS. The new location of the affected component lists
is easily retrievable. The existing TS requirements and those components to which they apply are not altered by this
TS amendment. There are no changes to the operations, maintenance, surveillance, and/or qualification of any component
on the removed lists. Therefore, the probability of occurrence and the consequences of any previously evaluated
accident is [sic] not changed. 



Standard 2_

Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated: 

The TS requirements and the components to which they apply are not altered by this amendment. The removed component
lists are added to a controlled and easily retrievable document. This amendment has no impact on plant operations,
maintenance, testing, or component qualification. Therefore, the possibility of a new or different kind of accident
is not created by this amendment. 



Standard 3_

Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety: 

The removal of these five component lists from the TS does not alter existing TS requirements or those components to
which they apply. These lists will be added to an administratively controlled document which is subject to the controls
provisions of the TS. More specifically, there is no impact on safe plant shutdown, maintenance or hot standby, containment
isolation capability, containment leakage rate, and/or the operability of safety related valves. Therefore, removal
of these five component lists from the TS will not involve a reduction in the margin of safety. 

The NRC staff has reviewed the licensees' analysis and, based on that review, it appears that the three standards of
50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment requests involve no significant
hazards consideration.

Date of amendments request: 

May 27, 1994.


Description of amendments request: 

The proposed amendment would revise the Technical Specification surveillance test interval from monthly to quarterly
for several channel functional tests for the Reactor Protective System and the Engineered Safety Feature Actuation
System (ESFAS). In addition, an administrative change to the ESFAS table would remove an out-of-date footnote concerning
the emergency diesel generator logic circuit modifications. 


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below: 
1. Would not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.

The Reactor Protective System (RPS) and the Engineered Safety Features Actuation System (ESFAS) provide the actuation
signals to safety equipment necessary to mitigate design basis accidents and transients. The proposed change would
increase the surveillance test interval from monthly to quarterly for several of the RPS and ESFAS instrumentation
channel functional tests. The RPS/ESFAS instruments are not an initiator in any previously evaluated accidents.
Therefore, the proposed changed does not involve an increase in the probability of an accident previously evaluated.
The required plant-specific setpoint drift analysis for Calvert Cliffs demonstrated that the observed changes
in instrument uncertainties for the extended surveillance test interval do not exceed the current 30-day setpoint
assumptions. This provides confidence the 90-day test interval will not impact the ability to detect and monitor
system degradation. Therefore, the proposed change will not change the ability of the RPS/ESFAS instrumentation
to respond to and mitigate the consequences of any previously evaluated accident. In addition, an obsolete footnote
is removed from ESFAS Table 4.3-2. 
Therefore, the proposed change does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated. 
2. Would not create the possibility of a new or different type of accident from any accident previously evaluated.

The proposed extended surveillance test interval for the RPS and ESFAS and the removal of the obsolete footnote does
not involve any changes in equipment or the function of these instruments. The proposed change does not represent
a change in the configuration or operation of the plant. The RPS and ESFAS setpoints will not be changed as the instrument
uncertainties resulting from the proposed surveillance test interval (calculated using actual plant data) are
less than the instrument uncertainties assumed for the current surveillance interval. Therefore, the proposed
change does not create the possibility of a new or different type of accident from any accident previously evaluated.

3. Would not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. 
The proposed change will not affect the functions of the RPS or the ESFAS instruments. The CEN-327 and CEN-327,
Supplement 1, topical reports quantified the corresponding changes in core melt frequency for the representative
fault tree models that were developed for Calvert Cliffs. The proposed change has two principal effects with opposing
impacts on core melt frequency. The first impact is a slight increase in core melt frequency that results from the increased
unavailability of the instrumentation in question. This assumed unavailability results from less frequent testing.
The unavailability of the tested instrumentation components represents the potential for the failure of the reactor
to trip, an Anticipated Transient Without Scram, or a failure of the appropriate engineered safety features to actuate
when required. The opposing impact on core melt risk is the corresponding reduction in core melt frequency that would
result due to the reduced exposure of the plant to test-induced transients. The two changes are nearly equal and the
net result is no distinguishable effect on plant safety. The NRC issued a Safety Evaluation Report which found that
these evaluations were acceptable for justifying the extensions in the surveillance test intervals for the RPS and
ESFAS from 30 days to 90 days. 
The RPS and ESFAS setpoints will not be changed since the instrument drift resulting from the proposed surveillance
test interval is less than the instrument drift presently assumed for the current surveillance interval. This provides
confidence the 90-day test interval will not impact the ability to detect and monitor system degradation. The removal
of the ESFAS Table footnote only removes obsolete information from the Technical Specifications. The conclusions
of the accident analyses in the Calvert Cliffs Updated Safety Analysis Report remain valid and the safety limits continue
to be met. Therefore, the proposed change does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. 
The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendments request involves no significant
hazards consideration.

Unit Nos. 1 and 2, Calvert County, Maryland 




Date of amendments request: 

June 8, 1994. 


Description of amendments request: 

The proposed amendments would revise the Calvert Cliffs Nuclear Power Plant, Unit Nos. 1 and 2 (CC1/2), Technical
Specifications (TS) 4.6.2.2.b to extend the surveillance interval for the containment fan coolers from 18 months
to 24 months. The requested changes have been submitted in accordance with Generic Letter (GL) 91-04, ``Guidance
on Preparation of a License Amendment Request for Changes in Surveillance Intervals to Accommodate a 24-Month Fuel
Cycle.'' These proposed amendments are part of a series of requests that will eliminate the need for mid-cycle surveillance
outages to accommodate the existing 18 month surveillance requirements since CC1-2 is operating on 24-month
fuel cycles. 


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below: 
1. Would not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.

The purpose of the Containment Air Cooling (CAC) System is to cool the containment atmosphere, and thereby limit containment
pressure and temperature, following a Loss of Coolant Accident (LOCA) or Main Stream Line Break in containment. Failure
of the CAC System is not an initiator for any previously analyzed accident. Therefore, the proposed change does not
involve an increase in the probability of an accident previously evaluated. 
Historical CAC System reliability, monthly surveillances and monitoring of CAC-related plant parameters provide
assurance that undetected system degradation will not occur between 24-month surveillances, and the system will
continue to perform its safety function. Therefore, there will be no significant increase in the consequences of
accidents previously evaluated. Therefore, the proposed Technical Specification change does not increase the
probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. 
2. Would not create the possibility of a new or different type of accident from any accident previously evaluated.

This requested revision to increase the interval for a CAC surveillance from 18 to 24 months does not involve a significant
change in the design or operation of the plant. No hardware is being added to the plant as part of the proposed change.
The proposed change will not introduce any new accident initiators. Therefore, the proposed change would not create
the possibility of a new or different type of accident from any accident previously evaluated. 
3. Does operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment involve a significant reduction in a margin
of safety. 
The CAC System provides a margin of safety by providing a means by which containment pressure can be limited following
a LOCA or Main Steam Line Break. The proposed change does not affect the operation or design of the CAC System. Historical
monthly surveillances and Control Room indications give assurance that the reduction in surveillance frequency
will not adversely affect our ability to detect degradation in the system. Therefore, the proposed change does not
involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. 
The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendments request involves no significant
hazards consideration.

4.8.1.1.1.b to extend the alternate 69 kV offsite power circuit surveillance frequency from 18 to 24 months. 


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below: 
1. Would not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.

The purpose of the 69 kV Southern Maryland Electric Cooperative (SMECO) power source is to act as an independent energy
source for achieving and maintaining safe shutdown of the plant if the 500 kV system is not available. Failure of the
69 kV SMECO system is not an initiator for any existing accident. Therefore, the proposed change does not involve an
increase in the probability of an accident. 
The 69 kV SMECO system could be used to mitigate the consequences of accidents involving a loss of primary offsite power.
However, the accident analyses assume that if the 500 kV circuits were not available, the Emergency Diesel Generators
would be used to provide power to maintain the plant in a safe shutdown condition. A historical review of surveillance
test results indicates the system has experienced only one significant failure in the last ten years. In addition,
the system is routinely used. 
However, the SMECO system is not assumed to function in our accident analysis, so this change will result in no significant
increase in the consequences of accidents previously evaluated. Therefore, the proposed Technical Specification
change does not increase the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. 
2. Would not create the possibility of a new or different type of accident from any accident previously evaluated?

This requested increase in the interval for a 69 kV SMECO surveillance from 18 to 24 months does not involve a significant
change in the design or operation of the plant. No hardware is being added to the plant of the proposed change. The proposed
change will not introduce any new accident initiators. Therefore, the proposed change would not create the possibility
of a new or different type of accident from any accident previously evaluated. 
3. Does operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment involve a significant reduction in a margin
of safety? 
The 69 kV SMECO system provides a margin of safety by providing an alternate offsite electrical power source. The proposed
change does not affect the operation or design of the 69 kV SMECO system. Historical surveillance data and routine
use indicates that the reduction in surveillance frequency will not adversely affect our ability to detect degradation
in the system. Therefore, the proposed change does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. 
The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendments request involves no significant
hazards consideration.

Baltimore Gas and Electric Company, Docket No. 50-318, Calvert Cliffs Nuclear Power Plant, Unit No. 2, Calvert
County, Maryland 




Date of amendment request: 

May 27, 1994.


Description of amendment request: 

This amendment would revise the existing heatup and cooldown curves and rates to increase their applicability to
30 Effective Full-Power Years (EFPY). The fluence value that was used to determine the heatup and cooldown curves
was based on the peak fluence and EFPY at the end of Cycle 9 and the peak predicted fluence for Cycles 10 and beyond. In
addition, a variable-setpoint low-temperature overpressure protection (VLTOP) system is being installed to increase
the allowable operating pressure band in the Low-Temperature Overpressure Protection (LTOP) region. The VLTOP
system uses a variable power-operated relief valve setpoint to take advantage of increased Appendix G pressure limits
at increased reactor coolant system (RCS) temperatures. This system will increase the operating window in which
the plant may operate during heatup and cooldown. 
Specifically, this amendment would revise the Unit No. 2 heatup and cooldown curves and rates for the following Technical
Specification (TS) sections. TS Section 3.4.9.1.a would be revised to decrease the maximum heatup rate from a fixed
value of 75 
 F/hr to a more conservative variable heatup rate of 30 
 F to 60 
 F/hr which varies with RCS temperature range from 70 
 F to greater than 246 
 F. TS Section 3.4.9.1.b would be revised to increase the RCS temperatures for the maximum allowable cooldown
rates. TS Figures 3.4.9-1 and 3.4.9-2 would be replaced by new RCS pressure Temperature Limits. The revised
curves and rates are based on the predicted fluence value for Cycle 10 and beyond. 
The following TS sections would be revised to support modifications to the LTOP system. TS sections 3.4.9.3.a.1 and
3.4.9.3.a.2 would be changed to ``trip setpoint below the curve in Figure 3.4.9-3*'' to account for the VLTOP
system. The footnote, ``When on shutdown cooling, the PORV trip setpoint shall be less than or equal to 443 psia,''
has been added for Shutdown Cooling Operation to maintain an extra setpoint that is independent of RCS temperature
and is equal to the lowest variable setpoint. The Minimum Pressure and Temperature (MPT) Enable would be changed from
305 
 F to 301 
 F. This change would effect TS sections 3.1.2.1, 3.1.2.3, Table 3.3-3, 3.4.1.2, 3.4.1.3, 3.4.3, 3.4.9.3,
4.5.2, and 3.5.3. Due to the lower MPT Enable temperature, the transition region at which the high pressure safety
injection pumps are placed under manual control on cooldown and restored to automatic status on heatup would be changed
from a temperatue range of 305 
 F-350 
 F, to 301 
 F-325 
 F. This affects TS 3.5.3 and Table 3.3-3. TS Bases Sections B3/4.4.1, B3/4.4.9, and 3/4.5.2 would change
to be consistent with the proposed change and to provide additional clarification of some of the existing bases. 


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below: 
1. Would not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.

The Low Temperature Overpressure Protection (LTOP) system, including the administrative controls, ensures that
the 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix G, Pressure-Temperature (P-T) limits for the reactor pressure vessel will not be
violated while operating at low temperatures. The heatup and cooldown curves are conservatively developed in accordance
with the fracture toughness requirements of 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix G, as supplemented by the American Society of
Mechanical Engineers Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code Section III, Appendix G. The reactor vessel material Adjusted
RT

NDT

 values are based on the conservative methodology provided in Regulatory Guide 1.99, Revision 2. 
Analyses show that the proposed use of a variable LTOP system will not result in a significant increase in the probability
of an inadvertent opening of a Power-Operated Relief Valve (PORV) causing a small break Loss-of-Coolant-Accident.
The proposed heatup and cooldown curves and associated limits continue to provide conservative restrictions on
Reactor Coolant System (RCS) pressure to minimize material stresses in the RCS due to normal operating transients,
thus minimizing the likelihood of a rapidly propagating fracture due to pressure transients at low temperatures.
Because the proposed heatup and cooldown curves and rates are based on conservative Appendix G methods, and because
the LTOP controls protect the Appendix G P-T limits, the proposed curves and limits do not involve an increase
in the probability of accidents previously evaluated. 
The proposed use of a variable PORV trip setpoint and the increase in the allowable fluence at the reactor vessel wall
results in the changes to the heatup and cooldown curves and rates, the Minimum Pressure and Temperature (MPT) Enable
temperature, and high pressure safety injection pump manual control transition temperature. These proposed changes
continue to provide sufficient margin to accommodate postulated pressurization from mass and energy addition transients.
Calculations have been performed that predict the response to such transients. Because the results of the analyses
remain well within the conservative acceptance limits of Appendix G, these changes do not increase the consequences
of accidents previously evaluated. 
Therefore, the proposed changes do not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated. 
2. Would not create the possibility of a new or different type of accident from any accident previously evaluated.

The new variable LTOP control system along with the proposed changes to the Technical Specifications will ensure
that the Appendix G P-T limits will not be violated during low temperature operations. While setpoints and curves
have changed, this proposed change does not introduce any operator actions that are significantly different from
current operator actions used at the plant. The variable LTOP system will continue to have redundant channels to ensure
that no single equipment failure or operator error will result in violation of the P-T limits. The use of a variable
LTOP system does not create a new failure mechanism for the PORV. The failure mechanism for the PORV continues to be
an inadvertent opening or the failure to open during a pressure transient which has been previously evaluated. Therefore,
the proposed change does not create the possibility of a new or different type of accident from any accident previously
evaluated. 
3. Would not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. 
This change will ensure that the margin of safety is maintained with respect to energy or mass addition events in that
none of the events postulated could challenge the Appendix G limits. The proposed use of a variable PORV trip setpoint
and the increase in the allowable fluence at the reactor vessel wall necessitate the changes to the heatup and cooldown
curves and rates, the MPT Enable temperature, and high pressure safety injection pump manual control transition
temperature. These changes ensure that the margin of safety is maintained by protecting the Appendix G limits for
all postulated transients. Therefore, the proposed change does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of
safety.

Date of amendments request: 

June 17, 1994.



Description of amendments request: 

The proposed amendments would revise the Technical Specifications (TS) to (1) remove the heatup and cooldown curves
from TS 3/4.4.6 and relocate them to a newly created Pressure and Temperature Limits Report, and (2) remove the reactor
vessel material surveillance program withdrawal schedule from TS Table 4.4.6.3-1 and relocate it to the Updated
Final Safety Analysis Report. 



Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below: 


1. The proposed amendment [sic] does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated because the changes are administrative in nature. These changes do not alter the configuration
or operation of the facility. The Limiting Safety Systems Settings and Safety Limits specified in the current Technical
Specifications remain unchanged. 

2. The proposed amendment [sic] does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident
previously evaluated. The safety analysis of the facility remains complete and accurate. There are no physical changes
to the facility and the plant conditions for which the design basis accidents have been evaluated are still valid.
The operating procedures and emergency procedures are unaffected. 

3. The proposed amendment [sic] does not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety because these margins
are established through the Limiting Conditions of Operation, Limiting Safety System Settings and Safety Limits
specified in the Technical Specifications, and since there are no changes to the physical design or operation of the
facility, these margins will not be changed. 

The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

Description of amendment request: 

The proposed amendment would revise the Technical Specifications by increasing the minimum reactor coolant system
temperature required for criticality from 500 degrees Fahrenheit to 530 degrees Fahrenheit. 



Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below: 

The proposed change does not result in a significant increase in the probability or consequences of accidents previously
evaluated. The probability for an accident is independent of the changes being proposed. Reactor criticality at
530 degrees Fahrenheit instead of the nominal no-load T

avg

 of 547 degrees Fahrenheit does not affect any of the accident initiators in the analyses, but does change one of the
initial conditions assumed in the Safety Analysis. However, the change in initial conditions from the nominal no-load
temperature of 547 degrees Fahrenheit to 530 degrees Fahrenheit does not increase the probability of any of the events
considered in the Safety Analysis. The proposed Minimum Temperature for Criticality specification (530 degrees
Fahrenheit) will be more restrictive than the current specification which allows reactor criticality at a temperature
as low as 500 degrees Fahrenheit. In addition, the Action Statement will require operator response to place the reactor
in a subcritical condition (Mode 3) with 15 minutes should the temperature drop below the limit for greater than a specified
amount of time (15 minutes). 

Likewise, the proposed change does not significantly increase the consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
In the reanalysis of the Zero Power accidents (Rod Withdrawal From Subcritical, Rod Ejection, Main Steamline Break,
Boron Dilution During Startup, and Feedwater Malfunction) from an initial condition of 530 degrees Fahrenheit,
it was concluded that the results and conclusions in the current Safety Analysis remain valid based on the fact that
the current analysis results are conservative and bounding for reactor criticality at 530 degrees Fahrenheit. The
LOCA transient analyses are unaffected by the proposed change since they are initiated from the limiting condition
of 102 percent. Since the full power T

avg

 value is unchanged by this proposed amendment, the LOCA analyses are unaffected. The proposed change will ensure
that plant parameters are within their analyzed ranges prior to reactor criticality and appropriate operator actions
are taken should the temperature drop below the temperature limit after reaching criticality. 

The proposed administrative changes delete requirements which are no longer applicable and will have no affect on
the probability or consequences of any accident previously evaluated in the analyses. 

The proposed change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated. The change does not involve the addition of any new or different type of equipment, nor does it involve the
operation of equipment required for safe operation of the facility in a manner different from those addressed in the
Final Safety Analysis Report. The proposed change will ensure that plant parameters are within their analyzed ranges
prior to reactor criticality. The proposed administrative changes delete requirements which are no longer applicable
and will not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.


The proposed change does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The proposed change does not affect
any safety related system or component operation or operability, instrument operation, or safety system setpoints,
and does not result in increased severity of any of the accidents considered in the analysis. Operator response to
a drop in temperature after reaching criticality for a specified period of time (greater than 15 minutes) will place
the reactor in a subcritical condition which is inherently more stable than when critical below the Point of Adding
Heat. The proposed administrative changes are being made to clarify Technical Specifications with no change of intent.
Therefore, the proposed changes do not create a significant reduction in a margin of safety. 

In conclusion, based on the previous considerations, Commonwealth Edison Company believes that the activities
associated with this Technical Specification amendment request satisfy the Significant Hazards Consideration
standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) and, accordingly, a finding that this Technical Specification amendment does not represent
a Significant Hazards Consideration is justified. 

The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

Lake County, Illinois 





Date of amendment request: 

June 24, 1994.



Description of amendment request: 

The proposed amendment would revise the Technical Specifications by removing the containment recirculation sump
level instrumentation. 



Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below: 

1. The proposed amendment does not involve a significant increase in the probability of occurrence or consequences
of any accident previously evaluated. 

This change does not affect the initiators or precursors of any accident previously evaluated. This change will not
increase the likelihood that a transient initiating event will occur because transients are initiated by equipment
malfunction and/or catastrophic system failure. Since the proposed change does not involve the introduction of
new or redesigned plant equipment, failure mechanisms are not impacted. As a result, the probability of occurrence
of accidents previously evaluated is not increased. 

The consequences of accidents previously evaluated are not increased. Removal of [containment recirculation sump
level] CRSL instrumentation requirements from Technical Specifications does not affect the ability to mitigate
the consequences of any accident previously evaluated. The CRSL instrumentation is used to verify that [residual
heat removal] RHR pumps have adequate [net positive suction head] NPSH to operate in the recirculation mode following
a Loss of Coolant Accident (LOCA). 

As stated in the Zion Updated Final Safety Analysis Report (UFSAR), the changeover from the injection mode to the recirculation
mode of emergency core cooling is initiated when the low level alarm on the RWST annunciates. This occurs when the RWST
level drops to 13
'-7
'
' (145,600 gallons). 

At this point, sufficient water has been delivered to the containment, from the Containment Spray (CS) system and,
by Emergency Core Cooling System (ECCS) injection, through the [reactor coolant system] RCS break, to provide at
least one foot of water above the containment floor. One foot of water above the containment floor provides sufficient
volume to sustain the required NPSH of the RHR pumps in the recirculation mode of operation. The water level in the Containment
Building during the recirculation phase will be approximately 5 feet above the floor elevation (568
') based on the volume of the RCS, accumulators, and the minimum required volume of the RWST. Minimum RWST volume
of 350,000 gallons is required by Technical Specification 3.8.1.F. 

In summary, RWST level instrumentation, which satisfies Regulatory Guide 1.97 qualification requirements for
a Type A, Category 1 variable, provides the operator with the primary indication of the appropriate time to initiate
switchover to the recirculation mode, as well as indication of adequate NPSH for the RHR pumps. Containment Water
Level (wide range) instrumentation which is qualified as a Type B variable provides confirmatory indication of water
level in containment. 

The proposed change does not affect the procedures controlling operation of equipment, or systems required to mitigate
the accidents considered in the UFSAR. As such, there will be no significant increase in the consequences of any accident
previously evaluated. 

2. The proposed amendment does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously
analyzed. 

The proposed change does not involve the addition of any new or different types of equipment, nor does it involve the
operation of equipment required for safe operation of the facility in a manner different from those addressed in the
UFSAR. No safety related equipment or function will be altered as a result of this proposed change. Because no new failure
modes are introduced, the proposed amendment does not create a new or different kind of accident from any previously
analyzed in the UFSAR. Also, the methods of recovery from accidents described in the UFSAR are not affected. 

Based on the above discussion, the proposed amendment does not create a new or different kind of accident from any previously
analyzed in the UFSAR. 


3. The proposed changes do not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. 

No design margins are impacted and the newly chosen primary indicator (RWST level) is both consistent with plant emergency
procedures and appropriately qualified. The proposed change will not adversely impact the peak clad temperature,
amount of fuel damage, or offsite dose projected to occur from the design basis accidents. Thus, the margin of safety
is not diminished. 

The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

Connecticut Yankee Atomic Power Company, Docket No. 50-213, Haddam Neck Plant, Middlesex County, Connecticut





Date of amendment request: 

June 16, 1994.


Description of amendment request: 

The proposed amendment will remove a footnote applicable for Cycle 18 only regarding the surveillance of the automatic
bus transfer (ABT) system and add surveillance requirement 4.8.3.1.2, to test the ABT once per refueling. 


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below: 
The proposed changes do not involve an SHC [significant hazards consideration] because the changes would not: 
1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. 
The proposed changes to delete a note from the limiting condition for operation for the MCC-5 ABT scheme and to
add the surveillance requirement has no impact on the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
By removing the requirement to test the scheme on-line, the probability of failure to mitigate an accident while the
Haddam Neck Plant is operational is incrementally decreased. 
2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously analyzed. 
The proposed changes remove the requirements to disable the subject ABT feature for testing, leaving the scheme undisturbed
throughout normal plant operation, and therefore does not create the possibility of a new accident or different kind
of accident from any previously analyzed. 
3. Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. 
The proposed changes require that the MCC-5 ABT feature be tested during a plant shutdown rather than during
normal operation. This will place the ABT scheme in a test environment that has no significant reduction in a margin
of safety. The plant configuration that is required to perform this test (refueling) would clearly place the Haddam
Neck Plant in a state that would be able to accept all possible ABT scheme test outcomes, normal and abnormal. Therefore,
these proposed changes do not result in any reduction in the margin of safety. 
The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

Consolidated Edison Company of New York, Docket No. 50-247, Indian Point Nuclear Generating Unit No. 2, Westchester
County, New York 




Date of amendment request: 

October 29, 1993, as supplemented on March 28, 1994.


Description of amendment request: 

This amendment is an additional followup to the amendment request of May 29, 1992, published in the 

Federal Register 

(57 FR 30242) on July 8, 1992, which changed the Technical Specifications Section 1.0, Definitions, to accommodate
a 24-month fuel cycle and which proposed the extension of the test intervals for specific surveillance tests. This
amendment proposes extending the surveillance intervals to 24 months for the following additional surveillance
tests: 




(1) Volume Control Tank Level Transmitter 
(2) Containment High Range Area Radiation Monitors, R-25 and R-26 
(3) Safety Injection System Electrical Loading 
(4) Safety Injection (SI) System 
(5) Reactor Coolant System Sub-Cooling Margin Monitor 



The changes requested by the licensee are in accordance with Generic Letter 91-04, ``Changes in Technical Specification
Surveillance Intervals to Accommodate a 24-Month Fuel Cycle.'' 
The October 29, 1993, submittal included surveillance tests for the Auxiliary Feedwater System which duplicated
a previous request which was subsequently approved. The March 28, 1994, submittal withdrew the duplicated request.



Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazard consideration,
which is presented below: 
(1) Volume Control Tank Transmitter: 
The proposed change does not involve a significant hazard consideration since: 
1. A significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated will not occur.

It is proposed that the channel calibration frequency for the volume control tank level instrumentation be changed
from every 18 months (+25%) to every 24 months (+25%). 
A statistical analysis of channel uncertainty for a 30 month operating cycle has been performed. Based upon this analysis
it has been concluded that sufficient margin exists between the existing Technical Specification limits and the
licensing basis Safety Analysis limits to accommodate the channel statistical error resulting from a 30 month operating
cycle. The existing margin between the Technical Specification limit and the Safety Analysis limit provides assurance
that plant protective actions will occur as required. It is therefore concluded that changing the surveillance interval
from 18 months (+25%) to 24 months (+25%) will not result in a significant increase in the probability or consequences
of an accident previously evaluated. 
2. The possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated has not been created.

The proposed change is operating cycle length from a maximum of 22.5 months to 30 months resulting from an increased
surveillance interval will not result in a channel statistical allowance which exceeds the current margin between
the existing Technical Specification limits and the Safety Analysis limits. Plant equipment, which will be set at
(or more conservatively than) Technical Specification limits, will therefore provide protective functions to
assure that Safety Analysis limits are not exceeded. This will prevent the possibility of any new or different kind
of accident from that previously evaluated from occurring. 
3. A significant reduction in a margin of safety is not involved. 
The change in surveillance interval from a maximum of 22.5 months to 30 months resulting from an increased operating
cycle will not result in a channel statistical allowance which exceeds the margin which exists between the current
Technical Specification limit and the licensing basis Safety Analysis limit. This margin, which is equivalent to
the existing margin, is necessary to assure that protective safety functions will occur so that Safety Analysis limits
are not exceeded. 
(2) Containment High Range Area Radiation Monitors, R-25 and R-26: 
The proposed change does not involve a significant hazard consideration since: 
1. There is no significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident. 
It is proposed that the calibration frequency for the high-range Containment Radiation Monitors (R-25 and
R-26) be revised from every 18 months (+25%) to every 24 months (+25%). 
These two monitors are redundant to each other and are used for post accident monitoring purposes. They serve no function
during normal plant operation. Furthermore, they serve no purpose in preventing accident initiation or mitigation.
They are used for Emergency Planning purposes to indicate a release of radioactivity to containment. 
Review of past test results indicates that the devices have proven reliable during past surveillances and there was
no indication that they would not remain operable for an extended operating cycle. In addition, the devices are essentially
redundant to each other. Each device would respond to a release of radioactivity to Containment. 
In consideration that the monitors are redundant, and in view of the past test history of the monitors, there would
be no significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident due to an extended operating cycle.

2. The possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously analyzed has not been created. 
The role of R-25 and R-26 is in the assessment of radiological releases to Containment. In this function
it is important that one of the instruments, being high range, respond to a radiological release. Indications from
the devices are not used in a quantitative manner. Rather they are used for qualitative purposes. Due to redundancy
and past test history, continued operability is expected. In addition, the instruments serve no function in preventing
accident initiation or accident mitigation. Therefore, it is concluded that an extended operating cycle for these
monitors would not result in the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously analyzed. 
3. There has been no significant reduction in the margin of safety. 
Due to the qualitative function served by these two instruments as well as their redundancy and acceptable past test
history, no significant reduction in the margin of safety due to an extended operating cycle is expected. 



(3) Safety Injection System Electrical Loading 


The proposed change does not involve a significant hazard consideration since: 
1. There is no significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident. 
The test procedure under consideration is one of the more complicated surveillance procedures accomplished at a
refueling interval. Considering the vast number of components that are tested it is highly improbable that some deficiencies
will not occur. When such problems are encountered it is important to note whether the failure is time dependent and,
in addition, whether the corrective maintenance implemented prevents recurrences in the future. In consideration
of the evaluation of past test observations it is important to note that the problems which occurred were not time dependent
and that maintenance practices have been effective in precluding future failures of the same type. Equally important
is whether the emergency power system would have performed its intended safety function if the situation was not a
test but represented an actual demand upon the system. Test acceptance criteria are always more stringent than required
by accident scenarios to provide margin. As discussed above the two most significant findings were a failure of a CCW
[Component Cooling Water] pump to strip from the bus during the 1989 test and a relay which did not function within its
timing sequence. In the first instance, the diesel generator was not overloaded. In the second instance, the relay
did function albeit not within the allotted time. In both cases, safety functions would have been performed. 
Thus, it is concluded that an extended period between surveillances will not involve a significant increase in the
probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. 
2. The possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously analyzed has not been created. 
The deficiencies noted in the test data taken during the last several refueling outage surveillances were not substantial
in number and would not have impacted the capability of the Safety Injection System and its emergency power supply
to perform its intended safety function. The effectiveness of maintenance practices, both preventive and corrective,
has been proven in that deficiencies noted in one test are not repeated in subsequent tests. The last refueling surveillance
test was completely successful where no new test failures were noted. Because past test deficiencies do not appear
to be time dependent, extending the surveillance interval by 7.5 months is not expected to create the possibility
of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously created. 
3. There has been no reduction in the margin of safety. 
Because previous tests indicate that the engineered safety features power supply would have performed its safety
function if called upon over the past several years, it is concluded that extending the operating cycle by several
months will not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. 


(4) Safety Injection System 


The proposed change does not involve a significant hazard consideration since: 
1. There is no significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident. 
The central safety objective in reactor design and operation is the control of reactor fission products from the fuel.
Four methods are used to ensure this objective. Two of these methods are: (1) Retention of fission products in the reactor
coolant for whatever leakage occurs; and (2) retention of fission products by the containment for operational and
accidental releases beyond the reactor coolant boundary. The engineered safety features are the provisions in the
plant that embody these two methods to prevent the occurrence or to ameliorate the effects of serious accidents. 
The engineered safety features systems are the containment system, the safety injection system, the containment
spray system, the containment air recirculation cooling and filtration system, the isolation valve seal-water
system, and the containment penetration and weld channel pressurization system. Each engineered safety feature
provides sufficient performance capability to accommodate any single failure of an active component and still function
in a manner to avoid undue risk to the health and safety of the public. 
A comprehensive program of plant testing is formulated for all equipment, systems, and system control vital to the
functioning of engineered safety features. The program consists, in part, of integrated tests of the systems as a
whole and periodic tests of the actuation circuitry and mechanical components. 
An assessment has been performed of the test results from the last five refueling outages, covering a period in excess
of seven years. In reviewing the test results particular attention was directed towards those test anomalies which
directly impacted test acceptance criteria and, thus, influence the capability of the safety injection system to
perform its intended safety function. Although in each test a problem area was identified, the number of such events
were minimal. Furthermore, after corrective action these events were not repeated in subsequent system tests. In
all instances the problems were not identified to be time dependent. Furthermore, the consequence from a system safety
function perspective was minimal. Thus, it is concluded that extending the surveillance interval by several months
will not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.

2. The possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously analyzed has not been created. 
The number of problem areas in each test have been few and of minimal to nonexistent safety significance. In 1986, a
valve failure occurred which would have been detected by alternate means during an extended operating cycle. In another
instance, lack of valve movement could not be repeated in a second test, leading to the conclusion that the valve malfunction
was not induced by the system but was the result of the test process. In the last problem area, manual SI initiation,
no credit is taken within the FSAR [Final Safety Analysis Report] accident analysis for this function. In 1989, a series
of containment isolation valves failed to stroke as required. In three instances the valves failed closed, which
is the correct position. In the other instances, either the redundant valve did stroke to the correct position or the
valve was located in a closed system. In all these events there was minimal impact upon safety. More importantly, after
corrective action, these failures were not repeated in the 1991 or 1993 tests. In 1991, one breaker failed to perform
within specifications and thus was considered defective. In 1993 there were no major equipment malfunctions, although
one containment isolation valve failed to perform as required. 
In summary, although there have been anomalies in all of the tests evaluated, none were deemed serious enough to impact
the safety function of the safety injection system or to be considered as having a negative affect upon an increased
interval of several months between surveillances. Therefore, it has been concluded that an increased operating
cycle will not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.

3. There has been no reduction in the margin of safety. 
The results of the previous five cycles of test data have been evaluated. None of the anomalies observed were sufficiently
serious to impact the performance of the Safety Injection System or to weigh against an extended operating cycle.
As there are no other changes to the safety analysis parameters which are impacted by an extended interval between
surveillances, it is concluded that this change will not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety.

The proposed change does not involve a significant hazards consideration since: 

1. There is no significant increase in the possibility or consequences of an accident. 

It is proposed that the channel calibration frequency for the volume control tank instrumentation be changed from
every 18 months (+25%) to every 24 months (+25%). 

The sub-cooling margin monitoring function is not relied upon during normal operation. There is no reference to its
use in the Indian Point Unit 2 standard operating procedures. No credit is taken for this monitoring function within
the safety analysis for either the prevention or mitigation of an accident. The increase in ``normal'' operating
uncertainty, due to the longer operating cycle, as well as ``adverse'' uncertainties, is being incorporated in the
EOPs [Emergency Operating Procedures]. Therefore, the slight increase in uncertainty associated with a longer
operating cycle between surveillances will not cause a significant increase in the probability or consequences
of an accident. 

2. The possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously analyzed has not been created. 

The sub-cooling margin serves no purpose during normal operation for prevention of an accident. No credit is taken
within the FSAR Safety Analysis for accident mitigation. The sub-cooling margin monitor is relied upon within the
Emergency Operating Procedures. Thus, the normal uncertainty due to a 30 month operating cycle, as supplemented
by the instrument loop error due to a post-accident harsh environment, is being factored into the Emergency Operation
Procedures in accordance with Emergency Response Guidelines. Thus, it is concluded that the possibility of a new
or different kind of accident from any previously analyzed has not been created. 

3. There has been no reduction in the margin of safety. 

Because the sub-cooling margin monitor serves no purpose during normal operation and appropriate measures have
been implemented to reflect the additional uncertainty due to a 30 month operating cycle into the EOPs, it is concluded
that there will be no significant reduction in a margin of safety. 

The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
50.92(c) are satisfied. 
Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.

Consolidated Edison Company of New York, Docket No. 50-247, Indian Point Nuclear Generating Unit No. 2, Westchester
County, New York 





Date of amendment request: 

June 1, 1994.



Description of amendment request: 

The proposed amendment would revise the Technical Specifications to allow extended Rod Position Indication (RPI)
deviation limits and on-line calibration of the RPI channels. Specifically, Section 3.10.6.1 would be changed to
allow extended RPI deviation limits, and Section 3.10.4.4 would be changed to allow on-line calibration of the RPI
channels. The Basis for Section 10 would be changed to reflect the above, and in addition, Section 3.10.6.2 would be
changed to clarify the operability requirements during calibration. The proposed changes to Sections 3.10.6.1
and 3.10.4.4 include power limits to be included in the Core Operating Limit Report (COLR). The use of a COLR for cycle
specific core operating limits was proposed by the licensee by submittal of October 29, 1993, and is currently under
review by the NRC staff. 



Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below: 

1. Does the proposed license amendment involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated? 



Response:

 Neither the probability nor the consequences of an accident previously analyzed is increased due to the proposed
changes. All peaking factors will remain within the limits of the Technical Specifications. Both the shutdown margin
and the axial flux difference will be maintained within the limits of the Technical Specifications. There will be
no fuel damage due to the changes. All design and safety criteria will be met. 

2. Does the proposed license amendment create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously
evaluated? 



Response: 

The changes will not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident. The calibration will be performed
using plant procedures that have been reviewed and approved by Con Edison's Safety Committees. It has been shown that
even with the new RPI deviation bands and on-line calibration, all power distribution limits will be met. 

3. Does the proposed amendment involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety? 



Response:

 The proposed amendment does not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety. There will be no change in
the power distribution limits used in the design and safety analyses and the required shutdown margin will be maintained.
It has been shown that there is no fuel failure as a result of this change. 

The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant
hazards consideration.

Date of application for amendment: 

December 9, 1993 (Reference NRC-93-0143) 



Brief description of amendment: 

This Licensee Amendment Request (LAR) proposes to revise the Enrico Fermi Power Plant, Unit 1, Technical Specifications
(TS) to bring the TS into conformance with a revision of 10 CFR Part 20 (56 FR 23360). 



Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below: 

a. Does the change involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated?


The proposed changes are administrative in nature and do not impact the SAFSTOR status or design of any plant structures,
systems or components. As a result, this proposed change cannot increase the probability or the consequences of any
accident previously evaluated. 

b. Does the change create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated?


The proposed changes do not affect the plant SAFSTOR status as defined. As a result, the proposed changes cannot create
the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. 

c. Does the change involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety? 

The proposed changes do not affect the plant SAFSTOR status. The changes will not increase the amounts or change the
types of effluents that may be released offsite. These changes only ensure compliance with revised 10 CFR 20. These
changes do not alter any of the requirements or responsibilities for protection of the public against radiation hazards.
As a result, these changes do not reduce the margin of safety. 

The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment requests involve no significant
hazards consideration.

1 and 2, Shippingport, Pennsylvania 





Date of amendment request: 

September 16, 1992, as superseded February 4, 1994. 



Description of amendment request: 

The proposed amendment would supersede in its entirety a previous proposed amendment which was submitted by letter
dated September 16, 1992. A notice of application and proposed no significant hazards consideration determination
for the September 16, 1992, submittal was published in the 

Federal Register

 on January 21, 1993 (58 FR 5429); this notice supersedes the January 21, 1993, notice in its entirety. 

The proposed amendment would modify the Technical Specifications (TSs) related to containment air locks to make
them as close to the Improved Standard TSs in NUREG-1431 as the plant-specific design will permit. The proposed
changes in TS 3.6.1.1 and 3.6.1.3 would modify surveillance requirements and limiting conditions of operation and
effect numerous administrative and format changes. The changes relate to air lock operability, leak testing, and
door interlocks. 



Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below: 

1. Does the change involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated?


The probability of occurrence of a previously evaluated accident is not increased because the containment air locks
do not effect the initiation of any design basis accident [DBA]. The consequences of an accident are also not significantly
increased because the proposed revisions to the action statements will continue to ensure that at least one door in
each air lock is maintained closed. A single door in each air lock is capable of withstanding a pressure in excess of
the maximum expected pressure following a DBA. The structural integrity and leak tightness of the containment will
not be changed by this proposed revision. For the brief period of time that the operable air lock door is open and the
inoperable door is providing the single containment barrier, the consequences of [2an] accident may be increased.
However, the probability of an event occurring requiring containment integrity is sufficiently remote to justify
limited access when required. 

Therefore, based on the continued ability of the containment air locks to provide a barrier to limit leakage from containment
during a DBA, this proposed change does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an
accident previously evaluated. 

2. Does the change create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated?


Air lock operation does not interface with the reactor coolant pressure boundary or any other mechanical or electrical
controls which could impact the operations of the reactor or its direct support systems. 

Containment air locks are designed for the purpose of containment entry and exit. During this operation, the air lock
maintains containment integrity by providing at least one door which is capable of providing a leak tight barrier
during a DBA. 

The proposed changes will continue to ensure that air lock operation is performed as assumed in the original design
of the plant. During the period when the operable door is open and the other door inoperable, at least one door is being
maintained closed as designed. This condition is ensured due to the subatmospheric conditions that exist during
plant operation. The operable air lock door cannot be safely opened unless the inoperable door is closed due to the
approximately 5 psi pressure differential that exists. The operable air lock door would only be opened long enough
to allow personnel to enter the air lock. 

Therefore, this proposed change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident
previously evaluated. 

3. Does the change involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety? 

The applicable margin of safety consists of maintaining the primary containment leak rates within the assumptions
of the DBA analysis. These leak rates are maintained provided at least one operable air lock door remains closed during
the event. 

The proposed revisions will continue to ensure that at least one air lock door is maintained closed. During the brief
period of time that an operable air lock door is open and the inoperable door is providing the single containment barrier,
the margin of safety is decreased. The inoperable door may not limit containment leak rates within the assumptions
of the DBA analysis. However, the probability of an event requiring the inoperable air lock door to limit containment
leakage occurring during this time period is sufficiently low and the overall margin of safety would not be decreased
by a significant amount. The proposed increase in allowable door seal leakage will not affect the overall ability
of the containment air locks to restrict the release of fission products to the environment. The overall air lock leakage
limit of less than or equal to .05 L

a

 remain unchanged. The amount of leakage which the air lock(s) are permitted to contribute to the combined containment
leakage limit of 0.60 L

a

 remain unchanged. Therefore, the margin of safety due to increasing the door seal leakage limit remains unchanged.


Therefore, this proposed change does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. 


The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

Georgia





Date of amendment request: 

March 31, 1994.



Description of amendment request: 

The proposed amendments would change Technical Specification 3/4.7.1.1 and its Bases regarding maximum allowed
reactor thermal power operation with inoperable main steam safety valves.



Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:

 As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:

1. The proposed changes do not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated. The new power range neutron flux high setpoint values will ensure that the secondary side steam pressure
will remain below 110 percent of its design value following a loss of load/turbine trip (LOL/TT) when one or more main
steam safety valves (MSSVs) are declared inoperable. Therefore, this transient will remain classified as a Condition
II probability event (faults of moderate frequency) per ANSI_N18.2, 1973 as discussed in Section 15.0.1 of the VEGP
Final Safety Analysis Report (FSAR). Accordingly, since the new power range setpoints will maintain the capability
of the MSSVs to perform their pressure relief function associated with a LOL/TT event, there will be no effect on the
probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.

2. The proposed changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated. The proposed changes do not involve any change to the configuration or method of operation of any plant
equipment, and no new failure modes have been defined for any plant system or component. The new power range neutron
flux high setpoints will maintain the capability of the MSSVs to perform their pressure relief function to ensure
the secondary side steam design pressure is not exceeded following a LOL/TT. Therefore, since the function of the
MSSVs is unaffected by the proposed changes, the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident
previously evaluated is not created.

3. The proposed changes do not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The algorithm methodology used
to calculate the new power range neutron flux high setpoints is conservative and bounding since it is based on a number
of inoperable MSSVs per loop; i.e., if only one MSSV in one loop is out of service, the applicable power range setpoint
would be the same as if one MSSV in each loop were out of service. Another conservatism with the algorithm methodology
is with the assumed minimum total steam flow rate capability of the operable MSSVs. The assumption is that if one or
more MSSVs are inoperable per loop, the inoperable MSSVs are the largest capacity MSSVs, regardless of which capacity
MSSVs are actually inoperable. Therefore, since the power range setpoints calculated for the proposed changes using
the algorithm methodology are more conservative and ensure the secondary side steam design pressure is not exceeded
following a LOL/TT, there will not be a significant reduction in a margin of safety.

The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

Description of amendment request: 

The proposed amendments would relocate the heat flux hot channel factor penalty of 2 percent in Specification 4.2.2.2.f
to the cycle-specific Core Operating Limits Report to allow burnup-dependent values of the penalty in excess of 2
percent. The licensee also proposes to revise the reference in Specification 6.8.1.6 to the Westinghouse F

Q

(Z) surveillance methodology in order to reflect Revision 1 of WCAP-10216-P, ``Relaxation of Constant
Axial Offset Control_F

Q

 Surveillance Technical Specification,'' approved by the NRC on November 26, 1993.



Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:

 As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:

1. Does the change involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated?

The proposed change involves only the manner in which the penalty factors for F

Q

(Z) would be specified (i. e., a burnup-dependent factor specified in the Core Operating Limits Report (COLR) versus
a constant factor specified in the TS [Technical Specification]). This is simply used to account for the fact that
F

Q

(Z) may increase between surveillance intervals. These penalty factors are not assumed in any of the initiating events
for the accident analyses. Therefore, the proposed change will have no effect on the probability of any accidents
previously evaluated. The penalty factors specified in the COLR will be calculated using NRC-approved methodology
and will therefore continue to provide an equivalent level of protection as the existing TS requirement. Therefore,
the proposed change will not affect the consequences of any accident previously evaluated.

2. Does the change create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated?

The proposed change does not involve a physical alteration to the plant (no new or different kind of equipment will
be installed) or alter the manner in which the plant would be operated. Thus, this change does not create the possibility
of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.

3. Does this change involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety?

The proposed change will continue to ensure that potential increases in F

Q

(Z) over a surveillance interval will be properly accounted for. The penalty factors will be calculated using NRC-approved
methodology. Therefore the proposed change will not involve a reduction in margin of safety.

The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

GPU Nuclear Corporation, et al., Docket No. 50-219, Oyster Creek Nuclear Generating Station, Ocean County,
New Jersey





Date of amendment request: 

June 22, 1994.



Description of amendment request: 

The proposed amendment changes Technical Specification Sections 1.6, 3.2.A, 3.9.F.5, and 4.2.A which specify the
Shutdown Margin (SDM) requirements that ensure the reactor can be made subcritical and can be maintained sufficiently
subcritical to preclude inadvertent criticality in any core condition. The amendment also proposes a new definition,
Shutdown Margin, Section 1.45. The proposed changes address the requirements for SDM demonstration and provide
clarification for actions if SDM is not met.

The amendment also proposes administrative changes to Sections 1.7 and 3.2.B.2 (b). The definition, COLD SHUTDOWN
CONDITION, was simplified by stating the reactor is in the SHUTDOWN CONDITION which eliminates the need of repeating
the requirements for this condition. The note which permitted unlimited reactor startups without the Rod Worth Minimizer
during Cycle 11 is no longer applicable. The note and its reference are deleted from the new page 3.2-2. Starting
with page 3.2-2 in Section 3.2, the pages were renumbered and repaginated to accommodate the changes in text.



Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:

GPU Nuclear has determined that operation of the Oyster Creek Nuclear Generating Station in accordance with the proposed
Technical Specifications does not involve a significant hazard. The changes do not:

1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or the consequence of an accident previously evaluated.

The proposed SDM Limits are more restrictive and provide adequate shutdown margin for various modes of reactor operation.
Since the new SDM limits do not modify any initial conditions for the accidents previously evaluated in the SAR [Safety
Analysis Report], the proposed changes do not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences
of these accidents.

2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated.

The proposed TS changes do not modify the function of any structure, system or component. The new Shutdown Margin requirements
will still meet the basic criterion that the core in its maximum reactivity condition be subcritical with the control
rod of highest worth fully withdrawn and all operable rods fully inserted. Based on these facts, the proposed TS changes
do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated.

3. Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.

The proposed changes do not reduce the margin of safety, because the new SDM limits where the highest worth control
rod is determined analytically (0.38% delta k) or by measurement (0.28% delta k) are more restrictive than the current
Oyster Creek limit (0.25% delta k).

The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

Texas




Date of amendment request: 

June 6, 1994. 


Description of amendment request: 

The licensee proposes to modify the South Texas Project, Units 1 and 2, Technical Specification 3/4.8.1.1, ``A.C.
Sources,'' to revise the action statements and surveillance requirements for testing of the standby diesel generators
(SDGs). The proposed amendment would eliminate excessive and unnecessary testing of the SDGs consistent with the

Operation.'' This request replaces a request for amendment dated November 23, 1993, which was noticed on January
5, 1994 (59 FR 621). This revised amendment request includes elimination of additional identified unnecessary testing
discovered since the original submittal. The changes include: (1) eliminating the requirement to demonstrate the
operability of an operable SDG whenever an offsite AC power source is determined to be inoperable, or whenever a support
system or an independently testable component of another SDG is inoperable, (2) eliminating the requirement to load
the diesel in 10 minutes during testing, (3) replacing the minimum required loading for testing with a load band, (4)
relocating some surveillance requirements to the Diesel Fuel Oil Testing Program, and (5) eliminating unnecessary
loss of offsite power tests. 


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below: 
1. The proposed change does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated. 
The Standby Diesel Generators do not initiate any accidents, therefore these changes do not increase the probability
or [of] an accident previously evaluated. The proposed changes will permit the elimination of the unnecessary mechanical
stress and wear on the diesel engine and generator while ensuring that the diesel generators will perform their designed
function. The elimination of this mechanical stress and wear will improve the reliability and availability of the
Standby Diesel Generators which will have a positive effect on the ability of the diesel generators to perform their
design function. Therefore, the consequences of an accident previously evaluated are not increased. The proposed
changes are consistent with NUREG-1366, NUREG-1431, Generic Letter 93-05, and Generic Letter
84-15. 
2. The proposed change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated.

The elimination of these unnecessary tests does not affect the design bases of the SDGs, or any of the accident evaluations
involving the SDGs. The SDGs are designed to provide electrical power to the equipment important for safety during
all modes and plant conditions following a loss of offsite power. The test schedule established in accordance with
GL 84-15 assures that operable SDGs are capable of performing their intended safety function. The proposed
changes to the surveillance requirements are consistent with NUREG-1431, NUREG-1366, Generic Letter
93-05, industry operating experience, and South Texas Project operating experience. These changes are intended
to improve plant safety, decrease equipment degradation, and remove unnecessary burden on personnel resources
by reducing the amount of testing that the Technical Specification requires during power operation. Relocating
the diesel fuel oil testing requirement to the STP Fuel Oil Monitoring Program outside of the Technical Specifications
is an administrative change consistent with NUREG-1431 and consequently has no effect on accident probability,
consequences, or margin. Therefore, this change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident
from any previously evaluated. 
3. The proposed change does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. 
The proposed changes extend testing frequency and eliminate unnecessary mechanical stress and wear on the diesel
generator in an effort to improve plant reliability and safety. These changes are consistent with NUREG-1431,
NUREG-1366, industry operating experience, and STP operating experience and do not adversely affect the design
bases, accident analysis, reliability or capability of the SDGs to perform their intended safety function. Relocating
the diesel fuel oil testing requirements to the STP Fuel Oil Monitoring Program outside of the Technical Specifications
is an administrative change consistent with NUREG-1431 and consequently has no effect on accident probability,
consequences, or margin. Therefore the proposed changes do not involve any reduction in a margin to safety. 
The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the standards of 10 CFR
50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the request for amendments involve no
significant hazards consideration.

Date of amendment request: 

June 18, 1993 as supplemented on December 17, 1993 and May 5, 1994. 


Description of amendment request: 

The proposed amendment would revise the Technical Specifications (TS) by clarifying TS wording for the Low Pressure
Coolant Injection (LPCI) and Containment Spray modes of the Residual Heat Removal (RHR) system to assure consistency
with requirements of the DAEC Updated Final Safety Analysis Report. 


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below: 
(1) The probability or consequences of a previously-analyzed accident will not be increased by these proposed changes
to the LPCI and Containment Spray LCOs and BASES because they merely clarify existing TS requirements and are consistent
with the DAEC UFSAR accident analysis. The addition of the footnote clarifying LPCI OPERABILITY during RHR system
operation in the Shutdown Cooling mode is consistent with the requirements in the NRC Standard TS (NUREG-1433).
No changes in either system design or operating strategies will be made as a result of these changes, thus no opportunity
exists to increase the probability or consequences of a previously-analyzed accident. 

(2) The possibility of a new or different kind of accident from those previously analyzed will not be created by these
changes to the LPCI and Containment Spray LCOs and BASES because they merely clarify existing requirements. The addition
of the footnote clarifying LPCI OPERABILITY during RHR system operation in the Shutdown Cooling mode is consistent
with the requirements in the NRC Standard TS (NUREG-1433). No changes in either system design or operating strategies
will be made as a result of these changes, thus no possibility exists to introduce a new or different kind of accident.

Niagara Mohawk Power Corporation, Docket No. 50-410, Nine Mile Point Nuclear Station, Unit 2, Oswego County,
New York 




Date of amendment request: 

July 1, 1994. 


Description of amendment request: 

The proposed amendment would revise the drawdown time testing requirement of Technical Specification (TS) 4.6.5.1.c.1
and the secondary containment inleakage testing requirement of TS 4.6.5.1.c.2. These revisions would support a
revised design basis radiological analysis which would support an increase in secondary containment drawdown time
from 6 to 60 minutes by taking credit for fission product scrubbing and retention in the suppression pool. The current
design basis radiological analysis does not take credit for the pressure suppression pool as a fission product cleanup
system as permitted in NUREG-0800, Section 6.5.5, ``Pressure Suppression Pool as a Fission Product Cleanup
System.'' The proposed amendment would also take credit for additional mixing of primary containment and engineered
safety feature systems leakage with 50 percent of the secondary containment free air volume prior to the release of
radioactivity to the environment. In the revised analysis, mixing is assumed to occur at the onset of a Design Basis
Loss-of-Coolant Accident as the primary containment and the engineered safety feature systems leak into secondary
containment. The current analysis takes credit for mixing within secondary containment only after achieving a ^0.25
inch water gauge (WG) pressure in secondary containment with respect to the outside surrounding atmosphere. The
licensee's radiological evaluation for this accident, which reflects these proposed changes and an assumed drawdown
time of 60 minutes, has determined that the radiological doses remain below 10 CFR Part 100 guidelines values and General
Design Criterion 19 criteria. The revised radiological doses, as calculated by the licensee, are lower than the doses
currently presented in the Updated Safety Analysis Report (USAR). 


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below: 
The operation of the Nine Mile Point Unit 2, in accordance with the proposed amendment, will not involve a significant
increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. 

Secondary containment and the SGTS [Standby Gas Treatment System] are not initiators or precursors to an accident.
Secondary containment provides a pressure boundary, with limited inleakage, for the purpose of establishing a negative
pressure to prevent a ground level unfiltered release of radioactivity. SGTS responds to accidents involving a release
of radioactivity to the secondary containment by establishing and maintaining a negative pressure inside secondary
containment and by providing an elevated filtered release. Therefore, changes to SECONDARY CONTAINMENT INTEGRITY
surveillances cannot affect the probability of a previously evaluated accident. 
The suppression pool and secondary containment are largely passive in nature, and the active components are suitably
redundant. Therefore, their fission product attenuation functions can be accomplished assuming a single failure.

Currently, using an assumed drawdown time of 6 minutes, the radiological doses for a DBA-LOCA [Design Bases
Accident_Loss-of-Coolant Accident] are below the guidelines of 10 CFR Part 100 and GDC [General Design Criterion]
19 criteria. The calculated doses, considering the pressure suppression pool as a fission product cleanup system,
additional mixing within secondary containment and an assumed secondary containment drawdown time of 60 minutes,
are lower than the previously calculated doses. The new doses are below 10 CFR Part 100 guideline values and GDC 19 criteria.
The revised radiological analysis follows the source term assumptions of RG [Regulatory Guide] 1.3, with the exception
of regulatory position C.1.f as permitted by SRP [Standard Review Plan] Section 6.5.5, and continues to provide a
conservative representation of the timing and the composition of the release of radioactivity from secondary containment
during a DBA-LOCA. 

The Technical Specification SRs [Surveillance Requirements] will ensure a continued state of readiness for the
SGTS, the secondary containment, the suppression pool and the suppression chamber/drywell vacuum breakers. Therefore,
the assumptions used in the dose assessment will continue to bound the actual bypass of the suppression pool and the
mixing in secondary containment during a DBA-LOCA. The proposed changes to the surveillances provide assurance
that the performance of the SGTS and secondary containment supports the radiological analysis. Accordingly, as
shown in Table 1, page 14 of 20, [of the July 1, 1994, amendment request] operation with the SGTS and the proposed change
to the surveillances for secondary containment will not significantly increase the consequences of an accident
previously evaluated. 
The operation of Nine Mile Point Unit 2, in accordance with the proposed amendment, will not create the possibility
of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. 

The proposed change to the surveillances ensures that the SGTS and secondary containment will be available to respond
to an accident such that the guidelines of 10 CFR Part 100 and the limits of GDC 19 are not exceeded. The proposed change
to the surveillances reflect consideration of the pressure suppression pool as a fission product cleanup system
and credit for additional mixing in secondary containment. The suppression pool will continue to perform its safety
functions as a pressure suppression pool and as a source of water to support emergency core cooling system operation
during a DBA-LOCA. In addition, secondary containment will continue to perform its safety function of controlling
and minimizing radioactive leakage to the outside atmosphere during a DBA-LOCA. Safety related equipment
will continue to be OPERABLE in the radioactive environment of secondary containment to mitigate the consequences
of a DBA-LOCA. Accordingly, the proposed Technical Specification change will not create the possibility of
a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. 
The operation of Nine Mile Point Unit 2, in accordance with proposed amendment, will not involve a significant reduction
in a margin of safety. 

The SGTS exhausts the secondary containment atmosphere to the environment through the filtration system. To verify
the SGTS has not degraded, SR 4.6.5.1.c.1 verifies that each SGTS subsystem will establish and maintain a pressure
in the secondary containment that is equal to or more negative than ^0.25 inch WG within the required time limit. To
verify secondary containment is intact, SR 4.6.5.1.c.2 demonstrates that one SGTS subsystem can maintain a pressure
which is equal to or more negative than ^0.25 inch WG for 1 hour at a flow rate less than or equal to the maximum allowed
inleakage. The 1 hour test period allows secondary containment to be in thermal equilibrium at steady state conditions.
Furthermore, as an interim measure, NMPC [Niagara Mohawk Power Corporation] implemented certain compensatory
measures through administrative controls to ensure that the radiological consequences of a DBA-LOCA would
remain within regulatory criteria. Together, these tests and the compensatory measures assure SGTS performance
and secondary containment boundary integrity. 
The proposed change to these surveillances incorporate changes to the design basis, i.e., credit for fission product
scrubbing and retention by the suppression pool and credit for additional mixing within secondary containment.
The new inleakage is 2670 cfm which is loss [less] than one change of the secondary containment free air volume per day.
The new drawdown time limit reflects consideration of the proposed change in the secondary containment inleakage
limit. Due to the effects of service water temperature, inside and outside temperature, flow measurement inaccuracies
and actual test pressures, meeting the current SRs does not by itself assure adequate SGTS performance. Therefore,
the surveillances' results are adjusted to account for actual test conditions. Compliance with the proposed surveillances
assures that the SGTS can achieve and maintain ^0.25 inch WG in less than 60 minutes following a postulated DBA-LOCA.
Achieving ^0.25 inch WG within 60 minutes assures that radiological doses will remain below regulatory limits (see
Table 1 [of the July 1, 1994, amendment request]). Therefore, the proposed surveillances, together with the proposed
adjustments, provide adequate assurance of SGTS performance and secondary containment boundary integrity. Accordingly,
the proposed Technical Specification change will not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. 
Therefore, as determined by the analysis above, this proposed amendment involves no significant hazards consideration.

The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant
hazards consideration.

Northern States Power Company, Docket No. 50-263, Monticello Nuclear Generating Plant, Wright County, Minnesota





Date of amendment request: 

June 8, 1994. 


Description of amendment request: 

The proposed amendment would revise sections 3.7/4.7, which pertain to the Standby Gas Treatment System (SGTS) and
Secondary Containment. The proposed amendment would revise the surveillance requirements for both SGTS and secondary
containment and revise the performance requirements for the SGTS filters and process stream electric heaters. 


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below: 
1. The proposed amendment will not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated. 
The function of the SGTS and secondary containment is to mitigate the consequences of a loss of coolant accident and
fuel handling accidents. The proposed changes maintain or improve this capability. Therefore, this amendment will
not cause a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated for the Monticello
plant. 
2. The proposed amendment will not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
analyzed. 
The proposed changes to Technical Specifications for the standby gas treatment system and secondary containment
do not alter the function of the systems or its interrelationships with other systems. The proposed changes provide
requirements to ensure the systems are capable of performing the required functions or that actions are taken to minimize
the potential for its function being required consistent with regulatory guidance; therefore, this amendment will
not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously analyzed. 
3. The proposed amendment will not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety. 
Improvements in the margin of safety are provided via the permanent elimination of a potential single failure which
could adversely affect both standby gas treatment systems by deleting the reference to the standby gas system room
heaters in the technical specification bases and providing appropriate surveillance requirements to assure system
operability. A review of the performance history of the Standby Gas Treatment System and licensing basis assumptions
has determined that the proposed changes do not adversely affect plant safety. Changes to the SGTS performance requirements
provide greater assurance of SGTS operability. The proposed change for the completion time to place the plant in a
cold shutdown condition if limiting conditions for operation can not be satisfied is consistent with the time frame
specified in the current specification and is consistent with Standard Technical Specifications. The proposed
amendment will not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety. 
The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

Date of amendment request: 

February 12, 1993, as supplemented by letters dated August 20, 1993 and June 6, 1994. 


Description of amendment request: 

This amendment request was previously noticed in the 

Federal Register

 on April 14, 1993 (58 FR 19485). The June 6, 1994, submittal supplements the February 12, 1993, application for amendment,
and includes and incorporates the NRC staff comments. The proposed amendment would modify the Technical Specifications
(TS) to implement the reactor coolant system (RCS) leak before break (LBB) methodology detection criteria, in accordance
with the recommendations listed in Generic Letter (GL) 84-04. 


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below: 
(1) Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. 
The proposed changes will require additional leak detection instruments be operable to close Unresolved Safety
Issue A-2, ``Asymmetrical Blowdown Loads on Reactor Primary Coolant System,'' for the Fort Calhoun Station.
Requiring additional instruments to be operable does not increase the probability or consequences of an accident
since the safety function of the instruments is not being altered. 
The proposed changes require at least two different types of RCS leak detection instruments, of diverse monitoring
principles, be operable or corrective actions be taken to restore the instrumentation to operable status. Currently
the Technical Specifications require only one RCS leak detection instrument to be operable. 
The probability of leaks occurring due to thermal or normal fatigue is not affected as indicated in the fracture mechanics
analysis referenced in Generic Letter 84-04. No changes are proposed to primary RCS piping systems or supports
as a result of the proposed revision. The proposed changes will ensure that a potential significant failure does not
go undetected within the Regulatory Guide 1.45 criteria as noted in Generic Letter 84-04. 
The Loss of Coolant Accident (LOCA) analysis will not be impacted by the proposed change. The results of the current
Fort Calhoun LOCA analyses cited in Section 14.15 of the Updated Safety Analysis Report (USAR) will not be impacted
as a result of these changes. 
(2) Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously analyzed. 
It has been determined that a new or different kind of accident will not be created due to the proposed changes since
no new or different modes of operation are created by this change. The existing operating procedures were established
to support an enhanced RCS leak detection program. Operation of RCS leak detection instruments will not differ from
existing conditions. 
(3) Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. 
The margin of safety as defined in the basis for the Technical Specifications is not changed or reduced by this proposed
change. Defining adequate RCS LBB monitoring is required to meet recommendations provided in Generic Letter 84-04.

The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are 
satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards
consideration.

Philadelphia Electric Company, Docket No. 50-352, Limerick Generating Station, Unit 1, Montgomery County,
Pennsylvania 




Date of amendment request: 

June 6, 1994.


Description of amendment request: 

The amendment would remove the controls for a remote shutdown system control valve and delete the isolation signal
for certain primary containment isolation valves from TS Tables 3.3.7.4-1 and 3.6.3-1 respectively,
as a result of eliminating the steam condensing mode of the Redidual Heat Removal system. 


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below: 
1. The proposed Technical Specifications (TS) changes do not involve a significant increase in the probability or
consequences of an accident previously evaluated. 
The RHR system steam condensing mode is a non-safety related function of the RHR system and has been eliminated at Limerick
Generating Station, Unit 1. These proposed changes will not affect any components required to perform the safety-related
function of the RHR system. 
The ability of the RHR system to respond to an accident will not be degraded by the proposed changes. Valve HV-51-1F011A
is locked closed with the electrical power removed. The valve's handswitch which is part of the remote shutdown panel
(RSP) controls, does not perform any function and will be physically removed from the RSP. The deletion of the isolation
signal for valves HV-C-51-1F103A and HV-C-51-1F104B will not affect the ability
of these valves to function as primary containment isolation valves (PCIVs), since they are locked closed already
in their safety-related position, providing containment isolation as manual PCIVs. Therefore, the proposed TS
changes do not involve an increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. 
2. The proposed TS changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated. 
No new failure modes of RHR system are created by the proposed TS changes. All valves associated with the proposed changes
are dedicated specifically for the RHR system steam condensing mode, and will not impact the operation of any components
or piping required for other modes of operation of the RHR system. These valves are locked-closed in their safety-related
position with the electrical power removed. Therefore, the proposed TS changes do not create the possibility of a
new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated. 
3. The proposed TS changes do not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. 
The steam condensing mode is a non-safety related function of the RHR system and, therefore, is not addressed in the
TS. The controls for remote shutdown system control valve HV-51-1F011A are not being used. Presently,
the valve is locked closed with the electrical power removed and the valve's handswitch will be removed from the RSP,
since it does not perform any function. The proposed changes will not impact the safe operation of LGS Unit 1. The deletion
of the isolation signal for valves HV-C-51-1F103A and HV-C-51-1F104B will not affect
the ability of these valves to function as primary containment isolation valves (PCIVs), since they are locked closed
already in their safety-related position. Therefore, the proposed TS changes do not involve a reduction in a margin
of safety. 
The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

Date of amendment request: 

June 10, 1994. 


Description of amendment request: 

The amendment involves a one-time change affecting the Allowed Outage Time (AOT) for the Emergency Service Water
(ESW) System, Residual Heat Removal Service Water (RHRSW) System, Suppression Pool Cooling, Suppression Pool Spray,
and Low Pressure Coolant Injection modes of the Residual Heat Removal System, and Core Spray System to be extended
from 3 and 7 days to 14 days during the Limerick Generating Station (LGS), Unit 2 third refueling outage scheduled to
begin in January 1995. This proposed extended AOT would allow adequate time to install isolation valves and cross-ties
on the ESW and RHRSW Systems to facilitate future inspections or maintenance. 



Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below: 

1. The proposed Technical Specifications changes do not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences
of an accident previously evaluated. 

The proposed one-time TS changes will not increase the probability of an accident since it will only extend the time
period that the `B' ESW and RHRSW loops and the affected equipment can be out-of-service. The extension of the time
duration that certain equipment is out-of-service has no direct physical impact on the plant. The proposed inoperable
systems are normally in a standby mode while the unit is in OPCON 1 or 2 and are not directly supporting plant operation.
Therefore, they can have no impact on the plant that would make an accident more likely to occur due to their inoperability.


During transients or events which require these systems to be operating, there is sufficient capacity in the operable
loops to support plant operation or shutdown, in-so-much that failures that are accident initiators will not occur
more frequently than previously postulated. 

In addition, the consequences of an accident previously evaluated in the SAR will not be increased. With the `B' loops
of ESW and RHRSW inoperable, a known quantity of equipment is either inoperable or the equipment is not fully capable
of fulfilling its design function under all design conditions due to certain support systems not being operable.
Based on the support functions of the ESW and RHRSW systems, a review of the plant was performed to determine the impacts
that the inoperable ESW and RHRSW `B' loops would have on other systems. The impacts were identified for each system,
as discussed in the preceding Safety Assessment, and it was determined whether there were any adverse [effects] on
the systems. It was then determined how the adverse [effects] would impact each system's design basis and overall
plant safety. The consequences of any postulated accidents occurring on Unit 1 during this AOT extension was found
to be bounded by the previous analyses as described in the SAR. 

The existing AOTs limit the amount of time that the plant can operate with certain equipment inoperable, where single
failure criteria is still met. The minimum equipment required to mitigate the consequences of an accident and/or
safely shutdown the plant will be operable or the plant will be shutdown. Therefore, by extending certain AOTs and
extending the assumptions concerning the combinations of events and single failures for the longer duration of each
extended AOT, we conclude, based on the evaluations above, that at least the minimum equipment required to mitigate
the consequences of an accident and/or safely shutdown the plant will still be operable during the extended AOT. Therefore,
the consequences of an accident previously evaluated in the SAR will not be increased. 

Therefore, these proposed one-time TS changes will not result in a significant increase in the probability or consequences
of an accident previously evaluated. 

2. The proposed TS changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated. 

The proposed one-time TS changes will not create the possibility of a different type of accident since it will only
extend the time period that the `B' ESW and RHRSW loops and the affected equipment can be out-of-service. The extension
of the time duration that certain equipment is out-of-service has no direct physical impact on the plant and does not
create any new accident initiators. The systems involved are either accident mitigation systems, safe shutdown
systems or systems that support plant operation. All of the possible impacts that the inoperable equipment may have
on its supported systems were previously analyzed in the SAR and are the basis for the present TS ACTION statements
and AOTs. The impact of inoperable support systems for a given time duration was previously evaluated and any accident
initiators created by the inoperable systems was evaluated. The lengthening of the time duration does not create
any additional accident initiators for the plant. 

Therefore, the proposed one-time TS changes will not create the possibility of a new or different type of accident
from any accident previously evaluated. 

3. The proposed TS changes do not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. 

The ESW and RHRSW systems and their supported systems are designed with sufficient independence and redundancy such
that the removal from service of a component/subsystem will not prevent the systems from performing their required
safety functions. Since removal of an ESW and a RHRSW loop from service with one unit in operation and the other unit
in a refueling outage is allowed by the current Technical Specifications, then the concern is the reduced margin of
safety incurred by extending the affected AOTs. 

The present ESW and RHRSW AOT limits were set to ensure that sufficient safety-related equipment is available for
response to all accident conditions and that sufficient decay heat removal capability is available for a LOCA/LOOP
on one unit and simultaneous safe shutdown of the other unit. A slight reduction in the margin of safety is incurred
during the proposed extended AOT due to the increased risk that an event could occur in a fourteen day period versus
a three or seven day period. This increased risk is judged to be minimal due to the low probability of an event occurring
during the extended AOT and based on the following discussion of minimum ECCS/decay heat removal requirements. 

The reduction in the margin of safety is not significant since the remaining operable ECCS equipment is adequate to
mitigate the consequences of any accident. This conclusion is based on the information contained in documents NEDO-24708A
and NEDC-30936-A. These documents described the minimum requirements to successfully terminate a transient
or LOCA initiating event (with scram), assuming multiple failures with realistic conditions and were used to justify
certain TS AOTs per UFSAR sections 6.3.1.1.2.o and 6.3.3.1. The minimum requirements for short term response to an
accident would be either one LPCI pump or one Core Spray loop in conjunction with ADS, which would be adequate to re-flood
the vessel and maintain core cooling sufficient to preclude fuel damage. For long term response, the minimum requirements
would be one loop of RHR for decay heat removal, along with another low pressure ECCS loop. These minimum requirements
will be met since implementation of the proposed TS changes will require the operability of HPCI, ADS, two LPCI subsystems
(or one LPCI subsystem and one RHR subsystem during decay heat removal) and one Core Spray subsystem be maintained
during the 14 day period.

In addition, measures will be taken prior to or during the proposed extended AOT for those fire regions that rely on
one or more safe shutdown methods which would all be unable to safely shutdown the plant with inoperable loops of the
ESW and RHRSW systems or the inoperable systems that ESW or RHRSW support. These measures will offset the increased
risk of a fire event occurring in the vulnerable areas, during the fourteen day versus three day AOT period. Therefore,
the proposed extended AOT does not adversely affect the approved level of fire protection as described in UFSAR Appendix
9A (Fire Protection Evaluation Report). 
A special procedure will be written to administratively control the requirement to maintain the operability of specified
components and implementation of any appropriate compensatory measures which are deemed necessary during the proposed
AOT. In addition, operations personnel are fully qualified by normal periodic training to respond to and mitigate
a Design Basis Accident, including the actions needed to ensure decay heat removal while LGS Unit 1 and Unit 2 are in
the operational configurations described within this submittal. Accordingly, procedures are already in place
that cover safe plant shutdown and decay heat removal for situations applicable to those in the proposed AOTs. 
A Probabilistic Safety Assessment (PSA) Study was performed for an ESW and RHRSW loop being out-of-service for 14
days on an operating unit. This analysis includes EDG D12 being aligned to `A' ESW and HPCI and RCIC not requiring room
cooling. No other deviations from the bounding assumptions used in the base PSA model were made. The Core Damage Frequency
(CDF) increased by 2.7x10

-6

, from 5.11x10

-6

/reactor-year to 7.8x10

-6

 /reactor-year. In absolute terms, this is not a significant increase in risk. In addition, the modifications to be
installed during this proposed extended AOT will allow for future maintenance and inspections to be performed on
the ESW and RHRSW loops without removing an entire loop from service, which will reduce risk in the future. For example,
if the ESW loop unavailability, due to testing or maintenance, is reduced by half, the CDF will decrease by more than
four percent. It will also minimize the potential need for future AOT extensions on these systems. 
Therefore, the implementation of the proposed one-time TS changes will not involve a significant reduction in the
margin of safety. 
The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

Description of amendment request: 

The licensee is proposing to revise the Technical Specifications (TS) requirements governing the minimum low pressure
cooling availability when irradiated fuel is in the reactor vessel and the reactor is in the cold condition. Specifically,
the proposed changes are: (1) Revise the TS section titles in the Table of Contents to agree with the TS section titles
in the body of the TS. (2) Revise TS Section 3.5.A.1 to provide proper reference to the revised TS Section 3.5.F. (3)
Revise TS Section 3.5.A.3 to provide proper reference to the revised TS Section 3.5.F. (4) Revise TS Section 3.5.B.1
to delete the reference to TS Section 3.5.F.3. (5) Revise TS Section 3.5.F to require the limiting condition for operation
(LCO) governing minimum low pressure cooling availability when irradiated fuel is in the reactor vessel and the reactor
is in the cold condition to be identical with the corresponding LCO in NUREG-1433, ``Standard Technical Specifications
General Electric Plants, BWR/4.'' (6) Revise TS Section 4.5.F to require the surveillance requirements (SR) governing
minimum low pressure cooling availability when irradiated fuel is in the reactor vessel and the reactor is in the cold
condition to be identical with the corresponding SR in NUREG-1433. (7) Revise TS BASES 3.5.A to delete the reference
to the core spray subsystem as also providing a source for flooding of the core in case of accidental draining because
the information is being added to TS BASES 3.5.F. (8) Revise TS BASES 3.5.F to be consistent with the corresponding
TS BASES in NUREG-1433. (9) Revise TS BASES 4.5 to be consistent with the corresponding TS BASES in NUREG-1433.
(10) Revise TS Section 3.7.A.1 to provide proper reference to the revised TS Section 3.5.F. 


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below: 
1. The proposed change does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated. 
Proposed changes 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9 and 10 are administrative in nature and involve no technical changes to the TS. These
proposed changes do not impact initiators of analyzed events or the assumed mitigation of accidents or transients
events. Therefore, these changes do not involve an increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated. 
Proposed changes 5 and 6 will not increase the probability of initiating an analyzed event or alter assumptions relative
to mitigation of an accident or transient event. These changes will not alter the operation of process variables or
systems, structures, or components (SSC) as described in the safety analyses. These changes do not involve any physical
changes to plant SSC. TS requirements that govern Operability or routine testing and verification of plant components
and variables are not assumed to be initiators of any analyzed event. The proposed changes will not alter the operation
of equipment assumed to be available for the mitigation of accidents or transients by the plant safety analysis or
licensing basis. The proposed changes establish or maintain adequate assurance that components are operable when
necessary for the prevention or mitigation of accidents or transients and that plant variables are maintained within
limits necessary to satisfy the assumptions for initial conditions in the safety analysis. These changes have been
confirmed to ensure no previously evaluated accident has been adversely affected. These changes will not allow continuous
plant operation with plant conditions during a unit outage such that a single failure will result in a loss of any safety
function. Therefore, the changes will not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an
accident previously evaluated. 
2. The proposed change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated. 
The proposed changes do not involve a physical alteration of the plant (no new or different type of equipment will be
installed or removed) and will not alter the method used by any system to perform its design function. The proposed
changes do not allow plant operation in any mode that is not already evaluated. Therefore, these changes will not create
the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. 
3. The proposed changes do not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. 
Proposed changes 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9 and 10 are administrative in nature and will not involve any technical changes. These
proposed changes will not reduce a margin of safety because they have no impact on any safety analysis assumptions.
Because these changes are administrative in nature, no question of safety is involved. Therefore, these changes
do not reduce the margin of safety. 
Proposed changes 5 and 6 add some new requirements and make some existing requirements more restrictive. These changes
will not impact any safety analysis assumptions. Adding new requirements and making existing ones more restrictive
either increases or does not affect the margin of safety. As such, no question of safety is involved. Therefore, these
changes will not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. 
Proposed changes 5 and 6 also make three less restrictive changes. The first change deletes the requirements for the
containment cooling system when the reactor is in the Cold Condition. The containment cooling system is necessary
to maintain primary containment Operable to mitigate the release of radioactive material following a DBA [design
basis accident].

However, primary containment is not required to be Operable with the reactor in the Cold Condition. As a result, the
containment cooling system is not needed to maintain the primary containment Operable with the reactor in the Cold
Condition. This change does not affect any safety limits, operating limits, or design assumptions. This [change]
provides the benefit of allowing maintenance to be performed on the containment cooling systems during a unit outage
to ensure their reliability during power operation. Therefore, this change does not involve a significant reduction
in a margin of safety. 

The current TS requirement that both core spray systems and the LPCI system be Operable during a refueling outage is
being relaxed by the second change to require one core spray subsystem and one LPCI subsystem or two core spray subsystems
to be Operable. This [change] does not adversely affect any accident or transient analyses because the change ensures
adequate vessel inventory makeup is available in the event of an inadvertent vessel draindown. The long term cooling
analysis following a design bases LOCA [loss of coolant accident] demonstrates only one low pressure ECCS [emergency
core cooling system] injection/spray subsystem is required, post LOCA, to maintain the peak cladding temperature
below the allowable limit. This change will not affect any safety limits, operating limits, or design assumptions.
This change provides the benefit of allowing maintenance to be performed on the low pressure ECCS subsystems not required
to be operable to ensure their reliability during plant operation. Therefore, this change does not involve a significant
reduction in a margin of safety. 

The final less restrictive change will allow low pressure injection/spray subsystems to be inoperable during a refueling
outage if the spent fuel storage gates are removed and the water level is at the required height over the top of the reactor
pressure vessel flange. This is acceptable because the water level requirement provides sufficient coolant inventory
to allow operator action to terminate any inventory loss prior to fuel uncovery in the event of an inadvertent draindown.
This change will not affect any safety limits, operating limits, or design assumptions. This change provides the
benefit of allowing maintenance to be performed on the low pressure ECCS subsystems to ensure their continued reliability
during plant operation. Therefore, this change does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. 

The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

Description of amendment request: 

The licensee proposed the following changes to its Technical Specifications (TS): (1) Revise TS 4.3.C.1 to require
that each control rod be scram time tested after each refueling outage or after a reactor shutdown that is greater than
120 days with reactor steam dome pressure greater than or equal to 800 psig prior to exceeding 40% of rated power. Scram
time testing is not required for control rods inserted per TS 3.3.B.1. (2) Replace TS 4.3.C.2 with the requirement
to perform scram time testing with the reactor steam dome pressure greater than or equal to 800 psig prior to exceeding
40% of rated power for only those control rods associated with the core cells affected by any fuel movement within the
reactor pressure vessel. (3) Add TS 4.3.C.3 to perform scram time testing for a representative sample of control rods
at least once per 120 days of power operation with the reactor steam dome pressure greater than or equal to 800 psig.
(4) Add TS 4.3.C.4 to perform scram time testing at any reactor steam dome pressure for individual control rods prior
to declaring them operable after work on the control rod or control rod drive system is performed that could affect
scram insertion time. (5) Revise TS Bases 3.3.C and 4.3.C to describe: the rational for performing scram time testing
with reactor pressure greater than or equal to 800 psig; the rationale for requiring control rods to be scram time tested
once per 120 days; what constitutes a representative sample of control rods; examples of work that could affect scram
times; and the rational and methods for performing scram time testing following work that could affect the scram insertion
times. (6) Add TS 4.3.C.5 to perform scram time testing with the reactor steam dome pressure greater than or equal to
800 psig prior to exceeding 40% of rated power after work on the control rod or control rod drive system that could affect
scram insertion time. (7) Revise TS 4.5.K.2 from performing scram time testing of 19 or more control rods on a rotation
basis to performing scram time testing of a representative sample of control rods. 



Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below: 

(1) The proposed change does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated. 

The proposed changes will not involve any physical changes to plant systems, structures, or components (SSC). These
proposed changes will not alter operation of process variables or SSC as described in the safety analysis. The proposed
changes establish or maintain adequate assurance that components are operable when necessary for the prevention
or mitigation of accidents or transients and that plant variables are maintained within limits necessary to satisfy
the assumptions for initial conditions in the safety analysis. In particular, proposed change 1 is acceptable based
on industry experience with control rod scram time testing coupled with the additional requirement in proposed change
4 that scram time testing of any control rod on which work was performed must be satisfactorily completed before that
control rod can be declared operable. The proposed changes will not allow continuous plant operation with plant conditions
such that a single failure will result in a loss of any safety function. Therefore, the changes will not involve a significant
increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. 

(2) The proposed change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated. 

The proposed changes do not alter the plant configuration (no new or different type of equipment will be installed
or removed) and will not alter the method used by any system to perform its design function. The proposed changes do
not allow plant operation in any mode that is not already evaluated. Therefore, these changes will not create the possibility
of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. 

(3) The proposed changes do not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. 

Following a refueling outage, control rod scram time testing for all control rods is currently required to be performed
during operational hydrostatic testing or during startup prior to synchronizing the main turbine generator. Any
control rods not tested during operational hydrostatic testing must be tested at greater than 30% power but less than
40% power. Proposed change 1 will require that scram time testing for all control rods be completed prior to exceeding
40% Reactor Power. This change is acceptable based on industry experience with control rod scram time testing coupled
with the additional requirement in proposed change 4 that scram time testing of any control rod on which work was performed
must be satisfactorily completed before that control rod can be declared operable. Proposed changes 2, 3, 4 and 6 add
some new requirements and make some existing requirements more restrictive. The margin of safety is not reduced by
more restrictive changes. If anything, the margin of safety may increase. Proposed change 5 revises the BASES to provide
consistency with the previously discussed SR [surveillance requirements] changes. Proposed change 7 is administrative
in nature and does not involve any technical changes. Proposed changes 5 and 7 will not reduce a margin of safety because
they have no impact on any safety analysis assumptions. Therefore, these changes will not involve a significant reduction
in a margin of safety. 

The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

Nuclear Generating Unit No. 3, Westchester County, New York 





Date of amendment request: 

June 29, 1994.



Description of amendment request: 

The proposed changes would alter the Plant Operating Review Committee's (PORC's) membership requirements and would
delegate a portion of PORC's procedure review responsibilities for nuclear safety related procedures and procedure
changes to the line organizations. Section 6.5, ``Review and Audit,'' of the Technical Specifications (TSs) would
be revised to modify the composition of the PORC and delete review and audit responsibilities for the Emergency and
Security Plans from the TSs. The review and audit responsibilities would be relocated to the respective Emergency
and Security Plans consistent with Generic Letter 93-07, ``Modification of the Technical Specification Administrative
Control Requirements for Emergency and Security Plans.'' The proposed changes would also revise Section 6.5 and
Section 6.8, ``Procedures,'' of the TSs to delegate a portion of the PORC's procedure review responsibilities for
nuclear safety related procedures to the line organizations. The PORC would continue to perform safety reviews associated
with procedures that are of safety significance. 



Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below: 

Consistent with the criteria of 10 CFR 50.92, the enclosed application is judged to involve no significant hazards
based on the following information: 

1. Does the proposed license amendment involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously analyzed? 

Response: The proposed changes do not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated since: (1) PORC will continue to review environmental impact and 10 CFR 50.59 safety evaluations
associated with procedures and procedure changes; (2) Only personnel knowledgeable in the affected functional
areas will review procedures and procedure changes; (3) Review and approval personnel (designated technical reviewers,
qualified safety reviewers and responsible procedure owners) will be identified in the appropriate administrative
procedures; (4) Designated technical reviewers shall meet or exceed the qualifications described in Section 4 of
ANSI N18.1-1971 [* * *] for applicable positions and are designated by the Department Managers;
5) The designated technical reviewers will be responsible for identifying whether additional cross disciplinary
reviews are required; (6) The qualified safety reviewers will be responsible for reviewing the procedure changes
from a safety perspective; (7) The responsible procedure owners are designated by the Resident Manager; and (8) The
responsible procedure owners will be responsible for verifying that procedure reviews are performed in accordance
with the administrative procedure governing the procedure review and approval process. 

The proposed changes (1) will add more detailed requirements regarding procedure review and approval to the Technical
Specifications which will strengthen the controls over the process, and (2) will free PORC from reviewing items that
are outside the charter of a ``safety review'' committee [* * *] [because non-safety significant
items can reduce the time that PORC members can spend on matters that are safety significant. The proposed Technical
Specification change establishes a highly structured review and approval program for procedures.] 

The proposed change to the PORC membership requirements would not significantly increase the probability or consequences
of an accident because it does not adversely affect the level of expertise applied to the PORC review function or its
effectiveness. The PORC quorum is currently composed of five members including up to two designated alternates and
a Chairman. [* * *] [This composition is not changed by the proposed amendment.] 

The miscellaneous administrative changes not related to the procedure review and approval process or the PORC membership
requirements cannot affect the probability or consequences of an accident because they do not affect plant operations[,]
[* * *] equipment[, or any safety-related activity.] 

2. Does the proposed license amendment create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident
previously evaluated? 



Response:

 [* * *] [No physical changes to the plant or changes in plant equipment operating procedures are being
proposed.] The changes are administrative and will not have any direct effect on equipment important to safety. Changing
the process by which procedures are reviewed and approved cannot in itself create the possibility of a new or different
kind of accident. Furthermore, a documented safety review, utilizing screening criteria, will be performed for
all nuclear safety related procedures and procedure changes. The proposed change establishes detailed controls
while allowing PORC to spend more time on safety significant issues. 

The proposed change to the PORC membership requirements would not create the possibility of a new or different kind
of accident from any previously evaluated since no physical alterations of plant configuration or changes to setpoints
or operating parameters are proposed. 

The miscellaneous administrative changes not related to the procedure review and approval or the PORC Membership
requirements cannot create the possibility of an accident because they do not affect plant operations[,] [* * *]
equipment [or any safety-related activity.]

3. Does the proposed amendment involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety? 


Response: 

The proposed amendment does not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety because a program controlled
by Administrative Procedures using designated technical reviewers approved by the Department Managers will be
in place to review new procedures and procedure changes. A 10 CFR 50.59 screening of each new procedure and permanent
procedure change will be performed by a qualified safety reviewer, and PORC will continue to review 10 CFR 50.59 Safety
and Environmental Impact Evaluations associated with procedures and procedure changes. Cross disciplinary reviews
will be conducted as appropriate. Thus, the margin of safety will be maintained by implementing the new procedure
review and approval process. 
The proposed change to the PORC membership requirements would not involve a significant reduction in the margin of
safety since the level and quality of PORC review will be maintained and there will not be an adverse change to the collective
educational background and work experience of PORC. [There will not be an adverse loss of PORC effectiveness as a result
of this change.] The PORC quorum is currently composed of five members including up to two designated alternates and
a Chairman. [* * *] [This composition is not changed by the proposed changes.] 
The miscellaneous administrative changes not related to the procedure review and approval process or PORC membership
program cannot reduce any margin of safety because they do not affect any safety related activity or equipment. These
changes increase the probability that the Technical Specifications are correctly interpreted by clarifying information.

The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant
hazards consideration.

Power Authority of the State of New York, Docket No. 50-333, James A. FitzPatrick Nuclear Power Plant, Oswego
County, New York




Date of amendment request: 

June 17, 1994.


Description of amendment request: 

The proposed changes would revise Section 6.5, ``Review and Audit,'' of the Technical Specifications (TSs) to modify
the composition of the Plant Operating Review Committee (PORC) and delete review and audit responsibilities for
the Emergency and Security Plans from the TSs. The review and audit responsibilities would be relocated to the respective
Emergency and Security Plans consistent with Generic Letter 93-07, ``Modification of the Technical Specification
Administrative Control Requirements for Emergency and Security Plans.'' The proposed changes would also revise
Section 6.5 and Section 6.8, ``Procedures,'' of the TSs to delegate a portion of the PORC's procedure review responsibilities
for nuclear safety related procedures to the line organizations. The PORC would continue to perform safety reviews
associated with procedures that are of safety significance. 


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below: 
Operation of the FitzPatrick plant in accordance with the proposed amendment would not involve a significant hazards
consideration as defined in 10 CFR 50.92, since the proposed changes would not: 
1. involve a significant increase in the probability of an accident or consequence previously evaluated. 
The proposed changes do not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated since: 1) PORC will continue to review environmental impact and 10 CFR 50.59 safety evaluations associated
with procedures and procedure changes; 2) Only personnel knowledgeable in the affected functional areas will review
procedures and procedure changes; 3) Review and approval personnel (designated technical reviewers, and responsible
procedure owners) will be identified in the appropriate administrative procedures. Designated technical reviewers
shall meet or exceed the qualifications described in section 4 of ANSI N18.1-1971 for applicable positions.
Designated technical reviewers are designated by the Department Managers. The responsible procedure owners are
designated by the Resident Manager; 4) The designated technical reviewers will be responsible for identifying whether
additional cross-disciplinary reviews are required; 5) The qualified safety reviewers will be responsible for
reviewing the procedure changes from a safety perspective; and 6) The responsible procedure owners will be responsible
for verifying that procedure reviews are performed in accordance with the administrative procedure governing the
procedure review and approval process. 
The proposed changes (1) will add more detailed requirements regarding procedure review and approval to the Technical
Specifications which will strengthen the controls over the process, and (2) will free PORC from reviewing items that
are outside the charter of a ``safety review'' committee because non-safety significant items can reduce the time
that PORC members can spend on matters that are safety significant. The proposed Technical Specification change
establishes a highly structured review and approval program for procedures. 
The proposed change to the PORC Membership requirements would not significantly increase the probability or consequences
of an accident because it does not adversely affect the level of expertise applied to the PORC review function. There
will not be an adverse loss of PORC effectiveness as a result of this change. The PORC quorum is currently composed of
five members including up to two designated alternates and a Chairman. This composition is not changed by the proposed
amendment. 
The miscellaneous administrative changes not related to the procedure review and approval process or the PORC Membership
requirements cannot affect the probability or consequences of an accident because they do not affect operations,
equipment, or any safety-related activity. 
2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from those previously evaluated. 
No physical changes to the plant or changes in plant equipment operating procedures are being proposed. The changes
are administrative and will not have any direct effect on equipment important to safety. Changing the process by which
procedures are reviewed and approved cannot in itself create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident.
Furthermore, a documented safety review, utilizing screening criteria, will be performed for all nuclear safety
related procedures and procedure changes. The proposed change establishes detailed controls while allowing PORC
to spend more time on safety significant issues. 
The proposed change to the PORC Membership requirements would not create the possibility of a new or different kind
of accident from any previously evaluated since no physical alterations of plant configuration or changes to setpoints
or operating parameters are proposed. 


The miscellaneous administrative changes not related to the procedure review and approval or the PORC Membership
requirements cannot create the possibility of an accident because they do not affect operations, equipment or any
safety-related activity. 
3. Involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety. 
The proposed amendment does not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety because a program controlled
by Administrative Procedures using designated technical reviewers approved by the Department Managers will be
in place to review new procedures and procedure changes. A 10 CFR 50.59 screening of each new procedure and permanent
procedure change will be performed by a qualified safety reviewer and PORC will continue to review 10 CFR 50.59 Safety
and Environmental Impact Evaluations associated with procedures and procedure changes. Cross-disciplinary reviews
will be conducted as appropriate. Thus the margin of safety will be maintained by implementing the new procedure review
and approval process. 
The proposed change to the PORC Membership requirements would not involve a significant reduction in the margin of
safety since the level and quality of PORC review will be maintained and there will not be an adverse change to the collective
educational background and work experience of PORC. There will not be an adverse loss of PORC effectiveness as a result
of this change. The PORC quorum is currently composed of five members including up to two designated alternates and
a Chairman. This composition is not changed by the proposed changes. 
The miscellaneous administrative changes not related to the procedure review and approval process or PORC Membership
program cannot reduce any margin of safety because they do not affect any safety-related activity or equipment. These
changes increase the probability that the Technical Specifications are correctly interpreted by clarifying information.

The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant
hazards consideration.

Public Service Electric & Gas Company, Docket Nos. 50-272 and 50-311, Salem Nuclear Generating Station,
Unit Nos. 1 and 2, Salem County, New Jersey





Date of amendment requests: 

February 18, 1994, as supplemented by letter dated April 6, 1994 for Salem Unit 1; and March 28, 1994 for Salem Unit 2.



Description of amendment request: 

The proposed change to Salem Unit 1 Technical Specifications (TS) replaces the main feedwater control and control
bypass valves with the main feedwater stop check valves for the Containment Isolation Function. The proposed change
to Salem Unit 2 TS adds a footnote to the 21-24 BF22 (main feedwater stop check valves) on Table 3.6-1, ``Containment
Isolation valves.'' This note identifies those containment isolation valves that are not subject to 10 CFR 50 Appendix
J, Type C leakage testing.



Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration.
The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis against the standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c). The NRC staff's review
is presented below.

1. Do not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequence of an accident previously evaluated.

The Salem Unit 1 main feedwater stop check valves provide the same isolation function presently accomplished by the
main feedwater control and control bypass valves, without reliance on an actuation signal. Positive closure is assured
during all postulated accident scenarios, through remote-manual controls in the main control room. These valves
satisfy the requirements of GDC 57 for Containment Isolation.

A previous amendment request for Salem Unit 2 neglected to designate the main feedwater stop check valves as exempt
from Type C leakage testing. That request was subsequently approved as Salem Unit 2 Amendment 128. The amended Technical
Specifications are now inconsistent with the Salem Updated Final Safety Analysis Report, which correctly shows
that these valves are exempt from Type C leakage testing. Valve functionality and operation are not affected by this
change.

Therefore, it may be concluded that the proposed changes do not involve a significant increase in the probability
or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.

2. Do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.

The Salem Unit 1 main feedwater stop check valves were originally intended to perform the Containment Isolation Function.
The only changes to the original plant design were the addition of motor operators and the upgrading of associated
controls to safety-related. These changes bring the stop check valves into compliances with GDC 57 requirements,
and ensure positive valve closure during all postulated accident scenarios. As stated above, a previous amendment
request for Salem Unit 2 neglected to designate the main feedwater stop check valves as exempt from Type C leakage testing.
The Salem Updated Final Safety Analysis Report correctly shows that these valves are exempt from Type C leakage testing.
Valve functionality and operation are not affected by these changes.

The changes do not involve modifications to plant equipment or operation. Therefore, no new or different accident
can be created by these changes.

3. Do not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.

Check valves provide inherent isolation from reverse flow conditions. Stop check valves provide increased safety
due to the positive closure feature. Motor operators with remote-manual closure capability, allow positive closure
from the main control room during all postulated accident scenarios. These features ensure that an adequate margin
of safety is maintained.

Additionally, feedwater isolation, utilizing the main feedwater control and control bypass valves, occurs through
Reactor Trip and/or Engineered Safety Features actuation. This feature is unaffected by the proposed changes and
redundant to the stop check valves for Containment Isolation. There are no modifications to plant equipment or operation
involved. Feedwater system operation during normal and accident conditions remains the same.

Therefore, it may be concluded that the proposed changes do not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.

Based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff
proposes to determine that the amendment requests involve no significant hazards consideration.

Rochester Gas and Electric Corporation, Docket No. 50-244, R. E. Ginna Nuclear Power Plant, Wayne County, New
York





Date of amendment request: 

May 13, 1994, as supplemented June 24, 1994.



Description of amendment request: 

The proposed amendment would revise the Ginna Station Technical Specifications (TSs) Section 6.0 ``Administrative
Controls,'' to be consistent with the criteria contained in the NRC Final Policy Statement of Technical Specifications
Improvements for Nuclear Power Reactors, and NUREG-1431 ``Standard Technical Specifications, Westinghouse
Plants,'' September 1993. The proposed amendment would also relocate to other programs and documents, several TS
requirements in accordance with this criteria.

The May 13, 1994, request supersedes the request of March 23, 1992, published in the 

Federal Register

 on November 25, 1992 (57 FR 55589).



Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:

1. Operation of Ginna Station in accordance with the proposed changes does not involve a significant increase in the
probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. The changes are consistent with the Final Policy
Statement on Technical Specifications Improvements for Nuclear Power Reactors and NUREG-1431 and have therefore,
been previously evaluated by the NRC. Implementation of these changes is expected to result in a significant human
factors improvement and enable RG&E [Rochester Gas & Electric] and the NRC to focus on the most important
requirements without any reduction in safety. The changes which do not duplicate NRC guidance in NUREG-1431
are currently addressed by existing technical specifications and regulations, the Ginna Station license, plant
procedures, or the QA [Quality Assurance] program.

2. Operation of Ginna Station in accordance with the proposed changes does not create the possibility of a new or different
kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. The Administrative Controls section contains those requirements
that are not covered by other technical specifications which are considered necessary to assure safe operation of
the facility. The majority of changes are consistent with the Final Policy Statement on Technical Specifications
Improvements for Nuclear Power Reactors and NUREG-1431 and have therefore, been previously evaluated by the
NRC. [* * *].

3. Operation of Ginna Station in accordance with the proposed changes does not involve a significant reduction in
a margin of safety. All requirements removed from technical specifications are relocated to other programs and documents.
These alternative programs and documents are controlled by existing regulations which provide a more appropriate
vehicle for addressing changes and compliance. There were no administrative control requirements which were removed
from technical specifications and not addressed by other regulations. Therefore, there is no significant reduction
in a margin of safety.

The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

Date of amendment request: 

June 28, 1994 (TS 94-09).



Description of amendment request: 

The proposed amendment would revise the Sequoyah Nuclear Plant Unit 2 Technical Specifications (TS) surveillance
requirements, bases, and a Limiting Condition For Operation to incorporate alternate steam generator tube plugging
criteria at tube support plate intersections. The proposed changes would be implemented for Fuel Cycle 7 only and
would affect: (1) TS 4.4.5.2.c.2 to address bobbin probe inspections; (2) TS 4.4.5.3.d to address future inspections
of tubes where the interim criteria is used; (3) TS 4.4.5.4.a.6 to address application of the interim criteria for
indications found within the thickness of the tube support plate; (4) TS 4.4.5.4.a.10 to address application of the
tube plugging alternate criteria and evaluation of indications; (5) TS 4.4.5.5.d and 4.4.5.5.e to address reporting
requirements and information to be reported to the Commission regarding application of the criteria; (6) TS 3.4.6.2.c
to reduce the allowable reactor coolant system total primary-to-secondary leakage through all steam generators
from 1 gallon per minute to 600 gallons per day and from any one steam generator from 500 gallons per day to 150 gallons
per day; and (7) Bases 3/4.4.5 and 3/4.4.6.2 to reflect the new primary-to-secondary leakage limits and add a reference.




Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below: 

TVA has evaluated the proposed TS change and has determined that it does not represent a significant hazards consideration
based on criteria established in 10 CFR 50.92(c). Operation of Sequoyah Nuclear Plant (SQN) in accordance with the
proposed amendment will not: 

1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. 

Testing of model boiler specimens for free-span tubing (no tube support plate restraint) at room temperature conditions
shows burst pressures in excess of 500 pounds per square inch (psi) for indications of outer-diameter stress corrosion
cracking with voltage measurements as high as 19 volts. Burst testing performed on intersections pulled from SQN
with up to a 1.9-volt indication shows measured burst pressure in excess of 6,600 psi at room temperature. Burst testing
performed on pulled tubes from other plants with up to 7.5-volt indications shows burst pressures in excess of 6,300
psi at room temperatures. Correcting for the effects of temperature on material properties and minimum strength
levels (as the burst testing was done at room temperature), tube burst capability significantly exceeds the safety-factor
requirements of NRC Regulatory Guide (RG) 1.121. 

Tube burst criteria are inherently satisfied during normal operating conditions because of the proximity of the
tube support plate (TSP). Test data indicates that tube burst cannot occur within the TSP, even for tubes that have
100 percent throughwall electrodischarge machining notches, 0.75-inch long, provided that the TSP is adjacent
to the notched area. Since tube-to-tube support plate proximity precludes tube burst during normal operating conditions,
use of the criteria must retain tube integrity characteristics that maintain a margin of safety of 1.43 times the bounding
faulted condition steam line break (SLB) pressure differential. During a postulated SLB, the TSP has the potential
to deflect during blowdown following a main SLB, thereby uncovering the TSP intersections. 

Based on the existing database, the RG 1.121 criterion requiring maintenance of a safety factor of 1.43 times the SLB
pressure differential on tube burst is satisfied by 7/8-inch-diameter tubing with bobbin coil indications with
signal amplitudes less than 8.82 volts, regardless of the indicated depth measurement. A 2.0-volt plugging criterion
(resulting in a projected end-of-cycle 

{

EOC

}

 voltage) compares favorably with the 8.82-volt structural limit considering the extremely slow apparent voltage
growth rates and few numbers of indications at SQN. Using the established methodology of RG 1.121, the structural
limit is reduced by allowances for uncertainty and growth to develop a beginning of cycle (BOC) repair limit that would
preclude indications at EOC conditions that exceed the structural limit. The nondestructive examination (NDE)
uncertainty component is 20.5 percent, and is based on the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) alternate repair
criteria (ARC). 

Because of the few number of indications at SQN, the EPRI methodology of applying a growth component of 35 percent per
effective full power year (EFPY) will be used. Near-term operating cycles at SQN are expected to be bounded by 1.23
years, therefore, a 43 percent growth component is appropriate. When these allowances are added to the BOC interim
plugging criteria of 2.0 volts in a deterministic bounding EOC voltage of approximately 3.26 volts for Cycle 7, operation
can be established. A 5.56-volt deterministic safety margin exists (8.82 structural limit_3.26-volt EOC equal
5.56-volt margin). 


For the voltage/burst correlation, the EOC structural limit is supported by a voltage of 8.82 volts. Using this structural
limit of 8.82 volts, a BOC maximum allowable repair limit can be established using the guidance of RG 1.121. The BOC
maximum allowable repair limit should not permit the existence of EOC indications that exceed the 8.82-volt structural
limit. By adding NDE uncertainty allowances and an allowance for crack growth to the repair limit, the structural
limit can be validated. Therefore, the maximum allowable BOC repair limit (RL) based on the structural limit of 8.82
volts can be represented by the expression: 





RL + (0.205  x  RL) + (0.43  x  RL) = 8.82 volts, or, 


the maximum allowable BOC repair limit can be expressed as, 


RL = 8.82-volt structural limit/1.64 = 5.4 volts. 





It is reasonable that this RL (5.4 volts) could be applied for interim plugging criteria (IPC) implementation to repair
bobbin indications greater than 2.0 volts independent of rotating pancake coil (RPC) confirmation of the indication.
Conservatively, an upper limit of 3.6 volts will be used to assess tube integrity for those bobbin indications that
are above 2.0 volts but do not have confirming RPC calls. This 3.6-volt upper limit for nonconfirmed RPC calls is consistent
with other recently approved IPC programs. 

The conservatism of the growth allowance used to develop the repair limit is shown by the most recent SQN eddy current
data. Two tubes plugged in Unit 1 during the last outage had less than one volt of growth over the past five operating
cycles. Only one tube in Unit 2 required repair because of outer-diameter stress corrosion (ODSCC) at the TSP intersections.


Relative to the expected leakage during accident condition loadings, it has been previously established that a postulated
main SLB outside of containment, but upstream of the main steam isolation valve (MSIV), represents the most limiting
radiological condition relative to the IPC. In support of implementation of the IPC, it will determine whether the
distribution of cracking indications at the TSP intersections at the end of Cycle 7 for Unit 2 is projected to be such
that primary-to-secondary leakage would result in site boundary doses within a small fraction of the 10 CFR 100 guidelines.
A separate analysis has determined this allowable SLB leakage limit to be 4.3 gallons per minute (gpm) in the faulted
loop. This limit uses the TS reactor coolant system (RCS) Iodine-131 activity level of 1.0 microcuries per gram dose
equivalent Iodine-131 and the recommended Iodine-131 transient spiking values consistent with NUREG-0800.
The projected SLB leakage rate calculation methodology prescribed in Section 3.3 of draft NUREG-1477 is used
to calculate EOC leakage. Because of the relatively low number of indications at SQN, it is expected that the actual
leakage values will be far less than this limit. Additionally, the current Iodine-131 levels at SQN range from about
25 to 100 times less than the TS limit of 1.0. 

Application of the criteria requires the projection of postulated SLB leakage, based on the projected EOC voltage
distribution for Cycle 7. Projected EOC voltage distribution is developed using the most recent EOC eddy current
results and a voltage measurement uncertainty. Data indicates that a threshold voltage of 2.8 volts would result
in throughwall cracks long enough to leak at SLB condition. Draft NUREG-1477 requires that all indications
to which the IPC are applied must be included in the voltage projection. Tube pull results from another plant with 7/8-inch
tubing with a substantial voltage growth database have shown that tube wall degradation of greater than 40 percent
throughwall was readily detectable either by the bobbin or RPC probe. The tube with the maximum throughwall penetration
of 56 percent (42 average) had a voltage of 2.02 volts. This indication also was the largest recorded bobbin voltage
from the EOC eddy current data. Based on the SQN pulled tube and industry pulled tube data supporting a lower threshold
for SLB leakage of 2.8 volts, inclusion of all IPC intersections in the leakage model is quite conservative. The ODSCC
occurring at SQN is in its earliest stages of development. The conservative bounding growth estimations to be applied
to the expected small number of indications for the upcoming inspection should result in very small levels of predicted
SLB leakage. Historically, SQN has not identified ODSCC as a contributor to operational leakage. The current leakage
level at SQN is less than 1.0 gallon per day (gpd). 


In order to assess the sensitivity of an indication's BOC voltage to EOC leakage potential, a Monte Carlo simulation
was performed for a 2.0-volt BOC indication. The maximum EOC voltage (at 99.8 percent cumulative probability) was
found to be 4.8 volts. Using NUREG-1477 and EPRI leakage models, the leakage component from an indication of
this magnitude is 0.12 and 0.028 gpm, respectively. 

Therefore, as implementation of the 2.0-volt IPC criterion during Cycle 7 in Unit 2 does not adversely affect steam
generator (S/G) tube integrity and implementation will be shown to result in acceptable dose consequences, the proposed
amendment does not result in any increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.

2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously analyzed. 

Implementation of the proposed S/G tube IPC criteria does not introduce any significant changes to the plant design
basis. Use of the criteria does not provide a mechanism that could result in an accident outside of the region of the
TSP elevations; no ODSCC is occurring outside the thickness of the TSP. Neither a single or multiple tube rupture event
would be expected in a S/G in which the plugging criteria have been applied (during all plant conditions). 

TVA will implement a maximum leakage rate limit of 150 gpd per S/G to help preclude the potential for excessive leakage
during all plant conditions. The SQN TS limits on primary-to-secondary leakage at operating conditions are to be
a maximum of 0.42 gpm (600 gpd) for all S/Gs, or, a maximum of 150 gpd for any one S/G. The RG 1.121 criterion for establishing
operational leakage rate limits that require plant shutdown is based upon leak-before-break considerations to
detect a free-span crack before potential tube rupture during faulted plant conditions. The 150-gpd limit should
provide for leakage detection and plant shutdown in the event of the occurrence of an unexpected single crack resulting
in leakage that is associated with the longest permissible crack length. RG 1.121 acceptance criteria for establishing
operating leakage limits are based on leak-before-break considerations such that plant shutdown is initiated if
the leakage associated with the longest permissible crack is exceeded. The longest permissible crack is the length
that provides a factor of safety of 1.43 against bursting at faulted conditions maximum pressure differential. A
voltage amplitude of 8.82 volts for typical ODSCC corresponds to meeting this tube burst requirement at a lower 95
percent prediction limit on the burst correlation coupled with 95/95 lower tolerance limit material properties.
Alternate crack morphologies can correspond to 8.82 volts so that a unique crack length is not defined by the burst
pressure versus voltage correlation. Consequently, typical burst pressure versus through-wall crack length correlations
are used below to define the ``longest permissible crack'' for evaluating operating leakage limits. 

The single through-wall crack lengths that result in tube burst at 1.42 times the SLB pressure differential and the
SLB pressure differential alone are approximately 0.57 inch and 0.84 inch, respectively. A leak rate of 150 gpd will
provide for detection of 0.4-inch-long cracks at nominal leak rates and 0.6-inch-long cracks at the lower 95 percent
confidence level leak rates. Since tube burst is precluded during normal operation because of the proximity of the
TSP to the tube and the potential exists for the crevice to become uncovered during SLB conditions, the leakage from
the maximum permissible crack must preclude tube burst at SLB conditions. Thus, the 150-gpd limit provides for plant
shutdown before reaching critical crack lengths for SLB conditions. Additionally, this leak-before-break evaluation
assumes that the entire crevice area is uncovered during blowdown. Partial uncover will provide benefit to the burst
capacity of the intersection. 

As S/G tube integrity upon implementation of the 2.0-volt IPC continues to be maintained through in-service inspection
and primary-to-secondary leakage monitoring, the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident
previously evaluated is not created. 

3. Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The use of the voltage based bobbin probe interim TSP elevation
plugging criteria at SQN is demonstrated to maintain S/G tube integrity commensurate with the criteria of RG 1.121.
RG 1.121 describes a method acceptable to the NRC staff for meeting General Design Criteria (GDC) 14, 15, 31, and 32
by reducing the probability or the consequences of S/G tube rupture. This is accomplished by determining the limiting
conditions of degradation of S/G tubing, as established by in-service inspection, for which tubes with unacceptable
cracking should be removed from service. Upon implementation of the criteria, even under the worst-case conditions,
the occurrence of ODSCC at the TSP elevations is not expected to lead to a S/G tube rupture event during normal or faulted
plant conditions. The EOC distribution of crack indications at the TSP elevations will be confirmed to result in acceptable
primary-to-secondary leakage during all plant conditions and that radiological consequences are not adversely
impacted. 

In addressing the combined effects of loss-of-coolant accident (LOCA), plus safe shutdown earthquake (SSE) on the
S/G component (as required by GDC 2), it has been determined that tube collapse may occur in the S/Gs at some plants.
This is the case as the TSP may become deformed as a result of lateral loads at the wedge supports at the periphery of the
plate because of the combined effects of the LOCA rarefraction wave and SSE loadings. Then, the resulting pressure
differential on the deformed tubes may cause some of the tubes to collapse. 

There are two issues associated with S/G tube collapse. First, the collapse of S/G tubing reduces the RCS flow area
through the tubes. The reduction in flow area increases the resistance to flow of steam from the core during a LOCA,
which in turn, may potentially increase the peak clad temperature (PCT). Second, there is a potential that partial
through-wall cracks in tubes could progress to through-wall cracks during tube deformation or collapse. 

Consequently, since the leak-before-break methodology is applicable to the SQN reactor coolant loop piping, the
probability of breaks in the primary loop piping is sufficiently low that they need not be considered in the structural
design of the plant. The limiting LOCA event becomes either the accumulator line break or the pressurizer surge line
break. LOCA loads for the primary pipe breaks were used to bound the conditions at SQN for smaller breaks. The results
of the analysis using the larger break inputs show that the LOCA loads were found to be of insufficient magnitude to
result in S/G tube collapse or significant deformation. The LOCA, plus SSE tube collapse evaluation performed for
another plant with Series 51 S/Gs using bounding input conditions (large-break loadings), is considered applicable
to SQN. 

Addressing RG 1.83 considerations, implementation of the bobbin probe voltage based interim tube plugging criteria
of 2.0 volt is supplemented by: (1) enhanced eddy current inspection guidelines to provide consistency in voltage
normalization, (2) a 100 percent eddy current inspection sample size at the TSP elevations, and (3) RPC inspection
requirements for the larger indications left in service to characterize the principal degradation as ODSCC. 

As noted previously, implementation of the TSP elevation plugging criteria will decrease the number of tubes that
must be repaired. The installation of S/G tube plugs reduces the RCS flow margin. Thus, implementation of the alternate
plugging criteria will maintain the margin of flow that would otherwise be reduced in the event of increased tube plugging.


Based on the above, it is concluded that the proposed license amendment request does not result in a significant reduction
in margin of safety. 

The NRC has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this 
review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are 
satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards
consideration.

2, Somervell County, Texas 




Date of amendment request: 

February 14, 1994, as supplemented by letter dated May 17, 1994.


Brief description of amendments: 

The proposed changes revise the Technical Specifications to allow power ascension above 50% rated thermal power
(RTP) with a quadrant power tilt ratio greater than 1.02 provided the assumptions of affected safety analyses are
confirmed to be satisfied. 


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below: 
1. The proposed change does not increase the probability or consequences of a previously evaluated accident. 
The proposed changes affect the Action Statements which are to be taken when it is discovered that the Quadrant Power
Tilt Ratio (QPTR) is greater than the value specified in the Limiting Condition for Operation. The frequency for determining
QPTR has been reduced. The requirements to reduce power to below 50% RTP and to reduce the power range flux trip setpoints
based on QPTR have been replaced by similar requirements based on F

Q

(Z) and F

N



D



H

. The requirement to correct the cause prior to increasing power and verifying QPTR hourly is replaced with specific
requirements to verify that F

Q

(Z) and F

N



D



H

 are within their limits, the safety analyses remain valid, and the excore detectors are re-normalized to indicate
zero quadrant power tilt. If the proposed actions are not met, a requirement to reduce power to >50% RTP within 4
hours was added. 
The only item above that could affect the probability of an accident is the removal of the requirement to reduce the
power range neutron flux setpoints. However, because the Protection Cabinets must be entered to make these adjustments,
eliminating the requirement to adjust these setpoints actually slightly reduces the probability of an inadvertent
plant trip. Thus, the changes do not increase the probability of an accident previously evaluated and may reduce the
probability of a plant trip. 
The proposed Action Statements, require that accident analyses be re-evaluated to confirm that the results remain
valid within 24 hours. Prior to completion of this confirmation, the plant is not permitted to operate at a power level
higher than is permitted under the current specification. If the re-evaluation of accident analyses cannot confirm
that the plant is within the accident analyses results, the required actions are similar to the requirements of the
current specification. Although higher initial power levels generally increase accident consequences, once the
accident analyses are confirmed to be valid, the consequences of any accident will be within analyzed acceptable
limits. Thus, the higher plant power levels permitted by the proposed changes do not significantly increase the consequences
of any accidents previously evaluated. 
The proposed specification does not require a reduction in Power Range Neutron Flux_High reactor trip setpoints
during the time the appropriate peaking factor surveillances are being performed. The interval during which the
proposed specification permits operation without reduced setpoints (and unverified peaking factors) is longer
than is permitted under the current specification. However, the consequences of any accident which could occur during
this interval are the same as for the conditions prior to resetting the trip setpoints in the current specification.
Therefore the change does not increase the consequences of any accident which could occur during this interval. The
impact of the extended interval is addressed in response to question (3) below. 
Based on the discussions above, the proposed changes do not involve an increase in the probability or consequences
of an accident previously evaluated. 
2. The proposed change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated
accident. 
The proposed changes do not involve any hardware changes. System operation has not been changed to create any new system
configurations which were not previously allowed. Therefore, the proposed changes do not create the possibility
of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. 
3. The proposed change does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. 
The limits for the parameters of concern (QPTR, F

Q

(Z) and F

N



D



H

) remain unchanged. The acceptance criteria for analyzed events also remain the same. The margin of safety established
by the LCOs [Limiting Conditions for Operation] remains unchanged. 
The only impact of the proposed changes is an increase in the allowed duration of operation above 50% RTP without a reduction
in the Power Range Neutron Flux_High trip setpoint. This could potentially affect a margin of safety by allowing operation
at conditions which are potentially outside the assumptions of the accident analyses for an interval longer than
is permitted under the current specification. The impact on safety margin is not considered to be significant, however,
because: the allowed interval is still small (24 hours versus the current 6 hours); the likelihood of an accident during
the interval is small; and, it is considered unlikely that the peaking factors would be outside their limits without
outer indications. 
Thus, it is concluded that the proposed changes do not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. 
The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

2, Somervell County, Texas 




Date of amendment request: 

March 28, 1994. 


Brief description of amendments: 

The proposed amendment would revise Section 6 of the Technical Specifications (TS) by deleting a reference to a no
longer used loss of coolant accident (LOCA) topical report and adding a reference to a new steamline break methodology
topical report. 


Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below: 
1. The proposed changes do not involve an increase in the probability or consequences of a previously evaluated accident.

The NRC assures that appropriate core operating limits are established by requiring that they be determined using
NRC approved analytical methods. These approved methods are described in the documents listed in TS Section 6.9.1.6b.
TU Electric has developed the analysis capability to evaluate the core operating limits. The methodologies used
by TU Electric have been documented in a series of TU Electric submittals which were reviewed and approved by the NRC.
This TS revision adds the topical report which describes the TU Electric steamline break analysis methodology to
TS Section 6.9.1.6b. 
Also, the Westinghouse report which describes the methodology previously used in the analysis of Unit 1 large break
LOCAs is no longer used and is being deleted. Large break LOCA analyses for Unit 1 are now performed using NRC approved
TU Electric methodology. 
Because the revisions are administrative only, they cannot directly affect the probability or the consequences
of any previously evaluated accident. The steamline break analysis methodology is part of a group [of] methodologies
which are authorized by the technical specifications to be used to verify that each reload cycle continues to satisfy
the core operating limits. The core operating limits are set to assure that relevant plant parameters are maintained
such that potential accidents are within the bounds of the accident analyses. Because the applicable limits of the
safety analyses will be verified to be satisfied using authorized methodologies, there is no significant impact
on the consequences of an accident previously evaluated. In addition, since the core operating limits do not affect
any accident initiators, the change has no impact on the probability of any accident previously analyzed. 
2.The proposed changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated. 
The proposed changes involve a change in the permissible analysis methodologies for determining core operating
limits. As such, the changes play an important role in the analysis of postulated accidents but none of the changes
affect plant hardware or the operation of plant systems in a way that could initiate an accident. Therefore, the proposed
changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.

3. The proposed changes do not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety. 
In reviewing and approving the methods used for safety analyses, the NRC has approved the safety analysis limits which
establish the margin of safety to be maintained. Satisfaction of event-specific acceptance criteria ensures that
the approved safety analysis limits are met and thus provides the margin of safety. The methodology being added to
the TS demonstrates, in a conservative manner, that the event acceptance criteria are satisfied. Therefore, including
this method in the TS does not change the margin of safety. 
The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

Description of amendment request: 

The proposed change would revise the Technical Specifications (TS) for the North Anna Power Station, Units No. 1 and

On December 29, 1993, the NRC issued Generic Letter 93-08 titled ``Relocation of Technical Specification Tables
of Instrument Response Time Limits.'' This generic letter provides guidance for preparing a proposed license amendment
to relocate the tables of response time limits for the RTS and the Engineered ESFAS instruments from TS to station-controlled
documents. 
The RTS and the ESFAS provides the signals needed to actuate the safety equipment necessary to mitigate accidents
and transients. Consistent with Generic Letter 93-08 the licensee is requesting license amendments for NA-1&2
to relocate the RTS and ESFAS tables of instrument response time limits from TS to station-controlled documents.



Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below: 
Specifically, operation of North Anna Power Station in accordance with the proposed Technical Specification[s]
changes will not: 
1. Involve a significant increase in the probability of occurrence or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.

The Reactor Trip System and the Engineered Safety Features Actuation System provide the signals needed to actuate
the safety equipment necessary to mitigate accidents and transients. The proposed changes relocate the RTS and ESFAS
instrument response time limits from the Technical Specifications to station controlled documents but will not
change the operability or surveillance requirements for these instruments. With these proposed changes, revisions
to the response times for these instruments can be made pursuant to 10 CFR 50.59 without Nuclear Regulatory Commission
approval unless the revision involves an unreviewed safety question. 
The proposed changes will not change any accident initiators or the consequences of any analyzed accident. Therefore,
the proposed changes do not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
analyzed. 
2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. 
The proposed changes relocate the RTS and ESFAS instrument response time limits from the Technical Specifications
to station controlled documents but will not change the functions of these instruments. The proposed change does
not represent a change in the configuration or operation of the plant. No new hardware is being added to the plant as
part of the proposed changes. The Technical Specifications will continue to require the same operability and surveillance
requirements to be met for these instruments. Therefore, the proposed changes do not create the possibility of a new
or different type of accident from any accident previously evaluated. 
3. Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. 
The proposed changes will not affect the functions of the RTS or the ESFAS instruments. Relocating the response time
limits will not alter the operability or the surveillance requirements of these instruments. The administrative
change control provisions for plant procedures written pursuant to 10 CFR 50.59 are adequate to control revisions
to the response time limits. Therefore, the proposed changes do not involve a significant reduction in a margin of
safety. 
The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant
hazards consideration.

Date of amendment request: 

June 9, 1994. 


Description of amendment request: 

The proposed changes to the Technical Specifications include: (1) modification of the high head charging pumps seal
cooling subsystem, (2) restructuring of the Chemical and Volume Control System and Safety Injection System Specifications,
(3) relocation of certain specification requirements within existing specifications, (4) specification of a minimum
boric acid solution temperature in lieu of heat tracing channel operability, and (5) minor wording changes which
are administrative in nature for consistency in terminology, capitalization of defined terms and clarification.



Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below: 
Specifically, operation of Surry Power Station in accordance with the proposed Technical Specifications changes
will not: 
1. Involve a significant increase in the probability of occurrence or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.

The modifications to the charging pumps and elimination of the charging pump component cooling subsystem do not increase
the probability of occurrence of any accident or malfunction previously evaluated in the safety analysis report.
The charging pump modifications utilize a passively designed process flow cooling arrangement to reduce exposure,
improve reliability, and improve operability. The charging pump modifications will not decrease the pumps ability
or the associated subsystems ability to perform their design function. 
The restructuring of the Chemical and Volume Control System and Safety Injection System specifications on a subsystem
basis continues to ensure that the reactor can be made subcritical from any operating condition and provide sufficient
shutdown margin to preclude inadvertent criticality when in the shutdown condition. The Safety Injection System
subsystems continue to maintain sufficient boration capability to mitigate reactivity transients within the design
limits associated with postulated accident conditions. The Safety Injection System subsystems ensure that sufficient
emergency core cooling capability will be available in the event of a LOCA [loss-of-coolant accident] assuming the
loss of one subsystem through any single failure consideration. Either subsystem operating in conjunction with
the accumulators remains capable of supplying sufficient core cooling to limit the peak cladding temperatures within
acceptable limits in accordance with the loss-of-coolant accident analyses. 
The Chemical and Volume Control System remains capable of achieving Cold Shutdown of both units during any operating
conditions in accordance with the safety analysis with a minimum specified solution temperature of 112 degrees F.
Heat tracing is not required for operability of the Safety Injection System nor does it affect the ability of the Safety
Injection System to mitigate the consequences of any postulated accident identified in the safety analysis. 
The changes ensure that the refueling water storage tank remains capable of providing a sufficient supply of borated
water for injection by the emergency core cooling system in the event of a LOCA. The limits specified for refueling
water storage tank volume and boron concentration continue to ensure that sufficient solution is available within
containment for recirculation cooling flow to the core, and that the reactor will remain subcritical in Cold Shutdown
consistent with the LOCA analyses. 
The specified allowed outage time of 72 hours for an inoperable Chemical and Volume Control System subsystem or Safety
Injection System subsystem is reasonable for the repair of affected components and is consistent with NRC Memorandum,
``Recommended Interim Revisions to LCO's for ECCS Components,'' dated December 1, 1975, and NUREG-1431, Standard
Technical Specifications for Westinghouse Pressurized Water Reactors. A reliability analysis (reference NRC
memo above) has shown that the impact of having one subsystem inoperable is sufficiently small to justify continued
operation for 72 hours. Engineering evaluation of the proposed changes determined that they are bounded by existing
safety analyses. Furthermore, the proposed changes do not increase the allowed outage times to achieve Cold Shutdown
presently specified in the Technical Specifications. 
2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. 
The passively designed once-through process flow cooling arrangement for the charging pumps' seals are recommended
by the pump manufacturer with the pump seal manufacturer's concurrence and result in no decrease in the pumps ability
to perform their safety function. Our Engineering evaluation has determined that the affected systems ability to
mitigate the consequences of any accident as described in the safety analyses is not reduced. The restructuring and
relocation of specifications has not reduced any limiting condition for operation or surveillance specification
requirements. Changes in allowed outage times are consistent with NUREG-0452, NUREG-1431, or Generic
Letter 93-05 and our accident analyses. Consequently, the possibility of a new or different kind of accident
is not created. 
3. Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. 
The modifications to the charging pumps result in improved reliability and improved operability of the CVCS [chemical
and volume control system] and SI [safety injection] subsystems. Our Engineering evaluation of the manufacturer's
proposed modification and the pump seal manufacturer's concurrence with the modification, have determined this
modification to be acceptable with no reduction in the pump's safety-related function. The charging pump modification
does not reduce the margin of safety in any part of Technical Specifications or the accident analyses. 
The restructuring of the Chemical and Volume Control System specifications continue to ensure that the reactor can
be made subcritical from any operating condition and provide sufficient shutdown margin to preclude inadvertent
criticality when in the shutdown condition. The Chemical Volume and Control System remains capable of achieving
Cold Shutdown of both units during any operating conditions in accordance with the safety analysis with a minimum
specified solution temperature of 112 degrees F. The revised allowed outage times for the Safety Injection System
subsystems do not impact the margin of safety * * * in the Technical Specifications bases or the accident
analyses. 
The Safety Injection System subsystems continue to maintain sufficient boration capability to mitigate reactivity
transients within the design limits associated with postulated accident conditions described within the safety
analysis report. The Safety Injection System subsystems ensure that sufficient emergency core cooling capability
will be available in the event of a LOCA assuming the loss of one subsystem through any single failure consideration.
Either subsystem operating in conjunction with the accumulators remains capable of supplying sufficient core cooling
to limit the peak cladding temperatures within acceptable limits in accordance with the loss-of-coolant accident
analyses. 
The changes ensure that the refueling water storage tank remains capable of providing a sufficient supply of borated
water for injection by the emergency core cooling system in the event of a LOCA. The limits specified for refueling
water storage tank volume and boron concentration continue to ensure that sufficient solution is available within
containment for recirculation cooling flow to the core, and that the reactor will remain subcritical in Cold Shutdown
consistent with the LOCA analyses. Consequently, the proposed change to Technical Specifications does not involve
a significant reduction [in] the margin of safety within the accident analyses. 
The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant
hazards consideration.

Description of amendment request: 

The proposed amendment would revise Kewaunee Nuclear Power Plant (KNPP) Technical Specification (TS) 3.3.c by separating
the Internal Containment Spray (ICS) and Spray Additive Systems into two distinct specifications. The proposed
amendment would also remove the requirement that for a spray train to be operable, a spray pump suction flow path from

from 48 hours to 72 hours.

The proposed changes were reviewed in accordance with the provisions of 10 CFR 50.92 to show no significant hazards
exist. The proposed changes will not: 
(1) Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. 

The likelihood that an accident will occur is neither increased nor decreased by these TS changes. These TS changes
will not impact the function or method of operation of plant equipment. Thus, there is not a significant increase in
the probability of a previously analyzed accident due to these changes. No systems, equipment, or components are
affected by the proposed changes. Thus, the consequences of the malfunction of equipment important to safety previously
evaluated in the Updated Safety Analysis Report (USAR) are not increased by these changes. 
The proposed changes have no impact on accident initiators or plant equipment, and thus, do not affect the probabilities
or consequences of an accident. 
(2) Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. 
The proposed TS changes would not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated. 
The proposed changes do not involve changes to the physical plant or operations. Since these changes do not contribute
to accident initiation, they do not produce a new accident scenario or produce a new type of equipment malfunction.
Also, these changes do not alter any existing accident scenarios; they do not affect equipment or its operation, and
thus, do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident. 
(3) Involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety. 
Operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed TS would not involve a significant reduction in a margin
of safety. The proposed changes do not affect plant equipment or operation. Safety limits and limiting safety system
settings are not affected by these proposed changes. Extending the time the Spray Additive System may be out of service
from 48 hours to 72 hours and removing the requirement to have a spray pump suction flow path from the additive tank for
a spray train to be operable is consistent with STS. The STS only require that the spray system be capable of taking suction
from the refueling water storage tank and the containment sump. 
The Containment Spray System would still be available and would remove some iodine from the containment atmosphere
in the event of a Design Basis Accident. The 72 hour completion time takes into account the Containment Spray System
redundant flow path capabilities and the low probability of the worst case Design Basis Accident occurring during
this period. 

The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

Description of amendment request: 

The proposed amendment would modify Point Beach Nuclear Plant Technical Specification (TS) 15.3.2, ``Chemical
and Volume Control System,'' by eliminating the necessity for high concentration boric acid and removing the operability
requirements for the associated heat tracing. The basis for Section 15.3.2 and applicable surveillances in Table
15.4.1-2 would also be revised to support the above changes.

1. Operation of this facility under the proposed Technical Specifications change will not create a significant increase
in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. 
Reduced boron concentration in the boric acid storage tank (BAST) is offset by increasing the volume of boric acid
solution that must be contained in the tanks. The heat tracing requirements are used to ensure that the dissolved boric
acid is maintained in solution and available for injection into the RCS to adjust core reactivity throughout core
life and to meet GDC requirements. Chemical analyses of boron concentrations of >4.0 weight percent have shown
that the boric acid does not crystallize at temperatures above 57
 F. Ambient temperatures in the areas of the primary auxiliary building where these components are located will
normally remain above this temperature. Hence, heat tracing will no longer be needed for boric acid concentrations
with corresponding solubility temperatures less than ambient temperatures. The proposed Technical Specifications
requirements for boron concentration, volume, and temperature of the BASTs and boration paths ensure that the capability
to inject boric acid is maintained. Since the components (and their function) necessary to achieve a safe shutdown
have not been changed or modified, this change does not significantly increase the probability or consequences of
any accident previously evaluated. 
The proposed changes to the boric acid system Technical Specifications requirements for the chemical and volume
control system (CVCS) do not affect the requirements for the emergency core cooling system (ECCS). The original design
of the high head safety injection (SI) system used the BASTs as its initial suction source. Westinghouse WCAP-12602,
``Report For The Reduction of SI System Boron Concentration,'' and a 10 CFR 50.59 Safety Evaluation Report performed
by Wisconsin Electric justifies the design change to use the refueling water storage tank (RWST) as the initial suction
source of SI fluid rather than the BAST. The affected FSAR Chapter 14 accident analyses include the Loss of Coolant
Accident (LOCA) events and the Steamline Break (SLB) events. The LOCA events are affected with respect to the large-break
post-LOCA long-term core cooling subcriticality requirement. The SLB events are affected with respect to core integrity.
The events were analyzed assuming the elimination of the logic which automatically opened the valves in the flow path
from the BASTs to the SI pumps upon the receipt of a safety injection signal. The results show that we remain within the
acceptance criteria of the aforementioned FSAR Chapter 14 accident analyses. Therefore, the proposed changes will
not create a significant increase in the probability or consequences of a[n] accident previously evaluated. 
2. Operation of this facility under the proposed Technical Specifications change will not create the possibility
of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. 
The reactivity control function of the boron in the CVCS and SI systems is not being changed. Therefore, the proposed
changes will not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.

3. Operation of this facility under the proposed Technical Specifications change will not create a significant reduction
in a margin of safety. 
The intent of the proposed Technical Specifications is to ensure that two independent flow paths from the borated
water source(s) (BASTs and/or RWST) to the reactor coolant system are maintained whenever a unit is taken critical.
This requires that sufficient quantities of boric acid be stored in the tanks, and that this borated water can be delivered
to the reactor coolant system when required. Although we presently require diverse sources of borated water (BAST


and 

RWST), the proposed reduction in diversity will be offset by the significant increase in reliability of the boric
acid system due to operation with lower boric acid concentrations and, hence, a much lower probability of boron precipitation
and system ``freeze-up.'' Reducing the boric acid concentration in the BASTs has been compensated for by increasing
the required volume of boric acid. 
The proposed Technical Specifications requirements for boric acid concentration and volume include the additional
specification of minimum temperature that must be maintained to assure boric acid solubility. The minimum temperature
requirement is more appropriate than the requirement for heat tracing because it is a more precise means of verifying
and assuring solubility. Therefore, the proposed boric acid concentration table, which includes the volume and
temperature requirements, is an appropriate substitute for the heat tracing requirements. Although the heat tracing
requirement is being eliminated, the boric acid heat tracing system will be available during our transition to the
lower boric acid concentration to assist in maintaining boric acid system temperature if necessary. Since our analyses
have shown that the existing FSAR Chapter 14 accident analyses remain bounded under the proposed specifications,
the margin of safety for the plant is not significantly reduced. 
The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

Wisconsin Electric Power Company, Docket Nos. 50-266 and 50-301, Point Beach Nuclear Plant, Unit Nos.
1 and 2, Town of Two Creeks, Manitowoc County, Wisconsin





Date of amendment request: 

May 26, 1994.



Description of amendment request: 

Point Beach Nuclear Plant is installing two additional emergency diesel generators and reconfigure portions of
the 4160 Volt emergency electrical power system. The proposed amendment would revise the Point Beach Nuclear Plant
Technical Specifications (TS) to establish the requirements for the electrical systems at Point Beach such that
the TS will provide the appropriate guidance for all interim configurations and the final configuration. The majority
of changes are incorporated in TS Section 15.3.7, ``Auxiliary Electrical Systems.'' Other Sections modified are
15.3.0, ``General Considerations,'' 15.3.14, ``Fire Protection System,'' and 15.4.6, ``Emergency Power System
Periodic Tests.''



Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration
which is presented below:

(1) Operation of this facility under the proposed Technical Specifications will not create a significant increase
in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.

The Point Beach Nuclear Plant Final Safety Analysis Report (PBNP FSAR) shows that the original emergency diesel generators
and the associated support systems and connections do not cause or affect the probability of any accident evaluated
in the PBNP FSAR. The additional emergency diesel generators, the associated support systems and connections, and
reconfiguration of the emergency AC power system will not change this. The emergency AC power system does not initiate
any accident previously evaluated in the PBNP FSAR.

The limiting conditions for operation and allowable outage times proposed in this license amendment request are
consistent with the current requirements in the PBNP Technical Specifications. The proposed change in the required
emergency diesel generator (EDG) inspection interval, from annually to the time as recommended by the EDG manufacturer,
will continue to maintain the operability and reliability of the EDGs. Therefore, the probability of occurrence
of an accident previously evaluated in the FSAR is not increased by the proposed Technical Specifications.

The consequences of the accidents previously evaluated in the PBNP FSAR are determined by the results of analyses
that are based on initial conditions of the plant, the type of accident, transient response of the plant, and the operation
and failure of equipment and systems. The new emergency diesel generator installation will meet the requirements
for emergency power sources for PBNP.

General Design Criterion (GDC) 39 as described in the PBNP FSAR, states, ``An emergency power source shall be provided
and designed with adequate independency, redundancy, capacity, and testability to permit the functioning of the
engineered safety features and protection systems required to avoid undue risk to the health and safety of the public.
This power source shall provide this capacity assuming a failure of a single component.''

The limiting conditions for operation and allowable outage times proposed in this license amendment request are
consistent with the requirements in GDC-39 and the current Technical Specifications for PBNP. Therefore,
this proposed license amendment does not affect the consequences of any accident previously evaluated in the PBNP
FSAR, because the factors that are used to determine the consequences of accidents are not being changed.

(2) Operation of this facility under the proposed Technical Specifications change will not create the possibility
of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.

The PBNP FSAR shows that the original emergency diesel generators and the associated support systems and connections
do not cause any accident evaluated in the PBNP FSAR. The additional emergency diesel generators, the associated
support systems and connections, and reconfiguration of the emergency AC power system will not change this, because
the new emergency diesel generators will meet the requirements for emergency power sources for PBNP. Additionally,
these changes do not introduce any type of system or component malfunction that would create the possibility of a new
or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.

The limiting conditions for operation and allowable outage times proposed in this license amendment request are
consistent with the requirements in GDC-39 and the current Technical Specifications for PBNP. The proposed
change in the required EDG inspection interval, from annually to the time as recommended by the EDG manufacturer,
will continue to maintain the operability and reliability of the EDGs.

Therefore, the proposed Technical Specification changes for the addition of two diesel generators and changing
the required EDG inspection interval do not create the possibility of an accident of a different type than any previously
evaluated in the FSAR.

(3) Operation of this facility under the proposed Technical Specifications change will not create a significant
reduction in a margin of safety.

The new diesel generator and emergency AC power system reconfiguration design and installation are being and have
been performed to meet or exceed the original system design requirements. The emergency diesel generators provide
power to the safety equipment that operates to maintain the margins of safety. The new diesel generators and emergency
AC power configuration will continue to satisfy this requirement.

The limiting conditions for operation and allowable outage times proposed in this license amendment request are
consistent with the requirements in GDC-39 and the current Technical Specifications for PBNP. The proposed
change in the required EDG inspection interval, from annually to the time as recommended by the EDG manufacturer,
will continue to maintain the operability and reliability of the EDGs.

Therefore, the proposed Technical Specification changes for the addition of two diesel generators and changing
the required EDG inspection interval do not reduce the margin of safety.

The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves

Wisconsin Electric Power Company, Docket Nos. 50-266 and 50-301, Point Beach Nuclear Power Plant, Unit
Nos. 1 and 2, Town of Two Creeks, Manitowoc County, Wisconsin





Date of amendment request: 

May 26, 1994.



Description of amendment request: 

The proposed amendment would revise the Point Beach Nuclear Plant Technical Specifications (TSs) by extending the
operation of both units with the current heatup and cooldown limit curves to 23.6 effective full power years (EFPY).
The proposal also would revise the bases for TS Section 15.3.1.B, ``Pressure/Temperature Limits,'' to reflect the
methodology for the curve compilation.



Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration
which is presented below:

We have evaluated these proposed amendments in accordance with the requirements of 10 CFR 50.91(a), against the standards
of 10 CFR 50.92, and have determined that these modifications will not result in a significant hazards consideration.
A proposed amendment will not involve a significant hazards consideration if it does not (1) involve a significant
increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated, (2) create the possibility of a
new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated, or (3) involve a significant reduction
in a margin of safety.

The proposed heatup and cooldown curves are identical to the current heatup and cooldown curves except for their projected
expiration. The curves were calculated using the most limiting weld and fluence information from either unit as input
to the acceptable methodology of Regulatory Guide 1.99, Revision 2. The consequences or probability of a previously
evaluated accident will, therefore, not significantly be increased or a margin of safety reduced.

The underlying purpose of these curves is to define an acceptable operating range of pressures and temperatures to
protect the reactor vessels against non-ductile failure. Since this purpose remains unchanged, a new or different
kind of accident cannot be created.

The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

Brief description of amendments: 

The amendments remove the Technical Specifications (TS) addressing reactor coolant chemistry limits and associated
sampling requirements that are applicable when the reactor is defueled. The TS requirements being removed have been

future changes to these chemistry requirements must be evaluated in accordance with 10 CFR 50.59 to determine whether
the changes involve an unreviewed safety question. A change involving an unreviewed safety question would require
a license amendment and NRC review and approval prior to implementation. In addition, changes to the reactor coolant
chemistry TS, applicable when fuel is in the reactor, are included in these amendments to provide clarification and
to ensure consistency in requirements among units.

Brief description of amendment: 

The amendment modifies the administrative section of the technical specifications (TS) to reflect management and
organizational changes at the Washington Public Power Supply System (the licensee) for operation of the WNP-2
facility. The proposed changes would (1) modify the reporting responsibility of the quality assurance organization
from the Managing Director to the Assistant Managing Director, Operations (AMDO), and (2) modify the appointment
authority for the Corporate Nuclear Safety Review Board (CNSRB) from the Managing Director to the AMDO. These changes
are proposed to reflect the current designation of the AMDO as the licensee's designated official with corporate
responsibility for overall plant nuclear safety and as the direct report for the CNSRB. 

In addition, the proposed change would (1) delete the specific requirement for health physics/chemistry program
procedures, (2) modify the titles of two positions on the Plant Operations Committee (POC) to reflect 
revised organizational titles, and (3) delete the requirement that the CNSRB Executive Secretary be designated
from the CNSRB membership.

<DOCTITLE>Connecticut Yankee Atomic Power Company; Issuance of Amendment to Facility Operating License</DOCTITLE>






The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (Commission) has issued Amendment No. 174 to Facility Operating License
No. DPR-61 issued to Connecticut Yankee Atomic Power Company (the licensee), which revised the Technical Specifications
for operation of the Haddam Neck Plant located in Middlesex County, Connecticut. The amendment is effective as of
the date of issuance.

The amendment revises Technical Specification Section 3/4.5.1, ``ECCS Subsystems_Tavg Greater Than or Equal to
350
 F,'' by adding a new ACTION Statement ``a'' which increases the allowed outage time for the centrifugal charging
pumps from 72 hours to 7 days. In addition, the ACTION statements are relettered to reflect the addition of the new ACTION
statement for the centrifugal charging pumps.

The application for the amendment complies with the standards and requirements of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as
amended (the Act), and the Commission's rules and regulations. The Commission has made appropriate findings as required
by the Act and the Commission's rules and regulations in 10 CFR Chapter I, which are set forth in the license amendment.

Notice of Consideration of Issuance of Amendment and Opportunity for Hearing in connection with this action was published
in the 

Federal Register

 on December 1, 1993 (58 FR 63405). No request for a hearing or petition for leave to intervene was filed following this
notice.

The Commission has prepared an Environmental Assessment related to the action and has determined not to prepare an
environmental impact statement. Based upon the environmental assessment, the Commission has concluded that the
issuance of this amendment will not have a significant effect on the quality of the human environment (59 FR 34452).

For further details with respect to the action see (1) the application for amendment dated November 2, 1993, as supplemented
February 28, and May 31, 1994, (2) Amendment No. 174 to License No. DPR-61, (3) the Commission's related Safety
Evaluation, and (4) the Commission's Environmental Assessment. All of these items are available for public inspection

ACTION: 

Notice of Exemption.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation has granted a request from the Home Team Limited Partnership of an exemption
from the bond/escrow requirement of section 4204(a)(1)(B) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974,
as amended. A notice of the request for exemption from the requirement was published on April 26, 1994 (59 FR 21791).
The effect of this notice is to advise the public of the decision on the exemption request.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Background




Section 4204 of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended by the Multiemployer Pension Plan
Amendments Act of 1980, (``ERISA'' or ``the Act''), provides that a bona fide arm's-length sale of assets of a contributing
employer to an unrelated party will not be considered to result in a withdrawal if three conditions are met. These conditions,
enumerated in section 4204(a)(1)(A)-(C), are that_

(A) The purchaser has an obligation to contribute to the plan with respect to the operations for substantially the
same number of contribution base units for which the seller was obligated to contribute;

(B) The purchaser obtains a bond or places an amount in escrow, for a period of five plan years after the sale, in an amount
equal to the greater of the seller's average required annual contribution to the plan for the three plan years preceding
the year in which the sale occurred or the seller's required annual contribution for the plan year preceding the year
in which the sale occurred (the amount of the bond or escrow is doubled if the plan is in reorganization in the year in
which the sale occurred); and

(C) The contract of sale provides that if the purchaser withdraws from the plan within the first five plan years beginning
after the sale and fails to pay any of its liability to the plan, the seller shall be secondarily liable for the liability
it (the seller) would have had but for section 4204.

The bond or escrow described above would be paid to the plan if the purchaser withdraws from the plan or fails to make
any required contributions to the plan within the first five plan years beginning after the sale.

Additionally, section 4204(b)(1) provides that if a sale of assets is covered by section 4204, the purchaser assumes
by operation of law the contribution record of the seller for the plan year in which the sale occurred and the preceding
four plan years.

Section 4204(c) of ERISA authorizes the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (``PBGC'') to grant individual or
class variances or exemptions from the purchaser's bond/escrow requirement of section 4204(a)(1)(B) when warranted.
The legislative history of section 4204 indicates a Congressional intent that the sale rules be administered in a
manner that assures protection of the plan with the least practicable intrusion into normal business transactions.
Senate Committee on Labor and Human Resources, 96th Cong., 2nd Sess., S.1076, The Multiemployer Pension Plan Amendments
Act of 1980: Summary and Analysis of Considerations 16 (Comm. Print, April 1980); 128 Cong. Rec. S10117 (July 29, 1980).
The granting of an exemption or variance from the bond/escrow requirement does not constitute a finding by the PBGC
that a particular transaction satisfies the other requirements of section 4204(a)(1). Such questions are to be decided
by the plan sponsor in the first instance, and any disputes are to be resolved in arbitration. 29 U.S.C. 1382, 1399,
1401.

Under the PBGC's regulation on variances for sales of assets (29 CFR Part 2643), a request for a variance or waiver of
the bond/escrow requirement under any of the tests established in the regulation (29 CFR 2643.12-2643.14)
is to be made to the plan in question. The PBGC will consider waiver requests only when the request is not based on satisfaction
of one of the four regulatory tests or when the parties assert that the financial information necessary to show satisfaction
of one of the regulatory tests is privileged or confidential financial information within the meaning of 5 U.S.C.
section 552(b)(4) (the Freedom of Information Act).

Under section 2643.3 of the regulation, the PBGC shall approve a request for a variance if it determines that approval
of the request is warranted, in that it_

(1) would more effectively or equitably carry out the purposes of Title IV of the Act; and

(2) would not significantly increase the risk of financial loss to the plan.

Section 4204(c) of the ERISA and  2643.3(b) of the regulation require the PBGC to publish a notice of the pendency
of a request for a variance or exemption in the 

Federal Register

, and to provide interested parties with an opportunity to comment on the proposed variance or exemption.

The Decision



On April 26, 1994 (59 FR 21791), the PBGC published a request from The Home Team Limited Partnership (``the Buyer'')
for an exemption from the bond/escrow requirement of section 4204(a)(1)(B) with respect to its October 4, 1993 purchase
of The Orioles, Inc. (``the Seller''). No comments were received in response to the notice.

According to the request, the Major League Baseball Players Benefit Plan (the ``Plan'') was established and is maintained
pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement between professional major league baseball teams and the Major League
Baseball Players Association. The major league clubs have established the Major Leagues Central Fund (the ``Central
Fund'') pursuant to the ``Major League Agreement in re Major Leagues Central Fund.'' Under this agreement, contributions
to the Plan for all participating employers are paid by the Office of the Commissioner of Baseball from the Central
Fund on behalf of each participating employer in satisfaction of the employer's contribution obligation arising
under the Plan's funding agreement. The monies in the Central Fund are derived directly from (i) gate receipts from
All-Star games, (ii) radio and television revenues from World Series, League Championships, intradivision play-offs
and All-Star games, and (iii) certain other radio and television revenues from regular and exhibition games, including
those from foreign broadcasts.

The Buyer and the Seller entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement for the Buyer to purchase substantially all of the
assets and assume substantially all of the liabilities of the Seller relating to the business employing the employees
covered by the Plan. The final closing of the transaction occurred on October 4, 1993. Under the Asset Purchase Agreement,
the Buyer assumed the obligation to contribute to the Plan for substantially the same number of contribution base
units as the Seller was obligated to contribute to the Plan. The Seller has agreed to be secondarily liable for any withdrawal
liability should the Buyer withdraw from the Plan within five years of the sale.

The amount of the bond/escrow that would be required under section 4204(a)(1)(B) of ERISA beginning as of April 1,
1994, is $1,401,449 (the annual contribution the Seller made for the Plan year preceding the Plan year in which the
sale of assets occurred). The estimated amount of the withdrawal liability that the Seller would incur if not for Section
4204 is $7,672,235.

In support of the waiver request the Buyer stated that:




The Plan is funded directly from the Revenues which are paid from the Central Fund directly to the [Plan's] Trust without
first passing through the hands of any of the Employers. Therefore, the Plan enjoys a substantial degree of security
* * * A change in ownership of an Employer does not affect the obligation * * * to fund
the Plan * * *. Nor does a change in ownership in any way create the possibility that there will be difficulty
in collecting Plan contributions due from any new Employer.




Based on the facts of this case and the representations and statements made in connection with the request for an exemption,
the PBGC has determined that an exemption from the bond/escrow requirement is warranted, in that it would more effectively
carry out the purposes of title IV of ERISA and would not significantly increase the risk of financial loss to the Plan.
Therefore, the PBGC hereby grants the request for an exemption for the bond/escrow requirement. The granting of an
exemption or variance from the bond/escrow requirement of section 4204 (a)(1)(B) does not constitute a finding by
the PBGC that the transaction satisfies the other requirements of section 4204(a)(1). The determination of whether
the transaction satisfies such other requirements is a determination to be made by the Plan sponsor.




Issued at Washington, D.C., on this 14th day of July 1994.

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation has granted a request from the San Francisco Baseball Associates, L.P.
for an exemption from the bond/escrow requirement of section 4204(a)(1)(B) of the Employee Retirement Income Security
Act of 1974, as amended, with respect to the Major League Baseball Players Benefit Plan. A notice of the request of exemption
from the requirement was published on April 14, 1994 (59 FR 17803). The effect of this notice is to advise the public
of the decision on the exemption request.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 


Background




Section 4204 of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended by the Multiemployer Pension Plan
Amendments Act of 1980 (``ERISA'' or ``the Act''), provides that a bona fide arm's-length sale of assets of a contributing
employer to an unrelated party will not be considered a withdrawal if three conditions are met. These conditions,
enumerated in section 4204(a)(1) (A)-(C), are that_


(A) The purchaser has an obligation to contribute to the plan with respect to the operations for substantially the
same number of contribution base units for which the seller was obligated to contribute:
(B) The purchaser obtains a bond or places an amount in escrow, for a period of five plan years after the sale, in an amount
equal to the greater of the seller's average required annual contribution to the plan for the three plan years preceding
the year in which the sale occurred or the seller's required annual contribution for the plan year preceding the year
in which the sale occurred (the amount of the bond or escrow is doubled if the plan is in reorganization in the year in
which the sale occurred); and


(C) The contract of sale provides that if the purchaser withdraws from the plan within the first five plan years beginning
after the sale and fails to pay any of its liability to the plan, the seller shall be secondarily liable for the liability
it (the seller) would have had but for section 4204.

The bond or escrow described above would be paid to the plan if the purchaser withdraws from the plan or fails to make
any required contributions to the plan within the first five plan years beginning after the sale.

Additionally, section 4204(b)(1) provides that if a sale of assets is covered by section 4204, the purchaser assumes
by operation of law the contribution record of the seller for the plan year in which the sale occurred and the preceding
four plan years.

Section 4204(c) of ERISA authorizes the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (``PBGC'') to grant individual or
class variances or exemptions from the purchaser's bond/escrow requirement of section 4204(a)(1)(B) when warranted.
The legislative history of section 4204 indicates a Congressional intent that the sales rules be administered in
a manner that assures protection of the plan with the least practicable intrusion into normal business transactions.
Senate Committee on Labor and Human Resources, 96th Cong., 2nd Sess., S.1076, The Multiemployer Pension Plan Amendments
Act of 1980: Summary and Analysis of Considerations 16 (Comm. Print, April 1980); 128 Cong. Rec. S10117 (July 29, 1980).
The granting of an exemption or variance from the bond/escrow requirement does not constitute a finding by the PBGC
that a particular transaction satisfies the other requirements of section 4204(a)(1).


Under the PBGC's regulation on variances for sales of assets (29 CFR Part 2643), a request for a variance or waiver of
the bond/escrow requirement under any of the tests established in the regulation (  2643.12-2643.14)
is to be made to the plan in question. The PBGC will consider waiver requests only when the request is not based on satisfaction
of one of the four regulatory tests or when the parties assert that the financial information necessary to show satisfaction
of one of the regulatory tests is privileged or confidential financial information within the meaning of 5 U.S.C.
552(b)(4) (the Freedom of Information Act).

Under  2643.3 of the regulation, the PBGC shall approve a request for a variance or exemption if it determines
that approval of the request is warranted, in that it_

(1) Would more effectively or equitably carry out the purposes of Title IV of the Act; and

(2) Would not significantly increase the risk of financial loss to the plan.

Section 4204(c) of ERISA and section 2643.3(b) of the regulation require the PBGC to publish a notice of the pendency
of a request for a variance or exemption in the 

Federal Register

, and to provide interested parties with an opportunity to comment on the proposed variance or exemption. The PBGC
received one comment on the request for exemption.

The Decision



On April 14, 1994 (59 FR 17803), the PBGC published a notice of the pendency of a request by the San Francisco Baseball
Associates, L.P. (the ``Buyer'') for an exemption from the bond/escrow requirement of section 4204(a)(1)(B) with
respect to its purchase of the San Francisco Giants (the ``Seller''). According to the request, the Major League Baseball
Players Benefit Plan (the ``Plan'') was established and is maintained pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement
between the professional major league baseball teams (the ``Clubs'') and the Major League Baseball Players Association
(the ``Players Association'').


The Clubs have established the Major Leagues Central Fund (the ``Central Fund'') pursuant to the ``Major League Agreement
in re Major Leagues Central Fund.'' Under this agreement, contributions to the Plan for all participating employers
are paid by the Office of the Commissioner of Baseball from the Central Fund on behalf of each participating employer
in satisfaction of the employer's pension liability under the Plan's funding agreement. The monies in the Central
Fund are derived directly from (i) gate receipts from All-Star games, (ii) radio and television revenues from World
Series, League Championships, intradivision play-offs and All-Star games, and (iii) certain other radio and television
revenues, including revenues from foreign broadcasts, of regular and exhibition games. During the 1992 Plan year,
approximately $34.1 million was paid into the Plan on behalf of all major league clubs. In that year revenues to the
Central Fund exceeded expenses, including contribution to the Plan, by approximately $354 million. 

Effective November 20, 1992, the Buyer and Seller entered into an Asset Sale and Contribution agreement under which
the Buyer agreed to purchase substantially all of the assets and assume substantially all of the liabilities of the
seller relating to the business of employing employees under the Plan. The contract of sale provides that the Buyer
agrees ``to contribute to the Plan substantially the same number of contribution base units which the Seller had an
obligation to contribute to the Plan.'' The contract of sale further provides that ``[i]f the Buyer thereafter, but
prior to the end of the fifth plan year commencing after the closing, partially or completely withdraws from the Plan,
the Seller will be secondarily liable for any withdrawal liability it would have had to the Plan * * *.''
the final closing of the transaction occurred on January 14, 1993. The amount of the bond/escrow that would be required
under section 4204 (a)(1)(B) of ERISA is $1,412,077. The estimated amount of the withdrawal liability that the Seller
would incur if not for Section 4204 is $4,796,483. 


The Comment received by the PBGC suggested that the request for exemption be denied based on the possibility that revenues
payable to the Central Fund may not be sufficient to provide contributions to the Plan in the future. In support, the
commenter cited an expected decrease in revenues under the terms of a new network television contract, the primary
source of revenue for the Central Fund; the possibility of a work stoppage during negotiations to implement a salary
cap as part of a new collective bargaining agreement; and diminished fan loyalty and attendance due to high player
salaries, inflated ticket prices, poor management, and other factors. 

The PBGC notes that the bond/escrow requirement is intended to assure the payment of the Buyer's withdrawal liability
if the Buyer withdraws from the Plan in the five plan years following the sale of assets, and the Buyer is unable to pay
withdrawal liability that would otherwise have been paid by the Seller had section 4204 not applied to the transaction.
The factors cited by the commenter do not substantially affect the Plan's ability to collect withdrawal liability
from the Buyer, as compared with the Plan's ability to collect withdrawal liability from the Seller had section 4204
not applied to the transaction. We also note that the Seller remains secondarily liable under section 4204(a)(2)
for withdrawal liability, regardless of whether the Buyer receives an exemption from the bond/escrow requirement.



In addition, the Plan's public filings indicate that the Plan is financially sound. The Plan's most recent annual
return/report (Form 5500) states that the Plan had approximately $708 million in assets as of the close of the plan
year on March 31, 1993. While the plan incurred approximately $63 million in expenses for that plan year, the Plan's
investment earnings were nearly $100 million. 


Accordingly, based on the facts of this case and the representations and statements made in connection with the request
for an exemption, the PBGC has determined that an exemption from the bond/escrow requirement is warranted, in that
it would more effectively carry out the purposes of title IV of ERISA and would not significantly increase the risk
of financial loss to the Plan. Therefore, the PBGC hereby grants the request for an exemption for the bond/escrow requirement.
The granting of an exemption or variance from the bond/escrow requirement of section 4204(a)(1)(B) does not constitute
a finding by the PBGC that the transaction satisfies the other requirements of section 4204(a)(1). The determination
of whether the transaction satisfies such other requirements is a determination to be made by the Plan sponsor.

<USDEPT>SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION</USDEPT>





Joint Industry Plan; Order Approving Amendment No. 1 to Reporting Plan for Nasdaq/National Market Securities Traded
on an Exchange on an Unlisted or Listed Basis, Submitted by the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.,
and the American, Boston, Chicago and Philadelphia Stock Exchanges


July 13, 1994.


On July 12, 1994, the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., and the American, Boston, Chicago, and Philadelphia
Stock Exchanges (collectively, ``Participants'')
 submitted to the Commission Amendment No. 1 to a joint transaction reporting plan (``Plan'') for Nasdaq/National
Market securities traded on an exchange on an unlisted or listed basis.
 The Commission is approving the proposed amendment to the Plan and trading pursuant to the Plan on a temporary basis
to expire on January 12, 1995.





I. Introduction


The Commission originally approved the Plan on June 26, 1990.
 The Plan governs the collection, consolidation and dissemination of quotation and transaction information for
Nasdaq/National Market securities listed on an exchange or traded on an exchange pursuant to a grant of unlisted trading
privileges (``UTP'').
 The Commission approved trading pursuant to the Plan on a one-year pilot basis, with the pilot period to commence when
transaction reporting pursuant to the Plan commenced. Accordingly, the pilot period commenced on July 12, 1993,
and was scheduled to expire on July 12, 1994.







As originally approved by the Commission, the Plan required the Participants to complete their negotiations regarding
revenue sharing during the one-year pilot period. The Participants, however, have not yet come to an agreement concerning
revenue sharing for transactions effected pursuant to the Plan. Proposed Amendment No. 1 to the Plan extends this
negotiation period for an additional six months. In conjunction with the Plan, on a temporary basis also scheduled
to expire on July 12, 1994, the Commission granted an exemption from Rule 11Ac1-2 under the Act regarding the
calculated best bid and offer (``BBO''), and granted the BSE an exemption from the provision of Rule 11Aa3-1
under the Act that requires transaction reporting plans to include market identifiers for transaction reports and
last sale data. At the request of the Participants, this order extends these exemptions through July 12, 1995, provided
that the Plan continues in effect through that date pursuant to a Commission order.


II. Background


The Securities Acts Amendments of 1975 (``1975 Amendments'') directed the Commission to facilitate the development
of a national market system for securities, consistent with certain objectives, including ``fair competition * * *
between exchange markets and markets other than exchange markets.'' The legislative history of the 1975 Amendments
makes clear that many active OTC stocks were expected to be part of the national market system. The 1975 Amendments
also authorized the Commission to grant OTC/UTP to exchanges if certain conditions were met. The Commission generally
deferred granting exchanges OTC/UTP pending progress on the development of the national market system.
In 1985, however, the Commission noted that since the enactment of the 1975 Amendments, important developments had
occurred in the OTC market; these developments led the Commission to reconsider its position on OTC/UTP.
 The Commission announced in its 1985 OTC/UTP Release its willingness to grant UTP to national securities exchanges
in NMS Securities,
 conditioned in part on the approval of a plan submitted by interested exchanges and the NASD to consolidate and disseminate
exchange and OTC quotation data and transaction data in OTC securities upon which UTP is granted.
 The exchanges and the NASD have been negotiating the terms of a plan, under the oversight of the Commission staff, since
that time.






In its 1985 OTC/UTP Release, the Commission also determined that although it was premature to require any specific
type of market linkage prior to the initiation of trading, the exchanges must provide OTC market makers direct telephone
access to the exchange specialist in UTP securities to facilitate intermarket trading in those securities. The Commission
determined to grant OTC/UTP to an exchange only if the exchange provided Nasdaq market makers access to the exchange
market in the subject securities to the same extent that Nasdaq market makers provide specialists access to the Nasdaq
market maker trading facilities.
In 1985, the Commission also stated that it expected Nasdaq market makers to provide exchange members with fair and
efficient access to the OTC market, and that if the Commission became aware of any limitation on such access, it would
take prompt remedial action. The Commission further noted that it did not believe that a more sophisticated intermarket
linkage need be in place during the initial stages of trading OTC/UTP securities, but encouraged the NASD and the exchanges
to forge their own initiatives in facilitating computerized intermarket trading linkages and adopting trade-through
rules for these securities. The 1985 OTC/UTP Release also conditioned the grant of OTC/UTP on the exchanges not applying
their off-board trading restrictions to those securities.

Finally, the Commission stated that it would evaluate trading under the one-year pilot and at the end of the pilot period
would determine what further action to take. Because of the potentially significant market structure implications
of this new policy, the Commission decided to proceed cautiously by establishing a one-year pilot program under which
each exchange requesting UTP would be permitted to trade, on an unlisted basis, up to 25 OTC securities designated
as NMS Securities pursuant to Rule 11Aa2-1 under the Act. The Commission stated that it considered this one-year
pilot a first step in granting UTP on NMS Securities and that granting UTP on additional NMS Securities might be appropriate
if no adverse consequences resulted from the trading of securities under the pilot program. 

In 1986, because of protracted negotiations to develop a joint industry plan, the Chx entered into an interim transaction
reporting plan (``Interim Plan'') with the NASD that was significantly more limited than the Joint Industry Plan.
On April 29, 1987, the Commission approved the Chx's application for UTP in 25 NMS securities quoted on the Nasdaq system
(generally, ``Nasdaq/National Market securities'')
 and simultaneously approved the Interim Plan submitted by the Chx and the NASD. 






As discussed more fully below, in 1990, the Commission approved the Plan and the ability for Participants to effect
transactions pursuant to the Plan on a one-year pilot basis, to begin when certain enhancements were made to the Nasdaq
system and transaction reporting pursuant to the Plan commenced. The Commission also expanded the maximum number
of Nasdaq/National Market securities to which a Participant could extend UTP from 25 to 100. 


In 1992, the Phlx, prior to the initiation of the Plan pilot, filed with the Commission a proposed rule change to initiate
a pilot program to provide for transactions on the Phlx floor in OTC securities pursuant to UTP. The Commission initially
approved this pilot program and the accompanying rules for a temporary period ending on December 31, 1993.
 Thereafter, the Commission extended the Phlx pilot program and the effectiveness of the accompanying Phlx rules
through December 31, 1994.
 






The Chx Interim Plan continued in effect, subject to the 100 security limitation, through July 12, 1993, when trading
pursuant to the Plan commenced, thereby superseding the Interim Plan. The Phlx and the Chx, as Participants to the
Plan, continue to be limited to extending UTP to a maximum of 100 Nasdaq/National Market securities. The Phlx currently
effects transactions in Nasdaq/National Market securities pursuant to the Plan and the Phlx pilot program (

i.e.

, while using the Plan Processor and pursuant to Phlx rules established under the Phlx pilot program). 

The Plan provides for the collection from Plan Participants and the consolidation and dissemination to vendors,
subscribers and others of quotation and transaction information in ``eligible securities,'' 

i.e.

, NMS Securities traded on an exchange on a listed or UTP basis. The Plan contains various provisions concerning the
operation of the Plan, which include: Implementation of the Plan; Manner of Collecting, Processing, Sequencing,
Making Available, and Disseminating Last Sale Information; Reporting Requirements (including hours of operation);
Standards and Methods of Ensuring Promptness, Accuracy, and Completeness of Transaction Reports; Terms and Conditions
of Acess (including the 1985 OTC/UTP Order requirement to ensure direct telephone access between dealers and specialists);
Description of Operation of Facility Contemplated by the Plan; the Method and Frequency of Processor Evaluation
(providing that the Processor's performance is subject to review by an Operating Committee during the fifth year
of the Processor's operation); Written Understandings of Agreements Relating to Interpretation of, or Participation
in, the Plan; Calculation of the BBO; Dispute Resolution; Method of Determination and Imposition, and Amount of,
Fees and Charges. 

The provisions affected by the present submission to the Commission, including proposed Amendment No. 1 to the Plan,
and the Participants' request for extensions of exemptive relief granted by the Commission in our 1990 Plan Approval
Order, are discussed in more detail below.

III. Discussion


The Participants have submitted to the Commission proposed Amendment No. 1 to the Plan, and have requested continued
exemptive relief under certain provisions under the Act.
 The Commission's approval of Amendment No. 1 and the requests for continued exemptive relief are discussed below.
In the 1990 Plan Approval Order, the Commission stated that it would review several issues related to the Plan after
it had been in operation for one year. These issues are also discussed below. Furthermore, in 1985, 1992, and 1993,
the Commission discussed the possible need for an intermarket linkage and a trade-through rule for transactions
effected pursuant to extensions of OTC/UTP.
 As discussed below, the Commission continues to believe that such a linkage and/or rule in this context may be appropriate.





A. Proposed Amendment No. 1 of the Plan


Section XIV of the Plan provides that the NASD shall recover from exchange Participants a sum of money to be negotiated.
Specifically, Section XIV of the Plan states:



[I]t is expressly agreed and understood among the Participants that specific provisions governing the issues of
cost allocation and revenue-sharing among the Participants will not be included in the Plan at the time of execution
thereof, but will be resolved within one year from the commencement of the Plan's operation. The provisions agreed
upon by the Participants will be applied on a retroactive basis by means of an amendment to the Plan. There shall be no
retroactive application if the Participants are unable to agree upon a cost allocation and revenue-sharing provision
or the amount of recapture. * * *



Even through the Plan has been in operation for one year, the Participants have not yet come to an agreement concerning
revenue sharing. Proposed Amendment No. 1 to the Plan, which the Commission is approving today, extends the negotiation
period for an additional six months. Thus, the Plan will now require the Participants to come to an agreement on these
financial matters before January 12, 1995.
To assist the Participants in ensuring compliance with this Plan amendment, the Commission is requesting each Participant
(including the BSE) to submit a written report to the Commission on or before September 30, 1994, that describes the
status of the negotiations, and the Participant's position with respect to those negotiations.





B. BBO Calculation and Extension of Rule 11Ac2-1 Exemptive Relief


On a temporary basis also scheduled to expire July 12, 1994, the Commission provided an exemption from Rule 11Ac2-1
under the Act regarding the calculated BBO for securities quoted pursuant to the Plan. At the Participants' request,
the Commission is extending this exemptive relief through July 12, 1995, provided that the Plan continues in effect
through that date pursuant to a Commission order.
The Plan provides that, in calculating the BBO disseminated to vendors, if quotations of more than one Participant
are identical in price, then the earliest in time is the best. While the Commission chose not to modify this Plan provision
in 1990, the Commission stated in approving both the Chx Interim Plan, and the Plan, that it would continue to reevaluate
this BBO calculation. Indeed, the Commission stated that its temporary approval of this BBO calculation would not
foreclose a future Commission decision to require size priority pursuant to the Vendor Display Rule,
 should such a decision be appropriate. The Commission also notes that, in the 1990 Plan Approval Order, the Commission
stated that the NASD had represented to the Commission that the Plan Processor would include a ``switch'' for easy
conversion if the Commission determines that the BBO should be calculated using price/size/time priority.






In order to evaluate the effects of this term of the Plan, the Commission is requesting that the Participants each submit
to the Commission a written evaluation of any relevant effects of the BBO calculation based on time on or before September
30, 1994.

C. The Boston Stock Exchange's Request for Exemption



The Plan does not provide for market identifiers for Limited Participant transaction reports or Limited Participant
consolidated best bid and offer quotations. Subsection (b)(2)(viii) of Rule 11Aa3-1 under the Act, however,
requires any transaction reporting plan submitted to the Commission to provide market identifiers for transaction
reports or last sale data made available to vendors. The BSE, as the only Limited Participant under the Plan, requested
in 1990 that the Commission exempt it from this requirement.

Prior to 1990, the BSE stated that it had signed the Plan only because it seeks to continue providing trading facilities
for dually listed (

i.e.

, listed on the BSE and traded in Nasdaq) stocks that it listed prior to the date the Plan was filed with the Commission
and does not wish to apply for OTC/UTP.
 To accommodate the BSE, the Plan Participants created the category of ``Limited Participants,'' which do not pay
any of the development costs of modifying NASDAQ to accommodate OTC/UTP and have limited voting rights under the Plan.
Limited Participants are not permitted to expand the number of dually listed issues or to apply for OTC/UTP. The Plan
provides that the BSE's quotations and trade reports will not have a BSE market identifier, but will instead be identified
by Nasdaq's market symbol.





The Participants have requested that the Commission extend, for an additional year, this exemptive relief to the
BSE from Rule 11Aa3-1(b)(2)(viii) under the Act. The Commission is unaware of any negative impact that this
exemption has had on the marketplace, and believes that the extension of exemptive relief through July 12, 1995, is
appropriate under these limited circumstances.



D. Written Understandings of Agreements Relating to Interpretation of, or Participation in, the Plan 



The pilot program, as originally approved and memorialized in an Undertaking dated April 1, 1989, provides that,
for the one-year period following the date on which the UTP Processor commences operations, each initial entry or
update of quotation information in Eligible Securities shall be effected by an individual at a computer terminal
and shall not be programmed or automated.
 No Participant has submitted a request to the Commission that this Undertaking be extended. This agreement, therefore,
expired July 12, 1994.





E. Intermarket Trading Linkage and Trade-Through Rule



The Commission has stated in several instances that it believes the Participants should work toward developing an
intermarket trading linkage and an accompanying trade-through rule with respect to OTC/UTP.
 The Commission is unaware of any recent efforts made by the Participants in this regard.





While the Commission understands that the Participant meetings concerning the Plan primarily have dealt with financial
matters, the Commission believes that efficient executions of securities transactions and customer protection
concerns must be considered with respect to the operation of the Plan. Accordingly, the Commission requests each
Participant to submit to the Commission, no later than September 30, 1994, a statement concerning the effects that
an intermarket trading linkage and/or a trade-through rule would have on market efficiency and/or customer protection.
 The Commission will be particularly interested in comments concerning the Participants' experience under the pilot
program under the Plan and/or the Chx Interim Plan. The Commission also requests each Participant to include in its
submission a statement concerning the appropriate course of action to ensure that the Participants routinely evaluate
market quality and customer protection matters as transactions continue to be effected pursuant to the Commission's
temporary or permanent approval of the Plan.





F. Commission's Previous Directive for Quantitative Assessment of Plan's Effects



In the 1990 Plan Approval Order, the Commission stated:




Plan Participants are hereby directed, in connection with any request for extension of the pilot or for permanent
approval of the Plan, to provide the Commission with a quantitative assessment of the effects, if any, of unlisted
trading privileges and the Plan on the width of quotation spreads and on price continuity in trading in OTC/UTP securities.




The Commission has not received any Participant's assessment of these effects. While the Commission believes that
a 6-month extension of the pilot program is warranted and appropriate under the Act, the Commission believes that
receipt of the above referenced quantitative assessments is essential to the Commission's evaluation of the pilot
program. Thus, the Commission directs the Participants to submit to the Commission, on or before September 30, 1994,
the quantitative assessments described above. The Commission expects these assessments to be based on statistical
studies.

VI. Conclusion


The Commission finds that proposed Amendment No. 1 to the Plan to extend the financial negotiation period for an additional
six months is appropriate and in furtherance of Section 11A of the Act. The Commission also finds that one-year extensions
of the exemptive relief requested, and described above, also is consistent with the Act and the Rules thereunder.
Specifically, the Commission believes that these extensions should serve to provide the Participants with more
time to conclude their financial negotiations and to evaluate the effects of the pilot program and report their findings
to the Commission. This, in turn, should further the objects of the Act in general, and specifically those set forth
in Section 11A of the Act and in Rules 11Aa3-1 and 11Aa3-2 thereunder.


It is therefore ordered,

 pursuant to Section 11A of the Act and (c)(2) of Rule 11Aa3-2 thereunder, that Amendment No. 1 to the Joint Transaction
Reporting Plan for Nasdaq/National Market securities traded on an exchange on an unlisted or listed basis is hereby
approved, and trading pursuant to the Plan is hereby approved on a temporary basis through January 12, 1995.



For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority, 17 CFR 200.30-3(a)(29).

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Notice of Filing of Proposed Rule Change by the American Stock Exchange, Inc., Relating
to the Listing and Trading of Warrants on the Nikkei Stock Index 300</DOCTITLE>


July 13, 1994.


Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''),
 notice is hereby given that on June 17, 1994, the American Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Amex'' or ``Exchange'') filed with
the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II, and
III below, which Items have been prepared by the Amex. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments
on the proposed rule change from interested persons.




I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change


The Exchange is proposing to list and trade under Section 106 of the Amex 

Company Guide

 warrants based on the Nikkei Stock Index 300 (``Index'').
The text of the proposed rule change is available at the Office of the Secretary, the Amex, and at the Commission.


II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change


In its filing with the Commission, the Amex included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed
rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be
examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The Amex has prepared summaries, set forth in sections (A), (B),
and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.



(A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



Under Section 106 (Currency and Index Warrants) of the Amex 

Company Guide,

 the Exchange may approve for listing warrants based on established foreign and domestic indexes. The Exchange is
proposing to list warrants based on the Nikkei 300 Index.
 The Nikkei 300 Index is comprised of 300 stocks which are representative of the first section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange
(``TSE'').




The Index was designed and is maintained by Nihon Keizai Shimbun, Inc. (``NKS''). The Index's component securities
were selected for their high market capitalization and high degree of liquidity, and are representaitve of the relative
distribution of industries within the broader Japanese equity market.






The median capitalization of the companies in the Nikkei 300 Index on March 31, 1994 was 

y

340.1 billion ($3.3 billion at the exchange rate of 

y

102.75 per US$1.00 prevailing on March 31, 1994). The average market capitalization of these companies was $7.5 billion
on the same date and using the same rate of exchange. The individual market capitalization of these companies ranged
from $875 million to $75.5 billion on March 31, 1994. The largest stock accounted for 3.41 percent of the total weighting
of the Index, while the smallest accounted for 0.04 percent.





The Index is a capitalization weighted index and is calculated by multiplying the price of each component security
(in Japanese yen) by its number of shares outstanding, adding those products, and dividing by the current Index divisor.
The Index divisor initially was determined to yield a benchmark value of 100 on October 1, 1982. The divisor is adjusted
for certain changes described below. The Index's closing value on July 8, 1994 was 301.48. For valuation purposes,
one Nikkei 300 Index unit (1.0) is assigned a fixed value of US$1.00.
The Index will be maintained by NKS. To maintain continuity of the Index, the divisor will be adjusted to reflect certain
events relating to the component securities. These events include, but are not limited to, changes in the number of
shares outstanding, spin-offs, certain rights issuances, and mergers and acquisitions. The competition of the
Index will be reviewed periodically by NKS.
Warrant issues on the Index will conform to the listing guidelines under Amex 

Company Guide

 Section 106, which provide that (1) the issuer shall have assets in excess of $100,000,000 and otherwise substantially
exceed the size and earnings requirements of Section 101(a); (2) the term of warrants shall be for a period ranging
from one to five years from the date of issuance; and (3) the minimum public distribution of such issues shall be 1,000,000
warrants, together with a minimum of 400 public holders, and a minimum aggregate market value of $4,000,000.

Nikkei 300 Index warrants will be direct obligations of their issuer subject to cash settlement in dollars, and either
exercisable throughout their life (

i.e.

, American style) or exercisable only on their expiration date (

i.e.

, European style). Upon exercise, or at the warrant expiration date (if not exercisable prior to such date), the holder
of a warrant structured as a ``put'' would receive payment in U.S. dollars to the extent that the Nikkei 300 Index has
declined below a pre-stated cash settlement value. Conversely, holders of a warrant structured as a ``call,'' upon
exercise or at expiration, would receive payment in U.S. dollars to the extent that the Index has increased above the
pre-stated cash settlement value. If ``out-of-the-money'' at the time of expiration, the warrants likely would
expire worthless.

The Amex has adopted suitability standards applicable to recommendations to customers of index warrants and transactions
in customer accounts. Amex Rule 421, Commentary .02, requires a Senior Registered Options Principal or a Registered
Options Principal to approve and initial a discretionary order in index warrants on the day entered. In addition,
the Exchange, prior to the commencement of trading, will distribute a circular to its membership calling attention
to specific risks associated with warrants on the Index.

The Exchange believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6(b) of the Act
 in general, and furthers the objectives of Section 6(b)(5) in particular, in that it is designed to prevent fraudulent
and manipulative acts and practices, promote just and equitable principles of change, foster cooperation and coordination
with persons engaged in facilitating transactions in securities, and remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism
of a free and open market and a national market system.





(B) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition



The Amex does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any burden on competition.



(C) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants,
or Others



No written comments were solicited or received with respect to the proposed rule change.



III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action



Within 35 days of the date of publication of this notice in the 

Federal Register

 or within such longer period: (i) As the Commission may designate up to 90 days of such date if it finds such longer period
to be appropriate and publishes its reasons for so finding, or (ii) as to which the self-regulatory organization consents,
the Commission will:

(A) By order approve such proposed rule change, or

(B) Institute proceedings to determine whether the proposed rule change should be disapproved.



IV. Solicitation of Comments



Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views, and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying in the Commission's
Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC. Copies of such filing also will be available for
inspection and copying at the principal office of the Amex. All submissions should refer to File No. SR-Amex-94-24
and should be submitted by August 10, 1994.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Notice of Filing of Proposed Rule Change by the Chicago Board Options Exchange,
Inc. Relating to Exercise Price Intervals on Interest Rate Options</DOCTITLE>



July 13, 1994.



Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''),
 notice is hereby given that on June 30, 1994, the Chicago Board Options Exchange, Inc. (``CBOE'' or ``Exchange'')
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items
I, II, and III below, which Items have been prepared by the CBOE. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit
comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons.





I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change



The Exchange is proposing to change CBOE Rule 23.5(a) to reduce from $2.50 to $1.00 the fixed interval between strike
prices.

The text of the proposed rule change is available at the Office of the Secretary, the CBOE, and at the Commission.



II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



In its filing with the Commission, the CBOE included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed
rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be
examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The CBOE has prepared summaries, set forth in sections (A), (B),
and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.



(

A

) 

Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



The purpose of the proposed rule change is to amend the Exchange's rules concerning interest rate option contracts
to reduce from $2.50 to $1.00 the interval between exercise prices on such contracts.

The Exchange believes that this change, which will establish a minimum spread of $100 ($1.00 times the multiplier
of 100) between series, will improve the value and utility of interest rate options. In particular, the Exchange believes
that this change should enable traders to construct hedges that correlate closely with interest rates and changes
in interest rate measures underlying interest rate options. Under current CBOE Rule 23.5(d), the $2.50 minimum strike
price interval is wider than the typical increments of change in interest rates, even during periods of high interest
rate volatility. For example, during the most volatile week in recent months, the yield on the 30-year U.S. Treasury
bond changed by less than 15 basis points (or $150), while strike price intervals were necessarily set at the minimum
of $250 apart. The Exchange believes that that ``wide'' minimum interval made at- or near-the-money positions unavailable,which
in turn limited the ability of traders to construct tight hedges or to use combination orders such as straddles effectively.
The Exchange believes that reducing the strike price interval accordingly should improve the value and utility of
interest rate options to CBOE members and their customers.

The Exchange believes that the proposed rule change will enhance depth and liquidity in interest rate options. The
Exchange believes this proposal is consistent with Section 6(b) of the Act in general, and Section 6(b)(5)
 in particular, by providing rules that perfect the mechanism of a free and open market, while protecting investors
and the public interest.

Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Order Approving Proposed Rule Change by the Chicago Board Options Exchange, Inc.,
Relating to Modification of Fees for Failure To Observe OEX RAES Requirements</DOCTITLE>


July 14, 1994.


On April 1, 1994, the Chicago Board Options Exchange, Inc. (``CBOE'' or ``Exchange'') submitted to the Securities
and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission''), pursuant to Section 19(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934 (``Act'')
 and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,
 a proposal to amend CBOE Rule 24.17, ``RAES Eligibility in OEX,'' to change the eligibility standards under which
individuals, member organizations and joint accounts may participate in the CBOE's Retail Automatic Execution
System (``RAES'') for Standard & Poor's 100 Index (``OEX'') options. Among other things, the CBOE proposes to
eliminate the automatic disqualification provision from CBOE Rule 24.17 and replace the rule's current $500.00
fee for failures to comply with RAES log-on and log-off requirements with the following fee schedule: a $100.00 fee
for each of the first three failures to comply with the log-on or log-off requirements in one calendar year; a $250.00
fee for each of the fourth through sixth such failures in one calendar year; and a $500.00 fee for all subsequent failures
to comply with the log-on and log-off requirements in one calendar year.





Notice of the proposed rule change was published for comment in the 

Federal Register

 in Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34128 (May 27, 1994), 59 FR 28907 (June 3, 1994). No comments were received on
the proposal.
In May 1993 Exchange Rule 24.17 was amended to establish, among other things, more rigorous log-on and log-off requirements
for participants in OEX RAES.
 For example, group members who previously were logged on automatically by the Exchange must now log on at their own
initiative each time they enter the trading crowd. Likewise, members who previously were not required to log off the
system each time they left the trading crowd must now do so.




In view of these additional log-on and log-off requirements, the Exchange believes that the $500.00 fees currently
due from members who do not log on or log off as required are excessive. The proposed rule change therefore establishes
a new graduated fee schedule, under which the fee amount will increase in relation to the number of times within any
one calendar year that a member does not log on or log off as required. Specifically, during each calendar year, a $100.00
fee will be due for each of the first three times that a member fails to observe the log-on or log-off requirements; a
$250.00 fee will be due for each of the fourth through sixth such times; and a $500.00 fee will be due for all subsequent
times. In addition, the CBOE proposes to assess a $500.00 fee on any member participating in a joint account or nominee
account held by a member organization if the member logs onto OEX RAES but thereafter terminates participation prior
to the next succeeding expiration date without either joining another OEX RAES account or terminating membership
on the Exchange.
In addition, the CBOE proposes to eliminate the automatic disqualification provisions in CBOE Rule 24.17. Specifically,
the Exchange proposes to delete the provisions which provide that a individuals's, participating nominee's, or
joint account member's failure to meet his RAES obligations will disqualify him from signing onto RAES for such time
period as the OEX Floor Procedure Committee (``OFPC'') determines. The CBOE also proposes to allow an individual
required to sign onto RAES immediately prior to expiration to apply to the OFPC for prospective relief from the log-on
requirements during a particular expiration cycle. The proposal states that in deciding such applications, the
OFPC may limit the grant of relief by imposing time periods during which the applicant will not be eligible to participate
in RAES.

Members who fail to observe CBOE Rule 24.17 can be subject to a variety of sanctions.
 The CBOE states that the fees suggested in the proposed rule change, like the fees imposed currently under CBOE Rule
24.17, do not constitute disciplinary action. Nevertheless, the review procedures in Chapter 19, ``Hearings and
Review,'' of the Exchange's rules will be available with respect to the assessment of the proposed fees. Under those
procedures, a member may seek verification of fees charged by the Exchange. If the member is not satisfied with the
verification of fees, he may request a hearing before a panel of three or more members of the Exchange's Appeals Committee.
At the hearing the appellant may be represented by counsel and may cross examine witnesses.







In addition, the decision of the Exchange's Appeals Committee panel is subject to review by the Board of Directors
of the Exchange on the Board's own motion, on the written request of the appellant, or at the request of the Exchange's
President or the relevant Exchange Committee Chairman. The review must be conducted by the Board or by a Board Committee
consisting of at least three Directors (other than Directors who sat on the Appeals Committee in the matter). An appellant
has an opportunity to address issues raided specifically by the Board or the Committee, and in addition may submit
oral or written arguments if the Board so allows in its discretion.






The Exchange believes that the proposed fee schedule is appropriate and equitable given the additional requirements
imposed on participants in OEX RAES in the RAES Approval Order. Furthermore, to ensure that all members are treated
alike under the RAES Approval Order, the Exchange will apply the revised fee schedule retroactively from April 30,
1993, the effective date of the RAES Approval Order.






The CBOE believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6(b) of the Act, in general, and furthers
the objectives of Sections 6(b)(4) and 6(b)(5), in particular, in that it is designed to allocate reasonable dues,
fees and charges among CBOE members and to promote the efficiency and effectiveness of the CBOE's automatic execution
system.

The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange and, in particular, the requirements of Section
6(b)(5).
 The Commission believes that the elimination of the automatic disqualification provisions of CBOE Rule 24.17, the
introduction of a graduated fee schedule for failures to comply with the RAES log-on and log-off requirements, and
the provision allowing individuals to apply to the OFPC for prospective relief from the requirement to log onto RAES
on the business day immediately prior to expiration are designed to make the rules applicable to OEX RAES participation
fairer and more flexible while maintaining the integrity of the RAES system for OEX options. The proposal is designed
to ensure that there is adequate market maker participation at all times in OEX RAES and that market makers are properly
logged onto the system. The presence of an adequate number of market makers protects investors and contributes to
the maintenance of fair and orderly markets by helping the Exchange to maintain the continued availability to RAES
for OEX, thereby contributing to the effective and efficient execution of public investor orders at the best available
prices.

The Commission also believes that it is reasonable for the CBOE to eliminate the provisions of CBOE Rule 24.17 allowing
for automatic disqualification from RAES for failures to satisfy RAES obligations because the fees imposed for failing
to meet participation requirements should provide a sufficient deterrent to ensure adequate market maker participation
in OEX RAES.
 In this regard, the Commission notes that in addition to the graduated fees for failures to comply with the RAES log-on
and log-off requirements, the proposal establishes a $500.00 fee for any member organization who logs onto RAES and
later terminates participation on RAES prior to the next expiration cycle without participating in another OEX RAES
account or terminating membership with the Exchange. The Commission believes that these fees should deter participating
OEX RAES market makers from abandoning their commitment to RAES for other than good cause. Nevertheless, the Commission
expects the CBOE to monitor OEX RAES participation and to consider altering the requirements should adequate participation
not be maintained after these changes are implemented, particularly during periods of high volatility.





In addition, the Commission believes that the proposal to allow a member to apply to the OFPC for prospective relief
from the requirement to log onto RAES on the business day prior to expiration is designed to provide flexibility and
to accommodate the needs of individual members while continuing to ensure adequate RAES participation. The Commission
notes that the proposal allows the OFPC to limit the grant of relief by imposing time periods during which the applicant
will not be eligible to participate in RAES.

The Commission believes that the proposal is also consistent with section 6(b)(5) under the Act in that it is designed
to facilitate transactions in securities. The CBOE believes that the current $500.00 fee for failures to comply with
the OEX RAES log-on and log-off requirements is excessive in light of the log-on and log-off requirements established
under the RAES Approval Order. Based upon this determination, the Commission believes that it is reasonable for the
Exchange to replace the current $500.00 fee with a graduated fee schedule and allow the Exchange to impose higher fees
for repeated failures, which should encourage compliance with the log-on and log-off requirements and may increase
the Exchange's ability to deter repeat offenders. The CBOE has distributed an Exchange Bulletin describing the new
fee schedule and the application of the fees to April 30, 1993, the effective date for implementation of the original
$500.00 fee. The Commission believes that this notification, and the fact that the graduated fees will be lower than
the fees that the CBOE can impose currently under the original $500.00 fee, help to ensure that the fees for failures
to comply with the log-on and log-off requirements are imposed fairly.

Moreover, the Commission believes that the right to appeal the fees imposed under CBOE Rule 24.17 pursuant to Chapter
19 of the CBOE's rules should help to safeguard the procedural rights of OEX RAES participants. In summary, under these
limited and unusual circumstances, the Commission believes that the CBOE may implement these lower fees as of April
30, 1993.

It is therefore ordered, pursuant to section 19(b)(2) of the Act,
 that the proposed rule change (SR-CBOE-94-12), is hereby approved.






For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Notice of Filing of Proposed Rule Change by Chicago Stock Exchange, Inc., Relating
to Corporate Governance Issues</DOCTITLE>



July 14, 1994.



Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby
given that on June 23, 1994, the Chicago Stock Exchange, Inc. (``CHX'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (``Commission'' or ``SEC'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II and III below,
which Items have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization. On June 30, 1994, the Exchange submitted to the
Commission Amendment No. 1 to the proposed rule change in order to narrow the scope of the original filing.
 The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons.





I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change



The CHX proposes to submit the following rule proposal to amend Article III, Sec. 2 and Article IV, Secs. 4, 5 and 7 of
the Exchange's Constitution relating to corporate governance issues. The text of the proposed rule change is available
at the Commission.



II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose
of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text
of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The self-regulatory organization has
prepared summaries, set forth in Sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.



A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



1. Purpose



The purpose of the proposed change is to amend the Exchange's Constitution relating to corporate governance issues.
Specifically, the changes concern (i) the creation of a new category of Governor and the addition of one additional
non-member Governor and (ii) providing more flexibility by permitting re-categorizations of Governors.

The primary purpose of these proposed amendments, along with corresponding and conforming amendments to the By-Laws
of the Midwest Clearing Corporation (``MCC'') and the Midwest Securities Trust Company (``MSTC''),
 is to achieve a governance structure pursuant to which the Exchange and two of its wholly owned subsidiaries, MCC and
MSTC, will be able to operate more as a single, coherently run business. Once all the proposed changes are adopted,
approved and implemented, the Board of Governors of the Exchange, the Board of Directors of the MCC and the Board of
Directors of MSTC would all consist of the same 31 individuals. This would be achieved by, among other things, having
the Nominating Committees of MCC and MSTC be the same as the Exchange's Nominating Committee. At the same time, in order
to insure fair and meaningful representation of Participants in the governance process of MCC and MSTC, the size of
the Board would be increased by four slots to accommodate a new category of Governor that would provide the Board with
more expertise on issues affecting MCC and MSTC, as more fully described below. 





New Category of Governor/Increased Board Size



The proposed amendment would create a new category of Governor, a Participant Governor. In order to be qualified to
be a Participant Governor, a person must be a general partner or officer of a Participant in the MCC or MSTC and must have
securities clearance and/or settlement expertise, background or responsibilities. The proposal would call for
the addition of four Participant Governors, one each in Class I and Class II and two in Class III. The Exchange does not
contemplate that the vacancies in the Participant Governor category would be filled by floor members of the Exchange.
 The proposed amendment also would add an additional non-member Governor slot, increasing the slots available for
non-member Governors from eight to nine. This slot has been added to Class II. This change would maintain the existing
balance between the non-member, or ``public,'' Governors and the industry Governors on the Board. In order to accomplish
these changes, the amendment would increase the size of the Board of Governors to 31 from its present size of 26. Pursuant
to existing Exchange rules, the vacancies created by this amendment (one vacancy in Class I, two vacancies in Class
II and two vacancies in Class III) could be filled by the Board, on an interim basis, until the April 1995 annual election.
The slots created are as follows:

Re-Categorization of Governors


In order to provide increased flexibility in the composition of the new, expanded Board, the proposed amendment also
would permit a Participant Governor to be re-categorized (within his or her class) as a Member Governor and permit
a Member Governor to be re-categorized as a Participant Governor, if the Governor to be re-categorized otherwise
meets the qualifications of his or her new position.


2. Statutory Basis


The proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6(b)(5) of the Act in that it is designed to promote just and equitable
principles of trade, to remove impediments and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and a national market
system and, in general, to protect investors and the public interest.


B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition


The Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any burden on competition.


C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received from Members, Participants
or Others


The proposed rule change has been approved by the Exchange's membership.


III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action


Within 35 days of the publication of this notice in the 

Federal Register

 or within such other period (i) as the Commission may designate up to 90 days of such date if it finds such longer period
to be appropriate and publishes its reasons for so finding or (ii) as to which the self-regulatory organization consents,
the Commission will:
(A) By order approve the proposed rule change, or
(B) Institute proceedings to determine whether the proposed rule change should be disapproved.


IV. Solicitation of Comments


Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; The Chicago Board Options Exchange, Incorporated; Notice of Filing and Immediate
Effectiveness of a Proposed Rule Change Relating to a Fee Reduction Plan</DOCTITLE>


July 14, 1994.



Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''),
 notice is hereby given that on July 7, 1994, the Chicago Board Options Exchange, Incorporated (the ``CBOE'' or the
``Exchange'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described
in Items I, II, and III below, which items have been prepared by the CBOE. The Commission is publishing this notice to
solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons.





I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change



The CBOE proposes to amend its fee reduction plan, which has been in effect since July 1, 1992.



II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



In its filing with the Commission, the CBOE included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed
rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be
examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The CBOE has prepared summaries, set forth in sections (A), (B),
and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.



A. Self-Regulatory Organizations's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



The purpose of the proposed rule change is to amend the Exchange's fee reduction plan. The plan, which was initially
adopted on July 1, 1992 and subsequently amended in July 1993, provides that if Exchange volume levels exceed a pre-determined
threshold at the end of any fiscal quarter, specified fees will be reduced the following quarter in accordance with
the schedule. The proposed amendments are the product of the Exchange's annual budget review and are structured to
accommodate the capital needs of the Exchange for the coming year. The amendments will take effect for the new fiscal
year commencing July 1, 1994.

The proposed rule change amends the current fee reduction thresholds and amounts. The minimum threshold for a fee
reduction is raised from 525,000 to 550,000 year to date contract volume. The reduction in the market-maker fees has
been lowered $.05 to $.10 for five of the eight thresholds. The member dues fee reduction of 25% to 100% is given at higher
thresholds. The proposed rule change also replaces the trade match fee reduction schedule with a fee reduction schedule
for floor brokerage fees.
 In all other respects, the fee reduction program remains unchanged.





The proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6(b) of the Act in general, and Section 6(b)(4) in particular,
by providing for the equitable allocation among CBOE members of reasonable dues, fees, and charges.





B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition



CBOE does not believes that the proposed rule change imposes any burden on competition not necessary or appropriate
in furtherance of the purposes of the Act.



C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants,
or Others



Comments on the proposed rule change have not been solicited or received.



III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action



The foregoing rule change has become effective pursuant to Section 19(b)(3)(A)(ii) of the Act and subparagraph (e)(2)
of Securities Exchange Act Rule 19b-4 in that the proposed rule change establishes or changes a due, fee, or other
charge imposed by the Exchange. At any time within sixty days of the filing of such proposed rule change, the Commission
may summarily abrogate such rule change if it appears to the Commission that such action is necessary or appropriate
in the public interest, for the protection of investors, or otherwise in furtherance of the purposes of the Act.



IV. Solicitation of Comments



Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views, and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying in the Commission's
Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street, N.W., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of such filing will also be available
for inspection and copying at the principal office of CBOE. All submissions should refer to file number SR-CBOE-94-23
and should be submitted by August 10, 1994.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Order Approving a Proposed Rule Change by the Municipal Securities Rulemaking
Board Relating to Recordkeeping and Record Retention Requirements Concerning Gifts and Gratuities</DOCTITLE>



July 13, 1994.



On May 26, 1994, the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (``Board'' or ``MSRB'') submitted to the Securities and
Exchange Commission (``Commission'') a proposed rule change (File No. SR-MSRB-94-7) pursuant
to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'').
 The MSRB filed the proposed rule change to require brokers, dealers, and municipal securities dealers (hereinafter
``municipal securities dealers'' or ``dealers'') to make and keep records relating to MSRB rule G-20. The Commission
published notice of the proposal in the 

Federal Register

 on June 10, 1994.
 No comments were received. For the reasons discussed below, the Commission is approving the proposed rule change.






I. Description



The proposal amends MSRB rules G-8 and G-9 concerning the records to be made and kept by municipal securities
dealers. The proposal will require a dealer to make and keep records relating to MSRB rule G-20, concerning gifts
and gratuities and contracts of employment. The proposal will become effective 30 days after publication of the approval
order in the 

Federal Register

.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940720-2-00147 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940720-2-00082 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The proposal requires dealers to keep and retain specific records of (i) gifts and gratuities subject to paragraph
(a) of rule G-20, and (ii) contracts of employment or agreements for compensation for services, referred to
in paragraph (c) of rule G-20, and compensation paid as a result of those agreements.
 Rule G-20(a) prohibits dealers from, directly or indirectly, giving or permitting to be given any thing or service
of value in excess of $100 per year to any person, other than to an employee or partner of the dealer, in relation to municipal
securities activities of the person's employer.







The $100 limitation applies to gifts and gratuities by a dealer and its associated persons to customers, individuals
associated with issuers, and employees of other dealers. Rule G-20 also prohibits a dealer from indirectly
exceeding the $100 limitation. Thus, if a third party (

e.g.

, a consultant hired by a dealer) gives a gift to any such person at the request of the dealer, the value of the gift would
be included in the $100 limitation.

Rule G-20(b) exempts certain gifts from the $100 annual limit. These gifts, called ``normal business dealings,''
include occasional gifts of meals or tickets to theatrical, sporting, and other entertainments, as well as the sponsoring
of legitimate business functions that are recognized by the IRS as deductible business expenses, and gifts of reminder
advertising. The rule, however, also provides that such gifts cannot be so frequent or so expensive as to raise a suggestion
of unethical conduct.

Rule G-20(c) provides that contracts of employment with or compensation for services rendered are not considered
gifts or gratuities subject to the $100 limitation. Such arrangements, however, must be in writing and must include
the nature of the proposed services, the amount of the proposed compensation, and the written consent of such person's
employer.



II. Discussion



The proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act, and specifically, with Sections 15B(b)(2)
(C) and (G) of the Act.
 Section 15B(b)(2)(C) authorizes the MSRB to adopt rules designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and
practices, to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to foster cooperation and coordination with persons
engaged in regulating transactions in municipal securities, to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism
of a free and open market in municipal securities and, in general, to protect investors and the public interest. Section
15B(b)(2)(G) authorizes the MSRB to adopt rules that prescribe the records to be made and kept by municipal securities
dealers and the periods for which such records shall be preserved.





Rule G-20 is intended to prevent fraud and inappropriate influence in the municipal securities market by limiting
the amount of gifts or gratuities from municipal securities dealers to persons not employed by the dealers, including
issuer officials and employees of other dealers, in relation to municipal securities activities.
 Concerns have arisen recently that political contributions and gifts, made by municipal securities underwriters
to officials of municipal securities issuers, may influence the selection process of an underwriting syndicate.
 The proposal addresses excessive gifts and gratuities by dealers to persons not employed by the dealer, including
officials of municipal securities issuers.






Although rule G-20 prohibits dealers from making certain gifts and gratuities, dealers currently are not required
to keep a record of such gifts. Recordkeeping and record retention by dealers of gifts and gratuities will better enable
dealers to monitor compliance with rule G-20. The proposal also will assist enforcement agencies in monitoring
dealer compliance with the rule. In addition, the proposal will enable the MSRB to determine whether rule G-20
should be amended in the future to impose more stringent requirements to prevent influence of the underwriter selection
process and to maintain the integrity of the municipal securities market.



III. Conclusion



For the foregoing reasons, the Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the Act an the rules
and regulations thereunder applicable to the MSRB and, in particular, Sections 15B(b)(2) (C) and (G).

It Is Therefore Ordered, pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act, that the proposed rule change as described above
be, and hereby is, approved and shall be effective August 19, 1994.




For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority, 17 CFR 200.30-3(a)(12).

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; The Options Clearing Corporation; Notice of Filing of a Proposed Rule Change Relating
to Flexibly Structured Cross-Rate Foreign Currency Options</DOCTITLE>



July 13, 1994.



Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''),
 notice is hereby given that on June 6, 1994, The Options Clearing Corporation (``OCC'') filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II, and III below, which
Items have been prepared primarily by OCC. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed
rule change from interested persons.





I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change



The purpose of the proposed rule change is to enable OCC to issue, clear, and settle new flexibly structured cross-rate
foreign currency option contracts.



II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



In its filing with the Commission, OCC included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule
change. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. OCC has prepared summaries,
set forth in sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.



A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



The purpose of this filing is to enable OCC to issue, clear, and settle new flexibly structured cross-rate foreign
currency option contracts proposed for trading by the Philadelphia Stock Exchange (``PHLX'').
 In OCC's original cross-rate foreign currency options filing, OCC sought and obtained approval to issue, clear,
and settle the following cross-rate option contracts: (1) options on German Deutsche marks with exercise prices
in Japanese yen (``DM/JY'' options); (2) options on British pounds with exercise prices in Japanese yen (``BP/JY
options''); and (3) options on British pounds with exercise prices in German Deutsche marks (``BP/DM options'').
 In that filing, OCC advised the Commission that it anticipated clearing additional cross-rate option contracts
in the future, including cross-rate option contracts involving different combinations of currencies. OCC stated
that it would submit a rule filing with the Commission before issuing any new cross-rate option products.






OCC was recently advised by the PHLX that it is proposing to trade new flexibly structured cross-rate options through
the PHLX's customized option facility. Under the PHLX proposal, options may be traded on any combination of currencies
underlying existing foreign currency option contracts.
 For example, options on British pounds with exercise prices in French francs (``BP/FF options'') may be traded.





Accordingly, OCC is proposing to issue, clear, and settle these new cross-rate option contracts. OCC has reviewed
its By-Laws and Rules and has determined that no changes are necessary to accommodate these new products because they
will be margined and settled like the existing cross-rate option contracts.

The proposed rule change is consistent with the purposes and requirements of Section 17A of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended, because it will provide for the prompt and accurate settlement of transactions in new cross-rate
foreign currency option contracts and for the safeguarding of related securities and funds. The proposed rule change
meets such requirements by establishing a framework in which existing, reliable OCC systems, rules, and procedures
will be extended to the processing of such cross-rate foreign currency options.



B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition



OCC does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any burden on competition.

C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received from Members, Participants,
or Others



Written comments were not and are not intended to be solicited with respect to the proposed rule change, and none have
been received.



III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action



Within thirty-five days of the date of publication of this notice in the 

Federal Register

 or within such longer period (i) as the Commission may designate up to ninety days of such date if it finds such longer
period to be appropriate and publishes its reasons for so finding or (ii) as to which the self-regulatory organization
consents, the Commission will:

(A) by order approve the proposed rule change or

(B) institute proceedings to determine whether the proposed rule change should be disapproved.



IV. Solicitation of Comments



Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views, and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C.  552, will be available for inspection and copying in the Commission's
Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of such filing will also be available
for inspection and copying at the principal office of the above-referenced self-regulatory organization.

All submissions should refer to File No. SR-OCC-94-07 and should be submitted by August 10, 1994.

ACTION: 

Notice of application for exemption under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the ``Act'').






APPLICANTS:

 First North American Life Assurance Company (``First North American''), FNAL Variable Account (``Variable Account''),
NASL Financial Services, Inc. (``NASL Financial'') and Wood Logan Associates Inc. (``Wood Logan'').




Relevant 1940 Act Sections:

 Exemption requested under Section 6(c) from Sections 26(a)(2)(C) and 27(c)(2).



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY OF APPLICATION: 

Applicants seek an order to the extent necessary to permit the deduction from the assets of the Variable Account of
a mortality and expense risks charge imposed under certain flexible purchase payment individual deferred variable
annuity contracts.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Following is a summary of the application. The complete application is available for a fee from the SEC's Public Reference
Branch. 


Applicants' Representations



1. First North American, a wholly owned subsidiary of North American Security Life Insurance Company (``Security
Life''), is a stock life insurance company organized under the laws of New York in 1992. Security Life is a wholly owned
subsidiary of North American Life Assurance Company. First North American is the depositor of the Variable Account.
The Variable Account is registered under the Act as a unit investment trust and was established under New York law to
offer certain variable annuity contracts, including the variable annuity contracts described in the application
(the ``Contracts''). The Variable Account is divided into sub-accounts which invest in corresponding portfolios
of NASL Series Trust (the ``Trust'').

2. NASL Financial, a wholly owned subsidiary of Security Life, is the principal underwriter of the Contracts. It is
a broker-dealer registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``1934 Act'') and a member of the National Association
of Securities Dealers, Inc. NASL Financial also serves as investment adviser to the Trust and is registered as an investment
adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.

3. Wood Logan, a Connecticut corporation registered as a broker-dealer under the 1934 Act, serves as the exclusive
promotional agent for the Contracts.

4. The Contracts are flexible purchase payment individual deferred variable annuity contracts which will provide
for the accumulation of values and the payment of annuity benefits on a fixed or variable basis. The Contracts are designed
for use in connection with retirement plans which may or may not qualify for special income tax treatment under the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.

5. Prior to the maturity date, First North American will, on the last day of each contract year, deduct from the accumulated
value of each Contract an annual administration fee of $30. This annual administration fee will also be deducted when
a Contract is surrendered on any date other than a contract anniversary. However, if prior to the maturity date the
contract value exceeds $100,000 at the time of the fee's assessment, the fee will be waived. During the annuity period,
the fee is deducted on a pro-rata basis from each annuity payment. In addition, First North American will deduct from
the sub-accounts each valuation period an administration charge equal to .15% of the sub-account assets on an annualized
basis. These fees are intended to compensate First North American for the cost of providing administrative services
attributable to the Contracts and the operations of the Variable Account and the Company in connection with the Contracts.
The fees are based upon First North American's current estimates of the administrative costs attributable to the
Contracts over their lifetime and are not designed or expected to generate a profit. These fees are guaranteed never
to be increased. Applicants will rely on Rule 26a-1 under the Act for the necessary exemptive relief to charge
such fees.

6. No sales charge will be deducted from purchase payments as they are made. Instead, a withdrawal charge (contingent
deferred sales charge) will be assessed in some circumstances when the contract value is completely or partially
withdrawn prior to the maturity date. Generally, a withdrawal charge only applies to the withdrawal of purchase payments
that have been in the Contract less than seven complete years. The withdrawal charge is a percentage of the amount withdrawn
which is subject to the charge, which percentage declines 6-6-5-5-4-3-2% over
the first seven years that a purchase payment has been in the Contract. Withdrawals are allocated first to earnings
and then to purchase payments on a first-in-first-out basis. There is no withdrawal charge with respect to withdrawals
of investment earnings and certain other free withdrawal amounts. Under no circumstances will the total of all withdrawal
charges exceed 6% of total purchase payments made. The withdrawal charge is intended to reimburse First North American
for compensation paid to cover selling concessions to broker-dealers, preparation of sales literature and other
expenses relating to sales activity. Applicants will rely on Rule 6c-8 under the Act for the necessary exemptive
relief to permit imposition of the withdrawal charge.

7. First North American assumes mortality and expense risks under the Contracts. The mortality risk is the risk that
annuitants may live for a longer period of time than estimated. First North American assumes this mortality risk by
virtue of annuity rates incorporated into the Contract, which cannot be changed. This assures each annuitant that
his longevity will not have an adverse effect on the amount of annuity payments. Also, First North American guarantees
that if the owner dies before the maturity date, it will pay a death benefit. The expense risk assumed by First North
American is the risk that the administration fees, which fees cannot be increased, may be insufficient to cover actual
expenses. To compensate it for assuming these risks, First North American will deduct from each sub-account a charge
each valuation period at an effective annual rate of 1.25%, consisting of .80% for mortality risks and .45% for expense
risks. The rate of the mortality and expense risk charge cannot be increased. If the mortality and expense risk charge
is insufficient to cover the actual cost of the mortality and expense risk undertaking, First North American will
bear the loss. Conversely, if the charge proves more than sufficient, the excess will be profit to First North American
and will be available for any proper corporate purpose including, among other things, payment of distribution expenses.



Applicants' Legal Analysis



1. Section 6(c) of the 1940 Act provides, in pertinent part, that the Commission, by order upon application, may conditionally
or unconditionally exempt any persons, securities, or transactions from any provision of the 1940 Act if and to the
extent that such exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection
of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the 1940 Act.

2. Section 27(c)(2) of the 1940 Act prohibits the issuer of a periodic payment plan certificate, and any depositor
or underwriter for such issuer, from selling such periodic payment plan certificate unless proceeds of payments
on such certificates (other than sales loads) are held under an indenture or agreement containing specified provisions.
Section 26(a)(2) and the Rules thereunder do not permit a deduction from the assets of a separate account for mortality
and expense risk charges.

3. Applicants represent that the 1.25% mortality and expense risk charge is within the range of industry practice
for comparable annuity products. Applicants state that this representation is based upon an analysis of publicly
available information about selected similar industry products, taking into consideration such factors as the
method used in charging sales loads, any contractual right to increase charges above current levels and the existence
of charges against separate account assets for other than mortality and expense risks. First North American will
maintain at its principal office, available to the Commission, a memorandum setting forth in detail the products
analyzed in the course of, and the methodology and results of, the comparative survey made.

4. Applicants acknowledge that the withdrawal charge will be insufficient to cover all costs relating to the distribution
of the Contracts and that, if a profit is realized from the mortality and expense risk charge, all or a portion of such
profit may be offset by distribution expenses not reimbursed by the withdrawal charge. First North American has concluded
that there is a reasonable likelihood that the proposed distribution financing arrangements made with respect to
the Contracts will benefit the Variable Account and the contract owners. The basis for such conclusion is set forth
in a memorandum which will be maintained by First North American at its principal office and will be available to the
Commission.

5. First North American represents that the Variable Account will invest only in an underlying mutual fund which undertakes,
in the event it should adopt any plan under Rule 12b-1 to finance distribution expenses, to have such plan formulated
and approved by a board of directors, a majority of the members of which are not ``interested persons'' of such fund
within the meaning of section 2(a)(19) of the Act.



Conclusion



Applicants submit that for the reasons and upon the facts set forth above, the exemptions requested are necessary
and appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended
by the policy and provisions of the Act.

Branch.


Applicants' Representations




1. Security Life, a wholly owned subsidiary of North American Life Assurance Company, is a stock life insurance company
organized under the laws of Delaware in 1979. Security Life is the depositor of the Variable Account. The Variable
Account is registered under the Act as a unit investment trust and was established, under Delaware law, to offer certain
variable annuity contracts, including the variable contracts described in the application (the ``Contracts'').
The Variable Account is divided into sub-accounts which invest in corresponding portfolios of NASL Series Trust
(the ``Trust'').

2. NASL Financial, a wholly owned subsidiary of Security Life, is the principal underwriter of the Contracts. NASL
Financial also serves as investment adviser to the Trust.

3. Wood Logan, a Connecticut corporation registered as a broker-dealer under the 1934 Act, serves as the exclusive
promotional agent for the Contracts.

4. The Contracts are flexible purchase payment individual and group deferred variable annuity contracts which will
provide for the accumulation of values and the payment of annuity benefits on a fixed or variable basis. The Contracts
are designed for use in connection with retirement plans that may or may not qualify for special income tax treatment
under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.

5. Prior to the maturity date, Security Life will, on the last day of each contract year, deduct from the accumulated
value of each Contract an annual administration fee of $30. This annual administration fee will also be deducted when
a Contract is surrendered on any date other than a contract anniversary. However, if prior to the maturity date the
contract value exceeds $100,000 at the time of the fee's assessment, the fee will be waived. During the annuity period,
the fee is deducted on a pro-rata basis from each annuity payment. In addition, Security Life will deduct from the sub-accounts
each valuation period an administration charge equal to .15% of the sub-account assets on an annualized basis. These
fees are intended to compensate Security Life for the cost of providing administrative services attributable to
the Contracts and the operations of the Variable Account and the Company in connection with the Contracts. The fees
are based upon Security Life's current estimates of the administrative costs attributable to the Contracts over
their lifetime and are not designed or expected to generate a profit. In the case of individual Contracts, these fees
are guaranteed never to be increased. For group Contracts, these fees may be modified by Security Life on 60 days notice
to the group holder of the Contract, provided that such modification shall apply only to certificates issued under
the Contract after the effective date of the modification. Applicants will rely on Rule 26a-1 under the Act for
the necessary exemptive relief to charge such fees.

6. No sales charge will be deducted from purchase payments as they are made. Instead, a withdrawal charge (contingent
deferred sales charge) will be assessed in some circumstances when the contract value is completely or partially
withdrawn prior to the maturity date. Generally, a withdrawal charge only applies to the withdrawal of purchase payments
that have been in the Contract less than seven complete years. The withdrawal charge is a percentage of the amount withdrawn
which is subject to the charge, which percentage declines 6-6-5-5-4-3-2% over
the first seven years that a purchase payment has been in the Contract. Withdrawals are allocated first to earnings
and then to purchase payments on a first-in-first-out basis. There is no withdrawal charge with respect to withdrawals
of investment earnings and certain other free withdrawal amounts. under no circumstances will the total of all withdrawal
charges exceed 6% of total purchase payments made. In the case of group Contracts only, the withdrawal charge may be
modified by Security Life on 60 days written notice to the group holder of the Contract, provided that the modification
shall apply only to certificates issued under the Contract after the effective date of the modification. The withdrawal
charge is intended to reimburse Security Life for compensation paid to cover selling concessions to broker-dealers,
preparation of sales literature and other expenses relating to sales activity. Applicants will rely on Rule 6c-8
under the Act for the necessary exemptive relief to permit imposition of the withdrawal charge.
7. Security Life assumes mortality and expense risks under the Contracts. The mortality risk is the risk that annuitants
may live for a longer period of time than estimated. Security Life assumes this mortality risk by virtue of annuity
rates incorporated into the Contract, which for individual Contracts cannot be changed and in the case of group Contracts,
cannot be changed for outstanding certificates. This assures each annuitant that his longevity will not have an adverse
effect on the amount of annuity payments. Also, Security Life guarantees that if the owner dies before the maturity
date, it will pay a death benefit. The expense risk assumed by Security Life is the risk that the administration fees,
which fees cannot be increased for individual Contracts or outstanding certificates, may be insufficient to cover
actual expenses.To compensate it for assuming these risks, Security Life will deduct from each sub-account a charge
each valuation period at an effective annual rate of 1.25%, consisting of .80% for mortality risks and .45% for expense
risks.
8. The rate of the mortality and expense risk charge cannot be increased for individual Contracts. The rate may be increased
for group Contracts but only for certificates issued after the effective date of the Contract. Applicants acknowledge
that if the mortality and expense charge is increased, further exemptive relief may be necessary. Security Life reserve
the right to issue group Contracts and certificates with a lower mortality and expense risk charge where it determines
that the risks of the group involved are less than for the persons for whom the Contracts and certificates were originally
designed. If the mortality and expense risk charge is insufficient to cover the actual cost of the mortality and expense
risk undertaking, Security Life will bear the loss. Conversely, if the charge proves more than sufficient, the excess
will be profit to Security Life and will be available for any proper corporate purpose including, among other things,
payment of distribution expenses.

Applicants' Representations



1. Security Life, a wholly owned subsidiary of North American Life Assurance Company, is a stock life insurance company
organized under the laws of Delaware in 1979. Security Life is the depositor of the Variable Account. The Variable
Account is registered under the Act as a unit investment trust and was established, under Delaware law, to offer certain
variable annuity contracts, including the variable contracts described in the application (the ``Contracts'').
The Variable Account is divided into sub-accounts which invest in corresponding portfolios of NASL Series Trust
(the ``Trust'').

2. NASL Financial, a wholly owned subsidiary of Security Life, is the principal underwriter of the Contracts. NASL
Financial also serves as investment adviser to the Trust.

3. Wood Logan, a Connecticut corporation registered as a broker-dealer under the 1934 Act, serves as the exclusive
promotional agent for the Contracts.

4. The Contracts are flexible purchase payment individual deferred variable annuity contracts which will provide
for the accumulation of values on a variable basis and the payment of benefits on a fixed or variable basis. The Contracts
are designed for use in connection with retirement plans that may or may not qualify for special income tax treatment
under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The minimum initial purchase payment for the Contracts will be
$25,000.

5. Security Life reserves the right to charge an annual administration fee if the contract value of a Contract drops
below $10,000 as the result of a partial withdrawal. In such event, Security Life may, on the last day of each contract
year, deduct from the contract value of such Contract an annual administration fee of $30. This annual administration
fee may also be deducted under such a Contract if the Contract is surrendered on any date other than a contract anniversary.
In addition, Security Life will deduct from the sub-accounts each valuation period an administration charge equal
to .25% of the sub-account assets on an annualized basis. These fees are intended to compensate Security Life for the
cost of providing administrative services attributable to the Contracts and the operations of the Variable Account
and the Company in connection with the Contracts.

Applicants represent that the fees are based upon Security Life's estimates of the administrative costs for such
services over the lifetime of the Contracts, are guaranteed never to be increased, and are not designed or expected
to generate a profit. Applicants rely on Rule 26a-1 under the Act to assess such fees.

6. No sales charge will be deducted from purchase payments as they are made. Instead, Security Life will deduct from
the sub-accounts each valuation period a distribution fee equal to .15% of sub-account assets on an annualized basis,
and prior to the maturity date, a 3% withdrawal charge (contingent deferred sales charge) will be assessed in circumstances
where complete or partial withdrawals are attributed to purchase payments made within three years prior to the date
of the withdrawal. Applicants represent that the distribution fee and the withdrawal charge are intended to reimburse
Security Life for compensation paid to cover selling concessions to broker-dealers, preparation of sales literature
and other expenses relating to sales activity. Applicants rely on Rule 6c-8 under the Act to impose the withdrawal
charge. 

7. To compensate it for assuming mortality and expense risks under the 
Contracts, Security Life deducts from each sub-account a charge each valuation period at an effective annual rate
of 1.25%, consisting of .80% for the mortality risks and .45% for the expense risks. The rate of the mortality and expense
risk charge cannot be increased. 

8. The Mortality risk assumed by Security Life under the Contracts is the risk that annuitants may live for a longer
period of time than estimated. Security Life assumes this mortality risk by virtue of annuity rates incorporated
into the Contract which cannot be changed. This assures each annuitant that his longevity will not have an adverse
effect on the amount of annuity payments. Also, Security Life guarantees that if the owner dies before the maturity
date, it will pay a death benefit. The expense risk assumed by Security Life is the risk that the administration fees,
which cannot be increased, may be insufficient to cover actual expenses. If the mortality and expense risk charge
is insufficient to cover the actual cost of the mortality and expense risk undertakings, Security Life will bear the
loss. Conversely, if the charge proves more than sufficient, the excess will be profit to Security Life and will be
available for any proper corporate purpose including, among other things, payment of distribution expenses. 



Applicants' Legal Analysis 




1. Section 6(c) of the 1940 Act provides, in pertinent part, that the Commission, by order upon application, may conditionally
or unconditionally exempt any persons, securities, or transactions from any provision of the 1940 Act if and to the
extent that such exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection
of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the 1940 Act.

2. Section 27(c)(2) of the 1940 Act prohibits the issuer of a periodic payment plan certificate, and any depositor
or underwriter for such issuer, from selling such periodic payment plan certificate unless proceeds of payments
on such certificates (other than sales loads) are held under an indenture or agreement containing specified provisions.
Section 26(a)(2) and the Rules thereunder do not permit a deduction from the assets of a separate account for mortality
and expense risk charges or distribution expense charges.

3. Applicants state that the proposed distribution fee is an appropriate method to help defray Security Life's costs
associated with the sale of the Contracts. Applicants represent that Security Life will monitor the performance
of the Variable Account to ensure that with respect to any Contract owner the cumulative sum of the distribution fee
and the withdrawal charge will not exceed 9% of the total premiums paid. Applicants state that assurance that the sum
of such charges will never exceed 9% of premiums paid can be obtained by monitoring the performance of the Variable
Account. Applicants represent that if the performance of the Variable Account should be so favorable so that it is
possible that the 9% limit may be reached under any outstanding Contract, Security Life will promptly commence monitoring
Contracts on an individual basis to make sure that the limit is not exceeded.

4. Applicants represent that the 1.25% mortality and expense risk charge is within the range of industry practice
for comparable annuity products. Applicants state that this representation is based upon an analysis of publicly
available information about selected similar industry products, taking into consideration such factors as the
method used in charging sales loads, any contractual right to increase charges above current levels and the existence
of charges against separate account assets for other than mortality and expense risks. Security Life will maintain
at its principal office, available to the Commission, a memorandum setting forth in detail the products analyzed
in the course of, and the methodology and results of, the comparative survey made.

5. Applicants acknowledge that the distribution fee and the withdrawal charge will be insufficient to cover all costs
relating to the distribution of the Contracts and that if a profit is realized from the mortality and expense risk charge,
all or a portion of such profit may be offset by distribution expenses not reimbursed by the distribution fee and the
withdrawal charge. Notwithstanding the above, Security Life has concluded that there is a reasonable likelihood
that the proposed distribution financing arrangements made with respect to the Contracts will benefit the Variable
Account and the Contract owners. The basis for such conclusion is set forth in a memorandum which will be maintained
by Security Life at its principal office and will be available to the Commission.

6. Security Life represents that the Variable Account will invest only in an underlying mutual fund which undertakes,
in the event it should adopt any plan under Rule 12b-1 to finance distribution expenses, to have such plan formulated
and approved by a board of directors, a majority of the members of which are not ``interested persons'' of such fund
within the meaning of Section 2(a)(19) of the Act.



Conclusion



Applicants submit that for the reasons and upon the facts set forth above, the exemptions requested are necessary
and appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended
by the policy and provisions of the Act.

of its status as an observer to the United Nations] or which engages in some aspect of the conduct of the international
affairs of such territory or political entity.'' (

See Palestine Information Office 

v. 

Shultz

, 853 F.2d 932, 937 (D.C. Cir. 1988).)



Pursuant to Section 4302(a)(1) of the Act, I hereby designate the acquisition by the PLO Office, or its agents or employees

(d) Financial services.

In addition, I hereby determine it to be reasonably necessary to accomplish the purposes set forth in section 204(b)
of the Act (22 U.S.C. 4304(b)) to require the PLO Office, and its agents or employees acting on its behalf, to comply
with the terms and conditions to be specified by the Director of the Office of Foreign Missions as a condition to the
execution or performance in the United States of any contract or other agreement, the acquisition, retention, or
use of any real property, or the application for or acceptance of any benefit (including any benefit from or authorized
by any Federal, State, or municipal governmental authority, or any entity providing public services).

Publication of this notice in the 

Federal Register 

constitutes notice to persons subject to the jurisdiction of the United States doing business with or providing goods
or services to the PLO Office that terms and conditions with respect to benefits as described herein are hereby imposed.

ACTION: 

Notice of receipt of petition for determination that nonconforming 1994 Volkswagen Golf III passenger cars are eligible
for importation.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This notice announces receipt by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) of a petition for a determination
that a 1994 Volkswagen Golf III that was not originally manufactured to comply with all applicable Federal motor vehicle
safety standards is eligible for importation into the United States because (1) it is substantially similar to a vehicle
that was originally manufactured for importation into and sale in the United States and that was certified by its manufacturer
as complying with the safety standards, and (2) it is capable of being readily modified to conform to the standards.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 



Background



Under 49 U.S.C. 30141(a)(1)(A) (formerly section 108(c)(3)(A)(i)(I) of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle
Safety Act (the Act)), a motor vehicle that was not originally manufactured to conform to all applicable Federal motor
vehicle safety standards shall be refused admission into the United States unless NHTSA has determined that the motor
vehicle is substantially similar to a motor vehicle originally manufactured for importation into and sale in the
United States, certified under 49 U.S.C. 30115 (formerly section 114 of the Act), and of the same model year as the model
of the motor vehicle to be compared, and is capable of being readily modified to conform to all applicable Federal motor
vehicle safety standards.

Petitions for eligibility determinations may be submitted by either manufacturers or importers who have registered
with NHTSA pursuant to 49 CFR Part 592. As specified in 49 CFR 593.7, NHTSA publishes notice in the 

Federal Register

 of each petition that it receives, and affords interested persons an opportunity to comment on the petition. At the
close of the comment period, NHTSA determines, on the basis of the petition and any comments that it has received, whether
the vehicle is eligible for importation. The agency then publishes this determination in the 

Federal Register

.

J.K. Motors of Kingsville, Maryland (``J.K.'') (Registered Importer No. R-90-006) has petitioned NHTSA
to determine whether 1994 Volkswagen Golf III passenger cars are eligible for importation into the United States.
The vehicle which J.K. believes is substantially similar is the 1994 Volkswagen Golf III that was manufactured for
importation into, and sale in, the United States and certified by its manufacturer, Volkswagenwerke A.G., as conforming
to all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety standards.

The petitioner claims that it carefully compared the non-U.S. certified 1994 Volkswagen Golf III to its U.S. certified
counterpart, and found the two vehicles to be substantially similar with respect to compliance with most Federal
motor vehicle safety standards.

J.K. submitted information with its petition intended to demonstrate that the non-U.S. certified 1994 Volkswagen
Golf III, as originally manufactured, conforms to many Federal motor vehicle safety standards in the same manner
as its U.S. certified counterpart, or is capable of being readily modified to conform to those standards.

Specifically, the petitioner claims that the non-U.S. certified 1994 Volkswagen Golf III is identical to its U.S.
certified counterpart with respect to compliance with Standards Nos. 102

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This notice announces the determination by NHTSA that 1992 Mercedes-Benz 190E passenger cars not originally manufactured

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Background



Under 49 U.S.C. 30141(a)(1)(A) (formerly section 108(c)(3)(A)(i)(I) of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle
Safety Act (the Act), a motor vehicle that was not originally manufactured to conform to all applicable Federal motor
vehicle safety standards shall be refused admission into the United States unless NHTSA has determined that the motor
vehicle is substantially similar to a motor vehicle originally manufactured for importation into and sale in the
United States, certified under 49 U.S.C. 30115 (formerly section 114 of the Act), and of the same model year as the model
of the motor vehicle to be compared, and is capable of being readily modified to conform to all applicable Federal motor
vehicle safety standards.




Petitions for eligibility determinations may be submitted by either manufacturers or importers who have registered
with NHTSA pursuant to 49 CFR Part 592. As specified in 49 CFR 593.7, NHSTA publishes notice in the 

Federal Register

 of each petition that it receives, and affords interested persons an opportunity to comment on the petition. At the
close of the comment period, NHTSA determines, on the basis of the petition and any comments that it has received, whether
the vehicle is eligible for importation. The agency then publishes this determination in the 

Federal Register

.

J.K. Motors, Inc. of Kingsville, Maryland (Registered Importer R-90-006) petitioned NHTSA to determine
whether 1992 Mercedes-Benz 190E passenger cars are eligible for importation into the United States. NHTSA published
notice of the petition on May 5, 1994 (59 FR 23256) to afford an opportunity for public comment. The reader is referred

Final Determination





Accordingly, on the basis of the foregoing, NHTSA hereby determines that a 1992 Mercedes-Benz 190E (Model ID 201.029)
not originally manufactured to comply with all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety standards is substantially
similar to a 1992 Mercedes-Benz 190E originally manufactured for importation into and sale in the United States and
certified under 49 U.S.,C. 30115, and is capable of being readily modified to conform to all applicable Federal motor

ACTION: 

Notice of receipt of petition for determination that nonconforming 1992 Ferrari 348TB passenger cars are eligible
for importation.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This notice announces receipt by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) of a petition for a determination
that a 1992 Ferrari 348TB that was not originally manufactured to comply with all applicable Federal motor vehicle
safety standards is eligible for importation into the United States because (1) it is substantially similar to a vehicle
that was originally manufactured for importation into and sale in the United States and that was certified by its manufacturer
as complying with the safety standards, and (2) it is capable of being readily modified to conform to the standards.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
Background




Under 49 U.S.C. 30141(a)(1)(A) (formerly section 108(c)(3)(A)(i)(I) of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle
Safety Act (the Act)), a motor vehicle that was not originally manufactured to conform to all applicable Federal motor
vehicle safety standards shall be refused admission into the United States unless NHTSA has determined that the motor
vehicle is substantially similar to a motor vehicle originally manufactured for importation into and sale in the
United States, certified under 49 U.S.C. 30115 (formerly section 114 of the Act), and of the same model year as the model
of the motor vehicle to be compared, and is capable of being readily modified to conform to all applicable Federal motor
vehicle safety standards.


Petitions for eligibility determinations may be submitted by either manufacturers or importers who have registered
with NHTSA pursuant to 49 CFR Part 592. As specified in 49 CFR 593.7, NHTSA publishes notice in the 

Federal Register

 of each petition that it receives, and affords interested persons an opportunity to comment on the petition. At the
close of the comment period, NHTSA determines, on the basis of the petition and any comments that it has received, whether
the vehicle is eligible for importation. The agency then publishes this determination in the 

Federal Register

.

Champagne Imports, Inc. of Lansdale, Pennsylvania (Registered Importer No. R-90-009) has petitioned
NHTSA to determine whether 1992 Ferrari 348TB passenger cars are eligible for importation into the United States.
The vehicle which Champagne believes is substantially similar is the 1992 Ferrari 348TB that was manufactured for
importation into and sale in the United States and certified by its manufacturer, Ferrari S.p.A., as conforming to
all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety standards.

The petitioner states that it carefully compared the non-U.S. certified 1992 Ferrari 348TB to its U.S. certified
counterpart, and found the two vehicles to be substantially similar with respect to compliance with most applicable
Federal motor vehicle safety standards.


Champagne submitted information with its petition intended to demonstrate that the non-U.S. certified 1992 Ferrari
348TB, as originally manufactured, conforms to many Federal motor vehicle safety standards in the same manner as
its U.S. certified counterpart, or is capable of being readily modified to conform to those standards.

Specifically, the petitioner claims that the non-U.S. certified 1992 Ferrari 348TB is identical to its U.S. certified
counterpart with respect to compliance with Standard Nos. 102 

Transmission Shift Lever Sequence * * * 103 Defrosting and Defogging Systems,

Additionally, the petitioner states that the non-U.S. certified 1992 Ferrari 348TB complies with the Bumper Standard
found in 49 CFR Part 581.

Petitioner also contends that the non-U.S. certified 1992 Ferrari 348TB is capable of being readily modified to meet
the following standards, in the manner indicated:

Standard No. 101 Controls and Displays:

 (a) substitution of a lens marked ``Brake'' for a lens with an ECE symbol on the brake failure indicator lamp; (b) installation
of a seat belt warning lamp; (c) recalibration of the speedometer/odometer from kilometers to miles per hour.

Standard No. 108

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document provides notice of the availability of Application Packages for the 1995 Tax Counseling for the Elderly
(TCE) Program.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Authority for the Tax Counseling for the Elderly (TCE) Program is contained in Section 163 of the Revenue Act of 1978,
Pub. L. 95-600, (92 Stat. 12810), November 6, 1978. Regulations were published in the 

Federal Register

 at 44 FR 72113 on December 13, 1979. Section 163 gives Internal Revenue Service authority to enter into cooperative
agreements with private or public non-profit agencies or organizations to establish a network of trained volunteers
to provide free tax information and return preparation assistance to elderly individuals. Elderly individuals
are defined as individual age 60 and over at the close of their taxable year. 



Cooperative agreements will be entered into based upon competition among eligible agencies and organizations.
Because applications are being solicited before the FY 1995 budget has been approved, cooperative agreements will
be entered into subject to appropriation of funds. Once funded, sponsoring agencies and organizations will receive
a grant from the IRS for administrative expenses and to reimburse volunteers for expenses incurred in training and
in providing tax return assistance. The Tax Counseling for the Elderly (TCE) Program is referenced in the Catalog
of Federal Domestic Assistance in Section 21.006.
