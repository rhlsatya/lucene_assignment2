Airworthiness Directives; Bell Helicopter Textron, Inc. Model 214ST Helicopters 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Federal Aviation Administration, DOT.

 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.

 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to Bell Helicopter Textron, Inc. Model 214ST
helicopters, that requires creation of a component history card and establishes an additional retirement life for
the main rotor mast (mast). This amendment is prompted by fatigue analysis and retesting that showed that the mast
is sensitive to frequent takeoffs and external load lifts (high-power events) in addition to time-in-service. The
actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent fatigue failure of the mast, loss of the main rotor system, and
subsequent loss of control of the helicopter. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations to include an airworthiness directive (AD) that is
applicable to Bell Helicopter Textron, Inc. Model 214ST helicopters was published in the 

Federal Register

 on November 12, 1993 (58 FR 59967). That action proposed to require creation of a component historical service record
and proposed to establish an additional retirement life of 50,000 high-power events for the main rotor mast (mast),
part number (P/N) 214-040-090-109. Currently, the mast has a retirement life of 10,000 hours' time-in-service.



Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. No comments
were received on the proposal or the FAA's determination of the cost to the public. The FAA has determined that air safety
and the public interest require the adoption of the rule as proposed with some editorial changes. The FAA has determined
that these changes will neither increase the economic burden on any operator nor increase the scope of the AD. 
In the notice, the cost estimates associated with this AD were based on replacement of the mast and creation of the component
history card for the entire fleet. This rule contains cost estimates for one-sixth of the fleet each year instead of
the entire fleet, as in the notice. Additionally, the notice referred to the component history card as a ``historical
service record or component history card''. This rule refers to it as a ``component history card or an equivalent record.''
Also, paragraph (d) of this rule was expanded to specify the details of the new retirement life. These changes will
not increase the scope of the AD. However, the FAA has performed a more detailed cost analysis and has determined that,
when factoring in the creation and maintenance of the component history card or equivalent record, the anticipated
costs are $9,163 higher than the proposed amount for the first year, and $7,879 higher than the proposed amount for
each subsequent year. In the proposal, the cost of this AD was estimated to be $53,970 each year ($323,820 for the total
fleet). 
The FAA estimates that 14 helicopters of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, that (1) it will take approximately
24 work hours per helicopter to replace the affected part due to the new method of determining the retirement life required
by this AD, (2) it will take approximately 2 work hours per helicopter to create the component history card or equivalent
record (record), (3) it will take approximately 10 work hours per helicopter to maintain the record each year, and
(4) the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Required parts will cost approximately $21,810 per helicopter. Based
on these figures, the total cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators for the first year is estimated to be $63,133, and
each subsequent year to be $61,849. These costs assume replacement of the mast in one-sixth of the fleet each year,
creation and maintenance of the records for all the fleet the first year, and creation of one-sixth of the records and
maintenance of the records for all the fleet each subsequent year. 
The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive
Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February
26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small
entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been prepared for this action
and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under
the caption

 39.13

 [Amended] 


2. Section 39.13 is amended by adding the following new airworthiness directive:

 



AD 94-15-04 Bell Helicopter Textron, Inc.: 

Amendment 39-8975. Docket Number 93-SW-19-AD.

 



Applicability: 

Model 214ST helicopters, with main rotor mast (mast), part number (P/N) 214-040-090-109 installed,
certificated in any category. 


Compliance: 

Required as indicated, unless accomplished previously. 
To prevent fatigue failure of the mast, loss of the main rotor system, and subsequent loss of control of the helicopter,
accomplish the following: 
(a) Within 10 calendar days after the effective date of this airworthiness directive (AD), accomplish the following:

(1) Create a component history card or an equivalent record for the affected mast. 
(2) Determine and record the total time-in-service (TIS) accumulated for the mast as follows: 
(i) If the TIS of the mast is unknown, use a TIS of 900 hours' per year. Prorate the hours for a partial year. 
(ii) If the TIS is known, use that total TIS. 
(3) Determine and record the accumulated takeoffs and external load lifts (high-power events) for the mast as follows:

(i) If the number of high-power events is unknown, assign 11 high-power events for each hour TIS obtained in accordance
with paragraph (a)(2). 
(ii) If the number of high-power events is known, record that number as total accumulated high-power events. 
(b) After compliance with paragraph (a) of this AD, continue to record the TIS and high-power events and add the high-power
events to the previously recorded sum. 
(c) Remove the mast from further service in accordance with the following: 
(1) For each mast with 9,900 hours' or more total TIS on the effective date of this AD, remove and replace the mast within
the next 100 hours' TIS. 
(2) For each mast with less than 9,900 hours' total TIS on the effective date of this AD, remove and replace the mast before
it attains 10,000 hours' TIS. 
(3) For each mast with 48,900 or more high-power events on the effective date of this AD, remove and replace the mast
on or before the accumulation of an additional 1,100 high-power events. 
(4) For each mast with less than 48,900 high-power events on the effective date of this AD, remove and replace the mast
before it attains 50,000 high-power events. 
(d) This AD revises the Airworthiness Limitations Section of the maintenance manual by establishing a new retirement
life for the mast of 10,000 hours' TIS, or 50,000 high-power events, whichever occurs first. However, for masts with
9,900 hours' or more TIS or 48,900 or more high-power events on the effective date of this AD, those masts need not be
retired until on or before the accumulation of an additional 100 hours' TIS or 1,100 high-power events, respectively.

(e) An alternative method of compliance or adjustment of the compliance time that provides an acceptable level of
safety may be used when approved by the Manager, Rotorcraft Certification Office, FAA, Rotorcraft Directorate.
Operators shall submit their requests through an FAA Principal Maintenance Inspector, who may concur or comment
and then send it to the Manager, Rotorcraft Certification Office.

 



Note: 

Information concerning the existence of approved alternative methods of compliance with this AD, if any, may be obtained
from the Rotorcraft Certification Office.

 

(f) Special flight permits may be issued in accordance with sections 21.197 and 21.199 of the Federal Aviation Regulations
(14 CFR 21.197 and 21.199) to operate the helicopter to a location where the requirements of this AD can be accomplished.

(g) This amendment becomes effective August 25, 1994.

Establishment of Class D Airspace; Class E4 Airspace and Amendment of Class E2 Airspace; Athens, GA



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This action establishes Class D and Class E4 airspace at Athens/Ben Epps Airport, Athens, Georgia due to commissioning
of a Non-Federal Air Traffic Control Tower, March 14, 1994. This action also amends the Class E2 surface airspace at
Athens/Ben Epps Airport to indicate part-time when the control tower is not in operation. The intended effect of this
action is to require pilots to establish two-way radio communications prior to entering the airspace during the hours
the control tower is in operation.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 




History



On May 2, 1994, the FAA proposed to amend part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71 to establish Class
D and Class E4 airspace at the Athens/Ben Epps airport Athens, Georgia. This proposal also would amend the Class E2
surface airspace at Athens/Ben Epps Airport to indicate part-time. The establishment of this Class D airspace area
will require pilots, prior to entering the airspace, to establish two-way radio communications with the newly commissioned
air traffic control tower providing air traffic services. (59 FR 22567). Interested parties were invited to participate
in this rulemaking proceeding by submitting written comments on the proposal to the FAA. No comments objecting to
the proposal were received.

The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. This amendment is the same as that proposed
in the notice. Designations for Class D, Class E2, and Class E4 airspace respectively are published in Paragraphs
5000, 6002, and 6004 of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993. The Class D and Class
E airspace designations listed in this document will be published subsequently in the Order.



The Rule



This amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations establishes Class D and Class E4 airspace areas at Athens/Ben
Epps Airport, Athens, Georgia. This amendment also amends Class E2 surface airspace at Athens/Ben Epps Airport,
Athens, Georgia, to indicate part-time. The establishment of this Class D airspace area will require pilots, prior
to entering the airspace, to establish two-way radio communications with the newly commissioned air traffic control
tower providing air traffic service.

The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which
frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore, (1) is not a ``significant
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies
and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as
the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and
air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

<USDEPT>NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS BOARD</USDEPT>





Administrative Regulations


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

National Labor Relations Board (NLRB).


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The National Labor Relations Board is amending the current administrative regulations governing the standards
of conduct and financial disclosure requirements of employees of the Agency. Most of these regulations have been
superseded by the Standards of Ethical Conduct for Employees of the Executive Branch issued by the Office of Government
Ethics (OGE). The NLRB publishes this rule to repeal the superseded provisions and to update cross-references in
the current regulations that continue to be applicable, in conformance with the executive branch-wide standards.


Thus, NLRB is not repealing the provisions of the existing administrative regulations requiring approval to engage
in outside employment, the prohibition to engage in private practice of law except in family or civic matters, and
the requirement to cooperate with the NLRB's Office of Inspector General in audits and investigations.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

In 1967, the NLRB issued 29 CFR Part 100, administrative regulations governing employee responsibilities and conduct
(32 FR 13560), primarily pursuant to and in conformance with E.O. 11222 (May 8, 1965) and regulations issued by the
U.S. Civil Service Commission (5 CFR 735.104, 33 FR 12487). Executive Order 12674 (April 12, 1990)_as modified by
E.O. 12731 (October 17, 1990)_revoked E.O. 11222 and directed OGE to ``establish a single, comprehensive, and clear
set of executive-branch standards of conduct that shall be objective, reasonable, and enforceable.''


On August 7, 1992, OGE published new Standards of Ethical Conduct for Employees of the Executive Branch (57 FR 35006).
These uniform standards of conduct, codified at 5 CFR part 2635, became effective on February 3, 1993; and supersede
most of the provisions in the NLRB's regulations found in 29 CFR Part 100. Additionally, the new standard authorized
executive-branch agencies, with the concurrence of OGE, to issue supplemental agency-specific regulations that
are necessary and appropriate to implement their respective ethics programs (5 CFR 2635.105).
Therefore, NLRB is amending Part 100 by removing/repealing certain sections of subparts A, B, and C that have been
superseded by the new OGE regulations and by revising or redesignating the remaining provisions.
In subpart A, ``Employee Responsibilities and Conduct,''  100.101 has been amended to cross-reference the
new executive branch-wide standards. Section 100.102 has been revised to accommodate redesignated  100.113.
Sections 100.103 through 100.105,   100.111 through 100.112, paragraphs (a)(2) through (d) of  100.113,
  100.114 through 100.122 have been removed. Section 100.123 is redesignated as  100.201 of the
renamed subpart B, ``Cooperation in Audits and Investigations.'' Sections 100.301 through 100.305 and  100.307
of subpart C, ``Special Government Employee Conduct and Responsibility,'' were also superseded as of February 3,
1993, and have been removed.
Section 100.106, with a revised paragraph (a) to show the new street address ``1099 Fourteenth Street, NW'' of the
NLRB headquarters, is redesignated as  100.401 of the renamed subpart D.
Paragraphs (a)(1) and (e) of  100.113 have been redesignated as paragraphs (a) and (b) of  100.102. NLRB
is not removing these paragraphs, because they contain the Agency's requirements for approval to engage in outside
employment and activities, and the prohibition to engage in private practice of law except in family or civic matters.
Pursuant to the Standards of Ethical Conduct for Employees of the Executive Branch, these requirements will remain
in effect until February 4, 1995, or until NLRB publishes new requirements.
Effective October 5, 1992, OGE regulations contained in 5 CFR part 2634, ``Financial Disclosure, Qualified Trusts,
and Certificates of Divestiture for Executive Branch Employees,'' superseded the executive branch confidential
reporting regulations at 5 CFR part 735, subpart D and  735.106, as well as the NLRB's implementing regulations.
Therefore, the NLRB is further amending part 100 by removing   100.201 through 100.209, along with the
heading of subpart B,'' Employee Statements of Employment and Financial Interest.'' Section 100.306 and the heading
of subpart C, ``Special Government Employee Conduct and Responsibilities,'' and also removed.
Sections 100.120 (gambling, betting, and lotteries) and 100.121 (general conduct prejudicial to the Government)
of the NLRB regulations are not superseded by 5 CFR part 2635 nor any other OGE regulation. However, pursuant to E.O.
12674 (as modified by E.O. 12731), OPM issued a final rule on November 30, 1992 (57 FR 56433) to complement 5 CFR part
2635. Enforceable by the employing agency, this OPM rule_which revised part 735 of title 5, Ch. I of the Code of Federal
Regulations_became effective on February 3, 1993; and established executive branch-wide standards in these conduct
areas. Accordingly, the NLRB is removing   100.120 and 100.121.
Additionally, subpart D, ``Employee Personal Loss Claims [Reserved],'' is redesignated as subpart C; subpart E,
``Claims Under the Federal Tort Claims Act,'' is redesigned as subpart D; and subpart F, ``Enforcement of Nondiscrimination
on the Basis of Handicap in Programs and Activities Conducted by the National Labor Relations Board,'' is redesignated
as subpart E of part 100 of title 29, Ch. I of the Code of Federal Regulations. Section 100.570 is amended to show the new
street address ``1099 Fourteenth Street, NW'' of the NLRB headquarters and the Director of Administration.
This rule relates to Agency management and personnel. As such, no notice of proposed rulemaking has been published.
For the same reason, the rule is not subject to the review requirements of E.O. 12991.

Conforming Postal Regulations to the Computer Matching and Privacy Protection Act of 1988 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Postal Service.

 

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.

 


</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Postal Service is amending its Privacy Act regulations to incorporate changes made by the Computer Matching and
Privacy Protection Act of 1988 (Pub. L. 100-503). That Act amended the Privacy Act of 1974 to establish procedures
affecting agencies' use of Privacy Act records in performing certain types of computerized matching programs. The
rules follow the guidelines issued by the Office of Management and Budget (54 FR 25818, June 19, 1989). Because the
proposed rule (59 FR 30739, June 15, 1994) generated no comments, the final rule is published unchanged. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Computer Matching and Privacy Protection Act of 1988 requires an agency to meet certain procedural requirements
when using one or more of its Privacy Act systems of records in conducting computer matching programs. Included is
the requirement that an agency Data Integrity Board agency. The following changes define computer matching under
the Act; incorporate some of the Act's procedural requirements, including 

Federal Register

 publication, submission of matching proposals to the Postal Service, and execution of matching agreements; and
describe the responsibilities and makeup of the USPS Data Integrity Board. 



List of Subjects in 39 CFR Parts 262 and 266 



Definitions, Privacy, Records and information management.

Responsibilities. 

The Data Integrity Board oversees Postal Service computer matching activities. Its principal function is to review,
approve, and maintain all written agreements for use of Postal Service records in matching programs to ensure compliance
with the Privacy Act and all relevant statutes, regulations, and guidelines. In addition, the Board annually reviews
matching programs and other matching activities in which the Postal Service has participated during the preceding
year to determine compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and agreements; compiles a biennial matching report
of matching activities; and performs review and advisement functions relating to records accuracy, recordkeeping
and disposal practices, and other computer matching activities. 

(2) 

Composition. 

The Privacy Act requires that the senior official responsible for implementation of agency Privacy Act policy and
the Inspector General serve on the Board. The Records Officer, as administrator of Postal Service Privacy Act policy,
serves as Secretary of the Board and performs the administrative functions of the Board. The Board is composed of these
and other members designated by the Postmaster General, as follows: 

(i) Vice President/Controller (Chairman). 

(ii) Chief Postal Inspector in his or her capacity as Inspector General. 

(iii) Vice President, Employee Relations. 

(iv) General Counsel. 

(v) Records Officer (Secretary).

(6) 

Computer matching purposes. 

Records from a Postal Service system of records may be disclosed to another agency for the purpose of conducting a computer
matching program or other matching activity as defined in paragraphs (c) and (d) of  262.5, but only after a determination
by the Data Integrity Board that the procedural requirements of the Privacy Act, the guidelines issued by the Office
of Management and Budget, and these regulations as may be applicable are met. These requirements include: 

(i) 

Routine use. 

Disclosure is made only when permitted as a routine use of the system of records. The USPS Records Officer determines
the applicability of a particular routine use and the necessity for adoption of a new routine use. 

(ii) 

Notice. 

Publication of new or revised matching programs in the 

Federal Register

 and advance notice to Congress and the Office of Management and Budget must be made pursuant to paragraph (f) of  266.5.


(iii) 

Computer matching agreement. 

The participants in a computer matching program must enter into a written agreement specifying the terms under which
the matching program is to be conducted (see  266.10). The Records Officer may require that other matching activities
be conducted in accordance with a written agreement. 

(iv) 

Data Integrity Board approval. 

No record from a Postal Service system of records may be disclosed for use in a computer matching program unless the
matching agreement has received approval by the Postal Service Data Integrity Board (see  266.10). Other matching
activities may, at the discretion of the Records Officer, be submitted for Board approval.

(f) 

Notification of computer matching program. 

The Postal Service publishes in the 

Federal Register

 and forwards to Congress and the Office of Management and Budget advance notice of its intent to establish, substantially
revise, or renew a matching program, unless such notice is published by another participant agency. In those instances
in which the Postal Service is the ``recipient'' agency, as defined in the Act, but another participant agency sponsors
and derives the principal benefit from the matching program, the other agency is expected to publish the notice. The
notice must be sent to Congress and OMB 40 days, and published at least thirty (30) days, prior to (1) initiation of any
matching activity under a new or substantially revised program, or (2) expiration of the existing matching agreement
in the case of a renewal of a continuing program.




8. Paragraph (e) is added to  266.8 as follows: 


 266.8 

Schedule of fees. 


* * * * * 


(e) The Postal Service may, at its discretion, require reimbursement of its costs as a condition of participation
in a computer matching program or activity with another agency. The agency to be charged is notified in writing of the
approximate costs before they are incurred. Costs are calculated in accordance with the schedule of fees at  265.9.




9. Section 266.10 is added as follows: 


 266.10 

Computer matching.

(a) 

General. 

Any agency or Postal Service component that wishes to use records from a Postal Service automated system of records
in a computerized comparison with other postal or non-postal records must submit its proposal to the USPS Records
Officer. Computer matching programs as defined in paragraph (c) of  262.5 must be conducted in accordance with
the Privacy Act, implementing guidance issued by the Office of Management and Budget and these regulations. Records
may not be exchanged for a matching program until all procedural requirements of the Act and these regulations have
been met. Other matching activities must be conducted in accordance with the Privacy Act and with the approval of the
Records Officer. See paragraph (b)(6) of  266.4. 

(b) 

Procedure for submission of matching proposals. 

A proposal must include information required for the matching agreement discussed in paragraph (d)(1) of this section.
The Inspection Service must submit its proposals for matching programs and other matching activities to the USPS
Records Officer through: Independent Counsel, Inspection Service, U.S. Postal Service, 475 L'Enfant Plaza SW,
Rm 3417, Washington, DC 20260-2181.

All other matching proposals, whether from postal organizations or other government agencies, must be mailed directly
to: 
USPS Records Officer, U.S. Postal Service, 475 L'Enfant Plaza SW, Rm 8831, Washington, DC 20260-5240.

(c) 

Lead time. 

Proposals must be submitted to the USPS Records Officer at least 3 months in advance of the anticipated starting date
to allow time to meet Privacy Act publication and review requirements. 

(d) 

Matching agreements. 

The participants in a computer matching program must enter into a written agreement specifying the terms under which
the matching program is to be conducted. The Records Officer may require similar written agreements for other matching
activities. 

(1) 

Content. 

Agreements must specify: 

(i) The purpose and legal authority for conducting the matching program; 

(ii) The justification for the program and the anticipated results, including, when appropriate, a specific estimate
of any savings in terms of expected costs and benefits, in sufficient detail for the Data Integrity Board to make an
informed decision; 

(iii) A description of the records that are to be matched, including the data elements to be used, the number of records,
and the approximate dates of the matching program; 

(iv) Procedures for providing notice to individuals who supply information that the information may be subject to
verification through computer matching programs; 

(v) Procedures for verifying information produced in a matching program and for providing individuals an opportunity
to contest the findings in accordance with the requirement that an agency may not take adverse action against an individual
as a result of information produced by a matching program until the agency has independently verified the information
and provided the individual with due process; 

(vi) Procedures for ensuring the administrative, technical, and physical security of the records matched; for the
retention and timely destruction of records created by the matching program; and for the use and return or destruction
of records used in the program; 

(vii) Prohibitions concerning duplication and redisclosure of records exchanged, except where required by law
or essential to the conduct of the matching program; 

(viii) Assessments of the accuracy of the records to be used in the matching program; and 

(ix) A statement that the Comptroller General may have access to all records of the participant agencies in order to
monitor compliance with the agreement. 

(2) 

Approval. 

Before the Postal Service may participate in a computer matching program or other computer matching activity that
involves both USPS and non-USPS records, the Data Integrity Board must have evaluated the proposed match and approved
the terms of the matching agreement. To be effective, the matching agreement must receive approval by each member
of the Board. Votes are collected by the USPS Records Officer. Agreements are signed on behalf of the Board by the Chairman.
If a matching agreement is disapproved by the Board, any party may appeal the disapproval in writing to the Director,
Office of Management and Budget, Washington, DC 20503-0001, within 30 days following the Board's written disapproval.


(3) 

Effective dates. 

No matching agreement is effective until 40 days after the date on which a copy is sent to Congress. The agreement remains
in effect only as long as necessary to accomplish the specific matching purpose, but no longer than 18 months, at which
time the agreement expires unless extended. The Data Integrity Board may extend an agreement for one additional year,
without further review, if within 3 months prior to expiration of the 18-month period it finds that the matching program
is to be conducted without change, and each party to the agreement certifies that the program has been conducted in
compliance with the matching agreement. Renewal of a continuing matching program that has run for the full 30-month
period requires a new agreement that has received Data Integrity Board approval.

Approval and Promulgation of Air Quality Implementation Plans; Commonwealth of Pennsylvania; Oxygenated Gasoline
Program 




<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 




</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 





</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 EPA is approving a State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision submitted by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. This
revision establishes and requires the implementation of an oxygenated gasoline program in the Pennsylvania portion
of the Philadelphia Consolidated Metropolitan Statistical Area (CMSA). This SIP revision was submitted to satisfy
the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (the Act) which requires all carbon monoxide nonattainment areas with a design
value of 9.5 part per million (ppm) or greater based generally on 1988 and 1989 air quality monitoring data to implement
an oxygenated gasoline program. The intended effect of this action is to approve the oxygenated gasoline program.
This action is being taken under section 110 of the Clean Air Act. 




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On November 29, 1993 (58 FR 62563), EPA published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPR) for the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.
The NPR proposed approval of an oxygenated gasoline program. The formal SIP revision was submitted by the Commonwealth
of Pennsylvania on November 12, 1992. The revision included revisions to 25 PA Code Chapter 121, General Provisions,
section 121.1 Definitions, and the additions of section 126.1 Oxygenate Content of Gasoline to 25 PA Code Chapter
126, Standards for Motor Fuels. These regulatory revisions were adopted by the Commonwealth on June 16, 1992 and became
effective on August 29, 1992. On February 16, 1993, an amendment to the November 12, 1992 SIP revision was officially
submitted to EPA. The amendment corrected a typographical error in 25 PA Code Chapter 121, section 121.1 in the definition
of ``oxygenated gasoline''. The corrected version of the definition was effective on October 24, 1992. A more detailed
analysis of the state submittal was prepared as part of the NPR action and is contained in a Technical Support Document
(TSD) dated June 15, 1993, which is available from the Region III office listed in the 

ADDRESSES

 section of this notice. 


Public comments were received from one group on the NPR. 
The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) submitted comments on December 29, 1993 which related
to the attest engagement

1

 requirements. A copy of the AICPA's comments can be found in the Pennsylvania oxygenated gasoline program SIP docket
file which is available from the Region III office listed in the 

ADDRESSES

 section of this notice. 




The AICPA had four comments on the NPR which are summarized as follows: 
(1) The Pennsylvania regulations require the attest engagement report to be submitted within 60 days following the
end of the control period and AICPA suggested that the filing deadline be extended to 120 days to be consistent with
EPA guidelines; 
(2) Pennsylvania regulations require attest engagements for both averaging and per gallon information, AICPA believes
this is inconsistent with EPA guidelines;

<DOCNO> FR940721-0-00015 </DOCNO>

(3) AICPA believes that Pennsylvania's implementation guidelines requirement that Certified Public Accountants
(CPA) meet the general standards prescribed in ``Government Auditing Standards, 1988 Revision, published by the
Comptroller General of the United States' General Accounting Office'' (GAS) should be deleted. AICPA commented
that the standards that govern the conduct of the attest engagement are the AICPA Statement of Standards for Attestation
Engagements (SSAE) and not the GAS; and 
(4) The third column of the EPA NPR, page 62564, contained an error by using the word ``account'' in connection with
``CPA'' and the word should be changed to ``accountant''. 
EPA has reviewed AICPA's comments and determined that the State requirements discussed in the first two comments
are more stringent than EPA guidelines and can be required at the State's discretion, and therefore do not affect the
approvability of this revision. 
The third comment deals with the Pennsylvania's implementation guidelines which were not submitted as part of the
SIP revision and therefore the comment is not relevant to the approvability of this revision. However, EPA has contacted
the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Resources (PADER) concerning this comment. PADER informed EPA that
the section of the Pennsylvania implementation guidelines entitled ``Auditor Qualifications'' requires each
auditor, who performs an attest engagement, to fulfill specific qualifications. One of the qualifications is that
the auditor meet the general standards prescribed in the ``Government Auditing Standards, 1988 Revision, published
by the Comptroller General of the United States' General Accounting Office'' (GAS). The subsequent section of the
Pennsylvania implementation guideline, entitled ``Agreed-upon Procedures'', does require that the auditor comply
with the AICPA Statement of Standards for Attestation Engagements (SSAE) when performing the attest engagement.
This section of the Pennsylvania implementation guideline, entitled ``Agreed-upon Procedures'', addresses the
third comment raised by the AICPA. 
With regard to the last comment, EPA acknowledges that it made a typographical error in the NPR, page 62564, and agrees
that the word ``account'' should have read ``accountant.'' 
Other specific requirements of the oxygenated gasoline program and the rationale for EPA's proposed action are explained
in the NPR and will not be restated here. 


Final Action 


EPA is approving the amendments to 25 PA Code Chapter 121, General Provisions, section 121.1 Definitions, the addition
of section 126.1 Oxygenate Content of Gasoline to 25 PA Code Chapter 126, Standards for Motor Fuels, and the correction
in 25 PA Code Chapter 121, General Provisions, section 121.1 in the definition of ``oxygenated gasoline.'' 
Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for revision to any state implementation plan. Each request for revision to the state implementation plan shall be
considered separately in light of specific technical, economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant
statutory and regulatory requirements. 
This action has been classified as a Table 2 action for signature by the Regional Administrator under the procedures
published in the 

Federal Register

 on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214-2225), as revised by an October 4, 1993 memorandum from Michael H. Shapiro, Acting
Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. The OMB has exempted this regulatory action from E.O. 12866 review.

Under section 307(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act, petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed in the United
States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by (Insert date 60 days from date of publication). Filing a petition
for reconsideration by the Administrator of this final rule does not affect the finality of this rule for the purposes
of judicial review nor does it extend the time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed, and shall not
postpone the effectiveness of such rule or action. This action approving Pennsylvania's oxygenated gasoline regulation
may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements. (See section 307(b)(2).)

Final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This Memorandum Opinion and Order states the Commission's intention to use lotteries to award licenses for all cellular
unserved areas in which applications were filed prior to July 26, 1993. This action is taken because the Commission
indicated in a prior order in this proceeding that it would address in a separate action the applicability of competitive
bidding or lottery procedures to certain radio applications filed before July 26, 1993. The Commission concludes
that this action to use random selection instead of competitive bidding to award licenses among these competing applications
will serve the public interest.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

This is a synopsis of the Commission's Memorandum Opinion and Order (Order) in PP Docket No. 93-253, adopted
May 27, 1994 and released July 14, 1994. The full text of Commission decisions are available for inspection and copying
during normal business hours in the FCC Docket Branch (room 230), 1919 M Street, NW., Washington, DC. The complete
text of this decision may also be purchased from the Commission's copy contractor, International Transcription
Service, Inc. (202) 857-3800, 2100 M Street, NW., Washington, DC 20037.



Synopsis of Order



In this Order, the Commission states its intention to use existing random selection procedures to choose from among
mutually exclusive applications filed prior to July 26, 1993, for authorization to provide cellular service to unserved
areas. This action is consistent with the Special Rule adopted in Section 6002(e) of the Budget Act. In the near future,
the Commission's staff will issue a Public Notice rescheduling the two previously scheduled lotteries. Finally,
the Commission stated that it will consider requests for approval of full market settlements and proceed with licensing
where such approval is granted.



Ordering Clauses



Accordingly, 

it is ordered

 that selection from among mutually exclusive applications filed prior to July 26, 1993, to provide cellular service
to unserved areas shall be by random selection, in accordance with existing Commission rules.

Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards 
Seating Systems; Pedestal Seats 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), DOT.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This notice amends Standard 207, 

Seating Systems,

 to establish a more appropriate test procedure for pedestal seats. Manufacturers of most pedestal seats will have
a choice between the current test procedure or the new test procedure. The current test procedure applies a single
load through the center of gravity (cg) of the entire seat. The new test procedure applies two separate loads, one through
the cg of the portion of the seat above the adjuster and the other through the cg of the pedestal. This rule is a response
to manufacturer concerns that the current Standard No. 207 test procedure imposes excessive loads on the adjuster
for pedestal seats when the cg of the seat is located above the seat adjuster. (The adjuster is typically located between
the pedestal and the seat.) Manufacturers believed that the current test procedure is inappropriate for seats whose
cg is located above the adjuster because a portion of the load applied to the seat, and therefore imposed on the adjuster,
represents the weight of the pedestal. In a real crash, only the weight of the seat that is above the adjuster would be
imposed on the adjuster.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On August 14, 1990, NHTSA published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) to amend Standard 207, 

Seating Systems,

 establish a more appropriate test procedure for pedestal seats (55 FR 33141). Under the proposed test procedure,
the pedestal and the seat portion of a pedestal seat would each be separately, but simultaneously, loaded. The NPRM
proposed definitions for a ``pedestal seat,'' and parts thereof, to differentiate such seats from other seating
systems. 


March 8, 1993, NHTSA published a supplemental notice of proposed rulemaking (SNPRM) for the same rulemaking (58 FR
12921). The SNPRM and the 1990 NPRM differed in two principal respects. The first concerned the definition of ``pedestal
seat.'' Instead of attempting to define and differentiate different parts of a pedestal seat from one another, as
was done in the NPRM, the SNPRM simply divided pedestal seats into two portions, that above the adjuster and that below
the adjuster. The second difference concerned whether the new test procedure would replace the current procedure
or become an alternative to it. The new test procedure proposed in the SNPRM was virtually identical to that proposed
in the NPRM, except that the SNPRM gave manufacturers the option of using either the current single load procedure
or the new dual load test procedure for testing most pedestal seats. 
The agency received six comments concerning the March 1993 SNPRM. In general, the commenters supported the SNPRM.
All of the comments were considered when formulating this final rule, and the most significant comments are addressed
below. 


Definitions 


The SNPRM proposed a new definition for ``seat adjuster'' as follows: 



``

Seat adjuster

'' means the part of the seat that allows the seat bench and back to move forward and rearward, and/or to rotate around
a vertical axis, including any fixed portion, such as a seat track. The term also means the uppermost seat adjuster
in the case of a seat equipped with seat adjusters at different levels.

 

AM General Corp. (AM General), Chrysler Corp. (Chrysler), and Volvo GM Heavy Truck Corp. (Volvo) commented on the
proposed definition. AM General and Chrysler commented that the proposed definition excluded nonadjustable pedestal
seats and asked that the proposed test procedure also apply to that type of seat. 
NHTSA agrees with AM General and Chrysler that the amendments proposed in the SNPRM apply only to adjustable pedestal
seats. The focus of this rulemaking has always been manufacturer concerns that the current Standard No. 207 test procedure
imposes excessive loads placed on the adjusters for pedestal seats. The current test procedure requires a single
load to be applied through the center of gravity (cg) of the entire seat. If the cg of a pedestal seat lies at or above the
adjuster, the test procedure places the load of the entire seat, including the pedestal, on the adjuster. However,
in a real-world crash, the adjuster would not have loads imposed on it from the pedestal. NHTSA does not believe the
same concerns apply to non-adjustable pedestal seats. In addition, NHTSA notes that extending this rule to non-adjustable
pedestal seats would be outside the scope of notice of this rulemaking.

 

Volvo stated that the:

 

(s)uspension seats in heavy trucks also include a fore and aft slide device which allows the seat to ``float'' and absorb
the pitch moment generated by rough roads or uneven loading. 



Volvo asked that the definition be changed to clarify that the adjuster is the part of the seat that provides forward
and rearward positioning of the seat, rather than a part of the seat which allows the seat to move while the vehicle is
in motion. NHTSA agrees that the Volvo change clarifies the definition and has adopted the change as suggested.

Adjustment Position (S5.1.1(a)) 


The test procedure proposed in the SNPRM specified that, if the height of the seat were adjustable, the loads were to
be applied when the seat was in its highest adjustment position. Volvo stated that, since the seat belts of many heavy
trucks are mounted on the seat, the compliance tests for Standard No. 207 and Standard No. 210, 

Seat Belt Assembly Anchorages

, are regularly conducted simultaneously. Volvo stated that the requirement that the seat be adjusted to its highest
adjustment position conflicted with Standard No. 210, which

 

requires some loading conditions to be applied with the seat in the rearmost position and some of the belt anchors in
the midpoint of any adjustment range. The Administration has previously interpreted NHTSA TP 210 for suspension
seats to be in the vertical mid ride position.

 

The Recreation Vehicle Industry Association (RVIA), stated that the Standard No. 207 ``test procedures have long
stated that such a seat is to be tested at its 

midpoint

 adjustment.'' 
Neither the current Standard No. 207 nor Standard No. 210 have height adjustment requirements for testing adjustable
seats. However, the current version of the Laboratory Test Procedure for Standard No. 207 specifies the highest point
adjustment (P. 25, Figure 6, ``Forward and Aft Loads on Seat Frame with Seat Belts Attached to Seat,'' TP-207-09,
January 18, 1992.) NHTSA would like to emphasize that the Laboratory Test Procedures are provided to contracted laboratories
as guidelines for conducting compliance tests, and do not limit the requirements of the applicable Federal motor
vehicle safety standards. Since Standard No. 207 does not limit the adjustment position, the seat is required to meet
the current requirement in all adjustment positions, and the fact that a test procedure specifies a specific adjustment
position does not limit this requirement. 
Section S4.3.2 of Standard No. 210 specifies that the seat is to be adjusted ``to its full rearward and downward position
* * *'' However, this section is related to the seat belt angle location requirements, and does not
necessarily apply to load testing. 
None of the commenters offered a convincing argument as to why NHTSA should not specify the adjustment position. Since
NHTSA believes that having to meet Standard No. 207 in the proposed highest adjustment position would necessitate
designing a stronger, safer seat than having to meet the standard in another adjustment position, NHTSA has retained
the procedure as proposed. 


Horizontal Plane (S5.1.1(a)(1)) 


Chrysler commented that the language of S5.1.1(a)(1), ``* * * horizontal plane tangent to the lowest
surface of the seat adjuster * * *,'' did not reflect some of the seat adjuster designs on its vehicles.
Chrysler stated that the lowest mounting surface on some designs did not lie in a horizontal plane, and the forward/rearward
motion of some designs was not linear. For this reason, Chrysler suggested that the word ``horizontal'' be deleted
from this section. 
NHTSA agrees with Chrysler it is not possible to specify the horizontal plane tangent to the lowest surface of the seat
as the tangent to the lowest surface of some seat adjusters will not be horizontal. The purpose of S5.1.1(a)(1) is to
define whether the load is in (or above) any part of the seat adjuster, which will allow manufacturers the option of
using either test procedure. Since the applied test load is horizontal and the tangent plane to the lowest surface
of the adjuster may not be horizontal for all possible cases, the word ``tangent'' is deleted. 
As explained above, NHTSA is amending Standard No. 207 because the application of a single load imposes an unnatural
load on the seat adjuster if the cg is at or above the adjuster. Therefore, NHTSA is amending S5.1.1(a)(1) to allow manufacturers
the option of applying either one or two loads whenever the horizontal plane containing the cg either contacts any
portion of the seat adjuster or is above the seat adjuster. Section S5.1.1(a)(3) has also changed to reflect the change
in S5.1.1(a)(1). 


Not Physically Possible 


NHTSA proposed to allow manufacturers a choice between the current test procedure and the new test procedure whenever
the cg of the seat was above the adjuster unless it was ``not physically possible'' to use the dual load test procedure.
Volvo objected to the language in proposed S5.1.1(a)(2) requiring manufacturers to use the single load test procedure
when it is ``not physically possible'' to use the dual load test procedure since this limited a manufacturer's choice.

Based on the testing done by the agency, the pedestal must be approximately 4 inches high for it to be physically possible
to use the test device. Since the agency no longer defines a pedestal seat in relation to the height of the pedestal,
NHTSA believes that this limitation is necessary. If NHTSA did not include this limitation, the agency might be precluded
from conducting a compliance test in the case of a pedestal seat whose pedestal is too short to accommodate the test
device. 


Specification of Dual Load Procedure for Some Pedestal Seats 


The SNPRM proposed S5.1.1(a)(3) specified the use of the new dual load test procedure whenever the cg of the seat ``is
located below the horizontal plane tangent to the lowest surface of the seat adjuster.'' Ford Motor Co. (Ford) stated
that it believed that this section should specify the use of the single load test procedure instead of the dual load
test procedure. It provided no explanation for its belief. 
Ford's suggestion is inappropriate. Specifying the use of the dual load test procedure when the cg is below the seat
adjuster ensures that test loads will be applied to both the pedestal and the seat. If a single load were applied, only
the strength of the attachment of the pedestal to the vehicle, and not the strength of the attachment of the seat to the
pedestal, would be tested. 


Clarification of S5.1.1(a) 


NHTSA has made various minor changes to S5.1.1(a) for the purpose of clarifying and simplifying the language. 


Effective Date 


The SNPRM proposed that the effective date for the option to use either the single or dual load test procedure be 90 days
after publication of the final rule. RVIA urged NHTSA to adopt an effective date at least one year following publication
of the final rule. RVIA stated that the proposed effective date ``does not provide sufficient lead time for manufacturers
to deplete existing stock, conduct additional tests under 

either

 procedure, and make any necessary design or structural modifications. 
NHTSA disagrees with RVIA's reasoning. The only type of seat for which modifications might be necessary are seats
whose cg is below their seat adjuster. All other seats either will continue to be required to be certified to the current
test procedure or will have the option of certifying to the current test procedure, and therefore, will not require
modification. NHTSA is not aware of any current seat designs whose cgs are below their adjusters. Therefore, NHTSA
continues to believe the 90 day leadtime is sufficient. 


Rulemaking Analyses and Notices 


EXECUTIVE ORDER 12866 AND DOT REGULATORY POLICIES AND PROCEDURES:

 NHTSA has considered the impact of this rulemaking action under E.O. 12866 and the Department of Transportation's
regulatory policies and procedures. This rulemaking document was not reviewed under E.O. 12866, ``Regulatory Planning
and Review.'' This action has been determined to be not ``significant'' under the Department of Transportation's
regulatory policies and procedures.

This action will have no economic impacts other than a one-time cost related to the test fixture, for those manufacturers
choosing the new procedure. In particular, they would have to add pneumatic or hydraulic rams to their test set-up.
It is estimated that there would be a one-time set-up cost of $2,500. The test procedure would not require any design,
retooling, or assembly changes. 




REGULATORY FLEXIBILITY ACT: 

NHTSA has also considered the impacts of this final rule under the Regulatory Flexibility Act. I hereby certify that
this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Vehicle manufacturers
typically would not qualify as small entities. While some manufacturers of pedestal seats and seat belt attachments
may be small entities, for the reasons stated above, NHTSA believes this final rule would not significantly affect
them. The final rule will not affect the costs of pedestal seats, since the new procedure is optional. Because of this,
small organizations and governmental units that purchase vehicles with pedestal seats should not be affected by
this final rule. 




PAPERWORK REDUCTION ACT: 

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (P.L. 96-511), there are no requirements for information
collection associated with this final rule. 




NATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY ACT: 

NHTSA has also analyzed this final rule under the National Environmental Policy Act and determined that it will not
have a significant impact on the human environment. 




EXECUTIVE ORDER 12612 (FEDERALISM): 

Finally, NHTSA has analyzed this rule in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in E.O. 12612, and
has determined that this rule will not have significant federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism
Assessment. 




CIVIL JUSTICE REFORM: 

This final rule does not have any retroactive effect. Under 49 U.S.C. 30103, whenever a Federal motor vehicle safety
standard is in effect, a State may not adopt or maintain a safety standard applicable to the same aspect of performance
which is not identical to the Federal standard, except to the extent that the State requirement imposes a higher level
of performance and applies only to vehicles procured for the State's use. 49 U.S.C. 30161 sets forth a procedure for
judicial review of final rules establishing, amending or revoking Federal motor vehicle safety standards. That
section does not require submission of a petition for reconsideration or other administrative proceedings before
parties may file suit in court.

 Final rule. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document amends Standard No. 213, 

Child Restraint Systems, 

to facilitate the manufacture of ``belt-positioning'' child seats (i.e., booster seats designed to be used with
the vehicle's lap/shoulder belts). The amendment adopts performance and labeling requirements and test criteria
for belt-positioning booster seats that are more appropriate than Standard 213's current criteria for these child
seats. This document also specifies that child booster seats must be labeled as being suitable for children weighing
not less than 30 pounds. 



This rule responds to the NHTSA Authorization Act of 1991 (sections 2500-2509 of the Intermodal Surface Transportation
Efficiency Act (``ISTEA'')), which directed the agency to initiate rulemaking on child booster seat safety and other
issues.

I. Background 



a. Statutory Origins of This Rulemaking 



This final rule regarding child booster seats responds to the NHTSA Authorization Act of 1991 (sections 2500-2509
of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act (``ISTEA''), Pub. L. 102-240), which directed the
agency to initiate rulemaking on child booster seat safety and other issues. This rule was preceded by an advance notice
of proposed rulemaking (ANPRM) published on May 29, 1992 (57 FR 22682), and an NPRM published on September 3, 1993 (58
FR 46928). 

The ISTEA directive on booster seats originated in S. 1012, a bill reported by the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science,
and Transportation and added verbatim to the Senate's surface transportation bill (S. 1204). The Senate Commerce
Committee report on S. 1012 expressed concern about suggestions that booster seats, ``depending on their design,
can be easily misused or are otherwise harmful,'' and that some child booster seats ``may not restrain adequately
a child in a crash.'' The Committee's concerns grew out of a study

1

 performed by Calspan Corporation. Calspan found that then-manufactured booster seats could adequately restrain
the 3-year-old (33 pound) test dummy that is used to test the seats for compliance with Standard 213. However, Calspan
also found that when the booster seats were tested with a 9-month-old and a 6-year-old test dummy, the booster seats
could not adequately restrain those dummies. Yet, the booster seats were recommended by their manufacturers as being
suitable for children in the 9-month-old and 6-year-old weight ranges. 





The Calspan study indicated that booster seat safety could be improved if booster seats were capable of properly restraining
the wide range of manufacturers' recommended child sizes. Belt-positioning booster seats are capable of accommodating
a wider range of child sizes than currently manufactured shield-type booster seats. Moreover, belt-positioning
seats used with vehicle lap/shoulder belts appear to perform better than shield booster seats used with vehicle lap/shoulder
belts. 

Pursuant to the ISTEA directive, NHTSA issued two notices of proposed rulemaking (NPRM's). The first addressed booster
seat performance and labeling requirements; the second, dummies for use in testing booster seats and other child
restraint systems. 



b. Booster NPRM 



NHTSA proposed to amend Standard No. 213, 

Child Restraint Systems, 

to facilitate the manufacture of ``belt-positioning'' child seats (boosters designed to be used with the vehicle's
lap/shoulder belts). The NPRM would add a definition of ``belt-positioning seat'' to the standard, and amend the
definition of ``booster seat'' to include belt-positioning booster seats. Standard 213's compliance test procedures
would be amended to specify that belt-positioning seats are dynamically tested when restrained to the test apparatus
with a lap/shoulder belt. The NPRM described the test apparatus in detail to ensure that the test would be carefully
controlled. NHTSA also proposed to amend labeling and informational requirements to decrease the likelihood that
belt-positioning booster seats would be misused. The agency believed that the proposed performance and labeling
requirements would be more appropriate than Standard 213's current criteria for these boosters. 



c. Dummy NPRM 



NHTSA also issued an NPRM to add additional child compliance test dummies to Standard 213. (59 FR 12225, March 16, 1994.)
The NPRM tentatively selected three new child dummies to add to Standard 213. These dummies are the newborn infant
dummy described in subpart K of 49 CFR part 572 (NHTSA's regulation on anthropomorphic test dummies), the 9-month-old
dummy in subpart J, and the instrumented 6-year-old dummy in subpart I. Subjecting booster seats and other child restraint
systems to more thorough compliance testing with additional dummies better ensures that each child restraint safely
restrains the range of children for whom the restraint is recommended. (Readers should note that, if proposals from
the March 1994 NPRM are adopted, those amendments could modify some of the requirements adopted today, such as the
labeling specified for booster seats.) 



d. Overview of Comments on Booster NPRM 



The response to the NPRM was very favorable. Commenters included vehicle and child seat manufacturers (Volvo, Ford,
Chrysler and Cosco) and child passenger groups and consultants (Tarrant County Child Car Safety Coalition, Solutions
Unlimited, the University of Michigan-Child Passenger Protection Program (UM-CPP), Ms. Deborah Davis Stewart,
Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety). Commenters also included the American Academy of Pediatrics, the Air Transport
Association and the National Transportation Safety Board. All commenters supported permitting the manufacture
of belt-positioning booster seats. Many suggested changes about specific proposals, and several had suggestions
for or commented on future work on belt-positioning and other booster seats. All comments were fully considered and
the significant ones are addressed below.

e. Overview Comparison of Booster NPRM and Final Rule 


This rule adopts most of the proposed amendments, with the following changes. The rule makes minor changes to the definition
of a booster seat for clarification purposes. The rule corrects errors in the specification of the test apparatus
used for belt-positioning booster seats, and does not require metric units on the child seat label. 


II. Amendments for Belt-positioning Seats 


a. Definitions 


To facilitate the manufacture of belt-positioning seats and to distinguish those child seats from other types of
seats for testing and labeling purposes, NHTSA amends Standard 213's definitions in three ways. The first amendment
is to include belt-positioning booster seats in the present definition of ``booster seat.'' NHTSA defines a belt-positioning
seat as a type of booster seat because belt-positioning seats and present booster seats serve similar functions,
i.e., both function to bridge the transition of the child from toddler or convertible child restraints to the vehicle
belt systems. (A convertible restraint is specially adjustable so that it can be used rear-facing by an infant or a
very young child, and forward-facing by a toddler. A ``toddler'' child restraint positions a child forward-facing
only and is not capable of being adjusted to face an infant rearward.) It is also advantageous to place belt-positioning
restraints in the same category as present (shield-type) boosters, because both types of child restraint systems
appear to pose similar potential misuse problems. That is, both could be inappropriately used by children who are
too small to be adequately restrained by a child booster seat. Similar countermeasures, such as labeling and instructional
information, can be developed to address those misuse problems. 
The second amendment defines a belt-positioning seat. ``Belt-positioning seat'' is defined as: 



A child restraint system that positions a child on a vehicle seat to improve the fit of a vehicle Type II belt system on
the child and that lacks any component, such as a belt system or a structural element, designed to restrain forward
movement of the child's torso in a forward impact.



This definition is the same as the one proposed in the NPRM. Commenters were generally supportive of the definition.
Volvo asked for clarification that the definition applies to both add-on and built-in belt-positioning seats. The
definition so applies. Volvo's uncertainty appears to have resulted from several proposed requirements that were
worded in such a way that they were appropriate for add-on seats, but not for built-in ones. (E.g., as proposed, S6.1.2.1.1
stated that a belt-positioning seat ``shall be secured to the standard vehicle seat'' using a lap/shoulder belt.)
NHTSA has reworded those sections to clarify the distinction between add-on and built-in seats to avoid any suggestion
that the definition does not apply to built-in belt-positioning seats. 
The third amendment slightly revises the definition of ``booster seat.'' Standard 213 defines a booster seat as ``a
child restraint which consists of only a seating platform that does not extend up to provide a cushion for the child's
back or head.'' (S4 of 49 CFR  571.213) The NPRM would not have changed that definition except to add ``or a belt-positioning
seat'' to the end of it. Ms. Weber of the University of Michigan Child Protection Program (UM-CPP) said that such a change
would be confusing because it implies_contrary to NHTSA's intent_that belt-positioning seats must not have seat
backs. She suggested Standard 213 should better distinguish between the traditional shield-type booster, which
may not have a back, and a belt-positioning booster which may, by naming the former a ``backless child restraint system.''
``This will help clarify the fact that a Belt positioning seat can have a back.'' 
NHTSA concurs that naming the backless type of booster seat will help distinguish the two types of child seat. As a result
of today's amendment, ``booster seat'' encompasses two types of restraint system for older children who are still
too small to sit directly on a vehicle seat and use a vehicle belt system. One type is the traditional shield-type booster
used with a Type I belt; the other is the belt-positioning seat used with a Type II belt system. The commenter's suggestion
will help clarify that a belt-positioning seat can have a back, and a child booster other than a belt-positioning seat
cannot. 
The absence of a seat back for boosters other than belt-positioning seats is one of the main features that distinguishes
a booster seat from a convertible child seat. The distinction is important for Standard 213 testing. The standard
specifies that most restraints are to be anchored with only a lap belt during agency compliance testing. However,
the standard permits a booster seat designed with a top anchorage strap (tether strap) to be tested at 30 mph with the
tether attached. NHTSA permitted attachment of a tether for boosters to facilitate the manufacture of boosters that
provide a harness system, rather than a short shield, for upper torso restraint. Some child safety researchers believed
a harness system was superior to a shield in terms of abdominal loading, head and neck loading, submarining and ejection.
(51 FR 5335.) 
Cosco raised a concern about NHTSA's proposal to simply add ``or a belt-positioning seat'' at the end of the present
``booster seat'' definition. Cosco believed that the change would be inadequate because it would not allow shield-type
boosters to have a seat back. (As explained above, under Standard 213's present definitions, a child restraint cannot
have a seat back and be considered a ``booster seat.'' This restriction is to limit the numbers and types of child restraints
that can be tested in Standard 213's 30-mph dynamic test with their tether attached.) The commenter said that safety
data do not show a need to prohibit seat backs on booster seats. Cosco requested that the definition be reworded either
to allow both types of boosters to use a seat back or to prohibit both from doing so.

<TEXT>
 

NHTSA declines to adopt the change requested by Cosco. NHTSA agrees with Cosco that data do not indicate a safety need
to prohibit seat backs on belt-positioning seats. However, the commenter suggests amending the ``booster'' definition
such that a seat back would be an acceptable feature on a shield booster. That suggestion is beyond the scope of the NPRM
and has not been adopted. 
In further response to Cosco, the absence or presence of a seat back is the only feature that distinguishes shield-type
boosters from toddler or convertible child restraint systems. Distinguishing booster seats from other child restraint
systems is important because Standard 213 provides that a tether on a booster seat may be tested in the 30 mph dynamic
test, while a tether on a toddler or convertible child restraint system will not be attached. NHTSA does not attach
the tether when testing toddler and convertible restraints because many consumers do not properly attach tethers
on their child seats. Limiting the use of a tether in the test better ensures that child seats perform satisfactorily
as they are typically used in the real world. If boosters were permitted to have seat backs, a new way to distinguish
shield booster seats from other types of child restraint systems would have to be developed. 
An alternative approach to distinguishing between shield booster seats and other child restraint systems could
be to remove the reason for having to distinguish between the restraint systems. That is, NHTSA could amend Standard
213 to specify that all child restraint systems, including shield boosters, would be tested without attaching any
tethers. NHTSA believes all booster seats are currently manufactured without a tether. The agency will consider
for future rulemaking whether Standard 213 should continue to specify attaching tethers on shield boosters in the
standard's 30 mph dynamic test. 


b. Test Procedures 


1. Type of Belt System Used To Test Belt-Positioning Seats


The agency is amending Standard 213's test procedures to specify the testing of belt-positioning seats using a lap/shoulder
belt. Cosco commented that there should be a misuse test in which a belt-positioning booster is tested with a lap belt.
The commenter said research has shown that the HIC and head excursions of dummies in belt-positioning seats tested
with lap belts were much greater than the limits in Standard 213. Conversely, the NTSB stated that, ``Because there
is no information on the extent of booster seat misuse * * * it appears premature to require misuse tests.''

NHTSA is not requiring testing belt-positioning seats secured by a lap belt only. Standard 213's approach is to require
child restraint systems to be tested in configurations they were designed for, absent information showing that misuse
of the restraints are resulting in safety problems. The reason for this approach is that child seat manufacturers
must design many safety features into their child restraint systems to protect a restrained child. To do this, the
manufacturers must anticipate how the restraint will be used and design safety into their system bearing in mind their
assumptions about such use. The manufacturer's assumptions about the expected use of the restraint are reflected
in the use instructions to the consumer. Today's rule requires belt-positioning seats to be conspicuously labeled
with instructions about the proper use of the seat, including information on the appropriate vehicle belt system
to be used. Absent information showing a safety need for a belt misuse test, it is premature to require testing belt-positioning
boosters with only a lap belt. 


2. Standard Seat Assembly 


This rule adopts test specifications appropriate for testing belt-positioning seats. The agency believes that
the specifications for the testing procedure should be sufficiently detailed so tests conducted uniformly by various
organizations would provide the same results. This presupposes that the test conditions that affect the performance
of the dummy/child restraint should be standardized. Accordingly, NHTSA amends the provisions concerning the standard
seat assembly used to test child restraint systems to depict added anchorages for the shoulder belt system. This rule
specifies a Type II seat belt assembly for use in testing belt-positioning seats. The standard belt system eliminates
the variability of these belt parameters. In response to Ford and UM-CPP, this rule also modifies some of the specifications
proposed in the NPRM. 
Ford and UM-CPP suggested that the rule should specify the type of latch plate, and further suggested ``that a locking
latch plate is appropriate, given the new rule on lap belt lockability.'' NHTSA has specified that retractors and
reels are not used in the standard seat assembly, which is what was proposed in the NPRM. Since retractors and reels
are absent, the latch plate functions as a locking latchplate. The agency agrees with these commenters that this is
appropriate given the FMVSS No. 208 lockability requirements that will be effective on September 1, 1995.

<TEXT>
 

The agency's lockability final rule published in the 

Federal Register

 on October 13, 1993, ``requires that lap belts or the lap belt portion of lap/shoulder belts be capable of being used
to tightly secure child safety seats, without the necessity of the user's attaching any device to the seat belt webbing,
retractor, or any part of the vehicle in order to achieve that purpose.'' This requirement applies to rear vehicle
seating positions that are recommended, in FMVSS No. 213, as the safest positions for placing a child restraint system.
The latchplate used for Standard 213 testing will be consistent with the lockability requirement, and will reflect
the type and operation of latchplates used in vehicles for attaching child restraint systems. 

Ford and UM-CPP said that the buckle assembly length should be specified as measured from the inboard anchor, ``such
that the length exposed beyond the bight is consistent with the maximum allowed by SAE J1819.'' NHTSA agrees that the
length of the belt exposed beyond the bite (i.e., the intersection of the seat back and seat cushion) needs to be specified
and agrees with using the value recommended by the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) in its draft recommended
practice J1819, ``Securing Child Restraint Systems in Motor Vehicles.'' The J1819 draft recommended practice is
a result of a joint effort of manufacturers of motor vehicles and child restraint systems to promote compatibility
between child restraints and vehicle seats and seat belts. As stated in the draft recommended practice, ``[C]hild
restraint systems and vehicle seats and seat belts having features that conform to this document are more likely to
be compatible with one another.'' By using the J1819 value, the agency not only specifies a uniform standard test procedure
but also reinforces the guidelines that promote the compatibility between child restraints and vehicle seats and
seat belts. Accordingly, NHTSA has revised Figures 1A and 1B and the addendum (addendum A, Seat Base Weldment, dated
July 1, 1993) to the Drawing Package SAS-100-1000 to show the length of the buckle assembly. (The materials
have also been revised to round off the dimensions to the whole millimeter.) 

Ford suggested that tension in the standard belt be set at the 2 to 4 pound (9 to 18 N) force specified in Standard 208,
rather than the 12 to 15 pound (53 to 67 N) force specified by Standard 213 for securing add-on child seats. Ford said
that the former range is more representative of the tension induced in a typical Type 2 belt by the emergency locking
retractor. NHTSA agrees. This rule adopts the proposed requirement in S6.1.1.3 stating that_ 






[T]hese seat belt assemblies meet the requirements of Standard No. 209 ( 571.209) and have webbing with a width
of not more than 2 inches, and are attached to the anchorage points without the use of retractors or reels of any kind.





However, the agency has replaced S6.1.2.2 with a new section to specify preloading of the various belts. The new section
maintains the current 12 to 15 pounds pretensioning of the lap belt that restrains the add-on child restraint to the
test seat assembly, but specifies that the shoulder portion of the Type 2 belt should be pretensioned to a 2-pound force
as in FMVSS 208. 



UM-CPP suggested that the shoulder belt should not be tightened to 12 to 15 lb prior to the test as is currently required
for lap belts. It said that a procedure to determine the tension in the shoulder portion of the belt may be needed. The
commenter suggested that a procedure consisting of placing a curved block with a given radius against the dummy's
chest, tightening the belt to the usual tension, and removing the block before the test, is a repeatable method of introducing
appropriate slack when tightening the belt. NHTSA disagrees that the suggested procedure is necessary. Today's
rule adopts a procedure in S6.1.2.2 which specifies that the tension of the shoulder belt is measured by a load cell
placed on the webbing portion of the belt system prior to the dynamic test. Thus, there is a procedure for ensuring that
the belt has the proper tension. NHTSA believes it is immaterial how the belt is tightened as long as the requisite tensile
force is achieved. Moreover, a procedure for tightening the belts can be addressed in the Laboratory Procedures for
the Standard 213 dynamic test. Describing the procedure in the laboratory procedures is preferable to describing
it in the standard because there might be ways to tighten the belt (e.g., by use of a metallic roller) that might be easier
to use than another procedure (e.g., use of a wooden block), that lead to equally uniform and repetitively consistent
results.

Ford stated that additional specifications for belt elongation are needed for the seat belt assembly to be used in
testing belt-positioning booster seats. Ford said that_




Standard 209 allows use of webbing having any elongation up to 30 percent in Type 2 belts. Using webbing with 30 percent
elongation for the lap/shoulder belt on the standard test seat may result in quite different results than using webbing
of 7 percent elongation. 




It suggested that S6.1.1.3 be amended to include a close tolerance specification for elongation of the standard belt
webbing used in the Standard 213 test for all child restraint systems, based on typical polyester belt webbing, such
as the draft ECE 44 Annex 13 standard seat belt webbing specification of 8

#

1 percent at 11 kN. 



NHTSA does not believe there is a need to specify the elongation of the webbing material used for testing belt-positioning
seats. Standard 213 does not currently specify the elongation of the webbing used for testing child restraint systems.
Further, NHTSA is unaware of information indicating that elongation should be specified. (Under S4.2(c) of Standard
209, the webbing in a Type I seat belt assembly shall not extend to more than 20 percent elongation at 2,500 pounds.)
There is no apparent reason why elongation should be specified for the Type 2 assemblies used to test belt-positioning
seats, when elongation is not specified for the Type I assemblies used to test all other child restraint systems. Also,
not specifying elongation better ensures the dynamic test is representative of real-world crash conditions. NHTSA
obtains webbing material from seat belt suppliers for use in Standard 213's dynamic test. These suppliers also furnish
vehicle manufacturers with the webbing used in motor vehicles. Under current Standard 213 test procedures, NHTSA
tests child restraint systems using webbing that is typical of that installed in vehicles. Any manufacturer that
is concerned about the possible effect that elongation might have on the performance of the child restraint can identify
and perform a ``worst case.'' A manufacturer may determine that a child restraint meeting Standard 213's performance
criteria when tested under worst case conditions will likely meet those criteria when tested under less severe conditions.
A manufacturer that tests its restraint for certification purposes could limit its testing by deciding to test only
a ``worst case'' scenario, i.e., testing under the most austere or unfavorable conditions and circumstances specified
in the standard.

Ford and UM-CPP pointed out an error in the location of the inboard anchor point. UM stated that the location 




[D]oes not follow the research results reported in DOT-HS-808003, TABLE 9, and has an unintended negative
effect on test results. Although the lateral (Y) position relative to the outboard anchor has been used, the X and Z
dimensions of the old center anchors have been retained. This inappropriately low anchor creates an especially long
inboard belt length which, when loaded during the test, makes the booster suddenly shift toward the outboard anchor,
sometimes shoving the dummy's neck into the shoulder belt and sometimes leaving the upper torso lagging behind at
an angle, depending on the initial geometry. This occurs because the effective center of this very asymmetrical belt,
when loaded, is not halfway along the Y axis. 




UM-CPP recommended that the higher and more forward inboard anchor location, determined by NHTSA's research,
be used. Ford also commented that_




Anchorages for the lap portion of the lap/shoulder belt on the standard test seat assembly are highly asymmetric,
with the inboard anchorage about 185 mm lower than and rearward of the outboard anchorage. Such highly asymmetric
anchorages are atypical. The outboard anchorage also appears to be unusually high. 






Ford suggested that anchorages be located based on the average dimensions of the vehicles surveyed in the agency's
research program. 



NHTSA agrees with the comments made by Ford and UM. The proposed location for the anchor points was based on the average
location of the anchorage points that was determined by the agency's research. However, among the proposed set of
coordinates for the inboard anchor point, only the y-coordinate was based on the average location. The x- and z-coordinates
of the old anchor were used. NHTSA will define all three coordinates of the inboard anchor point to reflect the location
of the ``average'' condition identified by the NHTSA research. 

In January 1994, tests were conducted at the agency's Vehicle Research and Test Center (VRTC), to verify that the change
in anchorage point does not negatively affect the quality and consistency of the tests. Those tests were directly
comparable to the tests in the earlier study, DOT-HS-808003, using the same booster/dummy configuration,
except that the inboard anchorage was at the ``old'' location in the fore-aft and vertical axes. The tests showed that
the corrected anchorage locations had a negligible affect on the performance of the child seats used to restrain 3-
and 6-year-old dummies. That is, there was no marked difference in the performance of the child seats using the old
anchorage locations as compared to the performance of the seats with the corrected locations. The principal difference
observed in the kinematics was that the booster seat did not slide toward the outboard anchorage location when tested
with the corrected inboard anchorage, as it tended to do using the old anchorage. This sliding is attributed to the
asymmetry of the inboard and outboard anchorages when tested with the old anchorage configuration. A report on these
VRTC tests is available in the docket for this rulemaking.

UM-CPP commented on the issue of the flexibility of the seat assembly's seatback for testing booster seats.
The commenter believes the specified seatback is too flexible to represent real-world vehicle seats, and that the
flexibility unrealistically affects booster test results. In the March 1994 dummy NPRM discussed above, NHTSA announced
that its research has shown that rulemaking does not appear warranted on changing the flexibility of the seatback.
The research evaluated the performance of booster seats when restrained under both conditions of flexible and rigid
seat back test assembly. The research findings indicated that the flexibility of the seatback is not a factor that
affects the test dummy's performance during compliance testing of shield-type booster seats. These findings were
summarized in a report titled, ``Evaluation of Effects of FMVSS 213 Seat Back's Flexibility on Booster Seat Responses,''
October 1992 (VRTC-82-0236, ``Child Restraint Testing (Rulemaking Support),'' DOT-HS-808006.

In commenting on this issue, UM said that the research was too limited. The commenter also did not agree with the conclusion
not to undertake rulemaking:



A very limited investigation of the issue concluded that shield boosters that had passed compliance tests with the
flexible seatback also passed with a rigid seatback. What the report did not acknowledge was the fact that, with the
rigid back, knee excursion increases were significant, and rebound in every case saw the dummy rise well above the
cushion and its head well above the seatback. The VRTC film footage is more dramatic than the still frames in the report,
and it also shows the impacts of the dummy's head with the structure behind the seatback. * * * I recommend
that the rigid seatback be adopted now at least for the 3-point belt test procedure.



NHTSA does not dispute that the flexibility of the back of the test seat assembly can affect a dummy's performance during
compliance testing of shield-type booster seats. NHTSA also recognizes that there are good reasons to further evaluate
the representativeness of the standard's test buck, concerning current vehicle seats. Moreover, NHTSA believes
there might be other reasons that may justify changing the Standard 213 seat back, such as possible cost reductions
due to not having to change the flexible pin in the seat hinges of the standard seat assembly after each test. The agency
has an on-going feasibility study at VRTC to determine if a need exists to upgrade the current FMVSS 213 test buck with
regard to these issues. 
However, NHTSA disagrees that the agency's research was too limited. NHTSA evaluated films and test reports for all
(seven) available FMVSS 213 compliance tests on child booster seats that were performed in 1990 and 1991. In addition,
sled tests were conducted on each of the booster seats that showed forward movement and contact with the dummy during
the compliance testing. There were four of these seats. When the seat back was fixed (rigid), the dummy's knee excursion
increased. However, the increased values for knee excursions did 

not

 exceed the 36-inch limit of FMVSS 213. In view of a lack of a safety need to revise the seat back, the agency has decided
to complete the VRTC feasibility study before deciding whether to undertake rulemaking on the matter. 
UM-CPP is correct that the dummy rose above the seat cushion when tested with the rigid seat back, and did impact
its head on the structure located behind the test assembly. However, that finding is inconclusive because the impacted
structure was placed on the test buck for the research and evaluation program on belt-positioning booster seats,
and will not be part of the seat assembly used in FMVSS 213 compliance testing. Thus, the dummy's head will not impact
the structure in an FMVSS 213 compliance test. 


c. Performance Criteria


This rule adopts performance requirements for belt-positioning seats. This rule requires belt-positioning seats
to meet the structural integrity, excursion, and injury criteria requirements of Standard 213 when dynamically
tested. Those requirements include maintaining the structural integrity of the seat, retaining the head and knees
of the dummy within specified excursion limits (limits on how far those portions of the body may move forward), and
limiting the forces which the head and chest of the dummy may experience during the test. Compliance with these requirements
better ensures that a child using the seat will not be injured by the collapse or disintegration of the seat, or by contact
with the interior of the vehicle, or by experiencing intolerable forces. Commenters overwhelmingly supported dynamically
testing belt-positioning seats. 
This rule does not adopt additional performance requirements for belt-positioning seats. The NPRM asked for comments
on the merits of additional performance requirements, and commenters disagreed with each other on the issue. UM-CPP
and Solutions Unlimited believed that the weight of the booster seat should be limited in order to limit loading the
back of a child occupant. Cosco said that it is unaware of any data that indicate a safety problem with the loads that
could be generated by booster seat backs. Cosco said excessive back loading would result in either higher HIC's or
higher G forces, and possibly greater excursions. The commenter believed it may be unnecessary for the agency to try
to measure seat back loading, unless NHTSA has research showing this phenomenon is of potential concern. 
Advocates also believed that Standard 213's dynamic test would detect problems relating to booster seat backs. The
commenter urged NHTSA to_



Carefully monitor and investigate defect complaints and manufacturer data related to special design features.
These aspects of booster seats can be dealt with through future rulemaking specifically addressing a problem identified
by manufacturer testing and consumer use.



NHTSA has decided not to specify limits on seat back loading at this time. There is a lack of data indicating a safety
problem. Further, there is no procedure at present for measuring or determining a threshold value for the loads imposed.

d. Labeling and Printed Instructions 


This rule adopts requirements for labeling and printed consumer instructions to decrease the likelihood that belt-positioning
seats will be misused. The information that needs to be conveyed to the consumer is: (a) That a belt-positioning seat
must be used with a vehicle lap/shoulder belt system to perform effectively and must not be used with just a vehicle
lap belt; (b) when using a shield booster with a vehicle's lap/shoulder belt system, the consumer must place the shoulder
belt portion of the system behind the child's head; and (c) the belt-positioning seat is not certified for aircraft
use. Each of these items of information is discussed below. This rule does not adopt the proposal that the manufacturer's
height and weight recommendations on the label include the information in metric units. In commenting on the NPRM,
Tarrant County Child Car Safety Coalition said that the metric units would be extremely confusing to many parents.
Similarly, Ford and Cosco commented that the proposed use of the word ``mass'' in the label would be confusing. NHTSA
concurs that the metric information on the label is unnecessary at this time. (Pursuant to the agency's plan to convert
to the metric system pursuant to the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act and E.O. 12770, this rule specifies metric
units in the specifications for Standard 213's compliance test procedures, 

see e.g.

, figures 1A and 1B. Since these values will not be any part of a labeled child seat, the metric values will not engender
confusion on the part of ordinary consumers.) 


1. Appropriate Vehicle Belt System 


NHTSA adopts a requirement that each add-on and built-in belt-positioning seat be labeled with a warning about using
the seat with Type 1 or the lap portion of Type 2 belt systems in a vehicle. No commenter other than Chrysler disputed
the need for the labeled warning. (Chrysler's comment is discussed below with respect to ``dual purpose'' boosters.)
In response to Cosco's belief that the warning was proposed to be on a separate label, no such requirement was proposed.
The warning can be on the existing installation label. Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety believed that there is
need for an installation diagram showing the proper installation of the belt-positioning seat in a vehicle. The American
Academy of Pediatrics believed the installation diagram should be placed directly on the child seat, and not on accompanying
printed material. Child restraints are already required to be labeled with an installation diagram showing the restraint
in the right front seating position in a vehicle, with a lap/shoulder belt (S5.5.2(l)). 
NHTSA proposed a labeling requirement for ``dual purpose'' boosters. These boosters can be used with either a lap
or a lap/shoulder belt in the shield mode, but only with a lap/shoulder belt in the belt-positioning mode. These seats
also typically require different belt routing for the two modes. To better ensure the boosters are properly used,
the agency proposed requiring dual purpose boosters to be labeled with information about the appropriate vehicle
belt system (lap-only or lap/shoulder belt system, depending on the design of the booster) to use with the booster,
and about how the booster must be used with the particular belt system (e.g., with or without the booster's shield).

Chrysler believed there is no need to label built-in dual purpose boosters that are factory-installed. Chrysler
believed these seats are already labeled with too much information, and that the information on the proposed label
``will mostly duplicate the information that is already provided in the [vehicle] owner's manual.'' Conversely,
Volvo commented that built-in belt-positioning seats ought to be labeled with information on correct belt usage.

NHTSA disagrees with Chrysler. There is a substantial amount of information that must be labeled on built-in seats.
However, it is vitally important that built-in seats be used with the appropriate vehicle belt system. Instructing
consumers how to use the belt-positioning booster increases the likelihood of correct usage. Further, the agency
believes that consumers are more likely to refer to the information if it is ``handy'' on the seat rather than in the
vehicle owner's manual. However, NHTSA is aware of concerns that there is too much information placed on child seat
labels. The agency will evaluate the labeling mandated by Standard 213 in the near future to determine if changes are
warranted. 


2. Placement of Shoulder Belt 


This rule requires manufacturers to label shield boosters with a warning to consumers that if the booster is used with
a Type II belt system, the shoulder belt portion of the belt system should be placed behind the child. Comments on the
proposed requirement were divided. UM-CPP ``strongly support[ed]'' the proposal because it found high head
accelerations resulting from impact of the dummy's head with the dummy's arm. Cosco disagreed with the proposal,
stating that the proposal ``ignores the excellent performance of shield booster seats used with the shoulder belt
in 

front

 of the child.'' (Emphasis in text.) 
NHTSA disagrees with Cosco about the effectiveness of shield-type booster seats used with the shoulder belt routed
in front of the child. The agency's VRTC Report No. DOT-HS-808-005 titled, ``Evaluation of Belt
Positioning Booster Seats and Lap/Shoulder Belt Test Procedures,'' summarized the findings of the agency's test
program on different booster seats. The report stated that, for small shield booster seats, ``the routing of the shoulder
belt (three point belt) in front of the dummy did significantly effect the HIC, 3 msec chest clip [acceleration], and
head excursion values, regardless of dummy size.'' Specifically, the study stated that:



The 3 year old dummy/three point belt tests had 80% to 90% higher HIC values than the corresponding lap only belt tests,
while for the 6 year old dummy, the three point belt tests were 18% to 59% higher. The 3 year old/three point belt tests
were the only test conditions that produced HIC values above 1000.

The study also showed that the chest clip acceleration increased for the 3-year-old dummy tested in two shield booster
seats, from 31G to 44G and from 38G to 45G, respectively. The chest acceleration increases for these seats were from
about 36G to 52G and 28G to 44G respectively. 


In short, NHTSA does not know of any shield-type booster seat that performs well when the booster seat is used with a
lap/shoulder belt system and the shoulder portion of the belt system is left in front of the child. 




3. Aircraft Use





This rule requires that belt-positioning seats be labeled with a statement that they are not certified for use on aircraft.
The Air Transport Association and UM-CPP supported the proposed requirement but also suggested requiring
all boosters to be so labeled. That suggestion is outside of the scope of the NPRM and has not been adopted. However,
NHTSA and the Federal Aviation Administration are jointly examining this issue and may initiate a separate rulemaking,
if warranted. 



ATA was concerned that both the statement against aircraft use and the statement certifying to aircraft use are required
to be in red. ATA suggested that the former statement be in a color other than red, to distinguish it from the latter.
The commenter believed an other-than-red contrasting color will help airline personnel better identify which child
seats are suitable for aircraft. 



NHTSA does not agree with the suggestion that there is a need to require the use of an other-than-red contrasting highlight
color to distinguish the warning against aircraft use from the certification to aircraft use. The red color is sufficient
to draw the attention of airline personnel to a warning. NHTSA believes using a color other than red would not necessarily
increase the level of awareness of the message contained in the warning. Rather, a message highlighted in red would
catch the eye of the reader (in this case, airline personnel), who would then read the message. Further, because belt-positioning
boosters lack any component in front of the child, they are readily distinguishable from other types of child restraints
(i.e., child restraints suitable for aircraft). The unique appearance of belt-positioning seats should facilitate
their identification by airline personnel. 




III. Labeling Boosters for Children Weighing Not Less Than 30 Pounds





This rule adopts a labeling requirement to address the problem of booster seats being used for children too small for
the restraints. This rule requires that, in labeling booster seats with their recommendations for the maximum and
minimum weight and height of children who can safely occupy the seats (S5.5.2(f) and S5.5.5(f)), manufacturers must
not recommend the seat for use by a child whose mass is less than 13.6 kilograms (30 pounds). No specific comments were
received on the feasibility of developing a booster seat that would safely restrain children weighing less than 30
pounds. 



Comments on the proposal were divided. Supporting the proposal were Volvo, Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety,
UM-CPP, and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP). Advocates believed that if booster seats are permitted
to cover a wide range of body weight and size, they become less appropriate at either end of the weight spectrum of recommended
use. Further, Advocates said ``merely stating a minimum figure of 30 pounds in the manufacturers' recommendations
for the weight and height range of the restraint is not sufficient.'' It said the booster seats should also have a separate
affirmative warning statement that the booster seat is not recommended for children who weigh less than 30 pounds.




AAP stated: 








While the Academy encourages NHTSA to be responsive and supportive of innovations in restraint technology, development
of new products should be guided by a recognition of a child's requirements for protection at different stages of growth.
What would be the low-weight end for such a product? We doubt that it is appropriate to approve a booster seat for children
weighing less than 30 pounds, when these children can be more safely transported in standard car safety seats. Ten
years ago, it was not uncommon for boosters seats to be available for children who weighed 20 pounds. Gradually, the
industry shifted because of concern for protection of the younger children to where the low-weight end for boosters
became 30 pounds. To drop below 30 pounds as the minimum weight for boosters, again, means to consider designs that
provide for upper-trunk support, designs like the early Strolee booster seat that included a five-point harness
and tether. Since it is unlikely that this design would find popular acceptance and use, a more reasonable course might
be to explore the potential of integrated booster seats in motor vehicles for children weighing less than 30 pounds.
To do this, however, requires attention to developing a lap/shoulder belt that can adjust to varying heights so that
the fit is across the child's chest, not the child's face or neck. 








Ford and Cosco opposed the proposal. Ford said that the vehicle manufacturer should have the flexibility to recommend
use of a belt-positioning (booster) seat, ``even for some children under 30 pounds.'' Ford said, ``A very thin child
weighing less than 30 pounds may be too tall for a convertible child restraint, but an ideal candidate for a belt-positioning
booster.'' Ford suggested that rather than base the prohibition on weight (30 pounds), NHTSA base it on height or age.
Thus, Ford suggested that Standard 213 specify that no booster can be recommended for children of standing heights
less than 900 mm (36 inches) or less than two years of age. Cosco believed that the prohibition against recommending
a booster for children less than 13.6 kilograms (kg) is design restrictive: 








Surely it is possible that a booster seat meeting all requirements * * * could be developed either for
children under 30 pounds or over 60 pounds in the future. Requiring a product to meet all the dynamic test requirements
regardless of what weight is recommended should be sufficient.

<TEXT>
 


NHTSA does not agree with Ford and Cosco that Standard 213 need not specify that boosters must not be recommended for
children of less than 13.6 kg. NHTSA generally agrees with Cosco that dynamic test requirements should be 

the

 criteria in determining whether a given design performs adequately. However, in the case of booster seats, the dynamic
test failed to prevent substandard restraining devices, with respect to protecting children at the extremes of the
weight ranges recommended for the restraints (e.g., the 20 pound and the 48 pound child). As explained in the ANPRM
preceding this rule, heretofore, manufacturers had great leeway in manufacturing booster seats and specifying
which size (weight) children were suitable for the seats. That leeway resulted in alarming practices: 








Concerns about shield-type boosters arose from the recommendations by manufacturers about the size of children
which could appropriately use a particular booster. Particular designs or models of boosters were typically recommended
for a broad range of children. Often, the seats were recommended for use by children weighing from about 20 to 70 pounds.
Such recommendations engendered concerns as to whether these boosters could provide adequate protection for children
ranging from nine-month-old infants (average weigh 20 pounds) to six-year-old (48 pounds) and older children. 







57 FR 22682, 22683; May 29, 1992. 





As explained in the ANPRM, in tests conducted by NHTSA and by Calspan Corporation, it was found that shield boosters
could not restrain a test dummy representing a 9-month-old child when dynamically tested using Standard 213's procedures.
Yet, the boosters were certified as meeting Standard 213, because only the three-year-old (33 pound) child dummy
is used to determine compliance with the standard. So tested, the restraints met Standard 213. 



NHTSA agrees with the commenters that children with a mass of less than 13.6 kg are better protected in convertible
and toddler seats. These child seats have been performing well when tested with the various sizes of dummies. However,
booster seats have not performed adequately in restraining dummies with masses of less than 13.6 kg in tests done over
the years at Calspan, the University of Michigan and VRTC. Moreover, the 9-month-old dummy in Part 572 that could be
used to evaluate the effectiveness of booster seats in protecting children with masses less than 13.6 kg is not instrumented,
and is therefore limited in its ability to provide a full and accurate indication of the safety of booster seats in protecting
the very young child. Accordingly, the agency agrees with AAP that the proposed minimum weight limit for use of booster
seats should be imposed until, and if, the state of the art of the technology evolves to design and develop a booster
seat that would protect children with masses of less than 13.6 kg. However, the agency does not agree with Advocates
that an affirmative warning label is appropriate. The label is ladened with warning statements, and adding to the
label risks ``information overload,'' which could reduce the effectiveness of each warning. 




IV. Effective Date 





This rule is effective in 30 days. An effective date of less than 180 days is justified because this rule relieves present
requirements in Standard 213 that restrict the manufacture of belt-positioning booster seats. Moreover, the rule
facilitates the manufacture of a booster seat that could provide safety benefits. 



However, sections of Standard 213 adopted today that affect present labeling of shield booster seats and the printed
instructions accompanying these seats are effective September 1, 1994. Those sections are S5.5.2(i)(2) and S5.6.1.9(a).
Ford and Cosco pointed out that the NPRM included proposals on those sections that would affect how present booster
seats are labeled, and how printed instructions now read. S5.5.2(i)(2) and S5.6.1.9(a) require that a booster seat
be labeled with and provided with instructions on a warning to use the booster seat only with the vehicle's lap belt
system, or with the shoulder belt portion of a Type II belt behind the child.

3

 Ford and Cosco argued for a longer leadtime for these changes. NHTSA agrees that more leadtime is appropriate. The
agency agrees with Cosco that more leadtime will help deplete supplies of existing labels (Cosco suggested three
months is adequate), and concurs with Ford that more leadtime is warranted to change existing labels and printed instructions.
(Ford suggested an effective date of September 1, 1994.) This rule makes the requirements affecting the labeling
and printed instructions for shield boosters effective September 1, 1994. 





With regard to belt-positioning seats, the labeling requirements adopted today do not change the way these child
seats are labeled. Since belt-positioning seats cannot now meet Standard 213, there are no belt-positioning seats
manufactured today for children under 50 pounds. The requirements only apply if manufacturers desire to produce
such seats for children under 50 pounds. 




V. Rulemaking Analyses and Notices 




Executive Order 12866 (Regulatory Planning and Review) and DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures





This rulemaking document was not reviewed under E.O. 12866, ``Regulatory Planning and Review.'' The agency has considered
the impact of this rulemaking action under the Department of Transportation's regulatory policies and procedures,
and has determined that it is not ``significant'' under them. NHTSA has prepared a final regulatory evaluation for
this action which discusses its potential costs, benefits and other impacts. A copy of that evaluation has been placed
in the docket for this rulemaking action. Interested persons may obtain copies of the evaluation by writing to the
docket section at the address provided at the beginning of this document.

<TEXT>
 

To briefly summarize the evaluation, while the agency believes that belt-positioning seats will improve safety,
the magnitude of that improvement is not known. Belt-positioning booster seats might be more acceptable to children
than shield-type boosters. This could lead to increased usage rates for child restraint systems. Increased usage
is important because child restraints are highly effective when used properly. Belt-positioning booster seats
raise the child up in the vehicle seat, increasing the chances that the vehicle's shoulder belt would fit properly,
and also that the lap belt will fit properly because it will be positioned lower on the child's hips. 


NHTSA also concludes that this rule will result in negligible costs for testing labs and manufacturers of belt-positioning
booster seats. The costs would result from testing and certifying belt-positioning seats. Manufacturers will be
minimally affected by this rulemaking because it simply permits new designs in booster seats and does not require
any design change or impose additional costs on manufacturers. Manufacturers that do not want to manufacture a belt-positioning
booster seat will not be affected. 




Regulatory Flexibility Act




NHTSA has considered the effects of this rulemaking action under the Regulatory Flexibility Act. I hereby certify
that it will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The agency knows of 14
manufacturers of child restraints, seven of which NHTSA considers to be small businesses (including Kolcraft, which
with an estimated 500 employees, is on the borderline of being a small business). 


Regardless of the number of small businesses, this rule will not have a significant economic impact on these entities.
The rule would affect manufacturers only if they choose to manufacture a new type of booster seat. The amendment could
benefit manufacturers by allowing them to manufacture and sell a new product. However, the agency does not know how
interested manufacturers are in belt-positioning child seats, and even if they were interested, the extent to which
consumers would purchase the product. 

Small organizations and governmental jurisdictions procure child restraint systems for programs such as loaner
programs. However, only a small percentage of loaner programs carry booster seats. In any event, NHTSA believes that
any small impact on price, either positive or negative, will not have a substantial impact on these loaner programs.
Thus, these entities would not be significantly affected by this rule. 



Executive Order 12612 (Federalism)



This rulemaking action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order
12612, and the agency has determined that this rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the
preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 



National Environmental Policy Act



NHTSA has analyzed this rulemaking action for the purposes of the National Environmental Policy Act. The agency has
determined that implementation of this action will not have any significant impact on the quality of the human environment.

This rule does not have any retroactive effect. Under section 49 U.S.C. 30103, whenever a Federal motor vehicle safety
standard is in effect, a state may not adopt or maintain a safety standard applicable to the same aspect of performance
which is not identical to the Federal standard, except to the extent that the state requirement imposes a higher level
of performance and applies only to vehicles procured for the State's use. 49 U.S.C. 30161 sets forth a procedure for
judicial review of final rules establishing, amending or revoking Federal motor vehicle safety standards. That
section does not require submission of a petition for reconsideration or other administrative proceedings before
parties may file suit in court.

ACTION:

 Final rule.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The American Automobile Labeling Act provides that, beginning October 1, 1994, passenger cars and other light vehicles
must be labeled with information about their domestic and foreign content. The new labels will enable consumers to
take country of origin information into account in deciding which new vehicle to purchase. 


This final rule establishes a new regulation to implement this statute. The regulation includes requirements which
apply to motor vehicle manufacturers, suppliers of passenger motor vehicle equipment, and motor vehicle dealers.
For model year 1995 and model year 1996 carlines which are first offered for sale to ultimate purchasers before June
1, 1995, manufacturers and suppliers may, instead of following the detailed calculation procedures set forth in
this new regulation, use procedures that they expect, in good faith, to yield similar results.

I. Background 


A. Statutory Requirements


Congress enacted the American Automobile Labeling Act (Labeling Act) as part of the Department of Transportation
and Related Agencies Appropriation Act for Fiscal Year 1993, Public Law 102-388. The Labeling Act amended Title
II of the Motor Vehicle Information and Cost Savings Act (Cost Savings Act) by adding a new section 210.

NHTSA notes that on July 5, 1994, the President signed a bill (Pub. L. 103-272) which revised and codified ``without
substantive change'' the Cost Savings Act and two other NHTSA statutes. The content labeling provisions, which formerly
existed as section 210 of the Cost Savings Act, are now codified at 49 U.S.C. 32304, Passenger motor vehicle country
of origin labeling. Since this final rule was essentially completed before the new bill was signed and since the bill
did not contain substantive changes, NHTSA is not revising the preamble of this final rule to delete references to
section 210 and cite the new statutory sections. However, the statutory citations in the regulatory text have been
updated. If the agency determines that additional conforming changes are appropriate for the regulatory text, it
will make them at a later time. 
Section 210 requires passenger motor vehicles

1

 manufactured on or after October 1, 1994 to be labeled with information about their domestic and foreign content.
The purpose of the section is to enable consumers to take country of origin information into account in deciding which
vehicle to purchase.




Section 210(b) requires each new passenger motor vehicle to be labeled with the following five items of information:

(1) The percentage U.S./Canadian equipment (parts) content; 
(2) The names of any countries

2

 other than the U.S. and Canada which individually contribute 15 percent or more of the equipment content, and the percentage
content for each such country; 




(3) The final assembly point by city, state (where appropriate), and country; 
(4) The country of origin of the engine; and 
(5) The country of origin of the transmission.

3

 




Section 210(b) specifies that the first two items of information, the equipment content percentages for the U.S./Canada
and foreign countries, are calculated on a ``carline'' basis rather than for each individual vehicle. The term ``carline''
refers to a name of a group of vehicles which has a degree of commonality in construction, e.g., body, chassis. 
Manufacturers of passenger motor vehicles are required to establish the required information annually for each
model year, and are responsible for the affixing of the required label to the vehicle. Dealers are responsible for
maintaining the labels. 
In order to calculate the information required for the label, the vehicle manufacturer must know certain information
about the origin of each item of passenger motor vehicle equipment used to assemble its vehicles. For example, in order
to calculate the information for the first item of the label, i.e., the percentage of the value of the motor vehicle
equipment installed on passenger motor vehicles within a carline which originated in the U.S./Canada, the manufacturer
must know the U.S./Canadian content of each item of motor vehicle equipment. 
The statute specifies that suppliers of passenger motor vehicle equipment must provide information about the origin
of the equipment they supply. For purposes of determining U.S./Canadian origin for the first item on the label, the
statute provides different procedures depending on whether equipment is received from an allied supplier (a supplier
wholly owned by the manufacturer) or an outside supplier.

For equipment received from outside suppliers, section 210(f)(5)(A) provides that the equipment is considered
U.S./Canadian if it contains at least 70 percent value added in the U.S./Canada. Thus, any equipment that is at least
70 percent U.S./Canadian is valued at 100 percent U.S./Canadian, and any equipment under 70 percent is valued at zero
percent. This statutory provision is sometimes referred to as the ``roll-up, roll-down'' provision. For equipment
received from allied suppliers, section 210(f)(5)(B) provides that the actual amount of U.S./Canadian content
is used.

The statute requires the Department of Transportation to promulgate regulations implementing the content labeling
requirements. Section 210(c) requires the promulgation of regulations which specify the form and content of the
required labels, and the manner and location in which the labels must be affixed. Section 210(d) requires promulgation
of such regulations as may be necessary to carry out the labeling requirements, including regulations to establish
a procedure to verify the required labeling information. That section also directs that such regulations provide
the ultimate purchaser of a new passenger motor vehicle with the best and most understandable information possible
about the foreign and U.S./Canada origin of the equipment of such vehicles without imposing costly and unnecessary
burdens on the manufacturers. Finally, section 210(d) also specifies that the regulations include provisions requiring
suppliers to certify whether their equipment is of U.S., U.S./Canadian, or foreign origin.

Section 210 does not specify a specific date for completing the rulemaking. However, section 210(d) does direct that
the regulations be promulgated in time to provide adequate compliance leadtime before content labeling becomes
mandatory on October 1, 1994.



B. Request for Comments and Public Meeting



On November 18, 1992, NHTSA published in the 

Federal Register

 (57 FR 54351) a request for comments in order to obtain information which would be of assistance in developing a proposal
to implement section 210. To add an additional dimension to the effort to obtain public input, a public meeting was
held on December 17, 1992, during which the agency heard nine speakers. More than 20 written comments were subsequently
received by the agency, including comments from vehicle manufacturers, and manufacturer and dealer groups.



C. Notice of Proposed Rulemaking



On November 19, 1993, NHTSA published in the 

Federal Register

 (57 FR 61042) a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) for a new regulation to implement section 210. The NPRM reflected
the agency's consideration of the matters raised in the oral and written comments received in response to the request
for comments, as well as many other issues. In developing the proposed regulation, the agency necessarily followed
the language of section 210 as closely as possible. NHTSA noted in the NPRM that, given the high level of detail set forth
in the statute, the agency has little discretion with respect to many aspects of the calculation and labeling scheme.
A summary of the proposed regulation follows.

Under the proposed regulation, vehicle manufacturers would be required to affix to all new passenger motor vehicles
a label which provides the five items of content information specified by section 210. The agency proposed to require
specific language for the label. The NPRM included a sample label, consistent with the proposed requirements, which
read as follows:




PARTS CONTENT INFORMATION






For vehicles in this carline:


U.S./Canadian Parts Content: 50%
Major Sources of Foreign Parts Content:
Japan: 20%
Mexico: 15% 




For this vehicle:


Final Assembly Point: Flint, Michigan, USA
Country of Origin:
Engine: U.S.
Transmission: Canada 






Note:

 The PARTS CONTENT of a typical vehicle makes up about (a range was to be specified in a final rule) percent of the vehicle's
total wholesale cost to the dealer. 




NHTSA proposed to specify the heading ``PARTS CONTENT INFORMATION'' to draw the attention of consumers to the content
information, and indicate the subject of the information. The purpose of the proposed sub-headings ``For vehicles
in this carline'' and ``For this vehicle'' was to advise consumers which items of information relate to the carline
as a whole and which relate to the individual vehicle. The purpose of the proposed explanatory note at the bottom of
the label was to inform consumers about the percentage of a typical vehicle's wholesale cost to the dealer that is attributable
to parts content, thereby helping consumers avoid confusing the parts content information specified on the label
with overall vehicle value (which would include other factors such as final assembly labor).

In order to ensure that vehicle manufacturers have the information necessary to calculate the information for the
content labels, NHTSA proposed to require each supplier of passenger motor vehicle equipment to provide specified
information about the content of the equipment it supplies. Under the proposal, the information was to be provided
directly to the party receiving the equipment, i.e., either a vehicle manufacturer or an allied supplier, in the form
of a certification. The agency proposed specific provisions concerning when the information was to be provided.

NHTSA also proposed specific procedures for manufacturers and suppliers to follow in calculating values for the
label. One issue of particular note was which costs are to be regarded as costs incurred at the final assembly point
and beyond, including the costs of assembly and labor. Section 210 provides that these costs are not to be included
in the calculation of parts content. NHTSA noted that manufacturers may conduct some pre-assembly operations, e.g.,
production of equipment, at the same location as final assembly. The agency tentatively concluded that such operations
should be treated in the same fashion as the operations of an allied supplier. The agency proposed to specify a particular
phase in the assembly process, for both the body and chassis, that would mark the beginning of final assembly.

Another significant issue which NHTSA addressed in the NPRM was whether ``carline'' should encompass different
countries of assembly. At present, there are a number of vehicle models that include some vehicles assembled in the
U.S./Canada and other vehicles assembled in other countries. The agency tentatively concluded that country of final
assembly should not be considered in making carline determinations, since section 210 specifies that carline determinations
are to be made based on degree of commonality in construction. NHTSA recognized, however, that additional subdivision
of carlines by country of assembly would result in labeling information that is more representative of the individually
labeled vehicles. The agency requested comments on requiring additional labeling information for carlines assembled
in more than one country.

<TEXT>
 

NHTSA also addressed the issue of whether any limited exclusions should be provided from section 210's labeling requirements.
The agency stated that it was considering whether manufacturers of vehicles with low U.S./Canadian content should
be permitted to identify the amount of such content as ``minimal'' instead of being required to calculate a specific
percentage. The agency also indicated that it was considering excluding multi-stage and low volume manufacturers
from the requirement to provide the first two items of information on the label, i.e., the two items which must be calculated
on a carline basis. NHTSA stated that, as part of considering whether any limited exclusions should be provided, the
agency was in the process of evaluating its authority to provide such exclusions.

NHTSA also proposed to require manufacturers to report certain content information to the agency, and to require
manufacturers and suppliers to maintain records of the information underlying the information provided on the content
label. The agency proposed to require dealers to maintain the content label on each vehicle until the vehicle is sold
to a consumer.



II. Summary of Comments



The agency received about 80 comments on the NPRM, including ones from vehicle manufacturers, suppliers, automotive
trade associations, and private citizens. A brief, representative summary of the major comments follows. A more
specific discussion of representative comments, and the agency's responses, are set forth later in this preamble.

The American Automobile Manufacturers Association (AAMA), representing General Motors (GM), Ford and Chrysler,
expressed concern about the timing of the final regulation. That organization stated that the proposed regulation
will require extensive data collection and calculation requirements, and that there are several areas of uncertainty
that will not be resolved until a final rule is issued. AAMA stated that it has been working in conjunction with the Automotive
Industry Action Group (AIAG) and a number of suppliers to establish processes to comply with the law, but has been unable
to complete this activity because of uncertainties about the final rule. AAMA stated that manufacturers and suppliers
will not be able to comply with all the data collection and calculation requirements by the October 1994 implementation
date. It requested NHTSA to allow manufacturers and suppliers to use procedures that are expected to yield similar
results for at least 12 months after the final rule is published.

In addition to expressing its concern about timing, AAMA urged the agency to make numerous changes in the proposed
regulation. On the subject of the wording of the label, that organization objected to describing the first item of
information as ``U.S./Canadian Parts Content.'' AAMA argued that the statute specifies use of the term ``U.S./Canadian
Content,'' and that the inclusion of the word ``parts'' is contrary to the statute. That commenter also recommended
against including an explanatory note concerning the percentage of a typical vehicle's wholesale cost to the dealer
that is attributable to parts content. AAMA stated that such a note would be confusing to the consumer and could be misleading
because of the broad range of ratios that exist for vehicles.

AAMA also recommended a number of changes with respect to the proposed procedures for calculating the information
on the label. One of the recommendations concerned which operations should be considered part of final assembly.
That organization stated that under NHTSA's proposal, the painted body and chassis would be considered a substrate
to which passenger motor vehicle equipment is attached to produce a finished vehicle. AAMA stated that this approach
is contrary to the generally accepted definition of the passenger motor vehicle equipment assembly process. That
organization agreed, however, that the production of certain equipment at the final assembly point should not be
considered part of final assembly but should instead be included in the valuation of the motor vehicle equipment and
content calculations. AAMA recommended that the agency define ``final assembly'' to include all operations involved
in the assembly of the vehicle performed at the final assembly point, including but not limited to assembly of body
panels, painting, final chassis assembly, and trim installation, except engine and transmission fabrication and
assembly and the fabrication of motor vehicle equipment components produced at the same final assembly point using
stamping, machining or molding processes.

AAMA also recommended numerous other changes related to such things as how the value of passenger motor vehicle equipment
is determined, how the engine and transmission countries of origin are determined, the responsibilities of suppliers,
how values in the currency of one country should be converted into values in the currency of another country, the time
when the label must be attached to the vehicle, and what requirements are appropriate with respect to maintenance
of records and reporting content information to the agency. On the subject of supplier requirements, AAMA stated
that the proposal would require that suppliers report on all parts supplied to a manufacturer or allied supplier regardless
of value of the item of equipment or the country of manufacture. That organization recommended that the reporting
requirement be limited to providing content data on those items of equipment for which such data was requested by the
manufacturer.

On the subject of how vehicle models that are assembled in both the U.S./Canada and other countries should be treated,
AAMA stated that the statute contains a sufficient definition of ``carline'' and that additional information should
not be provided on the label to indicate that a carline is produced in more than one country. That organization stated
that separate content calculations, one set for each assembly country and the entire carline, would cause unnecessary
burdens and confuse the consumer.

On the subject of possible exclusions, AAMA supported a limited exclusion for vehicles with low U.S./Canadian parts
content, albeit at a lower content level from that discussed in the NPRM. AAMA also stated that since the agency ``has
implied'' that it has the authority to set a minimal level for the U.S. and Canadian content which removes a recordkeeping
burden on the low end of content, it urged that such relief also be provided for the high end of content. That organization
recommended that, for carlines with more than 85 percent U.S./Canadian content, manufacturers be permitted to specify
the content as ``at least'' 85 percent instead of stating a specific percentage.

<TEXT>
 

GM, Ford and Chrysler also each submitted individual comments. To a large extent, these comments reiterated arguments
made by AAMA. An additional argument made by GM concerned the calculation methodology for determining the percentage
U.S./Canadian content for a carline. GM stated that the agency had proposed that the proper method to establish the
U.S./Canadian content for a carline would be to reasonably project the installation rates for all equipment options
and choice offered on that carline; multiply those rates by the U.S./Canadian content value for each option or choice,
and divide the result by the total value for all equipment, domestic or foreign. That company stated that it has found
for cost management and planning purposes that the use of a high volume configuration carline model results in better
management control of the assembly process than the so-called average equipped carline model. GM stated that such
a model has found wide acceptance in calculations made for corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) emission testing
configurations and most recently for vehicle configurations under NAFTA. That company recommended that the agency
permit manufacturers to use established carline cost management models for establishing the percentage U.S./Canadian
content required to be included in the AALA domestic content label. 



Foreign vehicle manufacturers also recommended numerous changes in the proposed requirements, but often from a
very different perspective from that of the domestic vehicle manufacturers. For example, while the domestic manufacturers
urged a change in the proposed definition of ``final assembly'' so that it is considered to begin earlier in the vehicle
manufacturing process, the foreign manufacturers generally urged changes in the definition so that it is considered
to begin later in the vehicle manufacturing process. 


The Association of International Automobile Manufacturers (AIAM) and Toyota stated that the point of final assembly
should be considered to be no sooner than the point at which the engine and vehicle body are fastened together. AIAM
argued that the Labeling Act defines ``final assembly'' as the time when ``all component parts necessary to the mechanical
operation of such automobile are included,'' and stated that the proposed definition would defy the stated intent
of the Act and defy all conventional wisdom with respect to the automotive manufacturing process. Nissan stated that
an appropriate point to be identified as the beginning of final assembly is the moment in the production process just
before the attachment of the engine and drive train to the chassis. Mitsubishi stated that the point where final assembly
begins should be defined as the point at which the engine and body are fastened. According to that company, this would
be more consistent with the agency's proposed definition of ``final assembly point'', where all components and parts
necessary to the mechanical operation of such automobile are included. 



BMW commented that NHTSA's proposal defined ``final assembly'' with regard to the body as the point at which the body
leaves the paint shop. That company stated that this portion of the definition is very precise and that the costs associated
with it will likely be similar between manufacturers regardless of painting process or vehicle design. BMW commented,
however, with regard to definition of final assembly of the chassis, that it believes a manufacturer would be able
to tailor the assembly process to take advantage of the definition and alter its carline's part content percentages.
That company stated that this portion of the definition employs the point at which the engine and transmission are
placed on the chassis frame or on the assembly cradle. According to BMW, because this point can be varied, a manufacturer
would have the opportunity to install or not install equipment such as the brake system including ABS, wheels and tires,
and interior components and trim. BMW commented that a manufacturer could choose to install the engine last, essentially
including all labor and overhead in its parts content calculations. BMW recommended that the agency investigate
assembly processes and include a more definitive point to stop including costs associated with the chassis assembly.




The foreign vehicle manufacturers also generally had very different views than the domestic manufacturers with
respect to the treatment of vehicle models including some vehicles assembled in the U.S./Canada and other vehicles
assembled in other countries. AIAM stated that failing to allow manufacturers to distinguish between countries
of production within a particular carline directly contradicts the Act's stated purpose of providing consumers
with the best and most understandable information possible. That organization stated that it believes that NHTSA
has the authority to adopt a country of production split for determining the parts content percentages for carlines,
in order to follow the stated intent of the Act. According to AIAM, without carline subdivision, the information presented
to the consumer will be at best misleading, and at worst totally inaccurate. 


The Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association (JAMA) urged that separate calculations for carlines manufactured
in more than one country at least be permitted. That organization stated that the failure to specify such percentages
separately would result in an overstated domestic content on imported vehicles and an understated one on domestically
produced vehicles. According to JAMA, the U.S. consumer cannot possibly be served by such misleading information.




While numerous foreign vehicle manufacturers objected to the agency's proposal to exclude country of assembly as
a factor to consider in making carline determinations, several indicated that, if NHTSA did not change that position,
they supported the concept of providing additional information on the label concerning such vehicles. Honda, for
example, stated that such additional information would improve the accuracy of the information provided to the consumer.




The foreign vehicle manufacturers differed among themselves on the question of whether an explanatory note should
be provided concerning the percentage of a typical vehicle's wholesale cost to the dealer that is attributable to
parts content. AIAM, for example, stated that such additional information would only serve to confuse the consumer,
and that a single percentage range to be used by all manufacturers cannot adequately illustrate the many variations
involved in the manufacture and distribution of motor vehicles. JAMA, however, argued that it is vital to consumer
understanding to clarify the fact that the label calculation does not include vehicle final assembly labor. 



The foreign vehicle manufacturers strongly supported a limited exclusion for vehicles with low U.S./Canadian parts
content. However, several of them argued that unless the agency also permits a limited exclusion from providing the
information required for item two of the label, i.e., the percentage parts content originating from major sources
of foreign content, there would be only a minimal benefit from an exclusion from specifying the percentage U.S./Canadian
parts content. This is because the foreign manufacturers would have to collect detailed information from most of
their suppliers to calculate the information for item two of the label. The foreign manufacturers suggested various
alternative approaches, such as requiring them to specify the countries that constitute major sources of foreign
content but not the percentages from such countries.

Like the domestic vehicle manufacturers, the foreign manufacturers recommended numerous other changes in the proposed
regulation, relating to such things as how the value of passenger motor vehicle equipment is determined, how the engine
and transmission countries of origin are determined, the responsibilities of suppliers, how currencies should
be converted, the time when the label must be attached to the vehicle, and what requirements are appropriate with respect
to maintenance of records and reporting content information to the agency. 


NHTSA received comments from several suppliers and one supplier trade association, the Automotive Parts Manufacturers'
Association (APMA). That association stated that if the agency does not adopt the AIAG model of content calculation,
the regulation should specifically state how outside suppliers should calculate U.S./Canadian content. APMA stated
that the proposed rule relies on the definitions of ``value added'' and ``foreign content'' in the statute, but that
neither the statute nor the regulation give specific regulatory direction concerning how outside suppliers are
to calculate ``value added in the U.S./Canada.'' 



The agency also received comments from two dealer associations, the National Automobile Dealers Association (NADA)
and the American International Automobile Dealers Association (AIADA). These organizations submitted comments
which focused on dealer responsibilities and other issues of concern to dealers. 


NHTSA also received comments from final stage manufacturers and the National Truck Equipment Association (NTEA),
a trade association representing distributors and manufacturers of multi-stage produced work-related trucks,
truck bodies and equipment. These comments focused on issues of concern to final stage manufacturers. 


III. Overview of Final Rule 




Today's final rule establishes a new regulation, 49 CFR Part 583, Automobile Parts Content Labeling, to implement
section 210 of the Cost Savings Act. The regulation establishes requirements for (1) Manufacturers of passenger
motor vehicles; (2) suppliers of motor vehicle equipment used in the assembly of passenger motor vehicles; and (3)
dealers of passenger motor vehicles. A summary of the requirements is set forth below. 




A. Manufacturers of Passenger Motor Vehicles 




Beginning on October 1, 1994, vehicle manufacturers are required to affix to all new passenger motor vehicles (this
category includes passenger cars, certain small buses, and all trucks and multipurpose passenger vehicles with
a gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR) of 8,500 pounds or less) a label which provides the following information: 



(1) 

U.S./Canadian Parts Content_

the overall percentage, by value, U.S./Canadian content of the motor vehicle equipment installed on the carline
of which the vehicle is a part; 


(2) 

Major Sources of Foreign Parts Content_

the names of the two countries, if any, other than the U.S./Canada, which contributed the greatest amount (at least
15 percent), by value, of motor vehicle equipment for the carline, and the percentage, by value, of the equipment originating
in each such country; 



(3) 

Final Assembly Point_

the city, state (where appropriate), and country in which the final assembly of the vehicle occurred; 


(4) 

Country of Origin for the Engine Parts; 


(5) Country of Origin for the Transmission Parts.

<PARENT> FR940721-0-00014 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The label is also required to include a statement below this information reading as follows:






Note: 

Parts content does not include final assembly, distribution, or other non-parts costs.




Manufacturers are permitted, but not required, to provide at the end of the note the following additional statement
for carlines assembled in the U.S. and/or Canada, and another country:




This carline is assembled in the U.S. and/or Canada, and in [insert name of each other country]. The U.S./Canadian
parts content for the portion of the carline assembled in [insert name of country, treating the U.S. and Canada together,
i.e., U.S./Canada] is [

XX

]%

. 


The information for items (1) and (2) of the label is calculated, prior to the beginning of the model year, for each carline.
The information for items (3), (4) and (5) is determined for each individual vehicle. However, the country of origin
for groups of engines and transmissions is determined once a model year. 

Vehicle manufacturers are to calculate the information for the label by using information provided to them by suppliers.
Under the final rule, manufacturers and allied suppliers are required to request their suppliers to provide the relevant
content information specified in Part 583, and the suppliers are required to provide the specified information in
response to such requests. The vehicle manufacturers are required to maintain records of the information used to
determine the information provided on the labels. 


B. Suppliers of Motor Vehicle Equipment 



For any equipment that an outside supplier (a supplier not wholly owned by the vehicle manufacturer) supplies to a
vehicle manufacturer or to a supplier wholly owned by the vehicle manufacturer (an allied supplier), the outside
supplier is required to provide, at the request of that manufacturer or allied supplier, the following information:


(1) The price of the equipment to the manufacturer or allied supplier; 

(2) Whether the equipment has, or does not have, at least 70 percent of its value added in the U.S. and Canada; 

(3) For any equipment for which the U.S./Canadian content is less than 70 percent, the country of origin of the equipment
(treating the U.S. and Canada together); 

(4) For equipment that may be used in an engine or transmission, the country of origin of the equipment (separating
the U.S. and Canada). 

For any equipment that an allied supplier supplies to a vehicle manufacturer, the supplier is required to provide,
at the request of the manufacturer, the following information: 

(1) The price of the equipment to the manufacturer; 

(2) The percentage U.S./Canadian content of the equipment;

(3) The country of origin of the equipment (treating the U.S. and Canada together);

(4) For equipment that may be used in an engine or transmission, the country of origin of the equipment (separating
the U.S. and Canada). 

A supplier of engines and transmissions is, in addition to the above requirements, required to provide, at the request
of the vehicle manufacturer, the country of origin for each engine or transmission it supplies to the manufacturer,
determined as follows: The country in which the greatest percentage, by value (using the total cost of 

equipment

 to the engine or transmission supplier, while excluding the cost of final assembly labor), was added to the engine
or transmission. 

Both outside and allied suppliers that directly supply equipment to vehicle manufacturers are required to provide
the specified information directly to the vehicle manufacturers, in the form of a certification. Outside suppliers
that directly supply to allied suppliers are required to provide the specified information and certification directly
to the allied suppliers. Suppliers are also required to maintain records of the information used to compile the information
provided to the manufacturers and outside suppliers. 

The requirements apply only to suppliers which supply directly to the vehicle manufacturer or to an allied supplier.
No requirements are imposed on suppliers earlier in the chain, 

e.g.

, a company which supplies an item of equipment to an outside supplier which then supplies it to a vehicle manufacturer.




C. Dealers of Passenger Motor Vehicles 



Dealers are required to maintain the label on each vehicle until the vehicle is sold to a consumer. 



D. First Year Requirements 



For model year 1995 vehicles and model year 1996 vehicles which are offered for sale to ultimate purchasers before
June 1, 1995, manufacturers and suppliers may, instead of following the detailed calculation procedures set forth
in this new regulation, use procedures that they expect, in good faith, to yield similar results. 



IV. Agency Rationale and Response to Comments 



A. Major Issues Concerning Information on the Label



In this section of the preamble, NHTSA presents its analysis of the major issues and comments concerning the information
on the label, including, but not limited to, ones relating to what information is provided on the label and the wording
of the label, how manufacturers must calculate the specified information, and how suppliers are to make the necessary
determinations concerning the origin of the equipment they supply. 

For ease of comparison with the proposed regulation, the discussion of issues is generally organized according to
the sections of the proposed regulation to which they relate. The agency notes that in some cases the cited sections
are relevant not only to the major issues concerning the information on the label, but also to other issues. The other
issues are discussed elsewhere in the preamble. 



1. Definitions (Section 583.4) 



The definitions section prescribes the meaning of terms and concepts which are used throughout the content labeling
regulation. As discussed below, some of the terms and concepts have a significant effect on the information to be provided
on the label, and some of the proposed definitions were controversial with many commenters. 
 


a. Carline. 

Section 210(b) specifies that U.S./Canadian parts content and major sources of foreign parts content (items one
and two on the label) are determined on a ``carline'' basis, instead of for each individual vehicle. Section 210(f)
defines 

carline 

as meaning a name denoting a group of vehicles which has a degree of commonality in construction (e.g., body, chassis),
and not considering any level of decor or opulence and not generally distinguished by such characteristics as roof
line, number of doors, seats, or windows, except for light duty trucks. That section also provides that light duty
trucks are considered to be different carlines than passenger cars. 

NHTSA addressed a number of issues in the NPRM concerning whether the meaning of 

carline

 should be further clarified by regulation. One significant issue was whether 

carline

 should encompass vehicles assembled in different countries. At present, there are a number of vehicle models that
are assembled in the U.S. and/or Canada and in other countries. The agency tentatively concluded that country of final
assembly should not be considered in making carline determinations, since section 210 specifies that carline determinations
are to be made based on degree of commonality in construction. 

The agency noted that determining carlines on the basis of country of assembly appears inconsistent with this statutory
definition since 

identical

 cars, 

i.e.

, ones with total commonality in construction, could be placed in different carlines. NHTSA also noted that such a
result might result in consumer confusion. For example, if a consumer ordered a car identical to one for which he or
she had taken a test drive, the consumer would find it very odd if the car he or she received had a label indicating that
it was in a different carline. 

NHTSA recognized, however, that additional subdivision of carlines by country of manufacture would result in content
labeling information that is more representative of the individually labeled vehicles. The agency requested comments
on a possible requirement for manufacturers to include additional information on the label for carlines assembled
in more than one country, such as a statement of the U.S./Canadian parts content and major foreign sources of that portion
of the carline produced in a given country. 

NHTSA also requested comments on the possibility of differentiating carlines by engine type, whether light trucks
should be separated into different carlines depending on whether they are 2-wheel drive or 4-wheel drive, and on whether
any other distinctions should be specified for making carline determinations. 

NHTSA received numerous comments concerning the definition of carline. In the discussion which follows, the agency
will first address comments concerning the issue of whether ``carline'' should encompass vehicles assembled in
different countries, and the related issue of a possible requirement for manufacturers to include additional information
on the label for carlines assembled in more than one country. The agency will then discuss other issues related to the
definition of carline.

Carline and different countries of assembly.

 AAMA supported NHTSA's tentative conclusion that carline is not distinguished by country of final assembly. That
organization noted that the statutory definition is similar to the definition used in other Federal regulations
and is also used in industry to establish carlines. AAMA argued that to maintain consistency among Federal regulations
and to minimize the administrative burden, the definitions and interpretation of carline used for the Labeling Act
should be the same as those used for CAFE. 

AAMA also commented that it disagrees with including additional information on the label for carlines that are assembled
in more than one country. That organization argued that separate content carline calculations, one set for each assembly
country and the entire carline, would cause unnecessary burden and confuse consumers. According to AAMA, this method
would create the same or more confusion than allowing manufacturers to separate carlines based on country of assembly.
That organization also commented that vehicles produced in both the U.S. and Canada would have similar content values,
and listing information twice would cause confusion. 

While the United Auto Workers (UAW) did not submit a comment on the NPRM, it made the following argument in response
to the agency's 1992 request for comments:


 

(I)n doing the model line calculations, imported vehicles must be combined with vehicles produced in the United States.
The automakers do not have the option of splitting the two groups of vehicles. The definition of ``carline'' in the
new statute is based on the definition under the CAFE program. Since those standards do not permit foreign and domestic
versions of the same carline to be split, this should not be allowed under the vehicle content labeling statute. 




AIAM commented that failing to allow manufacturers to distinguish between countries of production within a particular
carline directly contradicts the Act's stated purpose of providing consumers with the best and most understandable
information possible. That organization stated that it believes that NHTSA has the authority to adopt a country-of-production
split for determining the parts content percentages for carlines, in order to follow this stated intent of the Act.
According to AIAM, without carline subdivision, the information presented to the consumer will be at best misleading,
and at worst totally inaccurate. 

JAMA urged that separate calculations for carlines manufactured in more than one country at least be permitted. That
organization stated that the failure to specify such percentages separately would result in an overstated domestic
content on imported vehicles and an understated one on domestically produced vehicles. According to JAMA, the U.S.
consumer cannot possibly be served by such misleading information. 

Toyota stated that it believes the agency's tentative conclusion that country of assembly should not be considered
in making carline determinations is incorrect as a matter of statutory construction and Congressional intent. It
argued that the statute does not compel NHTSA to require averaging of equipment content information on a worldwide
basis for a particular carline. 

Toyota stated that since section 210(b)(1)(A) requires disclosure of the percentage of U.S./Canadian-origin equipment
``installed on 

such

 vehicle 

within

 a carline,'' the Labeling Act contemplates that the percentage disclosed will have a relationship to both the individual
vehicle and the carline to which it belongs. (Emphasis in Toyota's comment.) That company recognized that section
210(b)(2) requires the calculation of the percentage to made ``for such carline,'' but argued that it is incorrect
to read section 210(b)(2) out of context and ``in disregard of the requirement imposed by the literal language of section
210(b)(1)(A).'' Toyota argued that a model carline percentage that fails to approximate the level of content on the
particular vehicle would not satisfy this requirement. 

Toyota also argued that the lack of a reference in the statutory definition of 

carline

 to the country or countries where a carline is assembled indicates that the agency may exercise a level of discretion
in determining how the (b)(1)(A) calculation is to be performed with respect to carlines manufactured in multiple
countries. That company stated that NHTSA's exercise of that discretion should be guided by section 210(d)'s requirement
that the ultimate purchaser should be provided ``the best and most understandable information possible.'' Toyota
argued that consumers reading the label will expect the equipment content percentages disclosed on the label to apply
to a class of vehicles of which the particular vehicle being observed is representative. That company argued that
any such disclosure that attempts to average, for example, vehicles manufactured in the United States or Canada with
vehicles manufactured in Japan cannot possibly provide the consumer with meaningful information because of dissimilarity
with respect to the sourcing of equipment. 

Toyota also argued that it believes the treatment of carline under CAFE regulations is irrelevant to the issue of whether
Labeling Act equipment content reporting must be averaged for a carline produced in more than one country. That company
argued that the two statutes have completely different purposes. Toyota stated that it may be appropriate under CAFE
to average fuel economy data, because fuel economy of a carline is determined by vehicle design, an element that vehicles
in a carline have in common regardless of where they are produced. That commenter stated that the opposite is the case
for sourcing patterns, which typically differ greatly by country of manufacture. 

Honda argued that the agency's tentative decision to combine ``dual nationality'' nameplates into a single carline
is fundamentally inconsistent with the stated goal of the sponsor of the legislation_providing consumers sufficient
information to ``buy American'' if they so choose. That company argued that, under the agency's proposal, the domestic
content of the equipment on U.S./Canadian built ``dual nationality'' vehicles will be understated, while the domestic
content of the equipment on their foreign-built twins will be overstated. 

Honda stated that there is no reason to read the law to require such a result that it believes would frustrate the fundamental
purpose of the Labeling Act. It noted the agency's stated concern that determining carlines based on country of origin
would permit identical cars to be placed in different carlines, and argued that this result will occur under the agency's
proposal. That company cited the Ford Taurus and Mercury Sable as an example. Honda also cited NHTSA's stated concern
that consumers might be confused if they took delivery of a vehicle with a label indicating a different ``carline''
than the vehicle they test drove. That company stated that this potential for confusion is not greater than that which
might arise if the delivered vehicle shows a different final assembly point or country of origin of the engine or transmission
than those on the label of the test driven model.

BMW also disagreed with the agency's tentative conclusion that country of assembly should not be considered in making
carline determinations. First, that company argued that the Labeling Act does not prohibit division of vehicles
by country. That company stated that given the fact that Congress defined 

carline

 as a ``name,'' which is generally assigned by a manufacturer, it believes Congress intended carlines to be established
by manufacturers. BMW stated that it believes Congress was attempting to alleviate the burden on manufacturers by
giving them the maximum flexibility to group vehicles together, while not allowing completely unrelated vehicles
to be incorporated into one set of parts content calculations. 

BMW argued that Congress placed the restriction of having ``commonality in construction'' to define the largest
grouping by which a manufacturer is allowed to divide its vehicles. According to that company, this portion of the
definition was not intended to force manufacturers to group vehicles together but rather to limit the vehicles that
could be forced together into a carline. BMW stated that if the Congress had intended to force such a grouping on manufacturers,
it would have explicitly defined 

carline

 as a ``name denoting a group that shall include 

all

 vehicles which have a degree of commonality in construction.'' (Emphasis in BMW's comment.) 

Second, BMW argued that information based on a vehicle's country of origin would be the most accurate and understandable
to the consumer. That company noted the agency's statement in the NPRM that consumers might be confused if identical
vehicles are considered to be in different carlines. BMW argued that this should not be a concern because such differences
would provide better and more accurate information. 

Finally, BMW argued that NHTSA's tentative conclusion directly conflicts with the portion of section 210 that requires
the best and most understandable information. That company argued that the latter requirement should take precedence.
BMW recommended that, rather than debating such issues as the Congressional intent of the carline definition, the
agency should use the definition as worded in the legislation and permit manufacturers to make independent interpretations
to achieve this goal. 

While numerous foreign vehicle manufacturers, including ones in addition to those mentioned above, objected to
the agency's proposal to exclude country of assembly as a factor to consider in making carline determinations, several
indicated that, if NHTSA did not change that position, they supported the concept of providing additional information
on the label concerning such vehicles. Toyota stated that requiring this additional information (or alternatively,
allowing a manufacturer to include it on the label on its own option) is preferable to requiring (or permitting) only
disclosure of an average percentage for a carline on a worldwide basis. 

Honda stated that such additional information would improve the accuracy of the information provided to the consumer.
It suggested the following language: 




This carline is produced in both the United States [or Canada, as appropriate] and [add name of other country]. The
U.S./Canadian parts content for vehicles manufactured in the location noted in line three of this label is [

XX

]%.

 


Nissan stated that if manufacturers are not permitted to separate parts content percentage calculation by production
country origin, then each manufacturer should be permitted the option to determine the most appropriate method to
provide additional information or explanation of a label's parts content percentages to a potential vehicle purchaser.
That company argued that NHTSA should not prohibit the manufacturer from providing additional explanations or require
the manufacturer to include generic wording to clarify the U.S./Canadian parts content percentage calculation
to consumers. 

After carefully considering all of the comments, NHTSA has decided that carline determinations may not be based on
country of assembly, but manufacturers should be permitted to provide specified additional information for carlines
assembled in both the U.S./Canada and another country. In reaching this decision, the agency has focused both on the
Labeling Act's provisions related to ``carline'' and on section 210(d)'s requirement that regulations ``provide
to the ultimate purchaser the best and most understandable information possible about the foreign and U.S./Canada
origin of the equipment of such vehicles without imposing costly and unnecessary burdens on the manufacturers.''


In enacting the Labeling Act, Congress decided that the parts content percentages for the U.S./Canada and foreign
countries should be calculated for groups of vehicles rather than for each individual vehicle. It also decided to
adopt the concept of ``carline'' and its definition from the CAFE program, as the basis for determining the relevant
groups of vehicles.

Section 210 expressly states that carline determinations are to be made based on degree of commonality in construction.
Basing carline determinations on country of assembly would be a very different method for making carline determinations,
and one that is inconsistent with the method specified in the statute. 

Moreover, NHTSA disagrees with those commenters which argued that carline determinations which exclude considerations
of country of assembly are inconsistent with the purpose of the Labeling Act. First, the concept of ``carline'' is
well understood by Congress, given its use in the CAFE program. Since Congress decided to use this well-known concept
as the basis for making vehicle groupings under the Labeling Act, it is reasonable to assume that the concept is consistent
with the purpose of Congress. The agency observes that while many foreign vehicle manufacturers argued that basing
carline determinations solely on commonality of construction is inconsistent with the purpose of Congress, this
view was not shared by GM, Ford, Chrysler, or the UAW. 

The agency specifically rejects Toyota's argument that the treatment of carline under CAFE is irrelevant to Labeling
Act issues. Since Congress decided to adopt the same concept and definition for grouping vehicles as used in CAFE,
the treatment under CAFE is highly relevant. The agency notes that Toyota's objection and the objections of many of
the foreign vehicle manufacturers are ultimately with the statute rather than the agency's proposed regulations.
Toyota suggests that ``(i)t may be appropriate under CAFE to average fuel economy data, because fuel economy of a carline
is determined by vehicle design,'' but argues that ``(t)he opposite is the case for sourcing patterns, which typically
differ greatly by country of manufacture.'' However, the Labeling Act expressly requires carline determinations
to be determined based on ``commonality of construction,'' i.e., vehicle design. 

Second, the mere fact that the exclusion of country of assembly from carline determinations can result in overstated
domestic content on imported vehicles and an understated one on domestically produced vehicles does not mean that
the results are misleading. Any approach in which U.S./Canadian parts content is determined based on groups of vehicles
will result in situations where the content is overstated or understated for individual vehicles within the group.
However, prospective purchasers will know the U.S./Canadian parts content for the group as a whole. 

For example, if a particular make/model is assembled in both the U.S./Canada and another country, consumers will
know the average U.S./Canadian content for that make/model. The agency believes that this is relevant information
for consumers which wish to buy a vehicle made in the U.S. or Canada. Moreover, the carline information is not the only
information that Congress decided to require on the label. Consumers will also know where the individual vehicle
is assembled, and the countries of origin of the engine and transmission for that individual vehicle. 

NHTSA disagrees with several of the statutory arguments made by commenters favoring determination of carlines based
on country of assembly. As discussed above, Toyota argued that section 210(b)(1)(A)'s requirement that the label
indicate the percentage U.S./Canadian equipment ``installed on such vehicle within a carline'' amounts to a requirement
that the carline percentage must ``approximate the level of content'' on each individual vehicle. However, the quoted
language of section 210(b)(1)(A) simply means that the percentage to be provided on the label is for the carline of
which the individual vehicle is a part, as is made clear by section 210(b). There is no basis to read section 210(b)(1)(A)
as requiring the percentage to apply to 

both

 the individual vehicle and the carline. If content is determined for a group of vehicles, it necessarily follows that
the content of each individual vehicle may vary from that of the group as a whole. 

The agency also disagrees with BMW's argument that the statutory definition of carline is merely intended to define
the largest grouping by which a manufacturer is permitted to divide its vehicles but not preclude further divisions
in making carline determinations. NHTSA notes that in addition to specifying ``commonality in construction'' as
the basis for making carline determinations, the section 210 definition provides that even some attributes that
are part of ``commonality in construction,'' e.g., level of decor, are not to be considered in making carline determinations.
Moreover, manufacturers are not permitted to make unlimited divisions for purposes of CAFE. 

NHTSA also disagrees with BMW's suggestion that the agency should essentially permit manufacturers to interpret
the term ``carline'' in any way they choose. In addition to being concerned that the implementing regulations ensure
results that are consistent with the statutory requirements, NHTSA also believes it is important that consumers
be provided with information that is consistent among manufacturers. It would be very confusing to consumers if they
were provided with content information determined on a carline basis by each manufacturer, but the meaning of ``carline''
varied substantially among manufacturers. 

While NHTSA has concluded, for the reasons stated above, that carline determinations may not be based on country of
assembly, it recognizes that additional subdivision of carlines by country of manufacture would result in content
labeling information that is more representative of the individually labeled vehicles. NHTSA does not believe it
would be appropriate to permit unlimited additional information to be provided on the label, since such additional
information could result in an ``overload'' to consumers and dilute the impact of the required information. However,
given the potential significance of the impact that assembly of a carline in both the U.S./Canada and other countries
may have on the representativeness of the carline information provided on the label, NHTSA has decided to 

permit,

 but not require, the following additional statement to be provided on the label: 




This carline is assembled in the U.S. and/or Canada, and in [insert name of each other country]. The U.S./Canadian
parts content for the portion of the carline assembled in [insert name of country, treating the U.S. and Canada together,
i.e., U.S./Canada] is [

XX

]%.


 

The agency is specifying specific language for the optional information to ensure that it is both brief and easily
understood, as well as to maintain consistency among manufacturers. If a manufacturer chooses to provide this optional
information, the information must be provided at the end of the label, as part of the explanatory note. Moreover, if
the additional information is provided for some vehicles within a carline, it must be provided for all vehicles within
the carline. Otherwise, a manufacturer might provide the additional information only for the portion of the carline
which has higher U.S./Canadian parts content. 

NHTSA believes that permitting but not requiring manufacturers to provide this additional information is appropriate
in light of the statutory requirement that the implementing regulation ``provide to the ultimate purchaser the best
and most understandable information possible about the foreign and U.S./Canada origin of the equipment of such vehicles
without imposing costly and unnecessary burdens on the manufacturers.'' The agency believes that the usefulness
of the additional information to consumers is not of a level that justifies requiring it, but is sufficiently useful
that manufacturers should be permitted to provide it if they so choose.

Other issues related to the definition of ``Carline.''

 NHTSA received a number of comments concerning whether engine types, body styles, and/or drive systems should be
considered in making carline determinations. The agency notes that these factors, unlike country of assembly, are
related to degree of commonality in construction. 

As discussed above, AAMA argued that to maintain consistency among Federal regulations and to minimize the administrative
burden, the definitions and interpretation of ``carline'' used for the Labeling Act should be the same as those used
for CAFE. That organization stated that there should be no further segregation of carlines by engine type, and that
light trucks should not be divided by type of driveline. According to AAMA, these separations would not provide more
meaningful information to the consumer. That commenter stated that items such as 4-wheel drive and engine types are
customer options and should not be used to differentiate carlines. AAMA noted that differences in engine sourcing
will be reflected on the label under country of origin of the engine. AAMA stated that it supports the agency's proposal
not to subdivide the carline definition for sedans and station wagons or fuel economy model types. It argued that adding
more characteristics to define carline would increase the compliance costs to the vehicle manufacturer, would not
add any value to the label, and would confuse the customer. It stated that the proposed definition should be revised
by deleting a sentence stating that 2-wheel and 4-wheel drive versions of light trucks are treated as separate carlines,
and by replacing a reference to ``utility vehicles'' with the term ``special purpose vehicles.'' 

Toyota argued that manufacturers should have the option of separating carlines by engines and by drive systems. That
manufacturer stated that such separations would further the Act's purpose of providing the consumer information
on equipment content, by giving consumers more precise content information for the particular model being considered
for purchase. Toyota stated that because this would create an additional burden, it should be at the option of the manufacturer.


Honda stated that it supports differentiating carlines by engine type, because such separation would improve the
accuracy of the information on the label. That company stated that sourcing of parts may be different for different
engine types. Honda indicated that it strongly supports retaining station wagons within the carline of the same name,
consistent with EPA's inclusion of station wagons within the carline of the same name for purposes of computing the
carline's domestic content for CAFE. 

BMW stated that with respect to differentiating carline by engine type and drive type, it believes the relevant portion
of the carline definition is for the purpose of providing relief to manufacturers rather than imposing a requirement
on them. It stated that it believes that using the definition verbatim from the legislation and allowing manufacturers
discretion to decide which models to include in the carline calculations, in conjunction with clarification from
the manufacturer of the models that were used in the calculations, would result in the best and most accurate information
to potential consumers. 

Nissan stated that it believes carlines should not be separated by engine types, body styles or drive systems. According
to that manufacturer, it would take a major change in the foreign content of those parts to result in a significant change
in carline content percentages. Nissan stated that additional calculation and the resulting record keeping requirements
by engine types, body styles, and drive systems would impose a significant administrative burden on manufacturers,
and would not result in an appreciable increase in the accuracy of the content information on the label. 

After considering the comments, NHTSA has concluded that engine types and drive systems should not be considered
in making carline determinations. These features are typically customer options for particular make/models, similar
to options related to level of decor. The agency believes that these features are too insignificant to be considered
in making carline determinations, i.e., if vehicles are essentially the same except for the fact that one has a larger
engine or 4-wheel drive, there is sufficient commonality of construction that the vehicles should be in the same carline.
NHTSA does not believe that a manufacturer option should be provided in this area, because it could confuse consumers
if ``carline'' has a different meaning for different vehicles. Moreover, the agency believes that separation by
engine type and drive system would be unlikely to have a significant impact on the content percentages provided on
the label. 

The agency also generally agrees with AAMA that, to maintain consistency among Federal regulations and to minimize
the administrative burden, the definitions and interpretation of ``carline'' used for the Labeling Act should be
the same as those used for CAFE. NHTSA notes that station wagons are included in the same carline as similar sedans,
as in CAFE. This follows from section 210's language that carline is not generally distinguished by such characteristics
as roof line, except for light duty trucks. Consistent with CAFE, special purpose vehicles, vans and pickup trucks
are considered to be in different carlines. 



b. Final assembly/final assembly point.

 Section 210 provides that costs incurred at the final assembly point and beyond, including the costs of assembly and
labor, are not included in the calculation of parts content. NHTSA noted in the NPRM that manufacturers may conduct
some pre-assembly operations, e.g., production of equipment, at the same location as final assembly. The agency
tentatively concluded that such operations should be treated the same as the operations of an allied supplier. The
agency proposed to specify a particular phase in the assembly process, for both the body and chassis, that would mark
the beginning of final assembly. This was reflected in specific proposed definitions for ``final assembly'' and
``final assembly point.'' 

AAMA stated that under NHTSA's proposal, the painted body and chassis would be considered a substrate to which passenger
motor vehicle equipment is attached to produce a finished vehicle. AAMA stated that this approach is contrary to the
generally accepted definition of the passenger motor vehicle equipment assembly process. That organization agreed,
however, that the production of certain equipment at the final assembly point should not be considered part of final
assembly but should instead be included in the valuation of the motor vehicle equipment and content calculations.

AAMA recommended that the agency define ``final assembly'' to include all operations involved in the assembly of
the vehicle performed at the final assembly point, including but not limited to assembly of body panels, painting,
final chassis assembly, and trim installation, except engine and transmission fabrication and assembly and the
fabrication of motor vehicle equipment components produced at the same final assembly point using stamping, machining
or molding processes. AAMA stated that its definition is consistent with the statute and an improvement over the proposal
in that it (1) eliminates the conflict between regulations and normal business practice, (2) eliminates the ability
of a manufacturer to generate a considerable amount of U.S./Canadian value added for the assembly operation that
the proposed regulations would allow prior to the ``final assembly,'' (3) eliminates ability of a manufacturer to
shift value added simply by establishing ``transfer'' prices for all of the passenger motor vehicle equipment that
is produced prior to ``final assembly,'' and (4) eliminates the burden on a manufacturer associated with changing
systems simply to meet NHTSA's proposed definition. 

AAMA also recommended that the agency change the proposed definition of 

final assembly point,

 in a manner consistent with its recommendation concerning the definition of 

final assembly.

 That commenter also stated that the proposed definition creates ambiguity by introducing the term ``pre-final assembly,''
and that the proposed regulation does not state how this equipment is to be treated for determining origin. AAMA recommended
a specific definition for ``final assembly point.'' 

Ford stated that it agrees that in-plant pre-assembly and manufacturing should be included in the domestic and foreign
content of the vehicle and the value treated as operations of an allied supplier. It argued, however, that the proposed
definition of ``final assembly'' goes beyond the point that most manufacturers track parts cost. Ford stated that
operations performed at the final assembly point, including body assembly and painting, are usually not contained
in the manufacturer's final assembly bill of material. Ford argued that in-plant pre-assembly should include only
machining, stamping, molding operations, and engine or transmission assembly. 

AIAM stated that the point of final assembly should be considered to be no sooner than the point at which the engine and
vehicle body are fastened together. That organization argued that the Labeling Act defines final assembly as the
time when ``all component parts necessary to the mechanical operation of such automobile are included.'' AIAM stated
that the proposed definition would defy the stated intent of the Act and defy all conventional wisdom with respect
to the automotive manufacturing process. 

Toyota also argued that the point of final assembly should be considered to be no sooner than the point at which the engine
and vehicle body are fastened together. It stated that for any vehicle, regardless of the sequence of assembly operations,
there is always a point where the engine is united with the body. According to Toyota, section 210(f)(14) defines 

point of final assembly

 in terms of completeness. That commenter argued that the proposed final assembly points for the body and chassis are
inconsistent with the Act because all component parts necessary to the mechanical operation of the vehicle are not
yet present and included with the vehicle at those points. 

Toyota also stated that the point of final assembly must serve as the point before which assembly labor is included
in the calculation and after which it is not. That manufacturer stated that the proposed regulation is not clear with
respect to whether labor used in manufacturing the body after the point at which it emerges from painting but before
it is attached to the chassis or cradle is included or excluded. Toyota stated that only by specifying a single point
of final assembly can this technical problem be solved. 

Several other foreign vehicle manufacturers made similar comments. Nissan stated that an appropriate point to be
identified as the beginning of final assembly is the moment in the production process just before the attachment of
the engine and drive train to the chassis. Mitsubishi stated that the point where final assembly begins should be defined
as the point at which the engine and body are fastened. According to that company, this would be more consistent with
the agency's proposed definition of ``final assembly point,'' where all components and parts necessary to the mechanical
operation of such automobile are included. 

Honda took a different position in its comment. That manufacturer stated that it strongly supports the agency's proposal
to treat in-house production of parts and components as if the equipment were produced by an allied supplier. Honda
stated that this is necessary for consistency among manufacturers. Noting that the agency proposed to define 

final assembly point

 as a particular phase in the assembly process, Honda stated that the proposed treatment of this issue is sensible.
According to that manufacturer, defining ``final assembly point'' as the moment in the process at which the body leaves
the paint shop is generally appropriate. However, Honda requested clarification of this definition with respect
to the substantial additional ``pre-final assembly'' work that remains to be performed on its vehicles' doors after
the body leaves the paint shop. Honda argued that door subassembly labor should be included within computation of
U.S./Canadian value added, and stated that it assumes this subassembly labor would be included under the proposed
regulation because the work is performed off the main assembly line. 

BMW stated that NHTSA's proposal defined ``final assembly'' with regard to the body as the point at which the body leaves
the paint shop. That company commented that this portion of the definition is very precise and that the costs associated
with it will likely be similar between manufacturers regardless of painting process or vehicle design. BMW commented,
however, with regard to definition of final assembly of the chassis, that it believes a manufacturer would be able
to tailor the assembly process to take advantage of the definition and alter its carline's part content percentages.
That company stated that this portion of the definition employs the point at which the engine and transmission are
placed on the chassis frame or on the assembly cradle. According to BMW, because this point can be varied, a manufacturer
would have the opportunity to install or not install equipment such as the brake system including ABS, wheels and tires,
and interior components and trim. BMW commented that a manufacturer could choose to install the engine last, essentially
including all labor and overhead in its parts content calculations. BMW recommended that the agency investigate
assembly processes and include a more definitive point to stop including costs associated with the chassis assembly.


NHTSA believes that the comments concerning the proposed definitions for ``final assembly'' and ``final assembly
point'' raise two important, related issues: (1) What operations should be considered to be part of ``final assembly''
and therefore excluded from parts content calculations, and (2) Whether the proposed regulation distinguishes
such operations in a manner that is appropriate for all manufacturers. As discussed below, after considering the
comments in light of these two issues, the agency has concluded that definitions along the lines of those recommended
by AAMA should be adopted.

The starting place for resolving the question of what operations should be considered to be part of ``final assembly''
and therefore excluded from parts content calculations is the language of the Labeling Act. The Act includes several
relevant sections. First, section 210(b)(1)(A) provides that the label must indicate ``the percentage (by value)
of passenger motor vehicle equipment installed in such vehicle within a carline which originated in the United States
and Canada * * *.'' Second, section 210(f)(10) provides that ``(c)osts incurred or profits made 

at the final vehicle assembly point

 and beyond (i.e., advertising, assembly, labor, interest payments, profits, etc.) shall not be included in [the
calculation of value added in the United States and Canada].'' Third, section 210(f)(14) defines ``final assembly
point'' as ``the plant, factory, or other 

place 

at which a new passenger motor vehicle is produced or assembled by a manufacturer and 

from

 which such vehicle is delivered to a dealer or importer in such a condition that all component parts necessary to the
mechanical operation of such automobile are included with such vehicle * * *.'' (Emphasis added.).


While final assembly point can be considered as either a physical place or a phase in the assembly process, it is significant
that section 210 defines it as a place, i.e., the plant, factory, or other place at which a new vehicle is produced or
assembled. Thus, looking at the plain language of section 210, assembly and labor costs ``at'' the plant, factory
or other place at which a new vehicle is assembled are excluded from parts content calculations. 

It is also significant that the language in section 210(f)(14) about the vehicle being in such a condition that ``all
component parts necessary to the mechanical operation of such automobile are included with such vehicle'' refers
to the vehicle when it leaves the final assembly point for delivery to a dealer or importer. In citing this language
for the proposition that ``final assembly'' is defined in terms of completeness, AIAM and Toyota confuse the completion
of final assembly with the final assembly process. Section 210(f)(14) defines ``final assembly point'' as the plant,
factory, or other place at which a vehicle is ``produced or assembled'' by a manufacturer. All of the operations that
make up the production or assembly process are part of final assembly. There is no basis to interpret section 210(f)(10)'s
requirement that assembly and labor costs incurred ``at the plant, factory or other place'' at which a new vehicle
is assembled only applies to the costs associated with the last step in completing the vehicle. 


Since section 210 expressly provides that assembly and labor costs at the plant, factory or other place at which a new
vehicle is assembled are excluded from parts content calculations, NHTSA believes that all assembly and labor costs
that are ordinarily associated with final assembly must be excluded. However, the agency believes that the costs
associated with parts production that may occur at a final assembly plant should not be excluded from parts content
calculations. The agency notes the following argument made by the UAW in commenting on the request for comments: 




The definition of 

passenger motor vehicle equipment

 in section 210(f)(4) of the statute refers to components ``received at the final vehicle assembly point.'' Section
210(f)(14) then goes on to define ``final assembly point'' as meaning ``the plant, factory, 

or other place

 at which a new passenger motor vehicle is produced or assembled * * *.'' (Emphasis in UAW comment.)
We believe these definitions can and should be interpreted liberally to include parts and components which are built
``in-house'' within the scope of ``passenger motor vehicle equipment.'' Even though such parts and components may
be built in the same manufacturing facility, they are still built in a different ``place'' than where the vehicles
are actually assembled (i.e., in a different department or operation within the plant) * * *.
(T)he underlying purpose of the statute is to distinguish between labor performed in the final assembly of a vehicle
and the value of the parts which go into the vehicle. Including ``in-house'' parts does not do violence to this distinction.


 

NHTSA agrees with this comment of the UAW. A failure to consider parts produced at the final assembly plant as ``passenger
motor vehicle equipment'' would result in significant differences among manufacturers. Further, if a plant were
very highly integrated, it could result in a situation where the parts content percentages do not reflect the greater
number of a vehicle's parts. 

At the same time, however, NHTSA must give full effect to the Congressional intent to exclude the costs of final assembly
from parts content calculations. The agency believes that the best way to accomplish this is the method suggested
by AAMA: define 

final assembly

 to include all operations involved in the assembly of the vehicle performed at the final assembly point (the final
assembly plant), including but not limited to assembly of body panels, painting, final chassis assembly, and trim
installation, except engine and transmission fabrication and assembly and the fabrication of motor vehicle equipment
components produced at the same final assembly point using stamping, machining or molding processes. 

Under this approach, all costs incurred at the final assembly plant are excluded except for those that are incurred
in producing either engines/transmissions or in producing parts using forming processes such as stamping, machining
or molding. In addition to ensuring that final assembly costs are excluded as required by section 210, the agency also
believes that a definition along these lines is much clearer than the proposed definition. For example, this type
of definition will not raise issues concerning whether a part is assembled on the main assembly line or off of it. 

NHTSA cannot accept the recommendation of foreign vehicle manufacturers to define final assembly as starting at
the time when the engine and body are fastened together. Under such a definition, manufacturers could add the engine
to the body as the last step in assembling the vehicle, thereby reducing final assembly costs to a nullity. Such an approach
would be inconsistent with the statutory requirement to exclude assembly and labor costs at the final assembly plant
from parts content calculations.

The agency believes that a similar problem could occur under the proposed definitions for 

final assembly

 and 

final assembly point.

 As suggested by BMW's comment, manufacturers could tailor the assembly process to take advantage of the definition.
This could also reduce the costs of final assembly to a value close to a nullity. 
NHTSA notes that the cost of painting the vehicle body is considered to be part of the cost of final assembly under the
definitions being adopted for the final rule, assuming that it occurs at the final assembly plant. While this is a different
result than under the proposed definitions, the agency believes it is appropriate since painting is an operation
that occurs at essentially all final assembly plants. 
The agency also notes that the fact that final assembly labor and other costs are not included in parts content percentages
does not mean that they are not reflected on the label. The origin of these costs is reflected in the portion of the label
which states the final assembly point by city, state and country. 


c. Passenger motor vehicle equipment.

 Section 210(f)(4) provides that the term 

passenger motor vehicle equipment

 means ``any system, subassembly, or component received at the final vehicle assembly point for installation on,
or attachment to, such vehicle at the time of its initial shipment by the manufacturer to a dealer for sale to an ultimate
purchaser.'' That section also provides that the term does not include ``minor parts, such as attachment hardware
(nuts, bolts, clips, screws, pins, braces, etc.) and such other similar items'' as may be prescribed by rule. 


Dealer- and port-installed equipment.

 NHTSA tentatively concluded in the NPRM that dealer- or port-installed optional equipment should be excluded from
content calculations. The agency noted that the definition of 

passenger motor vehicle equipment

 in section 210(f)(4) is limited to equipment delivered to the manufacturer's final assembly point for installation
on, or attachment to, a vehicle at the time of its initial shipment by the manufacturer to a dealer. NHTSA noted further
that equipment sent directly to dealers or ports is never sent to the manufacturer's final assembly point. 
Ford stated that it agrees that dealer- and port-installed items of equipment should be excluded from content calculations
since they do not come within the statutory definition of passenger motor vehicle equipment. That company added,
however, that the agency should reserve the option to address this issue if it appears that any manufacturer is, to
a significant degree, installing options beyond the final assembly point. 
AIADA stated that it strongly supports the tentative conclusion that dealer- or port-installed optional equipment
should be excluded from content calculations. That organization stated, however, that the definition of 

passenger motor vehicle equipment

 should be clarified. AIADA argued that while the authors of the Labeling Act may have attempted to exclude port-installed
and dealer-installed parts such as air conditioners, wheels and stereo systems, the words ``for installation on,
or attachment to, such vehicle at the time of its initial shipment by the manufacturer to a dealer'' may not be interpreted
to exclude these parts. AIADA suggested adding the words ``and installed on'' to the definition, i.e., components
received at final assembly point for installation on, or attachment to, 

and installed on

 such vehicle. 
After considering the comments, NHTSA continues to believe that dealer- or port-installed optional equipment should
generally be excluded from content calculations since such equipment is ordinarily not received at the final assembly
point. However, the agency does not agree with AIADA's suggested clarification. That organization appears to be
referring to equipment which is received at the final assembly point and travels with the vehicle to the dealer, where
the final installation is made. NHTSA believes that such equipment does fall within the definition of 

motor vehicle equipment,

 i.e., it is received at the final vehicle assembly point for installation on, or attachment to, such vehicle at the
time of its initial shipment by the manufacturer to a dealer for sale to an ultimate purchaser. The agency views the
fact that the equipment travels with the vehicle as a form of attachment to the vehicle.


Exclusion of minor parts.

 The agency tentatively concluded in the NPRM that all parts received at the final assembly point, including paint,
sealers and solvents, are to be included as ``equipment'' for purposes of the Labeling Act, with the exception of the
minor parts specified in the statute. However, NHTSA encouraged commenters to suggest other specific minor parts
that should be excluded, and to comment on whether paint, sealers and solvents should be included as equipment. 
AAMA argued that the exclusions should be broadened. That organization stated that it would prefer the agency to exclude
all items not covered under NAFTA Annex 403.1. AAMA stated that since the agency had elected not to parallel that aspect
of NAFTA, it recommended the following additional exclusions: lubricants, grease, gasoline, oil, blackout, phosphate
rinse, sealers, windshield washer fluid, auto transmission fluid, anti-freeze, tape, straps, hinge covers, valve
stems, labels, owners manuals, hinges, bulbs, power steering fluid, knobs, bushings, fasteners, decals, isolators,
tire assembly fluid, spacers, clamps, rivets, retainers, deadeners, adhesives, links, springs (except springs
for suspension systems), grommets, wheel weights, fuses, plugs, paint, clear coat, and primer.

AAMA stated that the listed components represent less than three percent of material value, but 30-35 percent
of the number of part numbers in a passenger motor vehicle. That organization argued that the recommended list would
exclude a minimal value from the definition of passenger motor vehicle equipment, while significantly reducing
the number of parts and suppliers that have to be solicited for content information. AAMA also recommended that outside
and allied suppliers be permitted to default the values of these components to the country of origin of the passenger
motor vehicle equipment in which they are incorporated. 
Ford stated that items such as paints, sealers and solvents should not be included in the definition of passenger motor
vehicle equipment. That company stated that both bulk parts and raw materials should be excluded from the vehicle
content calculations. 
Ford noted that the Labeling Act defines 

passenger motor vehicle equipment

 as ``a system, sub-assembly or component'' received at the final vehicle assembly point for installation on, or attachment
to, the vehicle. Ford argued that if Congress had intended to add bulk items or items such as paint and solvents or bulk
parts, such as wheel weights and rivets, to the calculation, it would not have used the terms ``system, sub-assembly
or component.'' That company stated that in other sections of the Act, where Congress intended raw and bulk materials
to be included, it used the terms ``foreign content'' or ``material.'' Ford stated that paint, solvents, and sealers
should not be considered systems, sub-assemblies, or components because, among other reasons, these items only
have part numbers when ordered in bulk quantities. That company supported the list of additional exclusions set forth
in AAMA's comment. 
A number of manufacturers, including Toyota, Honda, and Nissan supported treating paint, sealers and solvent as
equipment. Honda stated that it believes that NHTSA appropriately defined minor parts to be excluded from the calculation
in the NPRM. Nissan, however, stated that it is not sure whether everything other than attachment hardware can be properly
considered passenger motor vehicle equipment and suggested that NHTSA consider how other regulatory and/or legislative
schemes may determine whether a particular item is an auto part. 
Isuzu stated that it believes attachment hardware such as nuts, bolts, clips, screws, pins and braces must be included
in, rather than excluded from, the definition of ``passenger motor vehicle equipment.'' That company stated that
the vehicle manufacturer specifies part numbers for these parts. It is not easy to identify these parts on the carline
parts list and then separate them from other parts. 
BMW stated that it supports including items that become a permanent part of the vehicle such as adhesives, sealers,
and paint. However, that manufacturer recommended that consumable items such as windshield washer and gasoline
not be included. 
APMA stated that it supports the exclusion of paint, sealers and solvents on the grounds that they are almost invariably
of local origin, and their exclusion will reduce the regulatory burden to manufacturers and paint suppliers. 
The UAW stated in its comment on the request for comments that, to avoid undermining the intent of the Labeling Act,
the exclusion for minor parts should be narrowly construed. The UAW stated that it does not believe the definition
should be interpreted to exclude paint or sealer, or raw materials, fasteners, or general purpose hardware. The UAW
stated that many of these items have substantial value, and that excluding them would only serve to provide consumers
with a misleading impression of the domestic versus foreign content of motor vehicles. 
After considering the comments, the agency has decided to exclude some additional items from the definition of ``motor
vehicle equipment,'' but not the entire list suggested by AAMA. With respect to AAMA's comment that it would prefer
that all items not covered under NAFTA Annex 403.1 be excluded, the agency notes some major items of motor vehicle equipment
are not covered by that annex, including air bags. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to use NAFTA Annex 403.1 as
the basis for determining what additional ``minor parts'' should be excluded. NHTSA also notes that it cannot adopt
Isuzu's suggestion to include attachment hardware such as nuts, bolts, clips, screws, pins and braces within the
definition of ``passenger motor vehicle equipment,'' since those items are expressly excluded by the statutory
definition.
The agency has decided to exclude the following additional items from the definition of 

passenger motor vehicle equipment:

 phosphate rinse, tire assembly fluid, gasoline, oil, windshield washer fluid, fasteners, rivets, grommets, and
wheel weights. The first five items are consumable items which are either consumed in the assembly of the vehicle or
are replaced within the first few days or months of vehicle ownership. Therefore, the agency believes that those items
should not be considered part of the vehicle. The last four items are either forms of attachment hardware similar to
the other ones listed in the statutory definition, or types of items whose collective value for a particular motor
vehicle will always be negligible. 
The agency is not adopting the other exclusions suggested by AAMA because the items are not similar to the ones listed
in the statutory definition and because the collective value of the items for a particular motor vehicle can be substantial.
With respect to Ford's comment concerning the meaning of ``system, subassembly, or component,'' the agency believes
that the term ``component'' is sufficiently broad to include such things as paint. 
For the minor items which are excluded from the definition of 

passenger motor vehicle equipment,

 the agency is permitting allied and outside suppliers to treat the cost of the minor items as value added in the country
of assembly of the equipment. NHTSA notes that this treatment is only necessary to the extent that such minor items
are part of other equipment supplied by a supplier. To the extent that such minor items are supplied directly to a manufacturer,
or are used by a manufacturer in assembly of a vehicle, they are not considered passenger motor vehicle equipment.



2. Items To Be Provided on the Label; Wording of the Label (Section 583.5) 


NHTSA proposed to require manufacturers to affix to all new passenger motor vehicles a label which provides the following
five items of information: 
(1) 

U.S./Canadian Parts Content

_the overall percentage, by value, U.S./Canadian content of the motor vehicle equipment installed on the carline
of which the vehicle is a part; 
(2) 

Major Sources of Foreign Parts Content

_the names of the two countries, if any, other than the U.S./Canada, which contributed the greatest amount (at least
15 percent), by value, of motor vehicle equipment for the carline, and the percentage, by value, of the equipment originating
in each such country;

<DOCNO> FR940721-0-00057 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940721-0-00014 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(3) 

Final Assembly Point

_the city, state (where appropriate), and country in which the final assembly of the vehicle occurred; 
(4) 

Country of Origin for the Engine; 
(5) Country of Origin for the Transmission. 
The agency proposed to require specific language for the label, including a heading, two subheadings, and an explanatory
note concerning the meaning of parts content. The NPRM included a sample label, consistent with the proposed requirements,
which read as follows:




PARTS CONTENT INFORMATION



For vehicles in this carline: 


U.S./Canadian Parts Content: 50% 
Major Sources of Foreign Parts Content: 
Japan: 20% 
Mexico: 15% 




For this vehicle: 


Final Assembly Point: Flint, Michigan, USA 
Country of Origin: 
Engine: U.S. 
Transmission: Canada 






Note: 

The Parts Content of a typical vehicle makes up about (a range was to be specified in a final rule) percent of the vehicle's
total wholesale cost to the dealer. 




The agency stated in the NPRM that it believed the proposed explanatory note would clarify the meaning of ``parts content''
to consumers, and help them understand the significance of the content information provided on the label. NHTSA noted
that since the percentage of a vehicle's total wholesale cost which is made up of parts content varies for different
vehicles, it believed that it would be appropriate to state the information in a range, e.g., 60 to 70 percent, 70 to
80 percent, etc. Since the agency did not have this information, it requested manufacturers to provide the information
for several specific vehicles, as well as their recommendation for a range to include in a final rule. 


a. Use of the term ``parts content.'' 

AAMA objected to the term ``U.S./Canadian Parts Content'' for describing the first item of information on the label.
It argued that the statute specifies use of the term ``U.S./Canadian Content,'' and that the inclusion of the word
``parts'' is contrary to the statute. 

NHTSA acknowledges that section 210(b)(1)(A) specifies that the information ``be identified with the words `U.S./Canadian
content.''' However, the agency believes the term U.S./Canadian Parts Content is consistent with this statutory
requirement. The statutory language ``U.S./Canadian content'' is included within the term ``U.S./Canadian Parts
Content.'' Consistent with its authority to specify the form and content of the required label, the agency added the
word ``parts'' to indicate to prospective purchasers that the identified U.S./Canadian content is for a vehicle's
parts (within a carline) rather than for the vehicle as a whole. To the extent that AAMA objects to the agency breaking
up the phrase ``U.S./Canadian content,'' NHTSA could instead specify a parenthetical at the end of the term U.S./Canadian
content, such as (parts). However, the agency believes that the term U.S./Canadian Parts Content is preferable since
it is easier to read. 
NHTSA notes that AAMA also objected to use of the term ``parts'' instead of ``equipment'' in the purpose section of
Part 583. That objection would presumably also apply to the wording on the label. AAMA contended that the calculations
required by the statute are based on the value and content of passenger motor vehicle equipment and not ``parts.''
Since the term ``passenger motor vehicle equipment'' includes all parts except minor parts such as attachment hardware,
NHTSA believes that the terms ``equipment'' and ``parts'' are interchangeable. For purposes of the label, the agency
believes that the term ``parts'' is preferable to ``equipment.'' The former term is shorter and therefore takes less
space. Moreover, the agency believes that consumers are more likely to understand the term ``parts.'' While it is
common to refer to a vehicle being made up of parts, one does not ordinarily refer to a vehicle being made up of equipment.
Also, the term ``equipment'' may have the connotation of optional accessories to consumers. 


b. Explanatory note. 

The agency received numerous comments on its proposal to require an explanatory note concerning the meaning of parts
content. As discussed below, some commenters argued that no note should be permitted or required; others agreed that
a note should be provided but argued that it should be worded differently. No commenters supported the proposed wording.
Numerous manufacturers argued that the ratio of parts content value to wholesale dealer cost varies so widely among
vehicles that there is no such thing as a ``typical vehicle'' in this context. 
AAMA argued against including the explanatory note. It stated that the note is not required by statute and adds a measure
of confusion to the consumer because of the broad range of ratios that exist for vehicles. GM argued that there is no
authority under the Labeling Act for such a note. It stated that the proposed note does not clarify the information
on the label, is an approximation, and includes elemental costs not considered by the Act. Ford stated that if NHTSA
believes that clarification is necessary, it should consider an explanatory brochure. 
AIAM stated that it is opposed to requiring information on the label concerning a parts content percentage range as
it relates to the total wholesale cost to the dealer, as this additional information would only serve to confuse the
consumer. 
JAMA, however, argued that it is vital to consumer understanding to clarify the fact that the label calculation does
not include vehicle final assembly labor. That organization stated that the proposed note would clarify this to some
degree, but does not go far enough. It suggested adding the following words to the note: ``and does not include vehicle
final assembly labor.'' JAMA also argued that the note should include an additional statement about assembly labor
for engines and transmissions not being included in country of origin label calculations for those items. 
Toyota stated that the proposed note would not be helpful because of the necessary broadness of the range and the potential
for additional consumer confusion. That manufacturer also stated that it does not believe a required, industry-wide
explanatory statement is necessary. Toyota indicated, however, that if the agency does require an explanatory statement,
it believes the statement should be one that consumers readily would understand and that would avoid confusion. It
suggested the following statement: ``The U.S./Canada parts content on this label does not include final assembly
or distribution costs for this vehicle.'' 
Honda supported the idea of an explanatory note, since it believes that consumers are likely to be misled by the label
without it. That company did not support the proposed wording, however, since the language does not clearly tell consumers
that certain specific costs are excluded. Honda also stated that it believes the inclusion of a range of the percentage
of parts costs would be confusing to consumers. Honda suggested the following explanatory note: ``U.S./Canadian
parts content on this label does not include final assembly or distribution costs for this vehicle.''

Nissan suggested that each manufacturer be allowed, at its discretion, to include or not include additional information
or explanation relevant to that manufacturer or particular carline. It stated that introducing a new percentage
on the label that is calculated from a different base will only add to the consumer's confusion. Nissan stated that
if the agency decides to require a statement, it suggests the following language: ``The parts content percentages
identified here do not value similar parts equally nor reflect the value of final assembly labor or parts or distribution
expenses, all necessary aspects of determining the ultimate value of a vehicle.'' 
AIADA stated that it supports the proposal to include a statement on the label to indicate that parts content of a vehicle
does not represent the total value of the vehicle. That organization stated that it believes the statement should
include a mention of what is not included, specifically labor and distribution costs. That organization also argued
that the agency should go further than providing a simple note. It argued that the label should explain such things
as roll-up, roll-down for outside suppliers (roll-up, roll-down is discussed later in this preamble), and whether
or not the vehicle is domestic or import for CAFE purposes. 
After considering all of the comments, and noting that none of the commenters provided information concerning the
range of parts content as a percentage of wholesale cost, NHTSA has decided to require a brief explanatory note to explain
the meaning of parts content. Since consumers are not likely to be familiar with the concept of parts content, the agency
is concerned that they are likely to confuse parts content with overall vehicle content without such a note. 
NHTSA is persuaded by the comments, however, that the note should not provide a range for the ratio of parts content
value to wholesale dealer cost for a typical vehicle. The agency agrees that such a statement might confuse consumers.

The agency has decided to require the following explanatory note at the end of the label: ``Parts content does not include
final assembly, distribution, or other non-parts costs.'' NHTSA believes that the same note should be provided for
all vehicles, to ensure brevity and clarity. With respect to GM's comment concerning authority, the agency notes
that section 210(c) provides the agency with authority to prescribe the form and content of the required label. The
agency also notes that manufacturers choosing the option, discussed earlier in this preamble, of providing additional
information for carlines assembled in both the U.S./Canada and other countries, would be required to include it at
the end of this explanatory note. 


c. Place of final assembly. 

Toyota stated that the city of assembly should only be required for vehicles assembled in the U.S. That manufacturer
argued that vehicles assembled in other countries should be labeled only with the country, not city, of final assembly,
since the names of many cities in foreign countries in which automobiles are assembled are likely to be unfamiliar
to many if not most consumers. 
NHTSA notes that section 210(b)(1)(B) expressly states that the label must indicate ``the final assembly point by
city, State (where appropriate), and country of such automobile.'' Therefore, the agency does not have the discretion
to permit the names of foreign cities to be excluded. 


3. Procedure for Determining U.S./Canadian Parts Content (Section 583.6) 


As discussed in the NPRM, in order to calculate the percentage U.S./Canadian parts content (the first item of information
on the label), the vehicle manufacturer must know: 
(1) the U.S./Canadian content (by value) of each item of motor vehicle equipment used to assemble the vehicles within
the carline; 
(2) the total value of each such item of equipment, i.e., the price it will pay for each such item of equipment; and 
(3) the unit volume of each such item of equipment for each carline. 
The agency stated in the NPRM that, in calculating the U.S./Canadian parts content for each carline, the manufacturer
must reasonably project the installation rates for all equipment offered on that carline. For example, if a carline
with a standard manual transmission is offered with an optional automatic transmission, the manufacturer must project
the sales of each transmission in advance of the model year. This also applies to all other equipment options or choices
for the vehicle. 
Much of the information that manufacturers use to calculate the first item on the label must come from parts suppliers.
These calculations are made once for each model year, prior to the model year. As discussed later in this preamble,
the agency is requiring suppliers to provide information to manufacturers concerning the content of the parts they
supply. 
NHTSA proposed a specific procedure in  583.6 of the proposed regulation for determining U.S./Canadian parts
content. Section 583.6(b) set forth a procedure for determining the value of items of equipment. It provided that
the value of an item of equipment is generally the price paid by the manufacturer for the equipment as delivered to the
final assembly point, and that the value of an item of equipment produced at the final assembly plant is the fair market
price that a manufacturer of similar size and location would pay a supplier for such equipment. 
Section 583.6(c) set forth a procedure for determining the U.S./Canadian percentage of the value of equipment. It
set forth different procedures for outside and allied suppliers, to reflect the fact that the statutory ``roll-up,
roll-down'' provision applies to outside suppliers, but not allied suppliers. 
Section 583.6(d) set forth a procedure for determining the U.S./Canadian percentage of the total value of a carline's
passenger motor vehicle equipment. This procedure involved adding up the total value of all of the equipment to be
installed in that carline during the next model year, dividing the value of the U.S./Canadian content of such equipment
by the total value of the equipment, and multiplying the resulting number by 100. 


a. Determining the value of items of equipment. 

AAMA commented that 583.6(b) puts the valuation emphasis on where material is received as opposed to from whom it is
purchased. That organization stated that for equipment purchased from outside suppliers by either a vehicle manufacturer
or allied supplier, valuation should be based on the price that exists in the financial records at the time the content
is calculated. AAMA stated that for equipment purchased from allied suppliers, valuation should be based on the established
practices of the manufacturer, which could include a transfer cost or transfer price methodology. That organization
stated that if a transfer price is used, the price should be consistent with customs valuation or that used for internal
management. AAMA also noted that  583.6 does not address determination of value for items of equipment delivered
to allied suppliers.

<TEXT>
 

NHTSA notes that valuation is based on where material is received because section 210(f)(13) provides, with respect
to passenger motor vehicle equipment which is of U.S./Canadian origin, that ``(f)or both outside suppliers and allied
suppliers the value used shall be the purchase price of the passenger motor vehicle equipment as paid at the final assembly
point.'' The agency also notes that section 210(f)(10)(A) provides, with respect to the term ``value added in the
United States and Canada,'' that costs incurred or profits made 

at the final vehicle assembly point and beyond

 * * * shall not be considered in such calculation.'' This implies that all costs up to delivery of the
equipment to the final assembly point are included. NHTSA therefore believes, with respect to motor vehicle equipment
that is delivered to the final assembly point, that the value of the equipment should be the price paid by the manufacturer
for the equipment as delivered to the final assembly point.

The agency believes that a specification that valuation be based on the price that exists in the financial records
at the time the content is calculated would be too vague. It would be unclear, for example, whether the price in question
was for the equipment as delivered to the final assembly point. Similarly, a specification that valuation be based
on the established practices of the manufacturer would also be vague.

To the extent that it is not possible to value equipment based on the price paid by the manufacturer for the equipment
as delivered to the final assembly point, e.g., because the equipment is produced at the final assembly point or a transfer
price methodology is used, the agency believes, for purposes of consistency among manufacturers, that value should
be based on the price that the manufacturer would have paid for the equipment as delivered to the final assembly point.
The final rule therefore provides that the value of each such item of equipment is the fair market price that a manufacturer
of similar size and location would pay a supplier for such equipment. NHTSA is also setting forth essentially the same
valuation procedures for equipment delivered to an allied supplier, except that valuation is based on the price paid
for the equipment as delivered to the allied supplier.



b. Determining the U.S./Canadian percentage of the value of items of equipment.

 APMA stated that if NHTSA does not adopt the AIAG model of content calculation, the regulation should specifically
state how outside suppliers should calculate U.S./Canadian content. That organization stated that, in the NPRM,
the agency relied on the definitions of 

value added

 and 

foreign content

 in the statute. APMA stated that 

value added

 is defined as the total purchase price (presumably paid by the customer) less the total purchase price (presumably
paid by the supplier) of foreign content. APMA stated that 

foreign content

 is simply defined as equipment which is ``not determined to be U.S./Canadian origin.'' That organization stated
that the statute and regulation give no direction as to how this determination is to be made. APMA also stated that while
the agency noted that suppliers ``may need in some cases to arrange to obtain information from their supplier,'' it
did not explain what that information is and how it is to be obtained.

APMA stated that the absence of any specific regulatory direction on the way in which outside suppliers are to calculate
``valued added in the U.S./Canada'' is likely to lead to numerous interpretations and challenges. For example, can
suppliers count all costs and profit or are some costs and profits excluded? How will a supplier know with certainty
that an input qualifies as U.S./Canadian content? APMA stated that it believes that adoption of the AIAG content calculation
is the best approach and would have minimal regulatory cost burden. That organization stated that if the agency does
not follow that approach, it suggests adding the following additional definition: 




Value is added in the United States or Canada by an allied supplier or outside supplier to the extent that the supplier
produces or assembles passenger motor vehicle equipment at a plant or factory located within the territorial boundaries
of the United States or Canada.

All costs incurred (other than the purchase price of foreign material received at such plant) and all profits made
at such plant shall form part of the value added in the United States and Canada. Foreign material shall be limited to
materials which have been produced or assembled outside of the territorial boundaries of the United States or Canada
and which have not undergone any further production or other operation within the territorial boundaries of the United
States or Canada before being received by such supplier or an affiliate of such supplier. 




Nippondenso America stated that the specified method for calculating U.S./Canadian content should state that value
added in the U.S. and Canada includes profit and processing costs such as labor, depreciation, expenses, etc. (originating
in the U.S. or Canada), to avoid any misunderstandings or confusion regarding determinations of the U.S./Canadian
content. 




Nissan stated that the proposed regulation does not address how suppliers should treat duty. Nissan recommended
that suppliers treat duty paid as domestic. It stated that this would be consistent with the treatment of duty under
CAFE.

NHTSA agrees with the commenters that it is appropriate to provide additional clarification in the regulation concerning
how suppliers are to calculate value added in the U.S./Canada. The agency notes that only allied suppliers typically
need to calculate actual value added in the U.S./Canada of their equipment. As a result of the roll-up, roll-down provision,
outside suppliers only need to determine whether the value added in the U.S./Canada is at least 70 percent or not. In
order to make this determination, of course, outside suppliers need to understand how value added in the U.S./Canada
is calculated. Moreover, if the value added in the U.S./Canada of their equipment is close to 70 percent, outside suppliers
will need to calculate actual value added.

NHTSA believes that APMA's recommendation that the agency adopt the AIAG content calculation procedure as the best
approach for calculating value added in the U.S./Canada is unclear. The AIAG, as an organization, represents an industry
effort to, among other things, help suppliers comply with the Labeling Act. As pointed out by AAMA, however, ``due
to the lack of regulatory guidance, complete process definition has not been established.'' The agency assumes that
AIAG will continue its efforts to help suppliers once today's final rule is issued. Since the AIAG has not completed
the process of establishing a content calculation procedure, NHTSA does not know what APMA means in recommending
that the AIAG procedure be adopted.

After considering the comments, the agency has decided to add the following clarifying language to  583.6(c):





(4)(i) Value is added in the United States or Canada by an allied supplier or outside supplier to the extent that the
supplier produces or assembles passenger motor vehicle equipment at a plant or factory located within the territorial
boundaries of the United States or Canada.

(ii) In determining the value added in the United States or Canada of passenger motor vehicle equipment produced or
assembled within the territorial boundaries of the United States or Canada, the cost of all foreign materials is subtracted
from the total value (e.g., the price paid at the final assembly plant) of the equipment. Except as provided in (c)(3),
material is considered foreign to whatever extent part or all of the cost of the material is not determined to represent
value added in the United States or Canada, traced back to raw materials. For any material which is imported into the
United States or Canada from a third country, the value added in the United States or Canada is zero, even if part of the
material originated in the United States or Canada. Neither suppliers nor anyone else is required to trace the value
added in the United States or Canada backwards; however, any portion of the cost of a material which is not traced to
value added in the United States or Canada is considered foreign. 

Example:

 A supplier located in the United States or Canada uses sheet steel to produce exterior panels which are shipped to a
final assembly plant. In determining the valued added in the United States or Canada of the exterior panels, the supplier
must subtract the price it paid for the sheet steel except to the extent that the supplier determines that the price
paid represents value added in the United States or Canada.

(iii) For the minor items listed in the  583.4 definition of ``passenger motor vehicle equipment'' as being
excluded from that term, outside and allied suppliers may, to the extent that they incorporate such items into their
equipment, treat the cost of the minor items as value added in the country of assembly.

(iv) For passenger motor vehicle equipment which is imported into the territorial boundaries of the United States
or Canada from a third country, the value added in the United States or Canada is zero, even if part of its material originated
in the United States or Canada.

(v) The payment of duty does not result in value added in the United States or Canada. 




In clarifying how suppliers are to calculate value added in the U.S./Canada, NHTSA believes it is important to keep
in mind the statutory requirement that it adopt regulations that provide the best and most understandable information
possible about the foreign and U.S./Canada origin of the equipment of such vehicles without imposing costly and unnecessary
burdens on the manufacturers. In order to make perfect determinations of the value added in the U.S./Canada of all
passenger motor vehicle equipment, it would be necessary to trace all costs involved in producing such equipment,
including the costs of all component parts, all the way back to raw materials. Even if such an effort were possible,
it would be extremely costly.

In light of submissions from GM, Ford, Chrysler, Mitsubishi and AIAM in response to its request for comments, NHTSA
explained in the NPRM that it agreed with the general premise that tracking and reporting requirements should be limited
to ``first tier'' suppliers (including both suppliers which deliver equipment to the manufacturer itself and ones
which deliver equipment to an allied supplier). The agency stated that no requirements would be imposed on suppliers
earlier in the chain, but noted that suppliers which are subject to the proposed information requirements may need
in some cases to arrange to obtain information from their suppliers.

A basic issue raised by APMA's comment is how, in the absence of extensive tracking requirements, ``first tier'' suppliers
will know enough about the content of the materials they purchase from other sources, for incorporation into their
equipment, to make the required determinations about U.S./Canadian content. In fact, the suppliers may not know,
or be able to find out, the amount of the cost of such materials that represents value added in the U.S./Canada. APMA's
comment also raises the issue of how suppliers are to treat such things as costs and profits.

The agency believes that the best way to resolve this potential problem is to specify simple procedures concerning
the determination of value added in the U.S./Canada. NHTSA notes that the total value of an item of passenger motor
vehicle equipment is determined under  583.6(b). The relevant issue, therefore, is what part of that total
value represents value added in the U.S./Canada.
NHTSA agrees with APMA that the basic way suppliers add value in the U.S./Canada is by producing or assembling passenger
motor vehicle equipment within the territorial boundaries of the United States or Canada. The simplest method of
determining the value added in the U.S./Canada for equipment produced or assembled within the territorial boundaries
of the United States or Canada is to subtract from the total value of the equipment the value of any foreign materials
used in such production or assembly.
The clarifying procedures therefore specify that, in determining the value added in the United States or Canada of
passenger motor vehicle equipment produced or assembled within the territorial boundaries of the United States
or Canada, the cost of all foreign materials is subtracted from the total value (e.g., the price paid at the final assembly
plant) of the equipment. The procedures also specify that material is considered foreign to whatever extent part
or all of the cost of the material is not determined to represent value added in the United States or Canada, traced back
to raw materials.
Under this approach, neither suppliers nor anyone else is required to trace the value added in the United States or
Canada back to raw materials; however, any portion of the cost of a material which is not traced to value added in the
United States or Canada is considered foreign. NHTSA believes that this approach is consistent with section 210(f)(16),
which specifies that ``foreign'' or ``foreign content'' mean ``passenger motor vehicle equipment not determined
to be U.S./Canadian origin.''
The clarifying procedures also provide that for any material which is imported into the United States or Canada from
a third country, the value added in the United States or Canada is zero, even if part of the material originated in the
United States or Canada. For purposes of simplicity and consistency, NHTSA believes it is appropriate to deem any
materials which are imported in the United States or Canada from a third country as foreign. The agency believes that
any attempt to separate out the possible portion of such materials that may have originated in the United States or
Canada would involve extremely complex issues concerning how various costs are attributed to different countries.
This would not provide significantly more useful information to the consumer, but would require a much more complicated
regulatory scheme.
NHTSA notes that APMA recommended a somewhat different approach with respect to the treatment of foreign material.
Under its suggested provision, foreign material would be limited to materials which have been produced or assembled
outside of the territorial boundaries of the United States or Canada and which have not undergone any further production
or other operation within the territorial boundaries of the United States or Canada before being received by such
supplier or an affiliate of such supplier. The problem with this recommended provision is that the entire value of
foreign material which has undergone further production or other operation within the U.S./Canada would be transformed
into value added in the U.S./Canada. This would create a giant loophole by which foreign material could be transformed
into U.S./Canadian content.
The above discussion has primarily concerned determining the value added in the United States or Canada of passenger
motor vehicle equipment produced or assembled within the territorial boundaries of the United States or Canada.
For equipment which is imported into the United States or Canada from a third country, the clarifying regulations
specify that the value added in the United States or Canada is zero. The agency is taking this approach for the same reasons
discussed above with respect to imported material that is used to produce or assemble passenger motor vehicle within
the United States or Canada.
The clarifying regulations also specify that the payment of duty does not result in value added in the United States
or Canada. While it may be necessary to pay duty as a condition of an item crossing a national border, such payment does
not add any value to the item in the country to which duty is paid.
NHTSA is also including a provision which specifies that if a manufacturer or allied supplier does not receive information
from one or more of its suppliers concerning the U.S./Canadian content of particular equipment, the U.S./Canadian
content of that equipment is considered zero. While the agency does not believe that this situation will occur very
often, the provision ensures that U.S./Canadian content is not overstated as a result of the manufacturer or allied
supplier simply assuming that equipment is of U.S./Canadian origin in the absence of information from the supplier.
The provision does not affect the obligation of manufacturers and allied suppliers to request this information from
their suppliers or the obligation of the suppliers to provide the information.


c. Determining the U.S./Canadian percentage of the total value of a carline's passenger motor vehicle equipment.


GM stated that the agency had proposed that the proper method to establish the U.S./Canadian content for a carline
is to estimate the installation rates for all equipment options and choices offered on that carline multiplied by
the U.S./Canadian content value for each option or choice divided by the total value for all equipment, domestic or
foreign. That company stated that it has found for cost management and planning purposes that the use of a high volume
configuration carline model results in better management control of the assembly process than the so called average
equipped carline model. GM stated that such a model has found wide acceptance in calculations made for corporate average
fuel economy (CAFE) emission testing configurations, and most recently, for vehicle configurations under NAFTA.
That company recommended that the agency permit manufacturers to use established carline cost management models
for establishing the percentage U.S./Canadian content required to be included in the AALA domestic content label.
JAMA stated that it understands that it is NHTSA's intention that manufacturers project the sales mix of all of the
potentially many models within a carline, including differences in series, engine type, transmission type, and
other optional equipment, and to perform the weighted average carline calculation based on this model and equipment
mix. That organization stated that it believes this calculation method would impose an unnecessarily great burden
on manufacturers without a significant increase in the accuracy of the computed percentage. It recommended that
agency permit a manufacturer, at its option, to use the U.S./Canadian parts content of a specific model, e.g., the
best selling model of a carline, on a projected sales basis, which is considered to reasonably represent the entire
carline.

Mazda stated that it believes proposed calculation method would impose too much burden on manufacturers, and recommended
that NHTSA permit manufacturers to use U.S./Canadian parts content of a specific representative model within a carline,
e.g., best selling model, as the parts content of the carline.
NHTSA does not disagree with the concept of permitting simplified procedures for estimating U.S./Canadian content,
if such procedures would always ensure reliable results. However, the procedures suggested by the commenters, which
are based on either a high volume configuration or best selling model, would not appear to always ensure meaningful
results.
For example, as discussed above, vehicles within a carline may be assembled in both the U.S./Canada and a foreign country.
If the high volume configuration or best selling model was produced in the U.S./Canada and the rest of the carline was
produced in a foreign country, content calculations based on the portion of the carline assembled in the U.S./Canada
would not be representative of the carline as a whole.
The agency believes it would inappropriate to permit simplified procedures that could produce unreliable results.


4. Procedure for Determining Major Foreign Sources of Passenger Motor Vehicle Equipment (Section 583.7)


As discussed in the NPRM, item two on the label, listing the main foreign sources of a carline's equipment, is necessary
only if one or more foreign countries (i.e., countries other than the U.S./Canada) individually contribute at least
15 percent of the value of the carline's equipment. If there is one such country, the manufacturer must list that country
and the percentage by value that originated in that country for the carline. If there are two such countries, the manufacturer
must list those countries and the percentage by value that originated in those countries for the carline, in descending
order of percentage. Manufacturers need not list more than two such countries. As with the first item on the label,
much of the information that manufacturers need to calculate the information for the second item must come from parts
suppliers.
NHTSA proposed a specific procedure in  583.7 of the proposed regulation for determining major foreign sources
of passenger motor vehicle equipment. The section specified the same procedure for determining the value of items
of equipment as  583.7, and also specified procedures for determining the country of origin of items of equipment
and for determining the percentage of the total value of a carline's passenger motor vehicle equipment which is attributable
to individual countries other than the U.S. and Canada.
NHTSA noted in the NPRM that the statute does not specify how country of origin is determined for purposes of item two
on the label. The agency tentatively concluded that the simplest method would be to specify one country of origin for
each item of equipment, using the country from which the greatest share of value originated for the item of equipment.
The agency noted that this is the method that Congress prescribed for the only other country of origin calculation
in section 210, i.e., country of origin for engines and transmissions in section 210(f)(12).
Ford commented that due to differences in calculation methods for U.S./Canadian and foreign content, it would be
possible for the sum of the domestic and foreign label values of a vehicle to be either over 100 percent or zero percent,
thereby causing confusion to consumers. That company suggested an alternative method for determining country of
origin which, among other things, would attribute the total value of outside supplied equipment that contains less
than 70 percent value added in the U.S./Canada to the country other than the U.S./Canada which contributed the greatest
amount of value to that item. Ford stated that if the agency did not adopt its recommendation, it should clarify that
the sum of U.S./Canadian content is considered one country, to preclude the classification of an item of equipment
that is more than 50 percent U.S./Canadian to be classified as a foreign item of equipment.
Chrysler argued that the proposed regulation could result in an anomaly. It stated, among other things, that under
the proposed method for determining country of origin, the country of origin could be the U.S. or Canada in situations
where U.S./Canadian content is less than 70 percent. Chrysler recommended an alternative method for determining
foreign country of origin. The method would only consider passenger motor vehicle equipment that contains less than
70 percent valued added in the U.S./Canada, and would consider the foreign value of the equipment to be its value multiplied
by the percent of content that originated outside of the U.S. and Canada.
Toyota stated that a ``greatest share of value originated'' test for purposes of item two on the label would represent
a new and different test that is inconsistent with all other origin tests in use. Toyota stated that it believes that
imposing this test would result in more work for suppliers with no benefit to the consumer. That company stated that
if this test is used at all, it should be confined to instances in which the country of origin of passenger motor vehicle
equipment, as determined for Customs purposes, is unknown and cannot be determined.
BMW commented that with regard to foreign parts content calculations and country of origin certification, NHTSA
should incorporate an alternative means to allow manufacturers with existing, substantial business records to
use these records as proof of foreign content to comply with the requirements. That company argued that without such
an alternative, NHTSA would be imposing an unnecessary burden which would be increased further due to language barriers.
BMW stated that it already has a system in place to handle customs duties and preferential treatment of goods with Germany
and the EC jurisdiction which provides information on more than 400,000 active BMW parts. That manufacturer stated
that by using the parts database and by inputting the appropriate parameters for a given group of vehicles, it can receive
information that could be utilized to complete the calculations for the foreign parts content of Item Two on the label.
BMW stated that while the wording of the definition of country of origin for customs purposes does not match the language
in the NPRM verbatim, the practical use of either definition essentially would be the same for calculating the foreign
content of Item Two. BMW acknowledged that circumstances would not be precluded where the country of origin would
be different given the two definitions, but argued that these exceptions will not influence the accuracy of the calculated
percentages.
After considering the comments, the agency has decided to make changes in  583.7 to prevent the possibility
that the specified U.S./Canadian content and major sources of foreign content for a carline will together exceed
100 percent and to provide greater flexibility concerning determination of country of origin for purposes of item
two of the label.
As discussed above, the first two items on the label provide parts content percentages for the U.S./Canada and for
up to two major sources of foreign parts content. For example, a label might indicate the following parts content percentages:
U.S./Canada, 50%; Japan, 20%; and Mexico, 15%. Since the label does not purport to indicate all sources of content,
the percentages are not expected to add up to 100%. However, the agency agrees that consumers would be confused if the
numbers added up to more than 100 percent.
One way to prevent the numbers from adding up to more than 100 percent would be to specify a procedure for determining
country of origin for item two of the label that is more closely tied to the statutory method for determining U.S./Canadian
content. However, such a procedure would necessarily be very complicated, given certain aspects of the procedure
for determining U.S./Canadian content, e.g., the roll-up, roll-down provision for outside suppliers.

<TEXT>
 

The agency has therefore decided to simply specify that if the U.S./Canada and major foreign source percentages add
up to more than 100 percent, the foreign source percentages are proportionately reduced to the extent necessary to
bring the percentages down to 100 percent. The U.S./Canada percentage is not changed. The agency believes that this
is the more important of the two items of information for consumers, and the method for determining the U.S./Canada
percentage, unlike the methodology for major foreign source percentages, is explicitly set forth in the statute.


Since section 210 provides a specific methodology for determining the U.S./Canada percentage, the  583.7
procedures have the limited purpose of providing a method for calculating the extent to which the 

remaining

 percentage is attributable to foreign countries which individually contribute at least 15 percent of the parts content,
and the specific percentage attributable to each such foreign country. 

Given that the U.S. and Canada are treated together in determining the U.S./Canada content, the agency agrees with
Ford that they should also be treated together in making determinations under  583.7. Beyond that, however,
NHTSA believes that since the statute does not specify a particular method for making the country of origin determinations
for item two of the label, and given the limited purpose of these determinations, manufacturers should be permitted
greater flexibility. The agency is therefore specifying that, in making country of origin determinations for item
two of the label only, manufacturers may use the greatest share of value approach or any other approach that is used
for customs (U.S. or foreign) purposes, so long as a consistent methodology is employed for all parts and so long as
the U.S. and Canada are treated together. 

NHTSA notes that regardless of what approach a manufacturer selects for making country of origin determinations
for item two of the label, it will have no effect on the specified U.S./Canadian content of a carline. Assume, for example,
that an outside supplier provides equipment with 65 percent U.S./Canadian content. Under the roll-up, roll-down
provision, the equipment is considered 0 percent U.S./Canadian for item one of the label. Under the greatest share
of value approach and possibly under other approaches, the equipment would be considered U.S./Canadian for item
two of the label. However, this would merely mean that the equipment does not show up in the percentages attributable
to Japan, Germany or some other foreign country in the item two calculations; it would never be reflected as U.S./Canadian
on the label. 

NHTSA does not agree with the specific approaches recommended by Ford and Chrysler. The agency believes that both
approaches are unnecessarily complicated. The agency also notes that the Ford approach would result in country of
origin determinations being made on a very small percentage of value for items with substantial, but less than 70 percent,
U.S./Canadian content. 



5. Procedure for Determining Country of Origin for Engines and Transmissions (Section 583.8) 



As discussed in the NPRM, the fourth and fifth items on the label, the countries of origin for the engine and transmission,
are also determined separately for each vehicle, instead of on a carline basis. The information needed to make these
determinations also needs to come from suppliers. 

Section 210(f)(12) states that the ``country of origin'' of an engine or transmission is the country that contributed
the greatest percentage of dollar value to the engine or transmission, based upon the purchase price of direct materials
received at the individual engine or transmission plant. It also states that the U.S. and Canada are to be treated separately
for determining the country of origin. Thus, the country of origin might be the U.S. or Canada, but could not be U.S./Canada.


NHTSA explained in the NPRM that the term ``direct materials'' is not defined in section 210 of the Cost Savings Act.
The agency referred to similar terms in the CFTA to assist it in defining the term, and tentatively concluded that the
term ``direct materials'' refers to the items (i.e., the materials) that make up the final good (either an engine or
a transmission), but does not include the ``costs'' (i.e., items such as labor) that go into assembling the final good.
Those ``costs'' are not ``materials.'' Further, they are not ``received at the individual engine or transmission
plants.'' (Emphasis added.) 

NHTSA therefore concluded that, in calculating the country of origin for engines and transmissions, the country
to which the engine or transmission is attributed is that country in which the greatest percentage by value was added,
based on the purchase price of all equipment that makes up the completed engine or transmission. In addition, the country
of origin calculation is based on the purchase price an engine or transmission supplier pays for all equipment it receives
at the plant at which the engine or transmission is assembled into a completed unit. Based on the language in section
210(f)(12), costs incurred once the engine or transmission supplier has received the equipment at its engine or transmission
assembly plants (e.g., labor costs, depreciation of equipment, insurance, etc.) are not permitted to be taken into
account for purposes of determining the country of origin of an engine or transmission. 

The agency recognized that some engine/transmission suppliers may produce their own equipment that is integrated
into the fully-assembled engine/transmission. NHTSA requested comments on whether such ``on-site'' production
should be treated similarly to on-site production at a manufacturer's final assembly point, i.e., by including all
costs related to the production of such components, including labor. 

The agency stated that under such an approach, for engine suppliers, production that occurs on-site prior to the point
at which the engine parts are assembled to the engine block would not be considered ``engine assembly,'' and non-parts
costs would be taken into account in determining the value of the engine in order to determine its country of origin.
After that point in the process, assembly and other non-parts costs would be disallowed. For transmission suppliers,
production that occurs on-site prior to the point at which the transmission parts are assembled in the transmission
casing (or transmission housing) would not be considered ``transmission assembly,'' and non-parts costs would
be taken into account in determining the value of the transmission in order to determine its country of origin. Again,
after that point in the process, assembly and other non-parts costs would be disallowed.

NHTSA proposed a specific procedure in  583.8 of the proposed regulation for determining country of origin
for engines and transmissions. NHTSA noted in the NPRM that while the proposed regulatory text did not reflect taking
parts production costs at the engine or transmission plant into account in determining country of origin for the engine
or transmission, the agency might, depending on the comments, adopt such an approach in the final rule. 



a. Assembly costs.

 AAMA stated that it agrees that the statute provides that determination of country of origin for engine and transmission
does not include the cost of assembling and fabricating the engine or transmission. 

Toyota, however, stated that it disagrees with this conclusion. That manufacturer argued that the statute does not
expressly require such exclusion, and the Act's use of the words ``dollar value added'' in the first sentence of section
210(f)(12) connotes that the cost of assembling the engine or transmission is to be included. Toyota stated that it
recognizes that the third sentence in (f)(12) provides that the estimate of value is based on the purchase price of
direct materials, but argued that the sentence does not require that the estimate be based solely on the value of direct
materials. Toyota urged the agency to interpret this section based on what it considers to be the plain meaning of both
of these sentences, under which materials are a component of the value added calculation but not the sole component.


Mitsubishi argued that exclusion of the cost of labor required to build or assemble engines and transmission is not
consistent with other provisions of the regulations, and the value of labor should therefore be included. That manufacturer
stated that since the term ``direct materials'' is not defined in the AALA, the agency should use its discretion to
interpret the undefined and vague language in a manner that is consistent with the rest of the Act. 

JAMA also argued that assembly labor for engines and transmission should be included in the country of origin label
calculations. That organization stated that if NHTSA believes that the statute precludes such inclusion, the agency
should provide in the final regulations a clear disclaimer statement to that effect. JAMA stated that this could be
accomplished by adding a sentence to the explanatory note or a parenthetical to the label following the words country
of origin. 

After considering the comments, NHTSA concludes, based on the language in section 210(f)(12), that determination
of country of origin for engine and transmission does not include the cost of assembling and fabricating the engine
or transmission. The agency does not accept Toyota's argument about the first and third sentences of (f)(12). Since
the third sentence expressly provides that ``(t)he estimate of the percentage of dollar value shall be based upon
the purchase price of direct materials as received at the individual engine or transmissions plants of engines of
the same displacement and transmission of the same transmission type,'' it limits the meaning of the term ``value
added'' in the first sentence. 

The agency also does not agree that significance should be accorded the fact that (f)(12) does not expressly provide
that the estimate must be based solely on the value of direct materials. A basic rule of statutory construction provides
that where a form of conduct, the manner of its performance and operation, and the persons and things to which it refers
are designated, there is an inference that all omissions should be understood as exclusions. See Sutherland Stat
Const  47.23 (5th Ed). Since (f)(12) provides that the estimate is to be based on the value of direct materials
received at the individual engine or transmission plant, other items such as assembly costs are excluded in making
estimates. 

NHTSA disagrees with Mitsubishi's argument that exclusion of the cost of labor is inconsistent with the rest of the
regulation. The agency notes that  583.8 applies 

only

 to the determination of country of origin for engines/transmissions for purposes of items four and five on the label;
the cost of labor in assembling engines and transmissions is not excluded for purposes of determining U.S./Canadian
parts content and major foreign sources of foreign content (items one and two of the label). NHTSA also notes that the
exclusion of labor and assembly costs in determining the country of origin for engines/transmissions is directly
analogous to the exclusion of final assembly costs in determining U.S./Canadian parts content and major foreign
sources of content. The agency also disagrees that the term ``direct materials'' is so vague that it can be interpreted
to include labor in assembling the equipment received at engine/transmission plants into engines/transmissions.


NHTSA has, however, decided to specify the addition of the word ``parts'' after ``engine'' and ``transmission''
on the label. The agency believes that this will make it clear to consumers that these country of origin determinations
exclude assembly costs. Because this change involves adding only two words to the label, it will not result in an information
overload for consumers or an unnecessarily long label. NHTSA believes that this change is consistent with the statutory
directive that the regulations provide to the ultimate purchaser of new passenger motor vehicles the best and most
understandable information possible about the foreign and U.S./Canada origin of the equipment of such vehicles
without imposing costly and unnecessary burdens on manufacturers. 



b. Parts that are produced at engine and transmission plants.

 AAMA recommended that the regulation provide that ``(a)ll value added at the transmission and engine plant is excluded
from the calculation of origin.'' APMA stated that the agency asked whether it should include non-parts costs of on-site
production prior to the point at which engine parts are assembled to engine block or transmission parts are assembled
in the transmission casing. APMA stated that it supports the regulation as drafted, which does not include non-parts
costs for on-site production, as being the only approach consistent with the statutory language. 

A number of other commenters, however, urged that ``on-site'' production of parts at an engine/transmission plant
should be treated similarly to on-site production at a manufacturer's final assembly point, i.e., by including all
costs related to the production of such components, including labor. Honda stated that it strongly supports inclusion
of costs of in-house production of parts and subcomponents that are subsequently integrated into the engine or transmission
during final assembly. It also stated that the agency's proposed definition of 

final assembly point

 for the engine (the point at which the engine parts are assembled to the engine block) and the transmission (the point
at which the transmission part are assembled in the transmission casing or housing) seems appropriate.

Nissan stated that it agrees that in-house parts and components production should be included as parts content in
determining country of origin for engines and transmissions. It also stated that, as proposed, final engine assembly
should be designated to begin at the point in the production process when the block and head are joined, and that for
transmissions, final assembly should be designated to begin at the point in the production process at which transmission
parts are assembled in the transmission casing. 


Toyota stated that because an assembled engine block is not equivalent to an engine (for any piston engine, gasoline
or diesel, there must also be a cylinder head), it recommends that the point of engine assembly should occur no sooner
than the point at which the block and head are attached to one another. That commenter stated that assembly labor prior
to the attachment of the head to the block should not be excluded, as such labor constitutes, by definition, part of
the value of the individual engine block and cylinder head, neither of which by itself constitutes an engine.

BMW stated that it supports treating on-site production of engine and transmission parts in a similar manner to on-site
production of parts at a manufacturer's final assembly plant. BMW added, however, that it believes the definitions
for the starting points of final assembly for the engine and transmission need to be precise so that substantial variances
cannot be achieved by modifying the assembly sequence.

After considering the comments, NHTSA has concluded that production of parts at an engine or transmission plant should
be treated in a similar manner with respect to determining country of origin of the engine or transmission as the production
of parts at a final assembly plant is treated with respect to determination of a vehicle's parts content. The agency
notes that the basic value of an engine or transmission is not primarily related to either the costs of assembly or the
costs of the raw materials, but is instead related to the costs of producing parts. If an engine or transmission plant
was highly integrated and all parts were produced at the plant, a determination of country of origin that did not reflect
the costs of producing parts would be based entirely on the costs of raw materials. The agency believes that such a determination
would be of little meaning.

At the same time, however, the agency must give full effect to the congressional intent to exclude the costs of assembling
engines and transmissions. NHTSA believes that the best way to accomplish this is to specify that all value added at
the transmission and engine plant is excluded from the calculation of origin, with the exception of the costs of producing
individual parts of the transmission/engine. Individual parts refers to the most basic level of parts used to assemble
an engine or transmission and not subassemblies.

In addition to ensuring that engine and transmission assembly costs are excluded as required by section 210, the agency
also believes that this approach is much clearer than the specific one discussed in the NPRM preamble. The agency believes
it could be difficult or impossible to define the starting points of final assembly for the engine and transmission
in ways that are appropriate for all manufacturers. NHTSA is particularly concerned that, under such an approach,
manufacturers might be able to modify the assembly process in ways that would reduce the costs of assembling the engine/transmission
to a nullity. This would be possible, for example, under the approach suggested by Toyota. Such a result would be inconsistent
with the statutory requirement that engine and transmission origin determinations be made based on the costs of direct
materials.



c. Other issues concerning determining country of origin for engines and transmissions. 

AAMA stated that  583.8 refers to determining country of origin for each individual engine and transmission.
That organization stated that this is inconsistent with section 210(f)(10)(B) of the statute, which specifies that
the following groupings are used in determining the origin and value added of engines/transmissions: engines of
the same displacement produced at the same plant and transmissions of the same type produced at the same plant. AAMA
noted that neither the statute nor proposed regulation defines ``type'' of transmission. It suggested that transmission
type be defined as follows: In determining the origin of transmissions produced in the same plant, a type should have
the same characteristics: driveline, number of forward gears, controls, and layout.

AAMA also commented that the regulation should specify that country of origin is determined once a model year using
same methodology as vehicles, except United States and Canada are treated separately. That organization also stated
that the regulation should make it clear that calculation of origin of engine/transmission is different for determining
overall U.S./Canadian content.

Honda stated that the proposed regulation does not address the appropriate groupings of engines and transmissions
for purposes of calculating country of origin. It also noted that the proposed regulatory text refers to a separate
country of origin determination for each individual engine and transmission, and argued that this is not contemplated
by the Labeling Act and would be extremely burdensome.

Honda stated that it believes the statutory groupings in some cases may be broader than appropriate to give meaningful
information to consumers. It cited the example of an engine that is available in two types, both of same displacement
and both manufactured at same plant, one of which is supercharged and the other standard. Honda stated that the two
engines may have very different parts sources. Honda suggested that final rule provide manufacturers discretion
to make country of origin determinations for engine and transmission subgroupings within the statutory grouping
framework.

NHTSA agrees with the commenters that section 210 requires country of origin determinations for engines and transmissions,
for items four and five of the label, to be based on groups of engines. The agency also agrees with AAMA's suggested definition
for transmission type. For purposes of consistency and clarity, the agency believes it is more appropriate to provide
a definition than simply leave subgroupings to the discretion of the manufacturer. The final rule reflects these
changes. The agency does not agree that it is appropriate to permit subgroupings of engines below the level specified
in section 210, since the statute specifies the groups to be used.

As part of the procedure for determining country of origin for engines and transmissions (for purposes of items four
and five of the label only), the agency is specifying a similar procedure for determining country of origin of the components
that comprise the engine/transmission as for making country of origin determinations for item two of the label, i.e.,
manufacturers may use the greatest share of value approach or any other approach that is used for customs (U.S. or foreign)
purposes, so long as a consistent methodology is employed for all parts. The U.S. and Canada, however, are treated
separately for making these determinations.

<TEXT>
 

Since the statute does not specify a particular method for making country of origin determinations for the components
comprising an engine/transmission, NHTSA believes that this approach will provide appropriate flexibility. The
agency notes that after country of origin determinations are made for each component comprising an engine/transmission,
the ``greatest share of value added'' approach is used to determine the origin of the engine/transmission. The agency
also notes that this approach will not have any effect on item one of the label. 


B. Format/Location for Label



NHTSA proposed to require that the label be placed in a prominent location on each vehicle where it can be read from the
exterior of the vehicle. The agency proposed three options for the format of the label: (1) A stand-alone label that
is at least 5 inches wide by 3 inches long, (2) an addition at the end of the Monroney pricing label (15 U.S.C. 1232), or
(3) an addition at the end of the fuel economy label (15 U.S.C. 2006). Under all three options, the label would be required
to read as follows: 





For vehicles in this carline: 


U.S./Canadian Parts Content: 

XX

% 
Major Source of Foreign Parts Content: 
[fill in country/countries]: 

XX

% 


For this vehicle: 


Final Assembly Point: 

XXXXX

 
Country of Origin: 
 Engine: 

XXXXX


 Transmission: 

XXXXX

 





In addition, the label would include the heading ``PARTS CONTENT INFORMATION'' at the top, and an explanatory note
at the bottom. The second item of the label (i.e., ``Major Source of Foreign parts Content'') would be omitted if no
individual country other than the U.S./Canada contributed a minimum of 15 percent of the value of a vehicle's equipment.


NHTSA stated in the NPRM that to ease comparisons among various carlines and to make the information available to consumers
in as clear and consistent a manner as possible, it believed it was appropriate to specify minimum requirements for
label and letter size. The agency noted that the label, whether separate or attached to the price or fuel economy labels,
must be large enough for all the content information to be easily read, yet small enough to avoid cluttering the limited
window space on the vehicle. The agency proposed to require a separate label to be rectangular with a minimum dimension
of 5.0 inches (125 mm) in width and 3.0 inches (75 mm) in length. The characters for items one through five of the parts
content label would be required to be printed at a minimum height of 12 points (one-sixth of an inch) in boldface type.
The required explanatory note at the bottom of the label would be required to be printed in characters two points smaller
than the information for items one through five. 


If the information required by section 210 is attached to the price or fuel economy labels, the information would be
required to be separated from the information required to be on those labels by a line that is a minimum of 3 points wide.
The words ``PARTS CONTENT INFORMATION'' would be required to be printed in bold, uppercase letters, centered, and
in not less than 12 point type. 

AAMA stated that the agency should permit the label information on any prominently displayed window label. That organization
stated that as various government agencies add more labeling requirements, many companies have been developing
consumer labels containing information on several different issues. On the issue of format, AAMA stated that because
of increasing labeling requirements such as bumper standards and CFC content, deviations should be permitted with
the prior approval of the agency. 


GM stated that label space is at a premium, especially for labels which are required to be left in place until delivery.
That manufacturer stated that the information required on the label is specifically set out in the legislation, and
additional information should not be required. GM also argued that the label location, format, size, appearance
and type style should be discretionary with the manufacturer to give the manufacturer the greatest flexibility.
GM indicated that it intends to include this label information in a consumer information label combining several
consumer notices on one label, including such things as bumper system performance information. GM stated that the
regulation should allow consolidation of this label with other consumer notices as part of another window label displayed
for consumer review at time of sale. 


GM stated that in its combined consumer information label format, a title size of 12 points with the label information
printed in characters two points smaller would make the label consistent with the other information. That manufacturer
argued that in no case should the type size be larger than 12 points. GM stated that type size changes and bolding are
more practical for implementing emphasis than underlining. According to GM, to maximize use of label space, the format
should be discretionary, not mandated. That company stated, for example, that various information should be allowed
on the same line if width permits to save label space. GM also argued that the title line should be ``Content Information''
to comply with the disclosure intent of the Labeling Act. 


Toyota stated that a separate Labeling Act label should not be required to be placed on the same window as the Monroney
label. That company stated that section 210(b) does not require such placement and provides only that the label appear
in a prominent place. Toyota also stated that the proposed 3 x 5 inch minimum size requirement for a separate label would
pose problems concerning placement on some vehicles for which available space is limited. It noted that a manufacturer
choosing to place the information on the Monroney label will be able to devote less space to Labeling Act disclosures
than the 15 square inches of a 3 x 5 inch label. Toyota stated that for the sake of consistency, a separate label should
not have to be substantially larger than the available space on the Monroney label. 


NADA urged the agency to allow manufacturers to set out parts content information in the certification label required
by 49 CFR part 567. That organization argued that a vehicle's right door frame is a prominent place and that nothing
in the Act requires parts content labels to be affixed to vehicle exteriors. NADA also stated permanent attachment
would provide information to subsequent purchasers. 


NADA stated that the agency should prohibit the affixing of any separate parts content labels on the vehicle window.
That organization stated that new vehicle windows are already cluttered with the Monroney and fuel economy labels.
It also stated that vehicles in demonstrator service must also have used car rule warranty labels affixed. NADA stated
that, by law, only used car rule labels may be removed during test drives. It noted that many state laws regulate vehicle
window obstruction, but Federal law requires Monroney and fuel economy labels to be maintained. NADA stated that
the agency, consistent with its primary mission to ensure vehicle safety, must not exacerbate this concern by allowing
the potential for an additional window label. 


After considering the comments, NHTSA has decided to require the label to be placed in a prominent location on each
vehicle where it can be read from the exterior of the vehicle with the doors closed. NHTSA does not accept NADA's recommendation
to permit the label to be included as part of the certification label on the door frame. The agency disagrees that the
door frame would be a prominent location for a consumer information label, since prospective purchasers would need
to open the door of a vehicle, and probably have to stoop down as well, to read the label.

<TEXT>
 

NHTSA does not believe that it would be appropriate to prohibit stand-alone labels from being affixed to vehicle windows.
Section 210 expressly provides that the agency must permit manufacturers to use, among other options, a readily visible
separate label. A window location is the most practicable location for consumer information labels since a label
installed on the inside of the glass can be read from outside the vehicle, yet is also protected from the elements. In
addition, affixing labels to exterior painted surfaces could damage the paint. While NHTSA recognizes the importance
of driver visibility, it observes that since a stand-alone label would be very small, such a label could be placed in
an area where it would have little or no impact on visibility. The agency notes, in response to Toyota's comment, that
stand-alone labels are not required to be on the same window as the Monroney label.

The agency is adopting format requirements that are similar to those in the NPRM, but with some minor changes. The agency
is requiring the heading ``PARTS CONTENT INFORMATION'' for all labels. The agency notes that the NPRM preamble suggested
that the heading would only be required for content labels included as part of other labels. However, the agency believes
that a heading is useful for all labels, since it draws attention to the information and identifies its purpose. The
agency believes the word ``parts'' is appropriate for reasons discussed earlier in this preamble. NHTSA also notes
that the wording of the explanatory note has also been changed and the word ``parts'' has been added after ``engine''
and ``transmission,'' for reasons discussed earlier in the preamble.

NHTSA agrees that manufacturers should be permitted to include the content label as part of any larger labels meeting
the specified location requirements, since this increases manufacturer flexibility without lessening the usefulness
or visibility of the content information. The agency disagrees, however, that it should drop all of the proposed format
and size requirements. Without such requirements, manufacturers might use fine print that is not easily read. Similarly,
the agency believes that the label would be harder to read if multiple items of information were placed on the same line.
NHTSA is not adopting the proposed requirement that certain information be underlined, since it agrees that the use
of capital letters and bold type provides sufficient emphasis. The agency is adopting minimum type size requirements.
The agency is not adopting any overall size requirement for a separate label, since it believes that the minimum type
size requirements are sufficient to ensure that the content label will be visible and easily read.



C. Attachment of Label




NHTSA proposed to require manufacturers to affix the content label to each new vehicle before the vehicle is shipped
from the final assembly point to the dealer, shipping agent, or importer. 

Virtually all of the vehicle manufacturers requested more flexibility as to when the label must be affixed to the vehicle,
and relied on the same basic arguments. They noted that section 210(b) does not expressly require manufacturers to
attach the label but instead specifies that each manufacturer shall ``cause to be affixed'' the required label. The
manufacturers also noted that section 210(c) specifies that manufacturers must be permitted the option of including
the content information as part of the Monroney or fuel economy label, and indicated that, for imported vehicles,
these labels are ordinarily affixed at the port of entry, a distribution center or the dealership.

Some of the manufacturers requested that the label be required to be affixed prior to the delivery of a vehicle to the
dealership. AAMA requested that the label be required to be affixed prior to a motor vehicle being ``offered for sale
to an ultimate purchaser.'' Ford commented that some vehicles which are shipped to dealers prior to introduction
dates are only consigned to the dealer, and the dealer does not take possession until the vehicle is invoiced.

In response to an inquiry from NHTSA concerning when Monroney labels are affixed, the Justice Department noted that
manufacturers are required by statute, ``prior to the delivery of any new automobile to any dealer, or at or prior to
the introduction date of new models delivered to a dealer prior to such introduction date'' to affix the Monroney label.
That Department noted that the language requiring the Monroney label be affixed ``prior to the delivery'' is straightforward
and places the responsibility squarely on the manufacturer. With respect to the ``introduction date'' exception,
however, the Justice Department indicated that models are introduced at varying times and vehicles may sometimes
arrive at a dealership several months ahead of the ``introduction date'' minus the Monroney labels. The Department
stated that this makes compliance problematic at times and raises enforcement issues that NHTSA may wish to consider.

After considering the comments, NHTSA has decided to generally require labels to be affixed prior to the delivery
of a vehicle to the dealer, but to provide an exception for vehicles delivered to dealerships prior to introduction
dates. The agency believes it is desirable for labels to be present on vehicles when they are delivered to the dealership,
since consumers may see such vehicles at any time after such delivery. There is no reason to require the labels to be
affixed any earlier, such as at the final assembly plant, since consumers will not see the vehicles prior to their arrival
at the dealership. Since the Labeling Act provides that manufacturers may include the content information as part
of the Monroney label, the agency believes it is appropriate to provide the same ``introduction date'' exception
as is provided for Monroney labels. 



D. Requirements for Suppliers and Related Ones for Manufacturers



As discussed above, much of the information that manufacturers need to calculate the required items for the label
must come from suppliers. Section 210(d) specifies that the agency must issue regulations which include provisions
applicable to outside and allied suppliers to require such suppliers to certify whether equipment provided by such
suppliers is United States, U.S./Canadian or foreign and to provide such other information as may be necessary to
enable the manufacturer to reasonably comply with the provisions of section 210 and to rely on such certification
and information.

NHTSA proposed specific requirements for suppliers. In order to enable manufacturers to calculate the information
required for items one and two of the label, i.e., the percentage U.S./Canadian content and major foreign sources
of equipment, NHTSA proposed ( 583.10) to require outside suppliers to provide the following information
for any equipment they supply to a vehicle manufacturer or to an allied supplier:

(1) The price of the equipment to the manufacturer or allied supplier;

(2) Whether the equipment has, or does not have, at least 70 percent of its value added in the U.S. and Canada;

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940721-0-00068 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940721-0-00014 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(3) For any equipment for which the U.S./Canadian content is less than 70 percent, the country of origin for the equipment.

The agency proposed ( 583.11) to require allied suppliers to provide the following information for any equipment
they supply to a vehicle manufacturer:

(1) The price of the equipment to the manufacturer;

(2) The percentage U.S./Canadian content of the equipment;

(3) The country of origin of the equipment, i.e., the country in which the greatest percentage, by value (using purchase
price), of value was added to the equipment.

Under the proposal, both outside and allied suppliers that directly supply vehicle manufacturers would be required
to provide the specified information directly to the vehicle manufacturer, accompanied by a certification of the
information's accuracy. Outside suppliers that directly supply allied suppliers would be required to provide the
specified information and certification directly to the allied supplier. Suppliers would also be required to maintain
records of the information used to determine the information provided to the manufacturers or allied suppliers.

The agency noted in the NPRM that since the information required for items one and two of the label must be calculated
before the beginning of the model year, it is important that manufacturers and outside suppliers receive the required
information in a timely manner. NHTSA proposed to require suppliers to provide the information by specified dates,
based on typical model year production periods. The agency also proposed to require suppliers to base the information
they provide on what they expect to supply during specified production periods. However, recognizing that manufacturers
may establish different model year production periods for particular carlines, the agency proposed to permit manufacturers
and suppliers to conclude agreements specifying alternative production periods and alternative times for providing
the information to the manufacturer.

As discussed above, the information for items four and five of the label, i.e., countries of origin for the engine and
transmission, is calculated for individual vehicles rather than on a carline basis. Under the agency's proposal
( 583.12), suppliers of engines and transmissions would be required to provide the vehicle manufacturer with
the country of origin for each engine or transmission it supplies to the manufacturer, i.e., the country in which the
greatest percentage, by value (using the total cost of equipment to the engine or transmission supplier), was added
to the engine or transmission. The agency proposed to require this information to be provided no later than the time
the engine or transmission is delivered to the manufacturer.

NHTSA received numerous comments concerning the proposed requirements for suppliers. AAMA noted that the proposed
regulation would require outside suppliers to provide a manufacturer or allied supplier content information for
each unique type of equipment. It stated that the requirement should be limited to providing content data on those
items of equipment requested by a manufacturer.

AAMA also noted that the proposed regulation would require suppliers' best estimates of price, content and origin
for unique type of equipment expected to be supplied during a 12-month period. That organization stated that it believes
it is highly unlikely that suppliers would be willing or able to release estimates ``for future model year costs,''
as this information is confidential business information and suppliers may not be able anticipate changes that may
be required to contract price during the year due to unforeseen design changes. AAMA suggested that to ease this potential
point of friction between suppliers and manufacturers, it recommends that suppliers' best estimates of price, content
and origin be based on the price which exists in the financial records of the manufacturer at the time when the content
is calculated. That organization stated that if this information does not yet exist because the part is new, suppliers
should be required to provide their best estimates of what the price, content or country of origin will be at start of
production.

AAMA also stated that the proposed requirements would not provide manufacturers the data necessary to determine
engine and transmission country of origin because they do not specify separate (as well as combined) U.S. and Canadian
content for transmission and engine items of equipment. Information on a combined basis is needed for items one and
two of the label; information on a separate basis is needed for items four and five of the label. Ford stated that since
it is not always known if an item of equipment is going to be installed on an engine or transmission, and to reduce complexity,
the separate and combined U.S. and Canadian content data should be obtained for all items of equipment. That manufacturer
stated that this would also permit the basic information collected from suppliers to support Labeling Act requirements
to be used for other reporting and analysis purposes.

A number of manufacturers argued that because carlines are not introduced on a rigid schedule, it would be difficult
or impossible for suppliers to adhere to the proposed timing schedule. AAMA stated that suppliers and manufacturers
should be allowed flexibility to establish their own internal guidelines.

Nissan stated that since vehicle model changeovers may occur at varying times throughout the year, it urges NHTSA
to specify that supplier content reporting requirement dates be negotiated by contract among suppliers and manufacturers
rather than a date prescribed by regulations. BMW stated that it believes exact dates for suppliers should be left
to agreements between the manufacturers and suppliers and, therefore, not included in the regulation. That company
noted that the manufacturer has ultimate responsibility to provide a label on the vehicle. BMW stated that the manufacturer
will require from its suppliers that information is received in a timely manner because without the information the
vehicle cannot be sold.

Other vehicle manufacturers, including Toyota and Honda, also emphasized the need for manufacturer flexibility
but stated that the agency's proposal to permit manufacturers and suppliers to conclude agreements specifying alternative
production periods and alternative times for providing the information to the manufacturer would provide the needed
flexibility.

APMA stated that if NHTSA adopts the AIAG format, requisite reporting would be jointly submitted by the outside supplier
to the allied supplier or manufacturer. That organization stated that if the AIAG format is not adopted, it recommends
(1) that a common reporting date be used for reporting to both allied suppliers and manufacturers, and (2) that an outside
supplier's obligation to report be conditioned on the receipt of at least 90 days advance written notice from an allied
supplier or manufacturer.

On the issue of supplier certifications, AAMA stated that since allied suppliers are wholly owned by the manufacturer,
the manufacturer has control over the information as well as the timing required from suppliers. It stated that the
information required of allied suppliers should be the same as for outside suppliers, but the certificate should
be optional.

Toyota stated that it believes that ``blanket certifications'' should be authorized for use where a supplier's parts
contain no U.S./Canadian content and where the country of origin of the equipment is indicated in ordinary business
records. 
After considering the comments concerning requirements for suppliers, NHTSA has decided to specify specific requirements
concerning the information suppliers must provide manufacturers and allied suppliers, but with some changes from
the proposal. First, the agency is persuaded by AAMA's comment that suppliers should only be required to provide content
data on those items of equipment requested by a manufacturer or its allied supplier. NHTSA is therefore specifying
that manufacturers must request the specified information from their suppliers for relevant motor vehicle equipment,
and that the suppliers must provide the specified information in response to such request (or a request from an allied
supplier). The agency believes that this approach offers two primary advantages: (1) Suppliers will not be required
to provide unnecessary information, i.e., information that would not be used for parts content calculations, and
(2) suppliers are less likely to have compliance problems from not knowing about the requirements of 49 CFR part 583
than in a situation where they did not receive a specific request for the required information. NHTSA also believes
that, as a practical matter, manufacturers would in any event need to be contacting suppliers concerning such things
as where to send the required information. 
NHTSA is also persuaded that it is unnecessary to specify any specific calendar dates for suppliers to provide the
information. The agency is simply specifying that manufacturers must request the information in time to enable them
to calculate the information required on the label. 
While the agency believes that it is generally appropriate to permit manufacturers and suppliers to work out timing
and other details among themselves, it believes that a few simple requirements are necessary for the benefit of outside
suppliers. Specifically, the agency is specifying the following requirements with respect to manufacturer and
allied supplier requests for content information from outside suppliers: (1) The requester must indicate that the
request is being made pursuant to 49 CFR part 583, and that the regulation is administered by the National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration, (2) the requester must indicate that 49 CFR part 583 requires outside suppliers to provide
specified information upon the request of a manufacturer or allied supplier to which it supplies passenger motor
vehicle equipment and that, to the best of the requester's knowledge, the outside supplier is required to provide
the requested information, (3) if any information other than that required by 49 CFR part 583 is requested, the requester
must indicate which information is required by 49 CFR part 583 and which is not, and (4) the requester must indicate
that 49 CFR part 583 specifies that while information may be requested by an earlier date, the outside supplier is not
required to provide the information until the date specified by the requester or the date 45 days after receipt of the
request, whichever is later. The agency is not specifying the specific language by which requesters must provide
this information. 
Since compliance by an outside supplier with 49 CFR part 583 is based upon providing information in response to a request
from a manufacturer or allied supplier, the agency believes these requirements are necessary to protect outside
suppliers. The requirements ensure that an outside supplier is aware that it is required by Federal regulation to
provide the requested information, and that it knows the citation for the regulation and the agency which administers
it. The requirements also ensure that outside suppliers will, in the event they receive requests for more information
than that required by 49 CFR part 583, know which information is required by the regulation and which is not. Finally,
the requirements ensure that outside suppliers will have adequate time to respond to the request. NHTSA notes that
APMA recommended that the regulation specify notice of at least 90 days. However, that organization did not justify
that amount of time. The agency believes that 45 days provides ample time, since today's final rule puts outside suppliers
on notice that, from now on, they must provide the specified content information in response to requests from manufacturers
and allied suppliers. 
NHTSA believes that similar requirements are unnecessary to protect allied suppliers, given that allied suppliers
are wholly owned by vehicle manufacturers. Also, any specific timing requirements as to when allied suppliers must
provide requested information would be more complicated, since allied suppliers may need to request information
of outside suppliers in order to provide the requested information. 
With respect to AAMA's comment that certifications should be optional for allied suppliers, NHTSA notes that section
210(d) specifies that regulations ``shall include provisions applicable to outside and allied suppliers to require
such suppliers to certify whether a component provided by such suppliers is United States, U.S./Canadian or foreign
* * *.'' Therefore, the agency does not have the discretion to make certifications optional. NHTSA also observes that
while allied suppliers are owned by manufacturers, they are nonetheless separate entities with independent legal
obligations. 
Given this statutory provision, the agency also cannot permit the use of ordinary business records instead of specific
certifications from suppliers, as recommended by Toyota. The agency notes, however, that a certification can cover
multiple items of equipment and can be part of documents containing other information. Suppliers may be able to incorporate
the certification into other business records that they provide manufacturers. 
The agency does not accept AAMA's suggestion that supplier estimates of price, content and origin for unique type
of equipment not be based on a period of time generally corresponding to the model year for which content calculations
are to be made. Estimates that are based on current production or on the start of production might be very different
from what the supplier anticipates for the model year as a whole. For example, a supplier might plan to manufacture
a part in both the United States and overseas, and to begin production in one place slightly before the other place.
In such an instance, an estimate based on start of production would not be meaningful. In order to ensure meaningful
label information, NHTSA believes that estimates must be for an overall production period that corresponds to the
relevant model year. The agency emphasizes, however, that suppliers are only required to provide good faith estimates
and are not prevented from making subsequent changes in price, content and origin for their equipment.

The final rule clarifies that suppliers are required to provide both separate and combined information concerning
the U.S. and Canadian content of parts that may be used in engines or transmissions. With respect to Ford's suggestion
that separate U.S. and Canadian content information be required for all equipment, NHTSA notes that it would be inappropriate
for the regulation to require suppliers to provide information that is not relevant to Labeling Act requirements.
However, manufacturers are free to request suppliers to provide such information outside the context of 49 CFR part
583. 
The agency notes that additional issues related to supplier certifications are discussed below in the section entitled
``Recordkeeping Requirements; Supplier Certifications.'' 


E. Requirements for Dealers
 


NHTSA proposed to require dealers to maintain the label on each vehicle until the vehicle is sold to a consumer. The
agency noted in the NPRM that AIADA had submitted a comment on the request for comments arguing that dealers should
be permitted to remove the label from a vehicle if state law requires it, such as when dealers are operating demonstrator
vehicles, or when dealers move cars in an intra-dealer exchange. AIADA had also recommended that dealers be permitted
to affix duplicate labels in the event that the manufacturer-supplied label becomes torn or otherwise mutilated.

NHTSA addressed this issue as follows in the NPRM: 



NHTSA has tentatively concluded that dealers should not be permitted to remove the label for any reason before sale
to a consumer. The agency believes that it is appropriate to treat this label in same manner as Monroney and fuel economy
labels, since all three labels are intended to provide information to aid consumers in making their purchase decision.
Neither the EPA or Department of Justice permit dealers to remove fuel economy or Monroney labels, even temporarily,
prior to sale to a consumer. The Department of Justice has advised that neither the Monroney nor fuel economy labeling
statutes contain exceptions for situations in which labels purportedly constitute safety hazards in demonstrator
cars (i.e., those cars that dealers allow potential customers to test drive), and went on to state that it was unaware
of any judicial interpretations that would create such exceptions. Section 210 is similar to the other two labeling
statutes in that it does not grant NHTSA the authority to permit dealers to remove the label. Indeed, section 210(b)(1)
states explicitly that each dealer shall cause the label required by this Act to be maintained on the vehicle. 
NHTSA is also concerned that, if dealers were permitted to remove labels for demonstrator vehicles, consumers would
not have the labeling information available to them at a crucial time in their purchasing decision, i.e., the time
they were evaluating a vehicle for purchase. In addition, the labels might be re-attached inadvertently to the wrong
vehicle or not re-attached at all. 
The Department of Justice has advised that most manufacturers have been applying Monroney and fuel economy labels
to the rear left windows of vehicles, and affixing the vehicles with labels that do not easily tear or loosen from the
windows to which they are attached. Such placement does not ordinarily interfere with the driver's vision in the event
of a test drive or other similar purpose. Additionally, the dealer could not easily remove the label, even for temporary
purposes, without tearing or destroying it. 
NHTSA will not, therefore, propose to permit dealers to remove labels for any reason prior to a first sale to a consumer,
with one exception: the agency agrees with the AIADA that it is necessary for dealers to replace any label that becomes
mutilated or otherwise damaged prior to sale to a consumer so that the information is no longer legible. 58 FR 61053.

As discussed earlier in this preamble, NADA argued that existing labels including the Monroney and fuel economy labels
create safety concerns for vehicles which are test driven prior to their delivery to first purchasers, because the
labels obstruct visibility. Noting that the agency indicated in the NPRM that dealers would not be allowed to remove
a parts content label except in the event that it becomes mutilated or damaged, that organization urged the agency
to prohibit the placement of separate parts content labels on vehicle windows. NADA stated that the final rule should
specify that dealers may remove labels prior to sale when instructed by a manufacturer to replace them with substitutes
containing updated or corrected information. AIADA repeated its earlier argument that dealers should be permitted
to remove the label from a vehicle if state law requires it, such as when dealers are operating demonstrator vehicles,
or when dealers move cars in an intra-dealer exchange. 

After considering the comments, NHTSA has concluded that there is no basis to change its view, discussed in the NPRM,
that section 210 prohibits temporary removal of labels for test drives. The Justice Department concurs in this view.
Section 210 specifically requires each dealer to ``cause to be maintained, 

on each such vehicle

,'' the required label. (Emphasis added.) Therefore, the required label must be maintained by dealers ``on each * * *
vehicle.'' Moreover, the similarity of the language in section 210 for the content label with that for the Monroney
and fuel economy labels indicates that the same result should be obtained. The commenters did not present any legal
analysis challenging the legal analysis presented in the NPRM or suggesting that the Justice Department analysis
is incorrect. 

The final rule does clarify that dealers may replace labels with substitutes containing corrected information when
instructed to do so by a manufacturer. It is unnecessary to specify that labels may be replaced for updated information,
since the information specified on the label is not subject to change (except for purposes of correction). 



F. Authority To Exclude Vehicles With Low or High U.S./Canadian Content



NHTSA stated in the NPRM that, for vehicles with less than 35 percent U.S./Canadian content, it was considering providing
manufacturers with the option of simply stating that the percentage U.S./Canadian content is ``minimal'' instead
of determining and providing the precise amount of such content. The agency addressed this issue as follows in the
NPRM: 




Several manufacturers requested more limited labeling requirements for manufacturers of new passenger motor vehicles
that contain minimal U.S./Canadian content. In effect, the label would state that the vehicle contained less than
a certain percentage of U.S./Canadian content. It would also state the final assembly point, and the country of origin
of the engine and transmission. 

Volvo suggested the simplified procedure be implemented for imported vehicles containing under 15 percent U.S./Canadian
content. The AAMA agreed with the 15 percent level, stating that Congress appeared to indicate that higher percentages
of U.S./Canadian content were significant for purposes of labeling. Volkswagen and the AIAM, however, suggested
a level of 35 percent, stating that lower levels would not affect enough vehicles to make implementation of the special
provisions worthwhile. Lamborghini, in its testimony at the public meeting in December 1992, suggested a cutoff
of 20 percent. 

As a practical matter, NHTSA agrees that once the domestic content gets below a certain point, the precise amount of
that content becomes immaterial, 

i.e

., the vehicle is foreign and small differences in domestic content are not likely to be relevant to consumer purchasing
decisions. 

Therefore, for vehicles with less than 35 percent U.S./Canadian content, the agency is considering providing manufacturers
with the option of simply stating that the percentage U.S./Canadian content is ``minimal'' instead of determining
and providing the precise amount of such content. 

The primary benefit of this option would be to eliminate manufacturer costs associated with keeping precise records
and making precise calculations about the U.S./Canadian content of a vehicle, when the manufacturer knows such content
is very low. Under this option, manufacturers would still be required to provide items 2, 3, 4, and 5 of the label, 

i.e.

, major foreign sources of vehicle equipment, place of final assembly and countries of origin of the engine/transmission.
58 FR 61053-54. 




However, NHTSA also noted that such an option would represent a limited exclusion from one of section 210's labeling
requirements. The agency stated that as part of considering this option, as well as possible special requirements
discussed below for multi-stage and low volume manufacturers, it was in the process of determining whether it had
authority to provide limited exclusions from section 210's labeling requirements. NHTSA stated that it would complete
its evaluation before reaching a final decision about possible exclusions. 58 FR 61054.

In commenting on the NPRM, AAMA stated that it supported a limited exclusion for vehicles with low U.S./Canadian parts
content, although at a 15 percent content level rather than 35 percent. AAMA also stated that since the agency ``has
implied that it has the authority to set a minimal level for the U.S. and Canadian content which removes a recordkeeping
burden on the low end of content, it urged that such relief also be provided for the high end of content. That organization
recommended that, for carlines with more than 85 percent U.S./Canadian content, manufacturers be permitted to specify
the content as ``at least'' 85 percent instead of specifying a percentage. 

The foreign vehicle manufacturers strongly supported a limited exclusion for vehicles with low U.S./Canadian parts
content. However, several of them argued that unless the agency also permits a limited exclusion from providing the
information required for item two of the label, i.e., the percentage parts content originating from major sources
of foreign content, there would be only a minimal benefit from an exclusion from specifying the percentage U.S./Canadian
parts content. This is because the foreign manufacturers would have to collect detailed information from most of
their suppliers to calculate the information for item two of the label. The foreign manufacturers suggested various
alternative approaches, such as requiring them to specify the countries that constitute major sources of foreign
content but not the percentages from such countries. 

Since publishing the NPRM, the agency has completed the analysis of its authority to provide exclusions from the Labeling
Act requirements. For reasons which are summarized below, NHTSA has concluded that it does not have the authority
to provide exclusions from the express statutory labeling requirements for either vehicles with low U.S./Canadian
content or vehicles with high U.S./Canadian content. As discussed in the next section of this preamble, however,
the agency may provide limited exclusions for multi-stage manufacturers and low volume manufacturers, based on
the 

de minimis

 doctrine. 

As discussed above, the Labeling Act expressly requires manufacturers to label each vehicle with five items of information:
(1) The ``

percentage

'' U.S./Canadian parts content; (2) the names of foreign countries providing at least 15 percent of the parts content
and the ``

percentage

'' for each such country; (3) final assembly point; and (4) and (5) countries of origin for the engine and transmission.
Items (1) and (2) are calculated on a ``carline'' basis. See section 210(b)(1). 

There is a limit to the degree of precision in the percentages required by the Labeling Act. Section 210(b)(2) provides
that ``[t]he percentages required to be indicated by this section may be rounded to the nearest 5 percent by the manufacturers.''


To implement these and other requirements, section 210(d) requires the Secretary to: 




Promulgate such regulations as may be necessary to carry out this section * * * Such regulations shall
provide to the ultimate purchaser of a new passenger motor vehicle the best and most understandable information possible
about the foreign and U.S./Canada origin of the equipment of such vehicles without imposing costly and unnecessary
burdens on the manufacturers. 




The Labeling Act does not provide any express authority to create exclusions from the statutory requirements which
apply to vehicle manufacturers. NHTSA notes that while section 210(d) provides that the regulations must not impose
costly and unnecessary burdens on manufacturers, this is not an invitation for the agency to second-guess Congress
about the requirements it has established regarding the specific content information which must be provided to consumers.
As a matter of statutory construction, the agency notes that general provisions cannot be construed as overriding
specific ones. Since all of the exclusions identified above are inconsistent with the statutory language, the relevant
legal question is whether NHTSA has implied authority to create the exclusions notwithstanding such language. 

Where a statute does not provide express authority to create exclusions, there are only two circumstances recognized
by the courts in which an agency has implied authority to create exclusions. The first is administrative need, related
to an agency's inability to carry out a mandate fully, and the second is 

de minimis

 circumstances, where following the plain meaning of a statute would lead to ``absurd or futile results'' or to ``a
gain of trivial or no value.'' The courts indicate that both bases for exclusions from the clear command of a statute
are disfavored and that agencies bear a strong burden of proof in attempting to show that adhering to a statute would
have the effects described above. 

Since exclusions are not necessary for the agency to carry out its mandate, the only relevant issue is whether the exclusions
can be justified on the 

de minimis

 theory. The exclusions cannot be justified if non-trivial benefits are provided by a regulation in those circumstances.


NHTSA has concluded that it does not have authority to provide the above-discussed exclusions from the express statutory
labeling requirements for either vehicles with low U.S./Canadian content or vehicles with high U.S./Canadian content
because the exclusions would permit the labels on a substantial portion of the vehicles sold to provide the consumer
with significantly less information than Congress intended, thereby eliminating much of the benefit that the Labeling
Act was intended to provide. 

For example, a ``low-end'' exclusion would permit a large percentage of foreign vehicles to be labeled with the words
``minimal'' or less than 35 percent (or some other specified percentage) U.S./Canadian content, instead of being
labeled with a specific percentage. Consumers would not know whether vehicles bearing such labels contained (on
a carline basis) 0 percent, about 15 percent, or possibly even nearly 35 percent U.S./Canadian content. A consumer
wishing to make a purchase decision among vehicles bearing such labels would not be able to compare their U.S./Canadian
content. Similarly, a ``high-end'' exclusion would permit most domestic vehicles to be labeled with the words ``greater
than 85% U.S./Canadian content.'' A consumer wishing to make a purchase decision among vehicles bearing such labels
would not be able to compare their U.S./Canadian content. 

NHTSA notes that section 210(b)(2) allows rounding of the percentages, but limits the rounding ``to the nearest five
percent.'' This indicates that specific percentages must be listed (since general percentages aren't amenable
to rounding) and that any rounding to a greater degree is prohibited. In this regard, it is particularly important
to note that the degree of permissible rounding permitted by the enacted version of section 210 is significantly less
than the degree that would have been permitted in the introduced version. In the introduced version, rounding would
have been permitted to the nearest 10 percent. The enacted version permits rounding only to the nearest 5 percent.
Thus, Congress focused particular attention on the issue of rounding and decided to adopt strict limits. Moreover,
implicit in the enacted rounding provision is a judgment by Congress that differences in content of as little as five
percentage points are significant enough to be considered by the consumer.

As discussed above, several foreign vehicle manufacturers requested an exclusion from the statutory requirement
to specify the percentage parts content originating from major sources of foreign content. Volkswagen stated that
its recommendation for such an exclusion is ``consistent with the intent of the original bill,'' but recognized that
the statutory requirement to list the percentage parts content originating from major sources of foreign content
was added by the House/Senate Conference Committee. Volkswagen argued that ``the Committee did not appear to have
assigned great importance to the inclusion of foreign sourced parts percentages.'' 
NHTSA notes that it must implement a statute as finally passed by the Congress, and not an earlier version that was not
passed. Moreover, the agency must follow the plain meaning of a statute and cannot ignore express statutory requirements
based on a belief that a Congressional committee may not have assigned great importance to a particular requirement.
The committee, and ultimately the Congress, thought the requirement at issue was important enough to pass into law.
Congress decided that prospective purchasers should know the percentage parts content that originated from major
sources of foreign content. This particular requirement primarily applies to foreign vehicles, since domestic
vehicles are less likely to have major sources of foreign content. Yet, the exclusions recommended by the foreign
manufacturers would permit a large percentage of foreign vehicles to labeled without this information. Such exclusions
cannot be considered 

de minimis. 

The agency does observe that the additional flexibility it is providing with respect to how country of origin is determined
for purposes of item 2 of the label should help reduce manufacturer costs in this area. 



G. Multi-Stage Manufacturers and Small Businesses



NHTSA proposed to exclude multi-stage manufacturers of ``carlines'' of fewer than 1,000 vehicles from providing
items 1 and 2 of the label (the two items that are determined on a carline basis). However, these manufacturers would
be required to provide items 3, 4 and 5 of the label. Similarly, the agency proposed to apply the same limited requirements
to businesses that produce a total of fewer than 1,000 passenger motor vehicles for sale in the United States annually.


The agency explained that the concept of carline is largely meaningless for many multi-stage manufacturers. Many
of the vehicles made in the multi-stage process are highly specialized, and are often built to order. A ``carline''
in this instance could consist of only several vehicles. The agency stated that it did not believe that Congress had
this situation in mind when it defined carline. Moreover, to the extent that vehicles are built to order, prospective
purchasers may not be able to inspect a content label prior to making a purchase decision. NHTSA also stated in the NPRM
that it believes that the same arguments made concerning multi-stage manufacturers, regarding carlines with a minimal
number a vehicles produced annually, can be made in a discussion of small businesses. 

In its discussion of multi-stage vehicles, the agency noted that alterers are not covered by section 210 for reasons
similar to those discussed above concerning dealer and port-installed options. Alterers modify completed vehicles,
after they have left the manufacturer's final assembly point. The parts they use are not considered equipment by section
210 of the Cost Savings Act, because they are never shipped to the final assembly point. Their modifications cannot
affect carline-basis calculations made before the start of the model year, and cannot be known in advance of the model
year by the manufacturer. 

NTEA stated that it agrees with agency's tentative determination that the label on vehicles produced in multiple
stages should differ from the label on mass produced vehicles. It also stated that it is confident the agency has authority
under the Labeling Act to promulgate different rules, and believes the Act could be interpreted to allow even a full
exclusion for multi-stage vehicles. NTEA stated that requiring small business multi-stage manufacturers to calculate
U.S./Canadian versus foreign percentages would be extremely burdensome in both an economic and practical sense
as they would need to do so on a per vehicle basis. That organization added that any ancillary reporting or recordkeeping
requirements would also need to be done on a per vehicle basis. NTEA noted that the proposed multi-stage rules would
require information on final assembly point and place of manufacture of the engine and transmission. That commenter
stated that this would allow a consumer to know where the vehicle was built and whether the most valuable individual
mechanical components, the engine and transmission, are of foreign or domestic origin. NTEA also stated that the
burden on small business multi-stage manufacturers would be minimal. 

AIAM stated that it applauds NHTSA's recognition of providing some regulatory relief to small automotive manufacturers.
It suggested that the agency expand the proposed exclusion for small manufacturers from fewer than 1,000 vehicles
to fewer than 2,500 vehicles. That organization stated that this would provide relief from the costly burdens the
Act imposes on additional small manufacturers without depriving consumers of information deemed necessary by the
Act. 

Coachmen stated that the ``concessions'' made in the NPRM fall far short of what was requested by RVIA in commenting
on the request for comments. Coachmen argued that the proposed requirements would impose an undue and costly and unnecessary
burden on Coachmen. It recommended that the final rule should exclude carlines of less than 20,000 per year, exclude
recreation vehicle manufacturers and van converters, or, as a less desirable alternative, provide simplified and
less costly compliance recordkeeping and reporting requirements based on using the information provided solely
by the original vehicle manufacturer on a pass through basis. Coachmen stated that it has several divisions, some
of which are final stage manufacturers and others van converters. It stated that the process of documenting and re-computing
percentage of domestic content of vehicles would require large amounts of paperwork, additional labor and possible
delays in shipments, but result in a minuscule change in the original vehicle manufacturer's domestic content.

Coachmen stated that the motor vehicles it receives for further manufacture are supplied by the Big Three, which Coachmen
assumed would have a domestic content label affixed to the incomplete vehicle. That company argued that individual
per unit costs of implementation would be significantly higher than for the Big Three, creating a competitive disadvantage.
Coachmen argued that the intent of the legislation relates to large volume producers, and that regulations should
not be extended to multi-stage manufacturers, final stage manufacturers or van converters. That company stated
that in addition to the interpretation as to the types of vehicles to be included, the issue of what constitutes a carline
should be redefined. Coachmen stated that by using the figure of 1,000 vehicles per year as the upper limit of applicability,
NHTSA has not considered the intent of the legislation. Coachmen noted that it has a van conversion division whose
annual production is a small fraction of the total market but does exceed the 1,000 unit limit by a considerable amount.


After considering the comments, NHTSA has decided to exclude all final stage manufacturers, as well as all businesses
that produce a total of fewer than 1,000 passenger motor vehicles for sale in the United States annually, from providing
items 1 and 2 of the label (the two items that are determined on a carline basis). However, these manufacturers are required
to provide items 3, 4 and 5 of the label. 

The agency believes that these exclusions are justified on the 

de minimis 

theory, i.e., only trivial additional benefits would be provided by not adopting the exclusions. First, NHTSA believes
that the total number of vehicles affected by the exclusions is less than one percent of the vehicles covered by the
statutory requirements. This is very different than the ``low end'' and ``high end'' exclusions considered above,
which would each affect a large percentage of total vehicles. Second, these exclusions largely affect vehicles which
are likely to be made to order and for which consumers would often not be able to inspect a label prior to making a purchase
decision. Thus, even if full labeling information was provided for these vehicles, it often could not be used by consumers
in making purchase decisions.

NHTSA disagrees with AIAM's suggestion that the exclusion for small manufacturers be changed to apply to manufacturers
which produce fewer than 1,000 vehicles to ones which produce fewer than 2,500 vehicles. As discussed above, the agency's
implied authority to provide exclusions from express statutory requirements is very limited. It is the agency's
judgment that the proposed limit is sufficient to cover small manufacturers which are likely to only produce vehicles
to order and for which consumers are unlikely to be able to inspect a vehicle label (e.g., on a demonstrator vehicle)
prior to making a purchase decision. Moreover, the concerns about carline determinations being made for only a few
vehicles are not likely to be relevant. In short, the agency believes that AIAM's recommended exclusion cannot be
justified on the 

de minimis 

theory. Extending the scope of the exclusion would unnecessarily deny prospective vehicle purchasers relevant
content information that Congress decided they should have. 

For the same reasons, NHTSA is not adopting Coachmen's recommendation that the final rule exclude carlines of less
than 20,000 per year and exclude recreation vehicle manufacturers, i.e., the exclusions would unnecessarily deny
prospective vehicle purchasers relevant content information that Congress decided they should have. With respect
to that company's recommendation that the final rule exclude van converters, NHTSA notes that many van converters
are excluded as a result of being alterers. 

However, NHTSA has decided to exclude all final stage manufacturers from the requirements to provide items 1 and 2
on the label, rather than limiting the exclusion to multi-stage manufacturers of ``carlines'' of fewer than 1,000
vehicles. The reason for this relates both to the relatively small number of multi-stage vehicles subject to the Labeling
Act requirements and the fact that key statutory definitions relevant to parts content calculations do not appear
to contemplate vehicles manufactured in more than one stage. 

As discussed above, section 210 defines ``final assembly point'' as ``the plant, factory, or other place at which
a new passenger motor vehicle is produced or assembled by a manufacturer and from which such vehicle is delivered to
a dealer or importer in such a condition that all component parts necessary to the mechanical operation of such automobile
are included with such vehicle * * *.'' Moreover, section 210 provides that costs incurred at or beyond
the final assembly point are not included in parts content calculations. 

For multi-stage vehicles, it is not clear from the statutory definition whether ``final assembly point'' refers
to the place where an incomplete vehicle is assembled or to the place of final stage manufacture. Regardless of which
location is considered to be the point of final assembly, problems can occur in applying the statutory requirements.


Assume, for example, the possibility of considering the place where the incomplete vehicle is assembled as the final
assembly point. An incomplete vehicle includes, as a minimum, a frame and chassis structure, power train, steering
system, suspension system, and braking system, to the extent that those systems are to be part of the completed vehicle.
See 49 CFR Part 568. It might have all component parts necessary for mechanical operation. However, the vehicle is
not delivered to a dealer or importer from the plant where the incomplete vehicle is assembled. Moreover, a large number
of the vehicle's parts may not be included at this time. 

Assume instead the possibility of considering the place of final stage manufacture as the final assembly point. It
might be argued that the incomplete vehicle manufacturer should be considered an outside supplier of passenger motor
vehicle equipment. However, section 210 defines passenger motor vehicle equipment as ``any system, subassembly,
or component received at the final vehicle assembly point for installation on, or attachment to, such vehicle * * *.''
An incomplete vehicle does not fit this definition. Moreover, if the incomplete vehicle manufacturer were considered
an outside supplier of equipment, the bulk of final assembly costs (of the incomplete vehicle) would be included in
parts content calculations, a result that is clearly inconsistent with Congressional intent.

It might be possible for NHTSA to develop an alternative approach to solve these problems, such as considering the
place where the incomplete vehicle is manufactured and the place of final stage manufacture to both be final assembly
points. However, any such approach would be complicated and itself require a departure from the express statutory
language. Given that the total number of multi-stage vehicles subject to the Labeling Act is relatively small and
the fact that the statutory definitions do not appear to contemplate vehicles manufactured in more than one stage,
the agency believes it is appropriate to simply exclude all such vehicles from the requirements related to items 1
and 2 of the label. 

Final stage manufacturers are required to provide items 3, 4 and 5 of the label. The agency is specifying, for purposes
of item 3 of the label, that the final assembly point for multi-stage vehicles is the location where the incomplete
vehicle is assembled. The agency is specifying this location because, unlike the location of final manufacture,
it will always involve significant final assembly operations. 



H. Recordkeeping Requirements; Supplier Certifications



Section 210(d) provides that the agency must promulgate such regulations as may be necessary to carry out section
210, including regulations to establish a procedure to verify the required labeling information, and regulations
applicable to outside and allied suppliers to require such suppliers to certify whether a component provided by such
suppliers is United States, U.S./Canadian or foreign. As discussed in the NPRM, in order to verify the information
provided on labels, NHTSA contemplates that it would conduct, on an occasional basis, an audit of the information
provided on a label. Such an audit would involve requiring the vehicle manufacturer to provide the agency with the
manufacturer's basis for the information it provided on the label, e.g., all relevant certifications from suppliers,
a listing of parts, cost information, and all calculations used by the manufacturer to derive the information provided
on the label. NHTSA would check whether the manufacturer's methodology was consistent with agency regulations.
The agency would similarly require individual suppliers to provide the basis for the information and certification
that they provided manufacturers or allied suppliers. 

In order to ensure that the agency can conduct such an audit, as well as otherwise enforce the labeling requirements,
NHTSA proposed to require manufacturers to maintain all records which provide a basis for the information they provide
on labels, and to similarly require suppliers to maintain records providing the basis for the information and certification
they provide to manufacturers or allied suppliers. Noting that EPA requires fuel economy records to be retained for
five years after the model year to which they relate, NHTSA proposed to require manufacturers to maintain records
for five years after December 31 of the model year to which the records relate, and to require suppliers to maintain
records, which form a basis for the information they provide to manufacturers or allied suppliers, for six years after
December 31 of the calendar year set forth in their submissions to manufacturers/allied suppliers. 

NHTSA also addressed the issue of whether manufacturers should have the option of maintaining records electronically.
The agency stated that it believes manufacturers and allied suppliers should retain the original copies of information
provided by suppliers, but sought comment on whether to allow them to retain the certifications and other information
obtained from suppliers electronically, specifically in the form of electronic images. NHTSA proposed to permit
manufacturers and suppliers to maintain all other records in either paper or electronic form for purposes of data
storage, provided that in every case all of the information contained in the record is retained. 

Numerous commenters argued that certifications and other information should be permitted to be submitted to manufacturers/allied
suppliers electronically, as well as stored electronically. AAMA stated that it objects to manufacturers receiving
and maintaining original copies of certificates. That organization stated that with the enactment of the Customs
Modernization Act, GM, Ford and Chrysler are developing process to collect all content and customs data electronically.
Ford argued that electronic storage is more efficient and cost effective and is consistent with the recently signed
Customs Automation Act. 

Toyota also recommended against any requirement to obtain or retain actual paper certificates. It stated that the
rules should allow all required records to be retained electronically. APMA stated that the proposed requirements
to require suppliers to generate paper originals for certificates would be burdensome and impede the spread of EDI.
That organization stated that the adoption of the AIAG/EDI package into the content reporting requirements under
NAFTA is expected to begin in 1995. It recommended that all records be allowed to be kept in any medium. 

Honda stated that it supports the proposal to require written certifications by suppliers to manufacturers. 

Nissan stated that it believes that a five to six year retention period is excessive. It suggested a retention period
for manufacturers of three years after December 31 of the model year to which records relate, and, for suppliers, a
retention period of four years after December 31 of the calendar year set forth in the certificate. 

After considering the comments, NHTSA has decided to permit certifications and other records to be submitted and
retained electronically. The agency believes that this is consistent with the approach being taken by the Federal
government in related areas, and with section 210's requirement to establish regulations that avoid imposing unnecessary
and costly burdens on the manufacturers. 

NHTSA has also decided to require records to be maintained for the periods proposed in the NPRM. As discussed above,
these requirements ensure that records are maintained for five years after the end of the model year to which they relate.
The agency disagrees with Nissan that the retention period is excessive. A possible audit of the information provided
on a label could take substantial time, particularly given the need to trace the information back to suppliers. NHTSA
also notes that the cost of maintaining records is substantially reduced to the extent that manufacturers use electronic
means. 



I. Reporting Requirements 



NHTSA proposed to require vehicle manufacturers to submit to the agency three copies of the information that will
appear on each carline's label. The agency proposed to require submittal of this information for each carline not
later than the date the first vehicle of the carline is delivered to dealers for that model year.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940721-0-00076 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940721-0-00014 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The agency stated that it believes this reporting requirement is necessary for several reasons. It would provide
one central location from which information can be gathered concerning the labels. Inquiries could come from within
the agency, or from interested members of the public. In addition, such reporting would aid the agency in deciding
whether to initiate any investigations or audits. 

The agency received several comments on the proposed reporting requirements. AAMA stated that the proposed requirements
should be modified to require submittal of information not later than the date the first vehicle of the carline is offered
for sale to the ultimate purchaser. Isuzu suggested that flexibility be introduced to permit manufacturers to submit
a report whenever a major specification change has been made in the middle of a model year or whenever the manufacturer
opts to change the model year at a timing different from normally accepted model year changes. NTEA stated that it understands
that small multi-stage businesses are not subject to the reporting requirements unless they produce carlines of
over 1,000 vehicles. 

After considering the comments, the agency has decided to adopt reporting requirements along the line of the proposal,
but to require submittal of information not later than the date the first vehicle of the carline is offered for sale
to the ultimate purchaser. This date will be adequate for the agency's purposes in monitoring the information on the
labels. Moreover, this date is consistent with the agency's decision, discussed above, not to require labels to be
placed on vehicles prior to the introduction date. 

The agency cannot provide flexibility to permit manufacturers to update labels during a model year, since section
210(b) provides that content percentages are ``established at the beginning of each model year for such carline and
shall be applicable to that carline for the entire model year.'' There is therefore no reason to provide flexibility
with respect to reporting updated information. However, if a manufacturer discovers an error in the information
reported to the agency, it should send information to the agency correcting that error. 

NHTSA agrees with NTEA that any manufacturer that is not required to provide information on a carline basis, i.e.,
items one and two on the label, is not subject to the reporting requirements. 



J. Leadtime/First Year Requirements



A number of manufacturers and suppliers argued that they cannot comply with all the data collection and calculation
requirements by the October 1994 implementation date. AAMA stated that the proposed regulation will require extensive
data collection and calculation requirements, and that there are several areas of uncertainty that will not be resolved
until a final rule is issued. It stated that it has been working in conjunction with the AIAG and a number of suppliers
to establish processes to comply with the law, but has been unable to complete this activity because of uncertainties
about the final rule. AAMA stated that manufacturers and suppliers will not be able to comply with all the data collection
and calculation requirements by October 1994. It requested NHTSA to allow manufacturers and suppliers to use procedures
that are expected to yield similar results for at least 12 months after the final rule is published. 

GM stated that because of the scope of the effort to comply with the new requirements, at least one year is required between
the publication of the final rule and the effective date of the rule. That manufacturer stated that it supports the
interim AAMA proposal of making a best efforts determination of domestic and foreign content for the AALA required
label using presently available CAFE cost and origin data for the first year after publication of the final rule. 

Ford submitted a comment along the lines of that of AAMA. It also provided NHTSA with a copy of an EPA final rule, published
in February 1993, which established labeling requirements for products manufactured with certain ozone-depleting
substances. EPA stated in the preamble for that final rule that it recognized the practical problems the regulated
community would have in meeting a May 15, 1993 statutory deadline for labeling, ``given the late publication of this
rule.'' 58 FR 8136, February 11, 1993. EPA stated that ``(a)s a result of the concerns, it is the Agency's policy to take
no enforcement action for matters occurring during the first nine months following the publication of these regulations.''


BMW stated that if NHTSA does not permit manufacturers a permanent alternative of using existing, substantial business
records to make parts content calculations, it should allow such an alternative on an interim basis in lieu of granting
additional leadtime. 

Calsonic stated that the proposed leadtime for suppliers was extremely short and requested postponement of at least
a year. Nippondenso also stated that the proposed leadtime for suppliers was short, and requested that the effective
date of the regulations be postponed for at least six months. 

After considering the comments, NHTSA agrees, given the complexity of the data collection and calculation requirements,
that it is impossible for manufacturers and suppliers to fully comply with all of the requirements by October 1, 1994.
The agency notes that this conclusion is partly based on the fact that manufacturers cannot complete their calculations
until they receive specified information from suppliers, and allied suppliers cannot complete their calculations
until they receive specified information from outside suppliers. The conclusion is also partly based on the fact
that many of the requirements are in the regulation as opposed to section 210, i.e., manufacturers and suppliers could
not comply with the data collection and calculation requirements absent a final rule. 

NHTSA is nonetheless faced with the section 210(b) requirement that labels be provided on each vehicle manufactured
on or after October 1, 1994. The agency agrees with AAMA that the most appropriate means for resolving this problem
is to permit manufacturers and suppliers to use procedures that are expected to yield similar results, for about a
year. The agency believes that this temporary alternative will ensure that consumers receive the best information
possible about the foreign and U.S./Canada origin of vehicles they are considering purchasing during this period,
given that full compliance by manufacturers and suppliers is not possible. NHTSA has decided to adopt the following
specific requirement:

 


For model year 1995 and model year 1996 carlines which are first offered for sale to ultimate purchasers before June
1, 1995, manufacturers and suppliers may, instead of following the calculation procedures set forth in this part,
use procedures that they expect, in good faith, to yield similar results.

 


NHTSA notes several things about this temporary alternative approach. First, it is available for all model year 1995
vehicles and for any model year 1996 vehicles which are introduced before June 1, 1995. The agency selected the June
1, 1995 date because it ensures manufacturers additional flexibility for about a one-year period. NHTSA notes that
since most model year 1996 vehicles will be introduced in the fall of 1995, manufacturers will have additional flexibility
for early introductions (a model year 1996 vehicle could be introduced as early as January 1995, for which full compliance
might not be possible), but will need to meet the full requirements for the vast majority of model year 1996 vehicles.

<TEXT>
 

Second, manufacturers may use any procedures that they expect, in good faith, to yield ``similar results.'' For example,
the manufacturers could use the CAFE procedures for making content determinations so long as they made adjustments
to attempt to account for differences between the CAFE content requirements and Labeling Act requirements, e.g.,
CAFE does not exclude assembly, sales, and marketing costs. 

Third, manufacturers may choose to rely entirely on information they already have in their possession or, at their
option, obtain additional information from some suppliers to help them make the necessary calculations. To the extent
that manufacturers are following this alternative approach, their suppliers may as well. 

NHTSA notes that Nissan asked, in a telephone call to NHTSA's Office of Chief Counsel, how the Labeling Act requirements
apply to MY 1994 vehicles that are manufactured on or after October 1, 1994. As discussed below, it is the agency's opinion
that the Act's requirements do not apply to any MY 1994 vehicles. 

The first sentence of section 210(b)(1) reads as follows: ``Each manufacturer of a new passenger motor vehicle distributed
for commerce for sale in the United States 

shall annually establish for each model year 

and cause to be affixed * * * on each vehicle manufactured on or after October 1, 1994, in a prominent
place, one or more labels * * *.'' Section 210(b)(2) provides that the percentages required for the
label ``shall be established at the beginning of the model year * * *.'' With respect to the issue of
how the Labeling Act requirements apply to MY 1994 vehicles, NHTSA believes it is significant that: (1) The requirement
to label vehicles takes effect on the date traditionally considered to be the beginning of MY 1995 (October 1, 1994),
and (2) the percentages required to be included on the label are to be established at the 

beginning

 of the model year. Reading these provisions together, the agency believes that the statute requires the labeling
requirements to begin with MY 1995 vehicles, since the time when the percentages are to be established for that model
year corresponds to the effective date of the requirements. NHTSA notes that very few MY 1994 vehicles are likely to
be manufactured on or after October 1, 1994. 



K. Other Issues



1. Supplier Definitions 



Section 210(f)(15) defines 

allied supplier

 to mean ``a supplier of passenger motor vehicle equipment that is wholly owned by the manufacturer, or in the case of
a joint venture vehicle assembly arrangement, any supplier that is wholly owned by one member of the joint venture
arrangement.'' Section 210(17) defines 

outside supplier

 to mean ``a supplier of passenger motor vehicle equipment to a manufacturer's allied supplier or anyone other than
an allied supplier who ships directly to the manufacturer's final assembly point.''

NHTSA addressed several issues concerning the supplier definitions in the NPRM. In commenting on the request for
comments, Ford had asked that NHTSA consider a supplier owned jointly by more than one parent company as an allied supplier
of both parents, especially in situations such as those in Canada, in which the Canadian government has laws requiring
partial Canadian ownership of share. NHTSA stated that it believes that such a situation is akin to the joint venture
agreement mentioned in section 210(f)(15) of the Cost Savings Act. The agency tentatively decided to treat the supplier
in such a case as being wholly owned by one of the manufacturers in the joint venture agreement, and therefore an allied
supplier for purposes of any carline jointly manufactured. 

After further consideration, however, NHTSA has decided that it cannot fully accommodate this suggestion by Ford.
The agency notes that Ford made the following statement in its comment on the request for comments:

 


We believe that suppliers and plants owned, operated, or controlled by the parent company (i.e., a consolidated subsidiary
of the parent company or ``joint venture'' of partners in which the parent holds a majority interest) should be treated
as allied suppliers.

 


Thus, Ford appears to have been asking that the agency replace the specification in the statute that suppliers be ``wholly
owned'' with a specification that they merely have to be ``controlled.'' NHTSA does not believe there is any justification
for such a departure from the statute. Moreover, the agency believes that the statement in the NPRM that the situation
is ``akin'' to the joint venture agreement mentioned in section 210(f)(15) was incorrect, i.e., there is no analogy
between the two situations. 



As discussed below, the agency is clarifying the definition of 

allied supplier

 to encompass varying corporate structures where ownership is complete. However, a mere control relationship is
not sufficient to make a supplier ``allied.'' 

In the NPRM, the agency specifically addressed the issue of a supplier owned by the parent company of the manufacturer.
NHTSA stated that it recognizes that a supplier owned by the parent company of a manufacturer is not strictly wholly
owned by the manufacturer. The agency noted, however, that if the parent is a holding company that wholly owns both
the manufacturer and the supplier, there is no meaningful difference in this situation from that in which the strict
definition of 

wholly owned

 occurs. In other words, there are no outside interests represented (as occurs if there are outside shareholders).
Therefore, the agency tentatively decided to treat a supplier wholly owned by the parent holding company of a manufacturer
as an allied supplier, provided that the parent holding company also wholly owns the manufacturer. 

Finally, NHTSA indicated that it read section 210(f)(17) as requiring wholly owned suppliers to allied suppliers
to be treated as outside suppliers. 

The agency received a number of comments on the supplier definitions. Ford stated that to clarify the difference between
suppliers and distributors, a definition of supplier should be incorporated into the definition section. It recommended
the following definition, which it indicated is consistent with NAFTA_The term supplier means a person or an enterprise
that manufactures or assembles passenger motor vehicle equipment. 

The agency does not agree that distributors should be eliminated from the definition of supplier. NHTSA observes
that a distributor may supply passenger motor vehicle equipment to a manufacturer. Moreover, a manufacturer might
have a relationship with a distributor to obtain certain equipment but not with the company which manufacturers or
assembles the equipment. 

Ford also stated that the outside supplier definition requires clarification. It argued that the definition in the
statute was not intended to include, in any way, allied suppliers. It stated that the regulation should clearly eliminate
allied suppliers from the definition. Ford noted that an interpretation that an allied supplier becomes an outside
supplier to the extent that it supplies equipment to another allied supplier could result in an allied supplied part
having two sets of content values: the actual U.S./Canadian content when the component is supplied to the final assembly
plant, and a rolled-up or down U.S./Canadian content when the component is sent to another allied manufacturing facility.

After considering Ford's comment, NHTSA has reconsidered its view that section 210(f)(17) requires wholly owned
suppliers to allied suppliers to be treated as outside suppliers. The basis for that view was that a wholly owned supplier
to an allied supplier falls within the section 210(f)(17) definition of outside supplier. However, such a supplier
also falls within the section 210(f)(15) definition of allied supplier. The agency agrees that it is appropriate
to resolve this ambiguity in the regulation. 
The only significant difference between the statutory treatment of allied and outside suppliers is that allied suppliers
must provide actual U.S./Canadian content information, while the roll-up, roll-down provision applies to outside
suppliers. Thus, Congress decided that suppliers which are wholly owned by manufacturers should generally be held
to a higher standard concerning the specificity of the U.S./Canadian content information that they provide. Given
this difference, the agency agrees with Ford that an allied supplier should not be considered an outside supplier
simply because it supplies equipment to an allied supplier. NHTSA also notes that if an allied supplier were to be treated
as an outside supplier in such a context, manufacturers could obtain the benefits of the roll-up, roll-down provision
for their allied suppliers, simply by having them ship their equipment through another allied supplier. This position
is reflected in the definition of 

allied supplier

 set forth in the final rule. 
Toyota stated that the proposed regulation does not address the scope of the statutory term 

allied supplier.

 That manufacturer stated that because some issues have arisen concerning the statutory definition, it recommends
that the regulation provide certain clarifications. Toyota stated that the determination of whether the allied
supplier relationship exists within the statutory meaning does not depend on the number of levels of ownership but
on the nature of ownership, i.e., whether it is complete ownership. That manufacturer stated that it should not matter
whether ownership is direct or indirect. 
Honda stated that NHTSA proposed to treat as 

allied

 a supplier wholly owned by the same parent company that wholly owns the manufacturer. That company stated that NHTSA's
analysis does not extend quite far enough to encompass Honda's corporate structure. According to that manufacturer,
two parent companies within the Honda group together wholly own both the manufacturer and the supplier. No outside
interests are represented. Honda requested clarification in the final rule. 
NHTSA agrees with these comments of Honda and Toyota, which the agency believes are consistent with the approach taken
in the NPRM for suppliers owned by the parent company of the manufacturer. The definition of 

allied supplier

 in the final rule clarifies the meaning of that term with respect to the corporate relationships discussed by those
commenters. 


2. Definitions of Dealer and Ultimate Purchaser 


Section 210(f)(7) defines 

dealer

 to mean ``any person or resident located in the United States, including any territory of the United States, or the
District of Columbia, engaged in the sale or the distribution of new automobiles to the ultimate purchaser.'' Section
210(f)(6) defines 

new passenger motor vehicle

 to mean ``a passenger motor vehicle the equitable or legal title to which has never been transferred by a manufacturer,
distributor, or dealer to an ultimate purchaser.'' 
AIADA stated that in the case where a state or local jurisdiction has chosen to regulate the automobile industry and
the conduct of the industry through franchise laws, it believes the definition of dealer in the state or local franchise
law should apply to this Act. That organization stated that in promulgating regulations without clarifying the term
dealer, NHTSA could inadvertently undermine state and local franchise laws. 
NHTSA notes that since the Labeling Act includes an express definition of the meaning of 

dealer,

 the agency cannot delegate to states or local jurisdictions the right to change the definition for purposes of the
Labeling Act. The agency notes, however, that the Labeling Act and implementing regulation merely require persons
engaged in the sale or distribution of new automobiles to the ultimate purchaser to maintain the content label. Neither
the Act nor the regulation specifies any requirements concerning who is permitted to be a dealer. 
AIADA also stated that clarification is needed with respect to the meaning of 

ultimate purchaser.

 That organization stated that without such clarification, there could be confusion and unnecessary liability for
dealers. AIADA stated that for vehicles in rental service, demonstrator service and executive service, the law is
unclear as to who is the ultimate purchaser. That organization asked the agency to specify what transaction results
in an individual or entity being an ultimate purchaser. 
NHTSA has decided to add the following definition of 

ultimate purchaser

 to the regulation: The term 

ultimate purchaser

 means with respect to any new passenger motor vehicle, the first person, other than a dealer purchasing in its capacity
as a dealer, who in good faith purchases such new passenger motor vehicle for purposes other than resale. This definition
is based on one used in the Automobile Information Disclosure Act (AIDA), 15 U.S.C. 1231-1233, the Act which
requires the Monroney label. NHTSA believes that it is appropriate to adopt this definition given that the Labeling
Act's definitions of 

dealer

 and 

new passenger motor vehicle,

 which use the term 

ultimate purchaser,

 are also based on definitions included in the AIDA. 
Except to the extent otherwise provided in the regulation established by today's final rule, e.g., with respect to
temporary removal of separate content labels for test drives, NHTSA plans to treat vehicles in rental service, demonstrator
service and executive service the same for Labeling Act purposes as the Justice Department treats these vehicles
for purposes of Monroney labels. NHTSA believes that this is appropriate, given the same general purposes of the labels,
and the similarity of the relevant definitions in the statutes and, in the case of the Labeling Act, the implementing
regulation. The agency is including in the docket a copy of a February 24, 1994 letter from the Justice Department which
provides additional guidance in these areas. 


3. Joint Ventures 


NHTSA stated in the NPRM that several commenters on the request for comments had noted that there are carlines manufactured
jointly by two manufacturers, and requested that the agency permit the manufacturers to determine between themselves
which would be responsible for tracking, record keeping and labeling. The agency tentatively agreed that this would
be an appropriate approach and proposed requirements to permit multiple manufacturers to determine among themselves
which of them is to be considered the vehicle manufacturer for purposes of the labeling requirements. The agency also
proposed to specify that, in the absence of such an agreement, the carline ``shall be attributed to the single manufacturer
that markets the carline.'' 
Nissan stated that it would not like to see language that specifies a procedure to determine the manufacturer of record.
It stated that the selection of the manufacturer of record should be determined in accordance with the statutory language
and agreement between the partners involved. 
Isuzu stated that it believes the final rule must specify that if no written article exists in a joint-venture agreement
regarding manufacturer responsibility, carline responsibility is attributed to the manufacturer mentioned in
certification label with respect to the safety standards.

In a telephone call to NHTSA's Office of Chief Counsel, an attorney representing Toyota asked whether the Geo and the
Corolla, are in one or two carlines. These are very similar vehicles, produced on the same assembly line, one of which
is marketed by GM and the other by Toyota. NUMMI stated that the Corolla is manufactured in Japan, at NUMMI in California,
and in Canada. That company stated that the NPRM, in discussing joint ownership/joint production relationships,
attributed carline to the manufacturer that markets the carline, subject to certain conditions. NUMMI argued that
the use of the word ``manufacturer'' in this case implies each production location. 
After considering the comments, the agency has decided that multiple manufacturers should generally be permitted
to determine among themselves which of them is considered the vehicle manufacturer for purposes of the labeling requirements.
NHTSA also believes it is appropriate to specify that, in the absence of such an agreement, a vehicle is attributed
to the manufacturer which markets the vehicle. This approach provides maximum manufacturer flexibility, while
also specifying who is responsible for labeling in the absence of an agreement among the joint venturers. 
NHTSA believes, however, that additional clarification is needed concerning the meaning of ``carline'' in the joint
venture context. While manufacturers may determine between themselves who is responsible for tracking, recordkeeping
and labeling, they must follow the specified requirements for making carline determinations. As discussed earlier
in this notice, section 210 specifies that the term ``carline'' means a name denoting a group of vehicles which has
a degree of commonality in construction. It is the agency's opinion that the Geo and Corolla are in different carlines,
because they have different names. Moreover, to the extent that NUMMI produced Corollas in California and Toyota
produced similar or identical Corollas in Japan, all of the Corollas must be placed in the same carline, given the statutory

4. Currency Exchange Rate Calculations 


Since currency exchange rates may fluctuate on a day-to-day basis, thereby affecting domestic content valuations,
NHTSA proposed a methodology for determining the exchange rate to be used. The agency stated in the NPRM that it believes
that, in the interest of consistency, the percentages printed on the labels required by section 210 should be determined
using the same basis. The agency proposed a specific procedure for calculating currency exchange rates, similar
to that set forth in EPA's CAFE regulation. Manufacturers would be required to take the mean of the exchange rates in
effect at the end of each quarter set by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York for twelve calendar quarters prior to and
including the calendar ending one year prior to the date that the manufacturer submits information to the agency for
a carline. The agency proposed essentially the same procedure for suppliers, replacing the date the manufacturer
submits information to the agency with the date of the information the supplier provides to a manufacturer or allied
supplier. 
NHTSA noted that EPA had suggested that NHTSA allow exchange rate calculations based on Purchasing Power Parity Rates
(PPP), provided that a manufacturer was already using an approved PPP calculation for EPA purposes. EPA allows an
exemption from the normally required exchange rate calculations, based on a petition. EPA stated that it believes
that, by coordinating the fuel economy and content labeling decisions, consistency between the two agencies will
be maintained. NHTSA stated that it was considering adopting the EPA suggestion, particularly by requiring a manufacturer
to use the same conversion method for content label purposes as was approved by the EPA for fuel economy purposes. The
agency sought suggestions on this proposal. 
AAMA stated that manufacturers and suppliers should have the option to convert foreign currency utilizing the exchange
rates used in the financial records at the time the content calculations are made. It stated that under this option,
all financial data used to calculate content will be internally consistent and tie directly with the financial records.
That organization also stated that this option would avoid the major systems revisions that may be required under
the proposed average exchange rate methodology. AAMA also stated that the option maintains consistency between
the treatment of the prices of many commodities, where the prices fluctuate dramatically, and currency prices in
that none of these prices are smoothed by averaging. Finally, AAMA stated that the option facilitates the same base
cost data that is required to calculate origin under NAFTA, which will reduce the burden on manufacturers and suppliers.

Toyota urged the agency to adopt a rule under which all manufacturers must use the same method for converting currency.
That manufacturer argued that EPA's suggested approach would depart from this principle by requiring a manufacturer
to use the same method as approved by EPA for fuel economy purposes. Toyota stated that the EPA approach is legally unsound
and will produce inconsistent information for consumers comparing vehicles for possible purchase. Toyota argued
that, from a legal standpoint, the fuel economy calculation is made pursuant to a different statute with a different
purpose. That manufacturer stated further that, with respect to the currency exchange method that should be used,
it believes that PPP is the most appropriate method for currency conversion and that use of this method by all manufacturers
will result in consistency of calculation and avoid difficulties caused by rapid fluctuations in exchange rates.
Toyota stated that if NHTSA does not require PPP, the agency should require currency conversion to be conducted according
to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). Toyota stated that it believes that GAAP is preferable for Labeling
Act purposes to the proposed method. 
Mitsubishi stated that manufacturers should have the option of using PPP. It stated that this would be consistent
with the EPA domestic content calculation for CAFE purposes. That company added that, in the interests of fairness,
the same restrictions should apply as under the CAFE regulations_manufacturers should have the option of using PPP,
but first they must get approval, and then cannot switch back and forth merely to get the optimal rate. 
After considering the comments, NHTSA has decided to adopt the proposed method for determining exchange rates, including
requiring a manufacturer to use the same conversion method for content label purposes as was approved by the EPA for
fuel economy purposes. The agency believes that this approach provides flexibility to manufacturers, while ensuring
that they use appropriate methods for determining exchange rates. 
The agency believes that AAMA's recommendation to permit manufacturers and suppliers to use the currency rates that
are used in their financial records at the time the content calculations are made is so broad as not to amount to any specification
for determining exchange rates. A manufacturer could use any method it chose and could switch back and forth between
methods to obtain the rates it desired. By contrast, EPA permits a degree of flexibility, but ensures that an appropriate
method is used and that it is not changed back and forth between years. The agency notes that if a manufacturer obtains
EPA approval for whatever method is reflected in its financial records, it can use that method for both EPA and Labeling
Act purposes. 
While Toyota is correct that different manufacturers can use different methods for determining exchange rates,
it has not shown that this will result in significant differences in label values. Moreover, it has not shown why differences
in the purposes of the CAFE and Labeling statutes should result in different approaches for determining exchange
rates. Since both statutes require making determinations about the content of passenger motor vehicles, NHTSA believes
it is appropriate for EPA and NHTSA to follow the same approach for determining exchange rates.

5. Value Added by Foreign Suppliers 


NHTSA noted in the NPRM that section 210(f)(5)(B) provides a specific formula for determining the U.S./Canadian
content of equipment received by manufacturers from allied suppliers. The formula provides first that the foreign
content is determined by adding up the purchase price of all foreign material purchased from outside suppliers that
comprise the individual passenger motor vehicle equipment, and then subtracting such purchase price from the total
purchase price of such equipment. The remainder is the U.S./Canadian content of the equipment. 
The agency noted that this formula does not appear to take into account the possibility that an allied supplier may
be foreign, since it assumes that everything, except for the foreign value passed through from outside suppliers,
is U.S./Canadian. Based on a reading of the statute as a whole, NHTSA stated that it does not believe Congress intended
to convert the entire value added by allied suppliers located outside the U.S./Canada into domestic content. Therefore,
the proposed regulation treated the value added by allied suppliers located outside the U.S./Canada as non-U.S./Canadian.
NHTSA specifically requested comments on this issue. 
AAMA stated that it agrees with NHTSA that value added by allied suppliers located in a foreign country should be treated
as foreign. Nissan stated that it agrees that it may not have been the intent of the law to treat parts obtained from allied
suppliers outside the U.S./Canada as U.S./Canadian parts content. APMA stated that it supports this part of the proposal
on the ground that it is responsive to Congress' intent. 
BMW stated that it agrees with NHTSA that the intent of the legislation was not to include value added outside U.S./Canada
from foreign allied suppliers as domestic content and that, accordingly, it supports the language NHTSA has proposed.
BMW expressed concern, however, that in many instances throughout the NPRM preamble, NHTSA referred to the explicit
language of the legislation and stated that deviation from this language is not allowed. BMW stated that if NHTSA is
able to deviate from the explicit language of the legislation in this case, the reasoning for refusing to modify other
wording seems inconsistent. 
After considering the comments, NHTSA has decided to follow the approach discussed in the NPRM. The agency notes that
no commenters disagreed with the agency's view that Congress did not intend to convert the entire value added by allied
suppliers located outside the U.S./Canada into domestic content. 
With respect to BMW's comment, the agency notes that its interpretation is based on principles of statutory construction
related to ``whole statute'' interpretation and limits of literalism. See Sutherland Stat Const   46.05
and 46.07 (5th Ed). Basically, a statute should not be read literally where such a reading is contrary to its purposes.
NHTSA does not believe that anyone could reasonably argue that Congress intended to convert the entire value added
by allied suppliers located outside the U.S./Canada into domestic content; that result flies in the face of the statute
as a whole and its purpose. The agency does not believe that any of the other situations referred by BMW are similar.



6. International Agreements; Mexico 


AIAM stated that before promulgating a final rule, NHTSA should consult with USTR to determine whether the rule is
consistent with NAFTA and particularly Article 300 providing for national treatment of goods produced in the territories
of the signatory parties. AIAM also stated that USTR should be asked whether the rule is consistent with those U.S.
treaties of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation that convey most favored national treatment and national treatment
for investors and goods, particularly in light of the special treatment afforded to Canadian production. Nippondenso
stated that Mexico should be treated on the same basis and Canada under the Labeling Act. 
The European Community (EC) stated that it considers the proposal to be more trade restrictive than necessary to fulfil
the aim of consumer information. More specifically, the EC stated the following: 



The proposed labelling system would indeed not give any useful information about the product as such or its characteristics.
The only information contained on the label would be whether, and to what extent, the individual parts of the product
are of American or Canadian origin. In the opinion of the EC, the U.S. measure can only have the objective to influence
consumers to buy American or Canadian motor vehicles. 
The EC believes that the U.S. proposal constitutes an unjustifiable discrimination, contrary to article 2.1 of the
GATT Code on Technical Barriers to trade: 
 the U.S. proposed obligation to indicate the origin of the engine and gearbox could discourage U.S. constructors
to import them from their European subsidiaries or from European component manufacturers. 
 within the European Community, the assembly of vehicles is quite flexible regarding the origin of car components,
due to the internal market. For a single model of motor vehicle, a specific part may originate from one of several countries.
The U.S. proposal will therefore have greater administrative costs on European importers than other importers.

The EC is seriously concerned that such a proposal will create unnecessary trade barriers. Should the U.S. rules be
adopted as proposed, this would put an excessive financial burden on importers to access the U.S. market. 
The U.S. proposal may involve the disclosure of confidential data from manufacturers other than U.S. manufacturers.

In consequence, since the U.S. authorities, in accordance with Article 2.1 of the GATT Agreement on Technical Barriers
to Trade, have an obligation to ensure that technical regulations are not prepared with a view to creating unnecessary
obstacles to international trade, the European Community requests the U.S. authorities to take the above comments
into account and adapt their proposal accordingly. 



As discussed in the NPRM, NHTSA does not believe that section 210 contravenes the spirit or letter of GATT for the simple
reason that it is informational in nature, and has no other effect. Violations of GATT occur when barriers to trade
are established by raising tariffs on selected countries, or by granting preferences to local goods over foreign
goods. Under section 210, no tariffs are levied and no preferences are given to vehicles based on the U.S./Canadian
content. No quotas are established, and no vehicle is forbidden to be sold in the U.S. The only effect of section 210
is to provide consumers information about the origin of the equipment in vehicles they are considering purchasing.
If a consumer is not concerned with the country of origin of a vehicle's equipment, the label will have no bearing on
the purchasing decision whatsoever. If, on the other hand, a purchaser wishes to buy a vehicle that is comprised of
equipment from the U.S./Canada, Germany, England, Japan, Korea, or some other country, the label will give that consumer
information needed to help make such a decision. 
With respect to the EC's concern about administrative costs for European manufacturers, NHTSA notes that since the
requirements imposed by the rule are strictly informational and do not require any product changes other than the
addition of a label, the costs for all manufacturers are small. The agency also observes that, as discussed above,
it made some changes in the final rule to provide greater flexibility, and hence reduced costs, for manufacturers.

NHTSA notes that the Conference Report includes the following explanation concerning combined treatment of U.S.
and Canadian content: 




The conferees also note the reasons that the percentage of USA and Canadian content value required to be listed in this
bill is combined. The conferees believe it is appropriate to make this new labeling requirement as consistent as possible
with existing laws and regulations. The conferees also do not want this legislation to increase the cost of automobiles
to consumers. 
The conferees also recognize that the USA and Canada have a longstanding and specific automobile free trade pact (the
US and Canada Automotive Parts Agreement), one that predates the USA-Canada Free Trade Agreement by over 20 years.
This special relationship in automotive trade, and other factors, justify listing both US and Canadian automobile
value as a combined percentage. The conferees do not intend that any other country is to be combined with the USA and
Canada in the percentage of total automotive value required to be listed by this legislation. 


7. Consumer Guide



AIADA stated that it believes the labeling law will be misleading and confusing for consumers, and that the dealer
will ultimately bear the burden and be in the difficult position of explaining what it believes to be illogical content
information. That organization stated that to aid dealers and consumers, it believes NHTSA should publish and make
publicly available a consumer guide that explains just what the content figures represent and do not represent. It
stated, for example, that the guide should explain the distinction between allied and outside suppliers and how that
affects the value of motor vehicle content. 
NHTSA believes that a consumer guide that attempted to explain the details of the content calculation procedures,
such as the distinction between allied and outside suppliers, would not be helpful to consumers but would instead
cause unnecessary confusion. NHTSA believes that the vehicle labels required by this final rule will be readily understood
by consumers and help those that wish to do so to take content information into account in making a purchase decision.



L. May 1994 Congressional Comment


In May 1994, NHTSA received a letter concerning this rulemaking signed by Senator Carl Levin and Representatives
Sander Levin, Marcy Kaptur and Nancy Johnson. The agency was also advised by phone that Representative Ralph Regula
supported the letter. The letter reads as follows:



We are writing to urge you to draft American Automobile Labeling Act implementing regulations that reflect the legislation's
intent to provide an accurate means of measuring the parts value content of a vehicle. 
The trend has been for Japanese transplants to purchase parts assembled in the U.S. by Japanese affiliated parts makers,
a high percentage of which are merely assembled here using subcomponents and materials imported from Japan. Nonetheless,
they are erroneously counted as U.S. parts for the purposes of calculating U.S. content levels. The Labeling Act was
an attempt by Congress to establish a tool to more accurately measure the ``actual'' U.S. and Canadian content of vehicles
sold in the U.S. based on the origin of where the parts are made, not where the parts are purchased or assembled. It is
our hope that the Labeling Act will achieve this objective by imposing a stringent definition of what is an ``American
or Canadian made'' auto part. 
Currently, Japanese transplant auto makers claim high levels of U.S. content in their U.S. made vehicles. But they
will not provide the necessary data to measure accurately the U.S. content levels of the auto parts used in these vehicles,
and thus, it is impossible to verify their claims. After tracing the actual source of parts, a 1992 Economic Strategy
Institute study found that the U.S. auto part used in a 1991 Honda accord contained 2/3 Japanese content and only 1/3
``actual'' U.S. content. Even with these low levels of U.S. content, Honda took credit for these parts being totally
U.S.-made. 
In order to adequately distinguish between parts assembled in the U.S. using imported materials and parts made in
the U.S. using U.S. materials, the Labeling Act must include tracing requirements similar to the tracing requirements
in the NAFTA rule of origin, with the exception that Mexican parts would not be included as U.S. or Canadian. Tracing
should be used to determine if suppliers can be designated as North America (U.S. or Canadian)_if they achieve the
70% North American content value_as well as to determine the country of origin for the engine and transmission. For
example, if tracing were required, an engine or transmission that contains 75% Japanese content but is assembled
in the U.S. would be correctly found to be primarily of Japanese origin, not of U.S. origin.

<DOCNO> FR940721-0-00083 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940721-0-00014 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Finally, the Labeling Act requires that the names of all countries supplying 15% or more total parts value be listed.
To be meaningful, this requirement should not only include the name of the country, but also the approximate percentages
those countries contribute * * *.



NHTSA notes that it is addressing this comment here in this separate section instead of addressing it in each of the
several relevant sections earlier in this preamble, since this approach is simpler and since the comment was received
near the end of the preparation of the preamble.
The agency believes that today's final rule adequately distinguishes between parts assembled in the U.S. using imported
materials and parts made in the U.S. using U.S. materials. For purposes of calculating item one of the label, the percentage
U.S./Canadian parts content for vehicles within the carline, tracing is required to the extent that a supplier claims
that an item of equipment is U.S./Canadian. An outside supplier cannot designate a part as U.S./Canadian unless it
determines, on the basis of tracing the part's materials back to the raw material stage, that at least 70 percent of
the cost of the part represents value added in the U.S. or Canada. This is true for all items of equipment, including
engines and transmissions.
The procedures for making country of origin determinations for purposes of items four and five of the label, countries
of origin for the engine and transmission, do not require tracing back to raw materials. However, country of origin
determinations must be made for each component delivered to the engine or transmission assembly plant (or produced
at such plant), and the cost of assembling the engine or transmission is not considered in making such determinations.
Therefore, engines and transmissions that are assembled in the U.S. largely of imported materials will not be determined
to be of U.S. origin under the procedures. As discussed above, the label will indicate that these country of origin
determinations are for ``engine parts'' and ``transmission parts,'' to make it clear to consumers that these country
of origin determinations exclude assembly costs. NHTSA does not believe that it would be appropriate to impose additional
tracing requirements, since such requirements could be very burdensome.
As to the foreign countries which contribute 15 percent or more parts content for vehicle within a carline, manufacturers
are required to list not only the names of those countries, but also the specific percentage originating in each such
country. If there are more than two such countries, the manufacturer need only provide the information for the two
countries with the highest percentages.


V. Rulemaking Analyses and Notices


A. Executive Order 12866 and DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures


NHTSA has considered the impacts of this rulemaking action under Executive Order 12866 and the Department of Transportation's
regulatory policies and procedures. This rulemaking document was reviewed under Executive Order 12866. This action
has been determined to be ``significant'' under the Department's regulatory policies and procedures, given the
degree of public interest and the relationship to other Federal programs and agencies, particularly those related
to international trade.
NHTSA has estimated the costs associated with the rule in a Final Regulatory Evaluation which is being placed in the
docket for this rulemaking. That document analyzes the comments concerning costs. The requirements imposed by the
rule are strictly informational and do not require any product changes other than the addition of a label. NHTSA estimates
the cost of a separate label to be $0.06 to $0.11, and the cost of expanding a Monroney or fuel economy label to be less
than $0.01. The total cost for labels for the estimated 14 million vehicles sold in the U.S. annually that are affected
by the rule would therefore range from $140,000 to $1,540,000.
Based on manufacturers' comments, NHTSA estimates that a one-time cost to implement a system to collect and store
the necessary information for the labels is about $1 million apiece for the three large domestic manufacturers, and
$500,000 apiece for 20 other large vehicle manufacturers. Ford estimated annual maintenance costs of $150,000.
The agency assumes that this figure is reasonable for the three large domestic manufacturers, and that the other large
manufacturers will experience annual costs of about $75,000.
The above cost estimates do not include the compliance costs for suppliers. NHTSA has limited information concerning
the costs that will be experienced by the approximately 15,000 parts suppliers to the vehicle manufacturing industry.
Some large suppliers (e.g., Rockwell, Dana Corp., or TRW) make hundreds of parts and could experience costs similar
to those of a large vehicle manufacturer. Many small suppliers procure all of their inputs from the same country and
will experience negligible costs. NHTSA notes that APMA estimated that parts manufacturers will experience costs
ranging from $40,000 to $80,000 in the first year, with a reduction in successive years.
Final stage manufacturers will experience only minor costs, since they only need to provide labels showing the final
assembly point and the country of origin for the engine and transmission.


B. Regulatory Flexibility Act


Pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act, the agency has considered the impact this rulemaking will have on small
entities. I certify that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.
Therefore, a regulatory flexibility analysis is not required for this action. Although certain small businesses,
such as parts suppliers and some vehicle manufacturers, are affected by the regulation, the effect on them is minor
since the requirements are informational.


C. National Environmental Policy Act


The agency has analyzed the environmental impacts of the regulation in accordance with the National Environmental
Policy Act, 42 U.S.C. 4321 

et seq., 

and has concluded that it will not have a significant effect on the quality of the human environment.


D. Executive Order 12612 (Federalism)


This action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612,
and it has been determined that the rule does not have sufficient Federalism implications to warrant the preparation
of a Federalism Assessment.


E. Paperwork Reduction Act


The reporting and recordkeeping requirements associated with this final rule are being submitted to the Office of
Management and Budget for approval in accordance with 44 U.S.C. chapter 35.


F. Executive Order 12778 (Civil Justice Reform)


This rule does not have any retroactive effect. States are preempted from promulgating laws and regulations contrary
to the provisions of the rule. The rule does not require submission of a petition for reconsideration or other administrative
proceedings before parties may file suit in court.

 583.1 

Scope.


This part establishes requirements for the disclosure of information relating to the countries of origin of the equipment
of new passenger motor vehicles.


 583.2 

Purpose.


The purpose of this part is to aid potential purchasers in the selection of new passenger motor vehicles by providing
them with information about the value of the U.S./Canadian and foreign parts content of each vehicle, the countries
of origin of the engine and transmission, and the site of the vehicle's final assembly.


 583.3 

Applicability.


This part applies to manufacturers of new passenger motor vehicles manufactured or imported for sale in the United
States, suppliers of passenger motor vehicle equipment, and dealers of new passenger motor vehicles.


 583.4 

Definitions.


(a) 

Statutory terms. 

The terms 

allied supplier, carline, country of origin, dealer, foreign content, manufacturer, new passenger motor vehicle,
of U.S./Canadian origin, outside supplier, passenger motor vehicle, passenger motor vehicle equipment, percentage
(by value), State, 

and 

value added in the United States and Canada, 

defined in 49 U.S.C. 32304(a), are used in accordance with their statutory meanings except as further defined in paragraph
(b) of this section.
(b) 

Other terms and further definitions.
(1) Administrator 

means the Administrator of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.
(2) 

Allied supplier 

means a supplier of passenger motor vehicle equipment that is wholly owned by the manufacturer, or in the case of a joint
venture vehicle assembly arrangement, any supplier that is wholly owned by one member of the joint venture arrangement.
A supplier is considered to be wholly owned by the manufacturer if a common parent company owns both the manufacturer
and the supplier, or if a group of related companies own both the manufacturer and the supplier and no outside interests
(interests other than the manufacturer itself or companies which own the manufacturer) own the supplier.
(3) 

Carline 

means a name denoting a group of vehicles which has a degree of commonality in construction (

e.g., 

body, chassis). Carline does not consider any level of decor or opulence and is not generally distinguished by such
characteristics as roof line, number of doors, seats, or windows, except for light duty trucks. Carline is not distinguished
by country of manufacture, final assembly point, engine type, or driveline. Light duty trucks are considered to be
different carlines than passenger cars. A carline includes all motor vehicles of a given nameplate. Special purpose
vehicles, vans, and pickup trucks are classified as separate carlines.
(4) 

Final assembly 

means all operations involved in the assembly of a vehicle, performed at the final assembly point including but not
limited to assembly of body panels, painting, final chassis assembly, trim installation, except engine and transmission
fabrication and assembly and the fabrication of motor vehicle equipment components produced at the same final assembly
point using forming processes such as stamping, machining or molding processes.
(5) 

Final assembly point 

means the plant, factory, or other place, which is a building or series of buildings in close proximity, where a new
passenger motor vehicle is produced or assembled from passenger motor vehicle equipment and from which such vehicle
is delivered to a dealer or importer in such a condition that all component parts necessary to the mechanical operation
of such automobile are included with such vehicle whether or not such component parts are permanently installed in
or on such vehicle. For multi-stage vehicles, the final assembly point is the location where the first stage vehicle
is assembled.
(6) 

Outside supplier 

means:
(i) A non-allied supplier of passenger motor vehicle equipment to a manufacturer's allied supplier and
(ii) Anyone other than an allied supplier who ships directly to the manufacturer's final assembly point.
(7) 

Passenger motor vehicle equipment 

means any system, subassembly, or component received at the final assembly point for installation on, or attachment
to, such vehicle at the time of its initial shipment by the manufacturer to a dealer for sale to an ultimate purchaser
except: Nuts, bolts, clips, screws, pins, braces, gasoline, oil, blackout, phosphate rinse, windshield washer
fluid, fasteners, tire assembly fluid, rivets, adhesives, grommets, and wheel weights. Passenger motor vehicle
equipment also includes any system, subassembly, or component received by an allied supplier from an outside supplier
for incorporation into equipment supplied by the allied supplier to the manufacturer with which it is allied.
(8) 

Person 

means an individual, partnership, corporation, business trust, or any organized group of persons.
(9) 

Ultimate purchaser 

means with respect to any new passenger motor vehicle, the first person, other than a dealer purchasing in its capacity
as a dealer, who in good faith purchases such new passenger motor vehicle for purposes other than resale.


 583.5 

Label requirements.


(a) Except as provided in paragraphs (f) and (g) of this section, each manufacturer of new passenger motor vehicles
shall cause to be affixed to each passenger motor vehicle manufactured on or after October 1, 1994, a label that provides
the following information:
(1) 

U.S./Canadian parts content. 

The overall percentage, by value, of the passenger motor vehicle equipment that was installed on vehicles within
the carline of which the vehicle is part, and that originated in the United States and/or Canada (the procedure for
determining U.S./Canadian Parts Content is set forth in  583.6);
(2) 

Major sources of foreign parts content. 

The names of any countries other than the United States and Canada which contributed at least 15 percent of the average
overall percentage, by value, of the passenger motor vehicle equipment installed on vehicles within the carline
of which the vehicle is part, and the percentages attributable to each such country (if there are more than two such
countries, the manufacturer need only provide the information for the two countries with the highest percentages;
the procedure for determining major foreign sources of passenger motor vehicle equipment is set forth in  583.7);
(3) 

Final assembly point. 

The city, state (in the case of vehicles assembled in the United States), and country of the final assembly point of
the passenger motor vehicle;
(4) 

Country of origin for the engine. 

The country of origin of the passenger motor vehicle's engine (this is referred to as the country of origin of the ``engine
parts'' on the label; the procedure for making this country of origin determination is set forth in  583.8);
(5) 

Country of origin for the transmission. 

The country of origin of the passenger motor vehicle's transmission (this is referred to as the country of origin of
the ``transmission parts'' on the label; the procedure for making this country of origin determination is set forth
in  583.8);
(6) 

Explanatory note. 

A statement which explains that parts content does not include final assembly, distribution, or other non-parts
costs.

(h) 

Requests for information and certifications relevant to information on the label. 

(1) Each manufacturer and allied supplier shall request its suppliers to provide directly to it the information and
certifications specified by this part which are necessary for the manufacturer/allied supplier to carry out its
responsibilities under this part. The information shall be requested sufficiently early to enable the manufacturer
to meet the timing requirements specified by this part. 

(2) For requests made by manufacturers or allied suppliers to outside suppliers: 

(i) The requester shall indicate that the request is being made pursuant to 49 CFR part 583, and that the regulation
is administered by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration; 

(ii) The requester shall indicate that 49 CFR part 583 requires outside suppliers to provide specified information
upon the request of a manufacturer or allied supplier to which it supplies passenger motor vehicle equipment and that,
to the best of the requester's knowledge, the outside supplier is required to provide the requested information;


(iii) If any information other than that required by 49 CFR Part 583 is requested, the requester shall indicate which
information is required by 49 CFR part 583 and which is not; 

(iv) The requester shall indicate that 49 CFR part 583 specifies that while information may be requested by an earlier
date, the outside supplier is not required to provide the information until the date specified by the requester or
the date 45 days after receipt of the request, whichever is later. 

(i) Manufacturers need not provide any of the information specified in this part for model year 1994 vehicles. For
model year 1995 and model year 1996 carlines which are first offered for sale to ultimate purchasers before June 1,
1995, manufacturers and suppliers may, instead of following the calculation procedures set forth in this part, use
procedures that they expect, in good faith, to yield similar results. 



 583.6

Procedure for determining U.S./Canadian parts content. 



(a) Each manufacturer, except as specified in  583.5 (f) and (g), shall determine the percentage U.S./Canadian
Parts Content for each carline on a model year basis, before the beginning of each model year. Items of equipment produced
at the final assembly point (but not as part of final assembly) are treated in the same manner as if they were supplied
by an allied supplier. All value otherwise added at the final assembly point and beyond, including all final assembly
costs, are excluded from the calculation of U.S./Canadian parts content. 

(b) Determining the value of items of equipment.

(1) For items of equipment received at the final assembly point, the value is the price paid by the manufacturer for
the equipment as delivered to the final assembly point. 

(2) For items of equipment produced at the final assembly point (but not as part of final assembly), the value is the
fair market price that a manufacturer of similar size and location would pay a supplier for such equipment. 

(3) For items of equipment received at the factory or plant of an allied supplier, the value is the price paid by the allied
supplier for the equipment as delivered to its factory or plant. 

(c) Determining the U.S./Canadian percentage of the value of items of equipment. 

(1) Equipment supplied by an outside supplier to a manufacturer or allied supplier is considered: 

(i) 100 percent U.S./Canadian, if 70 percent or more of its value is added in the United States or Canada; and 

(ii) 0 percent U.S./Canadian, if less than 70 percent of its value is added in the United States or Canada. 

(2) The extent to which an item of equipment supplied by an allied supplier is considered U.S./Canadian is determined
by dividing the value added in the United States and Canada by the total value of the equipment. The resulting number
is multiplied by 100 to determine the percentage U.S./Canadian content of the equipment.

(3) In determining the value added in the United States and Canada of equipment supplied by an allied supplier, any
equipment that is delivered to the allied supplier by an outside supplier and is incorporated into the allied supplier's
equipment, is considered:

(i) 100 percent U.S./Canadian, if at least 70 percent of its value is added in the United States or Canada; and

(ii) 0 percent U.S./Canadian, if less than 70 percent of its value is added in the United States or Canada.

(4)(i) Value is added in the United States or Canada by an allied supplier or outside supplier to the extent that the
supplier produces or assembles passenger motor vehicle equipment at a plant or factory located within the territorial
boundaries of the United States or Canada.

(ii) In determining the value added in the United States or Canada of passenger motor vehicle equipment produced or
assembled within the territorial boundaries of the United States or Canada, the cost of all foreign materials is subtracted
from the total value (e.g., the price paid at the final assembly plant) of the equipment. Except as provided in (c)(3),
material is considered foreign to whatever extent part or all of the cost of the material is not determined to represent
value added in the United States or Canada, traced back to raw materials. For any material which is imported into the
United States or Canada from a third country, the value added in the United States or Canada is zero, even if part of the
material originated in the United States or Canada. Neither suppliers nor anyone else is required to trace the value
added in the United States or Canada backwards; however, any portion of the cost of a material which is not traced to
value added in the United States or Canada is considered foreign. Example:

 A supplier located in the United States or Canada uses sheet steel to produce exterior panels which are shipped to a
final assembly plant. In determining the value added in the United States or Canada of the exterior panels, the supplier
must subtract the price it paid for the sheet steel except to the extent that the supplier determines that the price
paid represents value added in the United States or Canada.

(iii) For the minor items listed in the  583.4 definition of ``passenger motor vehicle equipment'' as being
excluded from that term, outside and allied suppliers may, to the extent that they incorporate such items into their
equipment, treat the cost of the minor items as value added in the country of assembly.

(iv) For passenger motor vehicle equipment which is imported into the territorial boundaries of the United States
or Canada from a third country, the value added in the United States or Canada is zero, even if part of its material originated
in the United States or Canada.

(v) The payment of duty does not result in value added in the United States or Canada.

(5) If a manufacturer or allied supplier does not receive information from one or more of its suppliers concerning
the U.S./Canadian content of particular equipment, the U.S./Canadian content of that equipment is considered zero.
This provision does not affect the obligation of manufacturers and allied suppliers to request this information
from their suppliers or the obligation of the suppliers to provide the information.

(d) 

Determination of the U.S./Canadian percentage of the total value of a carline's passenger motor vehicle equipment.

 The percentage of the value of a carline's passenger motor vehicle equipment that is U.S./Canadian is determined
by_
(1) Adding the total value of all of the equipment (regardless of country of origin) expected to be installed in that
carline during the next model year;

(2) Dividing the value of the U.S./Canadian content of such equipment by the amount calculated in paragraph (d)(1)
of this section, and

(3) Multiplying the resulting number by 100.



 583.7 


Procedure for determining major foreign sources of passenger motor vehicle equipment.



(a) Each manufacturer, except as specified in  583.5 (f) and (g), shall determine the countries, if any, which
are major foreign sources of passenger motor vehicle equipment and the percentages attributable to each such country
for each carline on a model year basis, before the beginning of each model year. The manufacturer need only determine
this information for the two such countries with the highest percentages. Items of equipment produced at the final
assembly point (but not as part of final assembly) are treated in the same manner as if they were supplied by an allied
supplier. In making determinations under this section, the U.S. and Canada are treated together as if they were one
(non-foreign) country.

(b) 

Determining the value of items of equipment. 

The value of each item of equipment is determined in the manner specified in  583.6(b).

(c) 

Determining the country of origin of items of equipment.

(1) Except as provided in (c)(2), the country of origin of each item of equipment is the country which contributes the
greatest amount of value added to that item.

(2) Instead of making country of origin determinations in the manner specified in (c)(1), a manufacturer may, at its
option, use any other methodology that is used for customs purposes (U.S. or foreign), so long as a consistent methodology
is employed for all items of equipment, and the U.S. and Canada are treated together.

(d) Determination of the percentage of the total value of a carline's passenger motor vehicle equipment which is attributable
to individual countries other than the U.S. and Canada. 

The percentage of the value of a carline's passenger motor vehicle equipment that is attributable to each country
other than the U.S. and Canada is determined on a model year basis by_

(1) Adding up the total value of all of the passenger motor vehicle equipment (regardless of country of origin) expected
to be installed in that carline during the next model year;

(2) Adding up the value of such equipment which originated in each country other than the U.S. or Canada;

(3) Dividing the amount calculated in paragraph (d)(2) of this section for each country by the amount calculated in
paragraph (d)(1) of this section, and multiplying each result by 100.

(e) A country is a major foreign source of passenger motor vehicle equipment for a carline only if the country is one
other than the U.S. or Canada and if 15 or more percent of the total value of the carline's passenger motor vehicle equipment
is attributable to the country.

(f) If the sum of the percentage U.S./Canadian parts content (determined under  583.6) and the percentages
of the two largest major foreign sources of content exceeds 100%, the major foreign source percentages are proportionately
reduced to the extent necessary to bring the sum down to 100%.



 583.8 


Procedure for determining country of origin for engines and transmissions (for purposes of determining the information
specified by   583.5(a)(4) and 583.5(a)(5) only).

(a) Each supplier of an engine or transmission shall determine the country of origin once a year for each engine and
transmission. The origin of engines shall be calculated for engines of the same displacement produced at the same
plant. The origin for transmissions shall be calculated for transmissions of the same type produced at the same plant.
Transmissions are of the same type if they have the same attributes including: Drive line application, number of forward
gears, controls, and layout. The U.S. and Canada are treated separately in making such determination. 

(b) The value of an engine or transmission is determined by adding up the prices paid by the manufacturer of the engine/transmission
for each component comprising the engine/ transmission, as delivered to the assembly plant of the engine/transmission,
and the fair market value of each individual part produced at the plant. All value added at the engine/transmission
plant is otherwise excluded from the calculation of origin. Individual parts refers to the most basic level of parts
used to assemble an engine or transmission and not subassemblies. 

(c) 

Determining the country of origin of components. 

(1) Except as provided in (c)(2), the country of origin of each component is the country which contributes the greatest
amount of value added to that item. 

(2) Instead of making country of origin determinations in the manner specified in (c)(1), a manufacturer may, at its
option, use any other methodology that is used for customs purposes (U.S. or foreign), so long as a consistent methodology
is employed for all components. 

(d) Determination of the total value of an engine/transmission which is attributable to individual countries

. The value of an
