Discussion



The Direction G&eacute;n&eacute;rale de l'Aviation Civile (DGAC), which is the airworthiness authority for France,
recently notified the FAA that an unsafe condition may exist on certain Aerospatiale Model ATR42 series airplanes.
The DGAC advises that corrosion has been detected on the pitch and rudder trim fail-safe rods installed on these airplanes.
(This corrosion was found during inspections that were conducted as a part of a sampling program carried out by the
manufacturer.) In some cases, corrosion apparently was caused by water accumulating in the lower part of the rods
and freezing; the rods in these cases were installed with their open end oriented upwards (rather than downwards),
which allowed water to accumulate between the internal and external tubes of the rod. Some cracking was associated
with corrosion in these cases. Such corrosion could compromise the required strength of these flight control rods.

Aerospatiale has issued the following service bulletins which address the identified problems:

a. Service Bulletin ATR42-27-0071, dated February 23, 1994, describes procedures for inspecting the
elevator trim rod and rudder trim rod to determine the orientation of the open rod end. It also describes procedures
for replacing rods having open ends that are oriented upwards with rods on which the open end of the rod is oriented downwards.
A downward-oriented rod end will prevent the accumulation of water between the internal and external tubes of the
rod. The DGAC classified the material contained in this service bulletin as mandatory and issued French Airworthiness
Directive 94-003-053(B), dated January 5, 1994, in order to assure the continued airworthiness of these
airplanes in France.

b. Service Bulletin ATR42-27-0048, Revision 2, dated May 16, 1991, describes procedures for reversing
the installation of the ends of the elevator tab and rudder tab control rods so that the open end of the rod is oriented
downwards. The DGAC has classified this service bulletin as ``recommended.''

c. Service Bulletin ATR42-27-0049, Revision 2, dated May 16, 1991, describes procedures for replacing
the elevator tab and rudder tab control rods with new rods that have been modified by the addition of a drain hole in the
non-open end of the rod and the application of a protective treatment. The DGAC has classified this service bulletin
as ``recommended.''

This airplane model is manufactured in France and is type certificated for operation in the United States under the
provisions of section 21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.29) and the applicable bilateral airworthiness
agreement. Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, the DGAC has kept the FAA informed of the situation
described above. The FAA has examined the findings of the DGAC, reviewed all available information, and determined
that AD action is necessary for products of this type design that are certificated for operation in the United States.

Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes of the same type
design registered in the United States, the proposed AD would require an inspection to determine the orientation
of the end of rudder trim and elevator trim fail-safe rods, and replacement of those rods having downwards-oriented
ends. The actions would be required to be accomplished in accordance with the service bulletins described previously.

Airplanes on which Aerospatiale Modification 02723 has been installed are not affected by the requirements of this
proposed AD. The subject flight control rods on those airplanes have been modified prior to airplane delivery.

The FAA estimates that 128 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD, that it would take approximately
4 work hour per airplane to accomplish the proposed inspection action, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work
hour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $28,160,
or $220 per airplane. This total cost impact figure is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any
of the proposed requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if
this AD were not adopted.

Should replacement of any of the flight control rods be necessary, the number of work hours and the cost of required
parts would vary according to the type of replacement accomplished. In a ``worst case scenario'' (both subject rods
needing replacement), the cost of parts would be approximately $6,000 per airplane. Labor necessary to accomplish
replacement of a rod(s) would vary from 54 work hours to 87 work hours, at an average labor rate of $55 per work hour.

The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment

For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) Is not a ``significant regulatory action''
under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44
FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative,
on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft
regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting
the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain McDonnell
Douglas Model DC-10-30 and -30F series airplanes. This proposal would require replacement of cargo
door latch spool fitting attach bolts fabricated from H-11 steel with Inconel bolts. This proposal is prompted
by a report of a broken latch spool fitting attach bolt found on a cargo door on a Model DC-9 series freighter airplane.
The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent inadvertent opening of a cargo door while the airplane
is in flight, and subsequent loss of pressurization and reduced controllability of the airplane.

Discussion 




On April 26, 1991, the FAA issued AD 91-10-07, amendment 39-6991 (56 FR 21268), applicable to McDonnell
Douglas Model DC-10 series airplanes, manufacturer's fuselage numbers 1 through 379 inclusive. That AD requires
inspection of the cargo door latch spool fitting attach bolts fabricated from H-11 steel and replacement of
those bolts with Inconel bolts. That action was prompted by a report of a broken latch spool fitting attach bolt found
on a cargo door on a Model DC-9 series freighter airplane. Broken bolts could jeopardize the integrity of the
door locking capability. The requirements of AD 91-10-07 are intended to prevent loss of pressurization
and reduced controllability of the aircraft due to inadvertent opening of a cargo door while the airplane is in flight.



Since the issuance of AD 91-10-07, the manufacturer has informed the FAA that cargo door latch spool fitting
attach bolts fabricated from H-11 steel also were installed on 8 additional Model DC-10 production airplanes.
Therefore, these 8 airplanes are subject to the same unsafe condition as addressed by that AD. 


The FAA has reviewed and approved McDonnell Douglas DC-10 Alert Service Bulletin A52-212, Revision 4,
dated November 3, 1993, that describes procedures for replacement of the H-11 cargo door latch spool fitting
attach bolts and associated hardware with Inconel bolts and associated hardware. Replacing the existing H-11
material bolts and associated hardware with new bolts made from Inconel material and associated hardware will eliminate
the possibility of stress corrosion failures. 


Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other products of this same type
design, the proposed AD would require replacement of H-11 cargo door latch spool fitting attach bolts with Inconel
bolts on 8 Model DC-10-30 and -30F series airplanes. The actions would be required to be accomplished
in accordance with the alert service bulletin described previously. 







Note: 

The FAA's normal policy is that, when an AD requires a substantive change, such as a change in its applicability, the
``old'' AD is superseded by being removed from the system and a new AD added. In the case of this AD action, the FAA normally
would have proposed superseding AD 91-10-07 to expand its applicability to include the 8 additional airplanes.
However, in reconsideration of the entire fleet size that would be affected by such a supersedure action, and the consequent
workload associated with revising maintenance record entries, the FAA has determined that a less burdensome approach
is to issue a separate AD applicable only to the 8 airplanes. This AD does not supersede AD 91-10-07; airplanes
listed in the applicability of AD 91-10-07 continue to be required to comply with the requirements of that
AD. This proposed AD is a separate AD action, and would be applicable only to eight airplanes listed in the alert service
bulletin described above. 





There are 8 Model DC-10 series airplanes of the affected design in the worldwide fleet. The FAA estimates that
6 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD, that it would take approximately 86 work hours per
airplane to accomplish the proposed actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Required parts would
cost approximately $10,682 per airplane. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators
is estimated to be $92,472, or $15,412 per airplane. 


The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the
proposed requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this
AD were not adopted.

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document proposes the supersedure of an existing airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to McDonnell Douglas
Helicopter Company and Hughes Helicopters, Inc. Model 369 and OH-6A series helicopters equipped with certain
main rotor (M/R) blade assemblies or certain M/R hub lead-lag assemblies, that currently requires repetitive inspections
and checks for cracks. This action would require the same inspections as the superseded AD, but would eliminate pilot
checks, expand the areas of inspection, and require the application of slippage marks on each M/R blade root fitting
lug and related bushings to detect movement. This proposal is prompted by additional reports of cracks in the M/R blade
root fittings, lugs, and adjacent blade skin, and movement of the root fitting bushings. The actions specified by
the proposed AD are intended to prevent failure of a M/R blade assembly or a M/R hub lead-lag link assembly, loss of a
M/R blade, and subsequent loss of control of the helicopter.

Discussion 


On August 8, 1991, the FAA issued AD 91-17-04, Amendment 39-8003 (56 FR 42230, August 27, 1991), to
require initial and repetitive inspections and checks of certain main rotor (M/R) blade assemblies and M/R hub lead-lag
link assemblies for fatigue cracks and for loose bushings in the M/R blade lead-lag link lugs (lead-lag lugs). That
action was prompted by two incidents involving a cracked M/R blade root fitting lug (root fitting lug). Bushing movement
in the M/R blade lead-lag link lugs may have caused fatigue cracks in the lead lag link assemblies. The lead lag link
assembly attaches to the M/R blade. Any cracks in the lead lag link assembly, the M/R blade, the MR blade root fitting,
or any movement of the bushing, could create an unsafe condition. That condition, if not corrected, could result in
failure of a M/R blade assembly or a M/R hub lead-lag link assembly, loss of a M/R blade, and subsequent loss of control
of the helicopter. 
Since the issuance of that AD, additional incidents of cracks in the M/R blade root fitting (root fitting), and M/R
blade skin have been reported. Additionally, the manufacturer has discovered that in some M/R blade assemblies,
the M/R blade root fitting bushing (bushing) can loosen and contribute to fretting-induced fatigue cracking in the
root fitting lug. The root fittings and M/R blade skins are parts of the M/R blade assembly. Therefore, McDonnell Douglas
Helicopter Company issued a revised Service Information Notice No. HN-211.4, DN-51.6, EN-42.4,
and FN-31.4 (SIN), dated January 27, 1993, that requested operators mark each root fitting lug and bushing with
a slippage mark and thereafter inspect for slippage on each root fitting lug and bushing. The revised SIN, dated January
27, 1993, includes the M/R blade assembly and M/R hub lead-lag link assembly inspections contained in the preceding
versions of the SIN, dated August 5, 1991.

Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other products of this same type
design, the proposed AD would supersede AD 91-17-04 to require application of a slippage mark on each root
fitting lug and bushing within 25 hours' time-in-service (TIS). In addition, this proposal would require, within
25 hours' TIS after the effective date of this AD and thereafter at intervals not to exceed 100 hours' TIS, that the M/R
blade assembly be removed and that the root fittings, root fitting lugs, lead-lag lugs, the M/R blade skin, and the
doublers adjacent to the root fitting be inspected for cracks. This AD proposal also requires that the bushings be
inspected for looseness and slippage, and that slippage marks be applied if not already present. Visual inspections
of the exposed M/R blade skin, root fittings, root fitting lugs, and lead-lag lugs for cracks and inspection of the
bushing slippage marks for movement are also required at intervals not to exceed 25 hours' TIS. The FAA no longer allows
pilots to perform checks such as those contained in AD 91-17-04, paragraph (b). Therefore, a pilot would
not be permitted to perform any of the proposed inspections in this AD. 
The FAA estimates that 1,000 helicopters of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD, that it would take
approximately 22 work hours per helicopter to accomplish the proposed actions, and that the average labor rate is
$55 per work hour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to
be  1,210,000. 
The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.

Proposed Establishment of Class E Airspace: Alta Vista Ranch Airport, Marfa, TX



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of proposed rulemaking.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This notice proposes to establish Class E airspace extending upward from 700 feet above ground level (AGL) at Alta
Vista Ranch Airport, Marfa, TX. The development of a very high frequency omni-directional range (VOR) standard instrument
approach procedure (SIAP) to Runway (RWY) 15 has made this proposal necessary. The intended effect of this proposal
is to provide adequate controlled airspace for aircraft executing the VOR RWY 15 SIAP at Alta Vista Ranch Airport,
Marfa, TX.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Comments Invited



Interested parties are invited to participate in this proposed rulemaking by submitting such written data, views,
or arguments as they may desire. Comments that provide the factual basis supporting the views and suggestions presented
are particularly helpful in developing reasoned regulatory decisions on the proposal. Comments are specifically
invited on the overall regulatory, aeronautical, economic, environmental, and energy-related aspects of the proposal.
Communications should identify the airspace docket number and be submitted in triplicate to the address listed under
the caption ADDRESSES

. Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments on this notice must submit, with those comments,
a self-addressed, stamped, postcard containing the following statement: ``Comments to Airspace Docket No. 93-ASW-60.''
The postcard will be date and time stamped and returned to the commenter. All communications received on or before
the specified closing date for comments will be considered before taking action on the proposed rule. The proposal
contained in this notice may be changed in the light of comments received. All comments submitted will be available
for examination in the Office of the Assistance Chief Counsel, 2601 Meacham Boulevard, Room 663, Fort Worth, TX, both
before and after the closing date for comments. A report summarizing each substantive public contact with FAA personnel
concerned with this rulemaking will be filed in the docket.



Availability of NPRM's



Any person may obtain a copy of this Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) by submitting a request to the Federal Aviation
Administration, System Management Branch, Department of Transportation, Forth Worth, TX 76193-0530. Communications
must identify the notice number of this NPRM. Persons interested in being placed on a mailing list for future NPRM's
should also request a copy of Advisory Circular No. 11-2A that describes the application procedure.



The Proposal



The FAA is considering an amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to establish Class
E airspace extending upward from 700 feet AGL, at Alta Vista Ranch Airport, Marfa, TX. The development of a VOR RWY 15
SIAP has made this proposal necessary. The intended effect of this proposal is to provide adequate Class E airspace
for aircraft executing the VOR RWY 15 SIAP at Alta Vista Ranch Airport, Marfa, TX.

The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Designated Class E airspace areas extending
upward from 700 feet or more above ground level are published in Paragraph 6005 of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993,
and effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference on 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993). The
Class E airspace designation listed in this document would be published subsequently in the order.

The FAA has determined that this proposed regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations
that need frequent and routine amendments to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) Is not a ``significant
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies
and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as
the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and
air navigation, it is certified that this rule, when promulgated, will not have a significant impact on a substantial
number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

Proposed Modification of Restricted Areas R-2303A and R-2303B, and Establishment of R-2303C,
Fort Huachuca, AZ

ACTION:

 Notice of proposed rulemaking. 


 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This proposed rule would amend Restricted Areas R-2303A and R-2303B, and establish R-2303C at Fort
Huachuca, AZ. R-2303A would be amended to exclude the Fort Huachuca/Libby AAF/Sierra Vista Municipal Airport
from the restricted area and provide airspace for visual flight rules (VFR) access to the airport when R-2303A
is in use. The proposal would lower the floor and ceiling and revise the lateral dimensions of R-2303B in order
to accommodate unmanned aerial vehicle training profiles. R-2303B would be further subdivided by redesignating
the southeast corner of the existing area as a separate restricted area, R-2303C. Additionally this notice
proposes to reduce the published hours of operation for R-2303A and R-2303B. As proposed, the time of designation
for the new area, R-2303C, would be intermittent by a Notice to Airmen (NOTAM). These changes are proposed to
accommodate increased training requirements and to return unneeded special use airspace to the National Airspace
System (NAS).

Availability of NPRM's 


Any person may obtain a copy of this Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) by submitting a request to the Federal Aviation
Administration, Office of Public Affairs, Attention: Public Inquiry Center, APA-220, 800 Independence Avenue,
SW., Washington, DC 20591, or by calling (202) 267-3485. Communications must identify the notice number of
this NPRM. Persons interested in being placed on a mailing list for future NPRM's should also request a copy of Advisory
Circular No. 11-2A, which describes the application procedure. 


The Proposal 


The FAA is considering an amendment to part 73 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 73) to amend R-2303A
to exclude from the restricted area the airspace from the surface to 1,500 feet above ground level (AGL), within a 3-nautical-mile
radius of the Fort Huachuca/Libby AAF/Sierra Vista Municipal Airport. The airspace from the surface to 1,500 feet
AGL within 1-nautical-mile either side of U.S. Highway 90 would also be excluded. This would provide VFR access to
the airport when R-2303A is in use. R-2303B would be amended by relocating the northern boundary 3 miles
south of its existing position. This would better accommodate hang gliding activity that takes place just outside
of the northwest corner of existing R-2303B. R-2303B would also be subdivided to designate the southeastern
section as a separate restricted area, R-2303C. This notice also proposes to lower the floor of R-2303B
from 15,000 feet MSL to 8,000 feet MSL in order to accommodate unmanned aerial vehicle training profiles. The ceiling
of R-2303B would be lowered from FL 450 to FL 300. This new subarea would extend from 8,000 feet mean sea level (MSL)
to FL 300. The U.S. Army has determined that there is no longer a requirement for restricted airspace above FL 300, therefore,
that airspace would be returned to the NAS. Lastly, the times of designation for R-2303A and R-2303B would
be reduced from ``Monday-Saturday, 0700-1600 local time; other times by NOTAM at least 24 hours in advance,''
to ``Monday-Friday, 0700-1600 local time; other times by NOTAM at least 24 hours in advance.'' Activation of
R-2303C would be intermittent by NOTAM at least 24 hours in advance. Designation of R-2303C is proposed
to accommodate hang gliding activities that occur just outside of the southeastern corner of existing R-2303B.
The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Section 73.23 of part 73 of the Federal
Aviation Regulations was republished in FAA Order 7400.8B dated March 9, 1994. 
The FAA has determined that this proposed regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations
for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) is
not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT
Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory
evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic
procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule, when promulgated, will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. 


Environmental Review 


An environmental review of the proposal will be conducted by the U.S. Army and the FAA prior to an FAA final decision
on the proposal. The results of the review will be addressed in any subsequent rulemaking action.

basic vehicle inspection and maintenance (I/M), and redesignation of the Detroit-Ann Arbor area to attainment for
ozone and corresponding 175A maintenance plan.

A. Emissions Inventory 


The inventory was submitted by the State to satisfy certain Federal requirements for an approvable nonattainment
area ozone SIP for the Detroit/Ann Arbor area in Michigan. 
A detailed analysis of Michigan's 1990 Base Year Emission Inventory SIP submittal is contained in the USEPA's technical
support document (TSD), dated January 27, 1994 from Jeanette Marrero to the Docket, entitled ``TSD for Proposed Revision
to Michigan's Ozone SIP for the 1990 Base Year Emissions Inventory for Areas Designated Nonattainment for Ozone''
(Emission Inventory TSD), which is available from the Region 5 office listed above. 


I. Background


Under the Act, States have the responsibility to inventory emissions contributing to NAAQS nonattainment, to track
these emissions over time, and to ensure that control strategies are being implemented that reduce emissions and
move areas towards attainment. The Act requires ozone nonattainment areas designated as moderate, serious, severe,
and extreme to submit a plan within 3 years of 1990 to reduce volatile organic compounds (VOC) emissions by 15 percent
within 6 years after 1990. The baseline level of emissions, from which the 15 percent reduction is calculated, is determined
by adjusting the base year inventory to exclude biogenic emissions and certain emission reductions not creditable
towards the 15 percent. The 1990 base year emissions inventory is the primary inventory from which the periodic inventory,
the reasonable further progress (RFP) projection inventory, and the modeling inventory are derived. Further information
on these inventories and their purpose can be found in the ``Emission Inventory Requirements for Ozone SIP,'' USEPA,
Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards (OAQPS), Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, March 1991. The base
year inventory may also serve as part of statewide inventories for purposes of regional modeling in transport areas.
The base year inventory plays an important role in modeling demonstrations for areas classified as moderate and above
outside transport regions. 
The air quality planning requirements for marginal to extreme ozone nonattainment areas are set out in section 182(a)-(e)
of title I of the Act. Further, the USEPA has issued a General Preamble describing USEPA's preliminary views on how
USEPA intends to review SIP revisions submitted under title I of the Act, including requirements for the preparation
of the 1990 base year inventory (57 FR 13502, April 16, 1992 and 57 FR 18070, April 28, 1992). Because USEPA is describing
its interpretations here only in broad terms, the reader should refer to the General Preamble for a more detailed discussion
of the interpretations of title I advanced in this proposal and the supporting rationale. In this rulemaking action
on the Michigan ozone base year emissions inventory, USEPA is proposing to apply its interpretations taking into
consideration the specific factual issues presented. Thus, USEPA will consider any comments submitted within the
comment period before taking final action on this proposal. 
Those States containing ozone nonattainment areas classified as marginal to extreme are required under section
182(a)(1) of the Act to submit a final, comprehensive, accurate, and current inventory of actual ozone season, weekday
emissions from all sources within 2 years of enactment (November 15, 1992). This inventory is for calendar year 1990
and is denoted as the base year inventory. It includes both anthropogenic and biogenic sources of volatile organic
compounds (VOC), nitrogen oxides (NO

X

), and carbon monoxide (CO). The inventory is to address actual VOC, NO

X

, and CO emissions for the area during peak ozone season, which is generally comprised of the summer months. All stationary
point and area sources, as well as highway mobile sources within the nonattainment area, are to be included in the compilation.
Available guidance for preparing emission inventories is provided in the General Preamble (57 FR 13498, April 16,
1992). 
The inventory was submitted by the State to USEPA on January 5, 1993 as a proposed revision to the SIP. The State of Michigan
held a public hearing on August 2, 1993 to receive public comment on the 1990 base year emission inventory for Detroit/Ann
Arbor nonattainment areas and certified the hearing to the USEPA in a submittal on November 15, 1993. Supplemental
information was also submitted on November 29, 1993. 
The emission inventory was reviewed by USEPA to determine completeness shortly after its submittal, in accordance
with the completeness criteria set out at 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) part 51, appendix V, as amended by 57
FR 42216 (August 26, 1991). The submittal was found to be complete on March 16, 1993 with the exception of evidence of
a public hearing. After receiving evidence of the public hearing, a letter from David Kee, Director, Air and Radiation
Division, USEPA, Region 5, dated January 7, 1994 was sent to the Governor's designee indicating the completeness
of the submittal and the next steps to be taken in the review process.


II. Review of State Submittal


When reviewing the final inventory, USEPA used the Level I, II, and III, ozone nonattainment inventory quality review
checklists provided by the OAQPS to determine the acceptance and approvability of the final emission inventory.

Level I is essentially the initial level of broad review that USEPA performs in order to determine if the inventory
preparation guidance requirements found in the report ``Emission Inventory Requirements for Ozone SIPs'' (EPA-450/4-91-011)
have been met. The Level II review addresses completeness, procedures and consistency for each of the four general
source types in the inventory: stationary point and area sources, highway mobile sources, and non-highway mobile
sources. The data quality is also evaluated. Detailed Level I and II review procedures can be found in the following
document: ``Quality Review Guidelines for 1990 Base Year Emission Inventories,'' USEPA, OAQPS, Research Triangle
Park, NC, July 27, 1992. 
Level III review procedures are specified in a memorandum from J. David Mobley, Chief, Emissions Inventory Branch,
and G. T. Helms, Chief, Ozone/CO Programs Branch, to Air Branch Chiefs, Region I-X, ``1990 Ozone/CO SIP Emission
Inventory Level III Acceptance Criteria,'' October 7, 1992 and revised in a memorandum from John Seitz, Director,
OAQPS, to Regional Air Division Directors, Region I-X, ``Emission Inventory Issues,'' June 24, 1993. The Level
III review process is outlined here and consists of 10 points that the inventory must include. For a base year emission
inventory to be acceptable it must pass all of the following acceptance criteria:
1. An approved Inventory Preparation Plan (IPP) was provided and the Quality Assurance program contained in the IPP
was performed and its implementation documented. 
2. Adequate documentation was provided that enabled the reviewer to determine the emission estimation procedures
and the data sources used to develop the inventory. 
3. The point source inventory must be complete. 
4. Point source emissions must have been prepared or calculated according to the current USEPA guidance. 
5. The area source inventory must be complete. 
6. The area source emissions must have been prepared or calculated according to the current USEPA guidance. 
7. Biogenic emissions must have been prepared according to current USEPA guidance or another approved technique.

8. The method (e.g., Highway Performance Monitoring System or a network transportation planning model) used to develop
Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT)
 estimates must follow USEPA guidance, which is detailed in the document, ``Procedures for Emission Inventory Preparation,
volume IV: Mobile Sources,'' USEPA, Office of Mobile Sources and OAQPS, Ann Arbor, Michigan, and Research Triangle
Park, North Carolina, December 1992. The VMT development methods were adequately described and documented in the
inventory report.

9. The MOBILE model was correctly used to produce emission factors for each of the vehicle classes. 
10. Non-road mobile emissions were prepared according to current USEPA guidance for all of the source categories.

The base year emission inventory will be approved if it passes Levels I, II, and III of the review process. 
The USEPA reviewed the State submittal using the Level I, II and III criteria noted above. These findings are discussed
further in the Emission Inventory TSD. 



III. Proposed Action


The USEPA is proposing to fully approve the ozone emission inventory SIP submitted to USEPA for the Detroit/Ann Arbor
area as meeting the section 182(a)(1) requirements of the Act for emission inventories. The State has submitted a
complete inventory containing point, area, biogenic, on-road, and non-road mobile source data, and accompanying
documentation. Emissions from these groupings of sources are presented in the following tables: 



 








Detailed information on how each of the above source category groupings was determined is included in the Emission
Inventory TSD. 



B. Inspection and Maintenance 



A detailed analysis of the Michigan I/M SIP submittal is contained in the USEPA's TSD, dated February 1, 1994 from Brad
Beeson to the Docket, entitled ``Technical Review of the Michigan SIP Submittal to Revise the I/M Program in Southeast
Michigan'' (I/M TSD), which is available from the Region 5 office listed above. 



I. Background and Review Criteria


The Act requires States to make changes to improve existing I/M programs or implement new ones. Section 182(a)(2)(B)(i)
requires States to submit SIP revisions for any ozone nonattainment area which has been classified as marginal, pursuant
to section 181(a) of the Act, with an existing I/M program that was part of a SIP prior to enactment of the Act, or any area
that was required by the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1977 (1977 Act) to have an I/M program, to bring the program up to
the level required in pre-1990 USEPA guidance, or to what had been committed to previously in the SIP, whichever was
more stringent. Areas classified as moderate and worse ozone nonattainment areas were also subject to this requirement
to improve programs to this level. 

On November 15, 1993 the Michigan Department of Natural Resources (MDNR) submitted to the USEPA a revision to the Michigan
SIP which was intended to address the requirements for an I/M program in the Detroit-Ann Arbor area. The revision included
legislation which was signed into law by Governor Engler on November 13, 1993.

2

 





At the same time as this legislation was being developed, the MDNR was also in the process of developing a redesignation
request from nonattainment to attainment for the Detroit-Ann Arbor moderate ozone nonattainment area. 

Section 107(d)(3)(E) of the Act states that an area can be redesignated to attainment if certain conditions are met.
One of these conditions is that the USEPA has fully approved the applicable implementation plan under section 110(k)
and that the State has met all applicable requirements of section 110 and part D. The USEPA's current approvability
criteria for I/M in part require fully adopted rules for all aspects of the proposed SIP revision. In addition, all
SIPs submitted must be subject to public hearing before they can be approved.

On November 5, 1992 (57 FR 52950), the USEPA published a final rule (I/M Rule) establishing I/M requirements pursuant
to section 182. On June 28, 1994 the USEPA published a proposal to amend requirements pertaining to SIP submissions
for areas required to implement a basic I/M program that submit, and otherwise qualify for approval of, a redesignation
request (``Proposed I/M Redesignation Rule''). The authority for that amendment is discussed in that proposal.

The I/M Redesignation Rule proposes to allow areas that have requested redesignation to attainment, and are otherwise
eligible to obtain approval of the request, to defer adoption and implementation of otherwise applicable requirements
established in the originally promulgated I/M rule. For such areas, the USEPA does not believe it is necessary to revise
or adopt new regulations which are not essential for clean air, and which would not be implemented after redesignation
occurred because they are not necessary for maintenance. The proposed rule applies only to areas that by virtue of
their air quality classification are required to implement a basic I/M program and that submit and obtain approval
of a redesignation request. 
For such areas, the I/M Redesignation Rule proposes that the I/M component of the I/M SIP contain the following four
criteria: 

(1) Legislative authority for basic I/M meeting all the requirements of subpart S such that implementing regulations
can be adopted without any further legislative action, 

(2) A provision in the SIP providing that basic I/M be placed in the contingency measures portion of the maintenance
plan upon redesignation, 

(3) a contingency measure consisting of a commitment by the Governor or his/her designee to adopt regulations to implement
the I/M program in response to a specified triggering event, and 

(4) a commitment that includes an enforceable schedule for the adoption and implementation of a basic I/M program
including appropriate milestones in the event the contingency measure is triggered. 

In this rulemaking, the USEPA is considering Michigan's I/M submittal based on the proposed I/M requirements for
areas otherwise eligible for redesignation. If the State's redesignation request is not otherwise eligible for
approval at the time the USEPA takes final action on it, or if the proposed I/M requirements for redesignation are not
codified, Michigan's submittal will be judged by the current I/M approvability criteria as detailed in the USEPA's
final I/M rule promulgated on November 5, 1992. 

As discussed in the Proposed I/M Redesignation Rule, while the USEPA considers the redesignation request, the State
continues to be required to meet all the current SIP submission requirements including fully adopted rules and specific
implementation deadlines as required under 40 CFR  51.372 of the I/M Rule. If the State does not comply with these
requirements, it could be subject to sanctions pursuant to section 179. If the redesignation request is approved,
any sanctions already imposed or any sanctions clock already triggered would be terminated. 



II. Finding of USEPA Review


On November 15, 1993 the State submitted a redesignation request including I/M as a contingency measure for the Detroit-Ann
Arbor area to the USEPA.

Using the proposed I/M Redesignation Rule criteria for areas redesignating from nonattainment to attainment, Michigan's
I/M SIP submittal for the Detroit-Ann Arbor area is acceptable. The State held public hearings on the State's submittal
February 14, 1994 in Detroit, Michigan.
With respect to the first element of the four criteria, the proposed I/M Redesignation Rule requires ``legislative
authority for basic I/M such that implementing regulations can be adopted without any further legislative action.''
The legislation adopted by Michigan as a whole includes all the essential elements of a satisfactory basic I/M program.
The essential elements include:
 Describing the network type (``test and repair'').

3






 Listing of geographic coverage of program (Wayne, Oakland, Macomb, and possibly Washtenaw if redesignated,
or Wayne, Oakland, Macomb, Washtenaw, St. Clair, Livingston, and Monroe if not redesignated).
 Specifying the test type and procedure (idle test with BAR 90 equipment).
 Listing of other applicable testing procedures (visual tampering inspection).
 Defining subject vehicle population (1975 and later).
 Specifying testing frequency (every 12 months).
 Granting authority to a State agency to develop necessary rules (MDNR).
 Establishing the enforceable obligation in the rule (persons shall not drive a motor vehicle without a valid
emissions certificate of compliance or waiver).
In addition to defining the elements essential to the definition of an I/M program, the legislation grants the authority
to MDNR to develop the rest of the language necessary to make the program complete, including technical and administrative
details. No further legislative action is necessary to authorize or implement the program.
In the event of redesignation, the USEPA believes that the States's approach to implement I/M in the counties of Wayne,
Oakland, Macomb, and Washtenaw counties is acceptable and meets the population requirements (geographic coverage)
specified in the I/M rule (40 CFR 51.350).
Because the State has authorized and provided the essentials of an I/M program in its adopted legislation, the first
element of the criteria proposed in the I/M Redesignation Rule is satisfied.
The second element of the I/M Redesignation Rule proposes to require ``a provision in the SIP providing that basic
I/M be placed in the contingency measures portion of the maintenance plan upon redesignation.'' This requirement
is satisfied by the provision of section 8(2)(a) which requires a basic I/M program to be implemented as a contingency
measure.
The third and fourth elements of the proposed I/M Redesignation Rule require an enforceable schedule and commitment
by the Governor or his/her designee for the adoption and implementation of a basic I/M program upon a specified, appropriate
triggering event. These elements are satisfied based on language submitted to the USEPA on November 15, 1993 under
separate cover, within the State's redesignation application. Section 6.8.3 of the State's Southeast Michigan
Redesignation TSD states ``implementation of the contingency measure[s] will be completed in a time-frame consistent
with schedules of implementation required for SIPs under title I of the Act and corresponding regulations.'' This
commitment was submitted to the USEPA on November 15, 1993 under the signature of Roland Harmes, the Governor's designee.
The USEPA assumes that the effective date of the basic I/M legislation as a contingency measure is the date that the
State determines that a basic I/M program is necessary, as shown by the urban airshed model (UAM), to correct a violation
of the ozone NAAQS. The USEPA further assumes that the basic I/M program will be implemented in the Detroit-Ann Arbor
area as a contingency measure 1 year from the effective date of the legislation as stipulated in the I/M rule 40 CFR 51.373(b).

4






While the USEPA is proposing approval of the State's I/M submittal based on the criteria proposed in the I/M Redesignation
Rule, if the State's redesignation request is not approved, or if the alternative approval criteria applicable to
redesignation is not codified as proposed, the State's submittal must be judged against the current I/M approvability
criteria which require fully adopted rules for all aspects of the program, as detailed in USEPA's final I/M rule of
promulgated on November 5, 1992. The State's submittal would then not be approvable because the submittal does not
include detailed rules, including cut points, test procedures and standards, quality control procedures, waiver
provisions, and program compliance and oversight.

III. Proposed Action


Because the State's submittal meets the I/M approvability criteria for areas redesignating from nonattainment
to attainment, USEPA is proposing to approve the I/M plan for the Detroit-Ann Arbor area that was submitted as a revision
to the Michigan SIP. Alternatively, USEPA is proposing to disapprove the State's I/M SIP for the Detroit-Ann Arbor
area if the State's redesignation request is ultimately not approved or if the I/M Redesignation Rule is not codified
as proposed in USEPA's I/M rule before the USEPA finalizes its approval of the redesignation.


C. Redesignation


Under the Act, nonattainment areas can be redesignated to attainment if sufficient data are available to warrant
such changes and the area satisfies other criteria contained in section 107(d)(3) of the Act. On November 12, 1993
the State submitted a redesignation request and section 175A maintenance plan. If approved, the section 175A maintenance
plan would become a federally enforceable part of the SIP for the Detroit-Ann Arbor area.
A detailed analysis of the Michigan Redesignation Request and section 175A Maintenance Plan SIP submittal for the
Detroit-Ann Arbor area is contained in the USEPA's TSD, dated February 24, 1994 from Jacqueline Nwia to the Docket,
entitled ``TSD for the Request to Redesignate the Detroit/Ann Arbor, Michigan Moderate Nonattainment Area to Attainment
for Ozone and the Proposed Revision to the Michigan Ozone SIP for a 175A Maintenance Plan'' and ``Amendments to the
February 24, 1994 TSD for the Request to Redesignate the Detroit/Ann Arbor, Michigan Moderate Nonattainment Area
to Attainment for Ozone and the Proposed Revision to the Michigan Ozone SIP for a 175A Maintenance Plan,'' dated June
21, 1994 (Redesignation/Maintenance Plan TSD), which are available from the Region 5 office listed above.


I. Background


The 1977 Act required areas that were designated nonattainment based on a failure to meet the ozone NAAQS, to develop
SIPs with sufficient control measures to expeditiously attain and maintain the standard. The Detroit-Ann Arbor
area was designated under section 107 of the 1977 Act as nonattainment with respect to the ozone NAAQS (43 FR 8962, March
3, 1978 and 43 FR 45993, October 5, 1978).
After enactment of the amended Act on November 15, 1990 the nonattainment designation of the Detroit-Ann Arbor area
continued by operation of law according to section 107(d)(1)(C)(i) of the Act; furthermore, it was classified by
operation of law as moderate for ozone pursuant to section 181(a)(1) (56 FR 56694, November 6, 1991 and 57 FR 56762,
November 30, 1992), codified at 40 CFR 81.323.
The Detroit-Ann Arbor area more recently has ambient monitoring data that show no violations of the ozone NAAQS, during
the period from 1991 through 1993. The area, therefore, became eligible for redesignation from nonattainment to
attainment consistent with the amended Act, and to ensure continued attainment of the ozone standard, Michigan also
submitted an ozone maintenance SIP for the Detroit-Ann Arbor on November 12, 1993. On 
November 12, 1993 Michigan requested redesignation of the area to attainment with respect to the ozone NAAQS. On October
22, 1993 Michigan held a public hearing on the maintenance plan component of the redesignation request.

II. Evaluation Criteria



The 1990 Amendments revised section 107(d)(3)(E) to provide five specific requirements that an area must meet in
order to be redesignated from nonattainment to attainment. 

1. The area must have attained the applicable NAAQS; 
2. The area has met all relevant requirements under section 110 and part D of the Act; 
3. The area has a fully approved SIP under section 110(k) of the Act; 
4. The air quality improvement must be permanent and enforceable; 
5. The area must have a fully approved maintenance plan pursuant to section 175A of the Act. 



III. Review of State Submittal


The Michigan redesignation request for the Detroit-Ann Arbor area will meet the five requirements of section 107(d)(3)(E),
noted above, if the VOC RACT ``fix-up,''

5

 and ``catch-up,''

6

 and major non-CTG submittals

7

, the 1990 base year emission inventory, basic I/M, and the section 182(f) NO

X

 exemption petition are also fully approved by the USEPA.

8

 Because the maintenance plan is a critical element of the redesignation request, USEPA will discuss its evaluation
of the maintenance plan under its analysis of the redesignation request. USEPA's Redesignation/Maintenance Plan
TSD contains a more in-depth analysis of the submittal with respect to certain of these evaluation criteria. 








1. Attainment of the ozone NAAQS



The Michigan request is based on an analysis of quality-assured ozone air quality data which is relevant to the maintenance
plan and to the redesignation request. Ambient air ozone monitoring data for calendar year 1991 through calendar
year 1993

9

 show an expected exceedance rate for the ozone standard of less than 1.0 per year of the ozone NAAQS in the Detroit-Ann
Arbor area (40 CFR 50.9 and appendix H). Because the Detroit-Ann Arbor area has complete quality-assured data showing
no violations of the standard over the most recent consecutive three calendar year period, the Detroit-Ann Arbor
area has met the first statutory criterion of attainment of the ozone NAAQS. The State committed to continue monitoring
in this area in accordance with 40 CFR part 58. (If, however, complete quality assured data shows violations of the
ozone NAAQS before the final USEPA action on this redesignation, the USEPA proposes that it disapprove the redesignation
request.)

2. Meeting Applicable Requirements of Section 110 and Part D



On May 6, 1980 (45 FR 29801) and February 7, 1985 (50 FR 5250), USEPA fully approved Michigan's SIP for the Detroit-Ann
Arbor area as meeting the requirements of section 110(a)(2) and part D of the 1977 Act with the exception that Michigan
must meet the part D RACT requirements for the ozone SIP. The 1990 Act, however, modified section 110(a)(2) and, under
part D, revised section 172 and added new requirements for all nonattainment areas. Therefore, for purposes of redesignation,
to satisfy the requirement that the SIP meet all applicable requirements under the 1990 Act, USEPA has reviewed the
SIP to ensure that it contains all measures that were due under the amended 1990 Act prior to or at the time Michigan submitted
its redesignation request for the Detroit-Ann Arbor area. The USEPA interprets section 107(d)(3)(E)(v) to mean
that for a redesignation request to be approved, the State has met all requirements that applied to the subject area
prior to or at the time of the submission of a complete redesignation request. Requirements of the Act that come due
subsequently, continue to be applicable to the area at those later dates [see section 175A(c)] and, if the redesignation
of the area is disapproved, the State remains obligated to fulfill those requirements. 

(A.) 

Section 110 Requirements.

 Although section 110 was amended by the Act, the Detroit-Ann Arbor area SIP meets the requirements of amended section
110(a)(2). A number of the requirements did not change in substance and, therefore, USEPA believes that the pre-amendment
SIP met these requirements. As to those requirements that were amended (57 FR 27936 and 23939, June 23, 1993) many are
duplicative of other requirements of the Act. The USEPA has analyzed the SIP and determined that it is consistent with
the requirements of amended section 110(a)(2). 

(B.) 

Part D Requirements.

 Before the Detroit-Ann Arbor area may be redesignated to attainment, it must have fulfilled the applicable requirements
of part D. Under part D, an area's classification indicates the requirements to which it will be subject. Subpart 1
of part D sets forth the basic nonattainment requirements applicable to all nonattainment areas, classified as well
as nonclassifiable. Subpart 2 of part D establishes additional requirements for nonattainment areas classified
under table 1 of section 181(a). As described in the General Preamble for the Implementation of title 1, specific requirements
of subpart 2 may override subpart 1's general provisions (57 FR 13501 (April 16, 1992)). The Detroit-Ann Arbor area
was classified as moderate (56 FR 56694, November 6, 1991), codified at 40 CFR 81.323. Therefore, in order to be redesignated
to attainment, the State must meet the applicable requirements of subpart 1 of part D_specifically sections 172(c)
and 176 as well as the applicable requirements of subpart 2 of part D. 

(B1.) Subpart 1 of Part D_Section 172(c) Provisions. Section 172(c) sets forth general requirements applicable
to all nonattainment areas. Under 172(b), the section 172(c) requirements are applicable as determined by the Administrator,
but no later than 3 years after an area has been designated as nonattainment under the amended Act. The USEPA has not
determined that these requirements are applicable to ozone nonattainment areas on or before November 12, 1993_the
date the State submitted a complete redesignation request for the Detroit-Ann Arbor area. Therefore, the State was
not required to meet these requirements for redesignation purposes. In addition, as discussed below, Michigan has
either satisfied the section 172(c) requirements or, as is the case for several of them, they lose their continued
force once an area has demonstrated attainment and maintenance of the ozone NAAQS. 
(1) RFP is defined as progress that a nonattainment area must make each year toward attainment of the ozone NAAQS. This
requirement only has relevance during the time it takes an area to attain the NAAQS. Because the Detroit-Ann Arbor
area has attained the ozone NAAQS, its SIP has already achieved the necessary RFP toward that goal. 

(2) In addition, because the Detroit-Ann Arbor has attained the ozone NAAQS and is no longer subject to an RFP requirement,
the section 172(c)(9) contingency measures are not applicable unless the redesignation request and maintenance
plan are not finally approved. Such contingency measures must take effect if the area fails to meet an RFP milestone
or fails to attain the ozone NAAQS; the Detroit-Ann Arbor area no longer has RFP milestones and has already attained
the NAAQS. However, section 175A contingency measures still apply. 

(3) Similarly, once an area is redesignated to attainment, nonattainment new source review (NSR) requirements are
not generally applicable. The area then becomes subject to prevention of significant deterioration (PSD) requirements
instead of the NSR program (57 FR 13564). The State has an acceptable program for review of new sources (45 FR 29790,
May 6, 1980 and 47 FR 3765, February 7, 1985). The PSD program was delegated to the State of Michigan on September 10,
1979 and amended on November 7, 1983 and September 26, 1988. Moreover, as discussed with respect to the NSR requirements
of part D, the USEPA believes that the applicability of the part C PSD program to maintenance areas makes it unnecessary
to require that an area have obtained full approval of the NSR revisions required by part D in order to be redesignated.


(4) The 172(c)(3) requirement for an emissions inventory has been met by submission and proposed approval of the 1990
base year emission inventory required by section 182(a)(1). 

(5) No additional Reasonably Available Control Measures (RACM) controls beyond what may already be required in the
SIP are necessary upon redesignation to attainment. The General Preamble (57 FR 13560, April 16, 1992) explains that
section 172(c)(1) requires the plans for all nonattainment areas to provide for the implementation of all RACM as
expeditiously as practicable. The EPA interprets this requirement to impose a duty on all nonattainment areas to
consider all available control measures and to adopt and implement such measures as are reasonably available for
implementation in the area as components of the areas attainment demonstration. Because attainment has been reached,
no additional measures are needed to provide for attainment. 
(6) For purposes of redesignation, the Michigan SIP was reviewed to ensure that all requirements of section 110(a)(2),
containing general SIP elements, under the Act were satisfied. Title 40 CFR 52.1172 evidences that the Michigan SIP
was approved under section 110 of the Act, and further that it satisfies all part D, title I (as amended in 1977) requirements
on May 6, 1980 (45 FR 29801) and February 7, 1985 (50 FR 5250) with the exception that Michigan must meet the part D RACT
requirements for the ozone SIP.

(B2.) Subpart 1 of Part D_Section 176 Conformity Provisions. Section 176(c) of the Act requires States to revise their
SIPs to establish criteria and procedures to ensure that Federal actions, before they are taken, conform to the air
quality planning goals in the applicable State SIP. The requirement to determine conformity applies to transportation
plans, programs and projects developed, funded or approved under title 23 U.S.C. or the Federal Transit Act (``transportation
conformity''), as well as to all other Federal actions (``general conformity''). Section 176 further provides that
the conformity revisions to be submitted by States must be consistent with Federal conformity regulations that the
Act required the USEPA to promulgate. Congress provided for the State revisions to be submitted on year after the date
for promulgation of the final USEPA conformity regulations. When that date passed without such promulgation, USEPA's
General Preamble for the implementation of title I informed States that its conformity regulations would establish
a submittal date [see 57 FR 13498, 13557 (April 16, 1992)]. The USEPA promulgated final transportation conformity
regulations on November 24, 1993 (58 FR 62188) and general conformity regulations on November 30, 1993 (58 FR 63214).
These conformity rules require that States adopt both transportation and general conformity provisions in the SIP
for areas designated nonattainment or subject to a maintenance plan approved under section 175A of the Act. Pursuant
to section 51.396 of the transportation conformity rule and section 51.851 of the general conformity rule, the State
of Michigan is required to submit a SIP revisions containing transportation and general conformity criteria and
procedures consistent with those established in the Federal rule by November 25 and 30, 1994, respectively. Because
the deadline for such submittals has not yet come due, it is not an applicable requirement, under section 107(d)(3)(E)(v),
for approval of this redesignation request. 

(B3.) Subpart 2 Requirements. Detroit-Ann Arbor is a moderate ozone nonattainment area. Under subpart 2, as of the
date the State submitted a complete redesignation request, it is required to have met the requirements of section
182(a)(1), (2), and (3), section 182(b)(2), and (4), and section 182(f). The State has submitted SIP revisions which
have not yet been approved by the USEPA but must be in order to find that the State has met all the applicable requirements
of the following sections of the Act: Section 182(a)(1) 1990 base year emission inventory, section 182(a)(2)(A)
VOC RACT ``fix-ups,'' section 182(a)(2)(B) I/M fix-ups, section 182(b)(2) (``catch-ups'') VOC RACT for each VOC
source covered by a CTG issued between enactment of the Act and the attainment date (since the due date for these rules
is November 15, 1994 which has not come due yet, it is not a requirement for approval of this redesignation request),
all VOC sources covered by any CTG issued before the date of enactment of the Act, and all other major stationary sources
of VOC located in the area, section 182(b)(4) basic I/M, and section 182(f) NO

X

 requirements. Section 182(b)(3) Stage II vapor recovery was also an applicable requirement. However, the ``onboard
rule''

10

 was published on April 6, 1994 and section 202(a)(6) of the Act provides that once onboard rules are promulgated, Stage
II vapor recovery will no longer be a requirement. In addition, Michigan's emission statement program SIP submitted
to satisfy the section 182(a)(3)(B) requirement was fully approved in a final USEPA rulemaking on March 8, 1994 (59
FR 10752). The USEPA is proposing to approve this redesignation request notwithstanding the lack of fully-approved
provisions submitted in compliance with the NSR requirements of part D, section 182(b)(5) of the CAA. The USEPA believes,
as suggested by the General Preamble at 57 FR 13564 (April 16, 1992), that the applicability of the part C PSD program
to maintenance areas makes it unnecessary to require that an area have obtained full approval of NSR revisions required
by part D in order to be redesignated. The USEPA believes that this interpretation of the Act is appropriate notwithstanding
section 175A(d)'s requirements that the contingency provisions of a maintenance plan include a commitment on the
part of the State to implement all measures, to control the relevant air pollutant, that were contained in the SIP prior
to redesignation. The term ``measure'' is not defined in section 175A(d) and it appears that Congress utilized the
terms ``measure'' or ``control measure'' differently in different provisions of the CAA that concern the PSD and
NSR permitting programs.

Compare 

section 110(a)(2)(A) and (C) with section 161. In light of this ambiguity in the use of the term ``measure,'' the USEPA
believes that the term ``measure'' as used in section 175A(d) may be interpreted so as not to include NSR permitting
programs. That this is an appropriate interpretation is further supported by USEPA's historical practice dating
back even before the 1990 CAA, of not requiring redesignating areas to demonstrate through modeling or otherwise
a justification for replacing the nonattainment NSR program with the PSD program once an area was redesignated. Rather
the USEPA has historically allowed the NSR program to be automatically replaced by the PSD program upon redesignation.
Michigan has presented an adequate demonstration that the State has met all the requirements applicable to the area
under section 110 and part D. The final approval of this redesignation request is contingent on the final approval
of the SIP submittals as noted above. These requirements, their applicability and status are discussed in more detail
in the USEPA's Redesignation/Maintenance Plan TSD. 




3. Fully Approved SIP Under Section 110(k) of the Act



In other sections of this action, USEPA is proposing approval of the 1990 base year emission inventory and basic I/M
(meeting the criteria of the June 28, 1994 proposed I/M Redesignation Rule). The SIP submittals for satisfying the
requirements for VOC RACT catch-ups, and fix-ups are being acted upon in a separate action. The 182(f) NO

X

 exemption petition also is being acted upon in a separate action. Once USEPA fully approves these submittals, the
State will have a fully approved SIP under section 110(k), which also meets the applicable requirements of section
110 and part D as discussed above. 




4. Improvement in Air Quality Due to Permanent and Enforceable 
Measures 




Under the pre-amended Act, USEPA approved the Michigan SIP control strategy for the Detroit-Ann Arbor nonattainment
area, satisfied that the rules and the emission reductions achieved as a result of those rules were enforceable. Furthermore,
numerous Federal measures apply to the Detroit-Ann Arbor area. The State provided a detailed discussion of the development
of the emission reductions of ozone precursors (VOC and NO

X

) from 1988-1993. The State attributed the improvement in air quality that led to attainment of the ozone NAAQS
to the federally enforceable Federal Motor Vehicle Control Program (FMVCP) and lower Reid Vapor Pressure (RVP)

11

 control measures. The emission reductions achieved from 1988 through 1993 are 226 tons VOC (21 percent) and 45 tons
of NO

X

 (3.4 percent) per day. In association with its emission inventory discussed below, the State demonstrated that point
source VOC emissions were not artificially low due to local economic downturn. This was accomplished by setting all
growth factors at a minimum value of 1.0 for 1990 and beyond. The USEPA finds that the combination of existing USEPA-approved
SIP and Federal measures contribute to the permanence and enforceability of reduction in ambient ozone levels that
have allowed the area to attain the NAAQS. 






5. Fully Approved Maintenance Plan Under Section 175A 





Section 175A of the Act sets forth the elements of a maintenance plan for areas seeking redesignation from nonattainment
to attainment. The plan must demonstrate continued attainment of the applicable NAAQS for at least 10 years after
the Administrator approves a redesignation to attainment. Eight years after the redesignation, the State must submit
a revised maintenance plan which demonstrates attainment for the 10 years following the initial 10-year period.
To provide for the possibility of future NAAQS violations, the maintenance plan must contain contingency measures,
with a schedule for implementation, adequate to assure prompt correction of any air quality problems. Section 175A(d)
requires that the contingency provisions include a requirement that the State will implement all control measures
that were contained in the SIP prior to redesignation as an attainment area. In this action, USEPA is proposing approval
of the State of Michigan's maintenance plan for the Detroit-Ann Arbor area because USEPA finds that Michigan's submittal
meets the requirements of section 175A provided that the State's contingency measures that were required as SIP revisions
prior to the submission of the redesignation request are fully approved. If USEPA determines after notice and comment
that it should give final approval to the maintenance plan, the Detroit-Ann Arbor nonattainment area will have a fully
approved maintenance plan in accordance with section 175A.

(A) 

Emissions Inventory_Base Year Inventory.

 The State has adequately developed an attainment emission inventory for 1993 that identifies 790 tons of VOC and 1336
tons of NO

x

 per day as the level of emissions in the area sufficient to attain the ozone NAAQS. The 1993 attainment inventory was
based on the comprehensive inventories of VOC and NO

X

 emissions from area, stationary, and mobile sources for 1990. Consistent with emission inventory guidance, the
1990 base year emission inventory represents 1990 average summer day actual emissions for the Detroit-Ann Arbor
area. Since the projected 1993 emissions are lower than the actual 1990 emissions (providing a more stringent attainment
inventory) and 1993 is the attainment year, it is appropriate to utilize projected 1993 emissions for the attainment
year inventory. Furthermore, the 1990 base year emission inventory was prepared in accordance with USEPA guidance.
USEPA's TSDs prepared for the 1990 base year emission inventory (Emission Inventory TSD) SIP revision and the redesignation
request (Redesignation/Maintenance Plan TSD) contain more in-depth details regarding the emission inventories
for the Detroit-Ann Arbor area. 

The 1990 base year emission inventory also served as the basis for calculations to demonstrate maintenance by projecting
emissions forward to the years 1993, 1996, 2000, and 2005. Projections are based on growth factors extracted from
the Southeast Michigan Council of Governments Regional Development Forecast (RDF). Supplemental information
used in the development of emission projections include source-specific data for electric utilities, automobile
manufacturing, aircraft, and gasoline marketing. 

Growth factors are derived from employment forecasts by two-digit Source Industrial Code by county. In addition,
product output data was used to develop growth factors for motor vehicle manufacturing, and utilities. The area source
growth factors used from RDF were based on population or housing data. Furthermore, all growth factors that were less
than 1.0 were set equal to 1.0 for 1990 and beyond to offset any effects of negative growth possibly due to economic downturns.


In developing the mobile source emission estimates, the MOBILE5a model was used. The significant input parameters
for the MOBILE5a model are analyzed in detail in the Redesignation/Maintenance Plan TSD. 

The stationary source emission estimates (point and area) were developed using the geocoded emissions modeling
and projections system (GEMAP). This emission projection model and supporting documentation were reviewed by Region
5 and the Emission Inventory Branch of the OAQPS during the developmental stages of the redesignation request and
appear to be acceptable since GEMAP employs methodologies equivalent to the applicable USEPA guidance on emission
projections (June 21, 1993 letter to John Schroeder and August 3, 1993 Record of Conversation with OAQPS, RADIAN and
Region 5).

(B.) 

Demonstration of Maintenance_Projected Inventories.

 In order to demonstrate continued attainment, the State projected anthropogenic 1990 actual emissions of VOC and
NO

X

 emissions to the years 1993, 1996, 2000, and 2005. These emission estimates are presented in the tables below and demonstrate
that the VOC and NO

X

 emissions will remain below the attainment year emissions (1993). In fact, the emissions projections through the
year 2005 show that emissions will be reduced from 1993 levels by 21 tons of VOC and 98 tons of NO

X

 per day by 2005. These emission reductions are primarily the result of the implementation of FMVCP. It is noted that
the emission projections are conservative since they do not account for emission reductions that will result from
the anticipated implementation of other control measures and programs during this time period.

<PARENT> FR940721-1-00009 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The emission projection methodologies used for the maintenance demonstration are the same as those used for the attainment
inventory and discussed above. 

The emission projections show that the emissions are not expected to exceed the level of the base year 1993 inventory
during the 10-year maintenance period. Further emission reductions that will occur during this maintenance demonstration
that are not accounted for in the emission projections presented in the tables above such as title III maximum achievable
control technology for air toxics, and onboard refueling vapor recovery. The projected emission inventories were
prepared in accordance with USEPA guidance. Finally, USEPA's Redesignation/Maintenance Plan TSD contains more
in-depth details regarding the projected emission inventories for the Detroit-Ann Arbor area. 

To demonstrate maintenance out to the year 2005 following redesignation, the State did not rely on certain SIP-approved
measures. The State now requests that these measures (discussed below) be moved from the applicable SIP into the maintenance
plan as contingency measures. 

The State has demonstrated maintenance without basic I/M, Stage I expansion

12

, Stage II and NO

X

 RACT. The Act required a SIP submittal for these control measures prior to the submittal of the redesignation request,
and consequently, they are required to be fully adopted and fully approved into the SIP prior to or at the time of full
approval of the redesignation request. However, since the State has demonstrated attainment and maintenance without
these programs these measures can be incorporated into the area's maintenance plan as contingency measures (see,
e.g., September 17, 1993 Shapiro memorandum). The June 28, 1994 Proposed I/M Redesignation Rule proposes to allow
basic I/M to be included as a contingency measure in the form of enabling legislation. Stage I must be fully adopted
since it is a SIP element that was due prior to the submittal of the redesignation request. Stage II, however, does not
have to be fully adopted. In fact, since the ``onboard rule'' was published on April 6, 1994 Stage II is no longer a requirement
(section 202(a)(6) of the Act). However, if the State chooses to include this program as a contingency measure, enabling
legislation would suffice. Michigan has chosen to retain Stage II as a contingency measure in the maintenance plan.
Finally, the State submitted to USEPA a section 182(f) NO

X

 exemption petition based on 1991-1993 ambient air quality data that demonstrates that the area is attaining
the ozone NAAQS. The USEPA is currently taking action on this submittal. Since the Detroit-Ann Arbor area has demonstrated
that it can maintain the standard without the implementation of these programs, USEPA proposes that the maintenance
plan be approved with these elements as contingency measures. In addition, based on the maintenance demonstration,
the USEPA plans to propose approval of the basic I/M enabling legislation (based on the June 28, 1994 proposed I/M Redesignation
Rule), and the Stage I rule and 182(f) NO

X

 exemption petition in a separate FR action. 






C. Verification of Continued Attainment 



Continued attainment of the ozone NAAQS in the Detroit-Ann Arbor area depends, in part, on the State's efforts toward
tracking indicators of continued attainment during the maintenance period. The tracking plan for the Detroit-Ann
Arbor area consists of two components; continued ambient ozone monitoring and inventory updates. To demonstrate
ongoing compliance with the NAAQS, Michigan will continue to monitor ozone levels throughout the area. The State
will also conduct periodic inventories for the redesignated area every 3 years using the most recent emission factors,
models and methodologies. The inventories will begin in 1996 with completion of the 1996 inventory by July 1, 1998.
Periodic inventories for 1999, 2002, and 2005 will be completed with submittal to the USEPA on the first of October
2 years after the inventory year. The periodic inventory will consist of reviewing the assumptions of the maintenance
demonstration such as VMT, population, employment, etc. If substantial changes are discovered, the State will reproject
the emissions for the maintenance period.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940721-1-00028 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940721-1-00009 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The contingency plan contains only one trigger, a monitored air quality violation of the ozone NAAQS, as defined in
40 CFR 50.9. The trigger date will be the date that the State certifies to the USEPA that the air quality data are quality
assured and no later than 30 days after an ambient air quality violation is monitored. 



D. Contingency Plan 



The level of VOC and NO

X

 emissions in the Detroit-Ann Arbor area will largely determine its ability to stay in compliance with the ozone NAAQS
in the future. Despite best efforts to demonstrate continued compliance with the NAAQS, the ambient air pollutant
concentrations may exceed or violate the NAAQS. Therefore, as required by section 175A of the Act, Michigan has provided
contingency measures with a schedule for implementation in the event of a future ozone air quality problem. Contingency
measures contained in the plan include basic I/M, NO

X

 RACT, Stage I expansion, Stage II, RVP reduction to 7.8 psi and intensified RACT for degreasing operations. In instances
where the contingency measures must be actually adopted and implemented, the schedules specified for these SIPs
in the Act and any corresponding regulations will be observed, with the exception of implementation of 7.8 RVP and
intensified degreasing rules which will commence 12 months after the decision to employ these measures. Once the
triggering event, a violation of the ozone NAAQS, is confirmed, the State will implement one or more appropriate contingency
measure. Selection of the contingency measure(s) will be based on a technical analysis using UAM. The Governor will
select the contingency measures within 6 months of a triggering event. The adoption and implementation schedules
for the selected contingency measure(s) will be submitted to the USEPA with the UAM analysis. The USEPA understands,
on the basis of the State's submission, that the adoption and implementation schedules specified in the Act and any
corresponding regulations would be observed; therefore, the following schedules will be applicable for the contingency
measures specified in the contingency plan: 

 Basic I/M would be implemented as a contingency measure 1 year from the effective date of the legislation, which
would be the date of the decision to employ a basic I/M program to correct a violation of the ozone NAAQS. Part 40 CFR 51.373(b)
stipulates implementation of basic I/M within 1 year of obtaining legal authority. 

 NO

X

 RACT rules would be submitted 2 years from date of the decision to employ NOx RACT as a contingency measure. The NO

X

 RACT rules would be implemented 30.5 months from the date NOx RACT rules are submitted to the USEPA or 54.5 months from
the date of the decision to employ NO

X

 RACT as a contingency measure. This schedule is consistent with section 182(b)(2)(C) which is the schedule applicable
to the adoption and implementation of NO

X

 RACT as specified by section 182(f). 

 Implementation of Stage I expansion to the entire seven county Detroit-Ann Arbor area (currently, Stage I
is implemented in Wayne, Oakland and Macomb counties) would be in accordance with the schedule contained in Michigan's
Stage I legislation (Senate Bill 726, section 9i). Gasoline dispensing facilities of any size constructed after

November 15, 1990 must implement Stage I within 6 months of the decision to employ Stage I as a contingency measure.
Existing facilities dispensing 100,000 gallons or more of gasoline a month must implement Stage I within 1 year and
facilities dispensing less than 100,000 gallons of gasoline a month must implement Stage I within 2 years of the decision
to employ Stage I as a contingency measure. 

 Stage II would be implemented according to the same schedule set forth for Stage I, since they are contained
in the same legislation (Senate Bill 726), but will only be implemented in the counties of Wayne, Oakland, Macomb and
Washtenaw. 

Under separate cover, the State has submitted to the USEPA, as SIP revisions, fully adopted legislation allowing
implementation of a basic I/M program, Stage I, and Stage II in the Detroit-Ann Arbor area. The legislation provide
for implementation of these programs as contingency measures within areas redesignated to attainment for ozone.


The USEPA's Redesignation/Maintenance Plan TSD provides a more detailed discussion of each contingency measure.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940721-1-00029 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940721-1-00009 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The USEPA finds that the five contingency measures provided in the State submittal meet the requirements of section
175A(d) of the Act since they would promptly correct any violation of the ozone NAAQS. 


E. Subsequent Maintenance Plan Revisions 


In accordance with section 175A(b) of the Act, the State has agreed to submit a revised maintenance SIP 8 years after
the area is redesignated to attainment. Such revised SIP will provide for maintenance for an additional 10 years.



IV. Proposed Action


The USEPA proposes to approve the Detroit-Ann Arbor ozone maintenance plan as a SIP revision meeting the requirements
of section 175A if there is full and final approval of the outstanding VOC RACT requirements previously discussed,
1990 base year emission inventory, basic I/M (meeting the criteria of the June 28, 1994 proposed I/M Redesignation
Rule), and the section 182(f) NO

X

 exemption petition. In addition, the USEPA is proposing approval of the redesignation request for the Detroit-Ann
Arbor area, subject to final approval of the maintenance plan, because the State has demonstrated compliance with
the requirements of section 107(d)(3)(E) for redesignation pending full approval of the SIP elements listed above.
(In the alternative, if ambient air quality violations occur before USEPA takes final action on the proposed redesignation
or if the USEPA does not fully approve any of the SIP revisions listed above, the USEPA proposes to disapprove this redesignation
request.) 
Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for revision to any SIP. Each request for revision to the SIP shall be considered separately in light of specific technical,
economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements. 
Ozone SIPs are designed to satisfy the requirements of part D of the Act and to provide for attainment and maintenance
of the ozone NAAQS. This proposed redesignation should not be interpreted as authorizing the State to delete, alter,
or rescind any of the VOC or NO

X

 emission limitations and restrictions contained in the approved ozone SIP. Changes to ozone SIP VOC regulations
rendering them less stringent than those contained in the USEPA approved plan cannot be made unless a revised plan
for attainment and maintenance is submitted to and approved by USEPA. Unauthorized relaxations, deletions, and
changes could result in both a finding of nonimplementation [section 173(b) of the Act] and in a SIP deficiency call
made pursuant to section 110(a)(2)(H) of the Act. 


D. Procedural Background 


This action has been classified as a Table 2 Action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in
the 

Federal Register

 on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214-2225). A revision to the SIP processing review tables was approved by the Acting
Assistant Administrator for Office of Air and Radiation on October 4, 1993 (Michael Shapiro's memorandum to Regional
Administrators). A future action will inform the general public of these tables. On January 6, 1989, the Office of
Management and Budget (OMB) waived Table 2 and 3 SIP revisions from the requirement of section 3 of Executive Order
12291 for a period of 2 years (54 FR 2222). The USEPA has submitted a request for a permanent waiver for Table 2 and Table
3 SIP revisions. OMB has agreed to continue the waiver until such time as it rules on USEPA's request. This request continued
in effect under Executive Order 12866 which superseded Executive order 12291 on September 30, 1993. 


E. Regulatory Process 


Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. section 600 

et seq., 

the USEPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small
entities. 5 U.S.C. section 603 and 604. Alternatively, the USEPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant
impact on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit
enterprises, and government entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000. 
The SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter I, part D of the Act do not create any new requirements, but simply
approve requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal SIP approval does not impose
any new requirements, I certify that it does not have a significant impact on any small entities affected. Moreover,
due to the nature of the Federal-State relationship under the Act, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis
would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of State action. The Act forbids USEPA to base
its actions concerning SIP's on such grounds.

I. Introduction 



EPA Region II announces its intent to delete the C&J Disposal site from the NPL and requests public comment on this
action. The NPL is Appendix B to the NCP, which EPA promulgated pursuant to Section 105 of CERCLA, as amended. EPA identifies
sites that appear to present a significant risk to public health, welfare, or the environment and maintains the NPL
as the list of those sites. Sites on the NPL may be the subject of remedial actions financed by the Hazardous Substances
Superfund Response Trust Fund (the ``Fund''). Pursuant to Section 300.425 (e)(3) of the NCP, any site deleted from
the NPL remains eligible for Fund-financed remedial actions, if conditions at such site warrant action. 

EPA will accept comments concerning the C&J Disposal site for thirty (30) days after publication of this notice
in the 

Federal Register

 (until August 19, 1994). 

Section II of this notice explains the criteria for deleting sites from the NPL. Section III discusses procedures
that EPA is using for this action. Section IV discusses how the C&J Disposal site meets the deletion criteria.




II. NPL Deletion Criteria 



The NCP establishes the criteria that the Agency uses to delete sites from the NPL. In accordance with 40 CFR Section
300.425 (e), sites may be deleted from the NPL where no further response is appropriate. In making this determination,
EPA will consider whether any of the following criteria have been met: 

1. That responsible or other persons have implemented all appropriate response actions required; or 

2. All appropriate Fund-financed responses under CERCLA have been implemented, and no further cleanup by responsible
parties is appropriate; or 

3. The remedial investigation has shown that the release poses no significant threat to public health or the environment
and, therefore, taking remedial measures is not appropriate.

III. Deletion Procedures 



The NCP provides that EPA shall not delete a site from the NPL until the State in which the release was located has concurred,
and the public has been afforded an opportunity to comment on the proposed deletion. Deletion of a site from the NPL
does not affect responsible party liability or impede agency efforts to recover costs associated with response efforts.
The NPL is designed primarily for informational purposes and to assist agency management. 

The following procedures were used for the intended deletion of the C&J Disposal site: 

1. EPA Region II has recommended deletion and has prepared the relevant documents. 

2. The State of New York has concurred with the deletion decision. 

3. Concurrent with this Notice of Intent to Delete, a notice has been published in local newspapers and has been distributed
to appropriate federal, state and local officials, and other interested parties. This notice announces a thirty
(30) day public comment period on the deletion package starting on July 20, 1994 and concluding on August 19, 1994.


4. The Region has made all relevant documents available in the regional office and the local site information repository.


EPA Region II will accept and evaluate public comments and prepare a Responsiveness Summary which will address the
comments received, before a final decision is made. The Agency believes that deletion procedures should focus on
notice and comment at the local level. Comments from the local community may be most pertinent to deletion decisions.


If, after consideration of these comments, EPA decides to proceed with deletion, the EPA Regional Administrator
will place a Notice of Deletion in the 

Federal Register

. The NPL will reflect any deletions in the next update. Public notices and copies of the Responsiveness Summary will
be made available to local residents by EPA Region II. 



IV. Basis for Intended Site Deletion 



Site History and Background 



The C&J Disposal site, located in the Town of Eaton, Madison County, New York, included a rectangular disposal
trench which measured approximately 140 feet by 40 feet. The disposal trench was situated between a former railroad
bed and an active agricultural field, and was on property immediately adjacent to residential property owned by C&J
Leasing of Paterson, New Jersey. Approximately 100 feet south of where the trench was located is a small pond and adjacent
wetlands which drain to Woodman Pond, a back-up water supply for the Village of Hamilton. There are twelve residences
in the vicinity and downgradient of the site which use private wells as their source of drinking water. 

During the 1970s, the trench area was used for the disposal of industrial wastes, although never licensed or permitted
for that purpose. In March 1976, C&J Leasing was observed dumping what appeared to be paint sludges and other liquid
industrial waste materials into the trench. An inspection of the site by the New York State Department of Environmental
Conservation (NYSDEC) and the Village of Hamilton engineer revealed 75-100 drums lying in a pool of liquid waste.
The trench was subsequently covered with fill, reportedly by C&J Leasing, apparently burying the drums observed
in March 1976. 

Sampling was conducted at the site by NYSDEC in 1985 and by EPA in 1986. Surficial soil samples obtained from the site
revealed the presence of phenolic compounds, phthalates, various volatile organic compounds (VOCs), polynuclear
aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and lead. One of the phthalates, bis (2-ethylhexyl) phthalate, and elevated levels
of lead were detected in the sediments of the small pond. The sampling of local residential wells in 1986 and later in
1988, by the New York State Department of Health (NYSDOH), did not detect any contaminants from the site.

The site was placed on the NPL in March 1989. 

In April 1989, prior to the start of the RI/FS, the site was subject to an unauthorized excavation by the principals
of C&J Leasing, leaving two large holes and three stockpiles of soil and waste material. The drums that were believed
to have been previously buried may have been removed at this time, or earlier, and taken off-site. An extensive follow-up
investigation failed to determine where the drums may have been taken. 

In October 1989, EPA initiated the RI/FS. Results from the RI indicated that the contaminants at the site were confined
to the waste disposal trench, with the exception of some low levels of contamination in the sediments of the small pond.
The total volume of waste material and contaminated soil and debris in the disposal trench was estimated at 1,250 cubic
yards (i.e., contained in the area of 140 feet by 40 feet and to a depth of 6 feet). The waste was determined to be non-uniformly
distributed and comprised of soil mixed with a light-colored, friable, plastic-like residue and/or a similar synthetic
matter, crushed drums and plastic bags (drum liners) contaminated with the same or similar plastic residue, and some
wood debris. 

The primary contaminants found in the trench area were various phthalates (i.e., bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate,
di-n-octylphthalate, and di-n-butylphthalate), phenols (i.e., 2,4-dimethyl phenol, and 4-methylphenol) and
VOCs (i.e., benzene, ethylbenzene, toluene, xylenes, and 
4-methyl-2-pentanone). Lead, which was found at elevated levels during limited testing by EPA in 1986, was detected
above background levels in only one sample during extensive RI sampling. Lead was also found at significantly elevated
levels during EPA's post-RI sampling in 1991. A wide variety of PAHs were also found in the disposal trench and in surrounding
surface soils. Since the PAHs were attributable to the old railroad bed (due to their association with products used
for railroad construction, operation, and maintenance, as well as where the PAHs were located at the site), they were
considered to be background. 

While some of the waste materials in the trench were in direct contact with the shallow ground water, the contaminants
were found to be bound in the waste material and/or adsorbed to the adjacent soils and, therefore, were not migrating
to the ground water from the trench. Extensive chemical analysis of the eight local residential wells (serving twelve
residences) during the RI confirmed the prior results (i.e., that no contaminants from the site had migrated to these
wells). Seven ground-water monitoring wells (four shallow and three deep), including one well in the center of the
trench, also indicated no migration of contaminants from the trench to the ground water. 

Testing of the water in the small pond indicated no migration of soluble contaminants from the site. The low levels
of bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate and lead found in the sediments in the pond were attributable to overland soil transport
by surface-water runoff. 

The RI concluded that the potential for direct human and animal exposure, as well as the potential for future contaminant
migration to the ground water and surface water, existed at the site and there were no permanent controls in place to
prevent contaminant migration from the trench as a result of any deterioration or disturbance of the waste. 

Following completion of the RI/FS, site security was upgraded by EPA. The upgrade included installing two locked
gates, additional fencing, and posting of warning signs to restrict access of unauthorized persons. Also at this
time, EPA performed additional sampling at the site, in preparation for the off-site disposal/treatment of the contaminated
soil and debris. 

On March 28, 1991, a Record of Decision was signed, selecting as the remedy for the site the excavation and removal of
approximately 1,250 cubic yards of contaminated soil and debris, followed by its transportation to a permitted,
Resource Conservation and Recovery Act-compliant waste management facility for treatment/disposal. The selected
remedy included backfilling the trench with clean soil, re-vegetating the area, and quarterly monitoring of the
ground water and downgradient residential wells for a period of one year. In addition, no remediation of the small
pond was necessary because of the insignificant amount of contaminants in the sediments and because of the adverse
impact excavation would have on the pond and its ecosystem.

<TEXT>
 

Following the completion of the remedial design (RD) in August 1992, the remedial action (RA) commenced. Over the
course of the RA, which was completed in June 1993, over 2,400 cubic yards of contaminated soil and debris (i.e., 173
truckloads containing 3,514 tons of material) were removed from the site. No intact drums were encountered during
the excavation. Analysis of samples collected from monitoring wells located downgradient of the disposal trench
two weeks after backfilling the trench indicated no contaminants had migrated to the wells as a result of excavation
activities. Post-RA sampling by NYSDOH, as well as post-RA quarterly sampling by EPA, also indicated no contamination
migration to residential wells. 



Summary of Community Relations Activities 



Overall, there has been moderate community interest shown with respect to activities at the site. Initially, interest
was high due to the unauthorized excavation at the site, reports of neighborhood children playing at the site, the
possibility of contaminated wells in the neighborhood, and the potential to pollute Woodman Pond (which, in part,
contributed to the Village of Hamilton's decision to install municipal wells instead of continuing to use Woodman
Pond for municipal drinking water). Interest in the site declined, however, when the testing and re-testing of local
residential wells indicated that no contaminants attributable to the site were present in local wells, visible improvements
were made in site security, and on-going contact was maintained with local officials and the community. At 
a public meeting on February 13, 1991, EPA presented the results of the RI/FS and identified the preferred remedial
alternative for the site. The remedy presented for the site was extremely well received since it satisfied the prior
requests of local officials and citizens for the complete removal of the chemicals at the site from their community.




Summary of Operation and Maintenance and Five-Year Review Requirements 



There are no operation and maintenance requirements since all remediation activities have been completed. Because
the implemented remedy does not result in hazardous substances remaining on-site above health-based levels, the
five-year review does not apply. 



Summary of How the Deletion Criteria Has Been Met 



Residential well monitoring since 1986 has consistently indicated no contaminant migration to any of the local residential
wells from the site. RI and RD sampling results indicated no site-related contaminants in on- or off-site monitoring
wells. One year of post-RA quarterly sampling completed by EPA in January 1994 did not show any contaminants from the
site in either the on-site monitoring wells or the local residential wells. 

The primary pathways that threatened public health at the C&J Disposal site were direct exposure and possible
ingestion of the chemicals at the site, as well as the possible future contamination of the ground water and local wells
and the impact to the local environment from deterioration or disturbance of the contaminated waste. The results
of the post-RA monitoring confirm that excavation and removal of the contaminants of concern from the C&J Disposal
site renders both current and future pathways incomplete. 

EPA and the State have determined that the response actions undertaken at the C&J Disposal site are protective
of human health and the environment. 

In accordance with 40 CFR Section 300.425(e), sites may be deleted from the NPL where no further response is appropriate.
EPA, in consultation with the State, has determined that all appropriate responses under CERCLA have been implemented
and that no further cleanup by responsible parties is appropriate. Having met the deletion criteria, EPA proposes
to delete the C&J Disposal site from the NPL.

Medicare and State Health Care Programs: Fraud and Abuse; Clarification of the OIG Safe Harbor Anti-Kickback Provisions


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Office of Inspector General (OIG), HHS.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Proposed rule.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This proposed rule would clarify various aspects of safe harbor provisions originally published in the 

Federal Register

 on July 29, 1991 as a final rule (56 FR 35952). The safe harbor provisions have been specifically designed to set forth
those payment practices and business arrangements that will be protected from criminal prosecution and civil sanctions
under the anti-kickback provisions of the statute. This proposed rule would modify the original set of final safe
harbor provisions to give greater clarity to the rulemaking's original intent.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
I. Background


On July 29, 1991, we published in the 

Federal Register

 a final rule setting forth various safe harbor provisions to the Medicare and Medicaid anti-kickback statute (56
FR 35952). This regulation was authorized under section 14 of Public Law 100-93, the Medicare and Medicaid Patient
and Program Protection Act of 1987. The final rule specified those payment practices that will not be subject to criminal
prosecution under section 1128B(b) of the Social Security Act (the Act) (42 U.S.C. 1320a-7b(b)), and that will
not provide a basis for exclusion from Medicare or the State health care programs under section 1128(b)(7) of the Act
(42 U.S.C. 1320a-7(b)(7)).
Since publication of the final rule, we have become aware of a limited number of ambiguities that have created uncertainties
for health care providers trying to comply with the safe harbor provisions. We have also become aware of certain instances
where our intent, either to protect or preclude protection for particular business arrangements, is not fully reflected
in the text of the regulation even though it is reflected in the preamble. This proposed rule would serve to modify the
text of the July 29, 1991 final rule to conform to the rulemaking's original intent.
The clarifications contained in this proposed rule do not represent an attempt to reevaluate the wisdom of the original
safe-harbor decisions. Instead, the changes set forth in this proposed rule would serve only to protect business
practices originally intended to be protected by removing ambiguities in the regulatory language. This clarity
should aid the formation of legal business practices without establishing any new significant legal obligations
on the parties affected by the regulations.

II. Summary of the Proposed Changes


A. Clarification to the General Comments Section of Preamble 


 Several individuals have commented that the following sentence in the preamble has created confusion: 



``Because the statute is broad, the payment practices described in these safe harbor provisions would be prohibited
by the statute but for their inclusion here.'' (56 FR 35958) 



This sentence was not meant to imply that, 

in all instances irrespective of the parties intent, 

the government could prosecute conduct described in the regulation, but for its inclusion in the regulation. Whether
a particular payment practice violates the statute is a question that can only be resolved by an analysis of the elements
of the statute as applied to that set of facts. Generally speaking, however, the original final rule did describe payment
practices that would be prohibited, where the unlawful intent exists, but for the safe harbor protection that has
been granted. 
 In discussing the space and equipment rental and personal services and management contracts, we stated that
if a ``sham contract is entered into * * * we will look behind the contract'' to its substance in evaluating
whether the arrangement qualifies for safe-harbor protection (56 FR 35972). We received numerous inquiries as to
whether we would similarly look behind the form of other arrangements to determine whether the substance of the arrangement
fits within a particular safe harbor. 
In some cases, such inquiries have led us to clarify particular safe harbors, as is illustrated by the following discussions
of the safe harbors for investment interests, space and equipment rental, and personal services and management contracts.
However, because of the broad variety of transactions subject to the Medicare and Medicaid anti-kickback statute
and the ability of individuals to manipulate the safe harbors in ways not contemplated, we believe that a general rule
preventing sham arrangements from receiving safe harbor protection would be appropriate. Thus, we are proposing
adding a new  1001.954 to the regulations. Such an approach has several precedents. The Federal Trade Commission
(FTC) with the concurrence of the Department of Justice promulgated  801.90 of the FTC's rules implementing
the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 (16 CFR 801.90), which disregards sham transactions entered
into for the purpose of avoiding obligations under the Act. In addition, other Federal agencies (such as the Securities
Exchange Commission and the Internal Revenue Service) have promulgated regulations and policies that seek to protect
the government from making enforcement decisions based on information that does not accurately reflect the substance
of the transaction. (See, for example, 17 CFR 240.12b-20; 

Estate of Korman 

versus 

Comm.

, TC Memo 1987-120; and Rev. Rul. 81-149, 1981-1 CB 77.) Moreover, the courts have historically disregarded
sham arrangements when examining the rights and obligations of the parties in tax cases. (See, for example, 

Knetsch 

versus 

United States, 

364 U.S. 361 (1960); and 

Thompson 

versus 

Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 

631 F.2d 642 (9th Cir. 1981), 

cert. denied, 

452 U.S. 961 (1981).) 


B. Clarifications to Investment Interests Safe Harbor ( 1001.952(a))





 Health Care Assets and Revenues


In qualifying for the ``large entity'' or ``small entity'' investment interest safe harbors, the monetary value
or amount of certain assets and revenues must be determined. Specifically, the safe harbors include: (1) The $50,000,000
asset threshold in  1001.952(a)(1); and (2) the gross revenues in the ``60-40 revenue rule'' in  1001.952(a)(2)(vi).
In these cases, 

only the assets or revenues related to the furnishing of health care items or services will be counted for the purposes
of qualifying for these safe harbor requirements. 

It would be an obvious sham, inconsistent with our original intent, if a joint venture could merge with a non-health
care business and have those non-health care assets, and the revenues derived from that non-health care line of business
counted for the purposes of qualifying for safe harbor protection. We are thus proposing to revise these safe harbor
provisions to further clarify our original intent that only health care assets and revenues will be counted in determining
these values and amounts.

 Acquisition of Investment Interests


As set forth in  1001.952(a)(1)(ii), an ``interested'' investor (who is in a position to make or influence referrals
to, furnish items or services to, or otherwise generate business for the entity) must obtain his or her investment
interest through trading on a registered national securities exchange on terms equally available to the public.
This does not mean that an interested investor may acquire his or her interest in any way other than the methods available
to the general public to acquire investment interests. We believe that the investor must acquire his or her investment
interest in the 

same way

 as members of the public_directly off of a registered national securities exchange through a broker_and it must be
the same type of investment interest that is available to the public. For example, a transaction in which the interested
investor receives restricted or ``lettered'' stock from the entity would not be considered a valid acquisition of
investment interests under this requirement.
The discussion above does not represent a change in this standard. Rather, it serves only to emphasize that the investment
interest ``

must be obtained

 on terms equally available to the public through trading on a registered national securities exchange * * *''
( 1001.952(a)(1)(ii)) (Emphasis added). Moreover, to obtain an investment interest ``on terms equally available
to the public,'' there cannot be any side agreements that require stock to be purchased or that restrict in any manner
the investor's ability to dispose of the stock. Any such agreement would constitute a sham transaction which would
disqualify dividend payments to that investor from safe harbor protection.







 Loans for the Purchase of the Investment Interest


One of the standards in the large and small entity investment interest safe harbors prohibits the entity from loaning
an investor funds that are used by the investor to purchase his or her investment interest. (See   1001.952(a)(1)(iv)
and 1001.952(a)(2)(vii).) We are proposing to change this standard to prohibit other investors, individuals or
entities as well as the entity from making such loans.







 Class of Investment Interests


In the 60-40 investor rule in the small entity investment interest safe harbor ( 1001.952(a)(2)(i)),
we established two categories of investors: (1) ``untainted'' or ``disinterested'' investors are those who do no
business with the entity, but hold the investment interest purely as an investment; and (2) ``tainted'' or ``interested''
investors are those who are in a position to make or influence referrals to, furnish items or services to, or otherwise
generate business for the entity. For purposes of determining in which category to place an investor, we require ``each
class of investments'' to meet the 60-40 apportionment between the two categories.
We have become aware of the difficulty in applying the 60-40 rule to each class of investors in a joint venture
where the general partners hold a separate class of stock or investment interest from the limited partners. In such
a situation, that class of investment interest for the general partners consists of 100 percent ``tainted'' or ``interested''
investors since the general partners are providing services to the entity. Therefore, we believe that the entire
joint venture does not qualify for safe harbor protection.
While it is not always true that an active investor holds a different class of investment interest from a passive investor,
we have found that it is unnecessarily restrictive to have this 60-40 investor rule only apply to 

each

 class of investment interest. Thus, we are proposing to modify this first investment interest standard to allow an
alternative to the class-by-class analysis. The new alternative would allow equity investment interests to be combined
together or debt investment interests to be combined together (separate from the equity investments) for purposes
of apportioning investors into ``untainted'' and ``tainted'' pools and meeting the 60-40 test. Only equivalent
classes of equity investment interests could be combined, and only equivalent classes of debt investment interests
could be combined. That is, the classes of investment interests combined would have to be similar in all material respects.
For example, the classes to be combined would have to have equivalent returns in proportion to amounts invested. In
addition, if one class is given preferential treatment (e.g., in the case of disposition), such an interest could
not be combined with subservient interests for purposes of compliance with the 60-40 investor rule.

<TEXT>
 

If a limited partnership has a general partner who holds 20 percent of the value of the investment interests, referring
physicians hold 20 percent, and all the other investors have no business relationship with the partnerships, then
the 60-40 investor rule would be met, as long as all other requirements are satisfied.
The 60-40 investor rule would not be met if any of the other disinterested investors in the above example holds
a debt instrument instead of an equity instrument. For example, if a joint venture raises one-third of its capital
through a debt instrument held by disinterested investors, with the remaining two thirds of its capital derived from
equity instruments held equally by interested (physicians and general partners) and disinterested investors,
the safe harbor would not be met. In this example, even though interested investors hold only one-third of all the investment
interests, they hold one-half of the 

equity 

investment interests, and thus no safe harbor protection would be available.
We note that other standards in this small entity safe harbor preclude protection for abusive schemes to give referring
investors preferential treatment 

in any way 

by creating different classes of investment. For example, if a joint venture creates two classes of stock, with one
of the classes reserved for referring physicians who receive a higher dividend per share than non-referring investors
in the other class, such an arrangement would not comply with at least sections 1001.952(a)(2) (ii), (iii) and (viii).







 Items or Services Furnished by an Investor


As discussed above, when an investor furnishes items or services to the joint venture, such as management services,
he or she is a tainted or interested investor for the purposes of complying with the 60-40 investor rule ( 1001.952(a)(2)(vi)).
It was not our intent to have any revenues that the joint venture derives from this investor's services to be considered
tainted for the purpose of qualifying for the 60-40 revenue rule.
Because of the apparent confusion caused by the language ``items or services furnished'' in this safe harbor standard,
we are proposing striking it. The focus of the inquiry in this standard is 

where 

the business and clients are coming from. In other words, the revenues are tainted, and may not exceed 40 percent of
total revenues, if they are derived ``from referrals* * * or business otherwise generated from investors.''
We note that the language we are proposing to strike_``items or services furnished''_is superfluous because, if
the revenue is ``generated'' (i.e., induced 

to come to 

the joint venture for items or services 

by an investor

), it is tainted. Thus, the language we are proposing to delete appears not to have added anything and merely caused
confusion.
The following example demonstrates the confusion and our solution. If a radiologist holds an investment interest
in an imaging center and reads all the films at the center, his or her reading of the film does not taint all the revenues
from the referrals by non-investors. However, we have received a few questions from people who read the 60-40
revenue rule as making such referrals tainted because the investor furnished services at the joint venture.
We emphasize that if a radiologist-investor is reading the film 

and 

making referrals or otherwise generating business, then the revenues the joint venture derives from that activity
would become tainted. For example, revenues would be tainted when a radiologist-investor takes part in a consultation
with a non-investor internist, and during that consultation the radiologist recommends a procedure which is performed
at the joint venture.


C. Clarifications to Space and Equipment Rental and Personal Services and Management Contracts Safe Harbors (  1001.952
(b), (c) and (d))


 In the preamble discussing the safe harbor provisions for space and equipment rental and personal services
and management contracts (56 FR 35971-74), we made clear that one of our concerns was that health care providers
in a position to make referrals to each other who engaged in these business arrangements could renegotiate their contracts
on a regular basis depending on the volume of business generated. It is for this reason that we require the leases or
contracts be for a term of not less than one year. (See   1001.952(b)(4), 1001.952(c)(4), and 1001.952(d)(4).)

It has come to our attention that a small number of health care providers believe they are complying with the literal
terms of these safe harbor provisions, but are circumventing our intent not to protect agreements that are renegotiated
based on the volume of business generated between the parties. They believe that they are protected if they enter into
multiple agreements, each of which is for a period of one year, but when all the agreements are viewed together renegotiations
are taking place more frequently (e.g., every month), with the terms of the additional agreements based in part on
the volume of business being generated between the parties under existing agreements. For example, a one year personal
services contract between a hospital and a high-volume referring physician is created for the physician to perform
certain services. The next month a 

new

 one year contract is created for a slightly different service, with the amount of payment influenced by the previous
months referrals.


This scenario does not comply with the requirement in each of these safe harbor provisions that the compensation not
take ``into account the volume or value of any referrals or business otherwise generated between the parties * * * .''
(  1001.952(b)(5), 1001.952(c)(5), and 1001.952(d)(5)). However, because the principal problem
in this situation is that the parties are creating multiple overlapping agreements, we are proposing to revise these
three safe harbor provisions to expressly preclude such schemes.


In addition, it appears that some health care providers are attempting to pay for referrals by renting more space than
they actually need from referral sources. Although such an arrangement would not fit within a safe harbor because
the aggregate rental charge would be determined in a manner that would account for the volume or value of referrals
or business otherwise generated between the parties, we are proposing to revise the safe harbor provisions in   1001.952
(b)(5), (c)(5) and (d)(5) to expressly preclude this practice.



D. Clarifications to Referral Services Safe-Harbor ( 1001.952(f))




 One of the standards in the referral services safe harbor provision requires that any fee the referral service
charges the participant be ``based on the cost of operating the referral service, and not on the volume or value of any
referrals to or business otherwise generated 

by the participants

 for the referral service * * * .'' (Emphasis added) ( 1001.952(f)(2)). This language
precludes protection where a referral service, such as one operated by a hospital, 

lowers

 its referral service fee to one of its staff physicians who participates in the service because that physician is a
high-volume referrer.


This language creates an ambiguity where the referral service tries to adjust its fee based on the volume of referrals


it makes to the participant.

 Thus, we propose clarifying the second prong to preclude safe harbor protection for payments that are based on the
volume or value of referrals to or business otherwise generated by either party for the other party.



E. Clarifications To Discount Safe Harbor ( 1001.952(h))




 Many people requested clarification of the safe harbor for discounts. Because there has been some uncertainty
over what obligations individuals or entities have to meet in order to receive protection under this safe harbor,
we propose dividing the parties into three groups: buyers, sellers, and offerors of discounts. In describing each
party's obligations, we would revise paragraphs (h)(1) and (h)(2), and add a new paragraph (h)(3).


In addition, through a proposed new paragraph (h)(4), we would clarify that, for purposes of this regulation, a ``rebate''
is any discount which is not given at the time of sale. Consequently, a rebate transaction may be covered within the
safe harbor if it involves a buyer under  1001.952 (h)(1)(i) or (h)(1)(ii), but it is not covered if it involves
a buyer under  1001.952(h)(1)(iii) because, under that provision, 

all discounts must be given at the time of sale.


We also wish to clarify what has to happen for sellers to receive safe harbor protection. In the safe harbor regulation
itself, we state that discounts will be safe harbored if both the seller ``and'' the buyer comply with the applicable
standards as described in the rule. Yet in the preamble we state that sellers should not be held liable for the omissions
of buyers. If a seller has done everything that it reasonably could under the circumstances to ensure that the buyer
understands its obligations to accurately report the discount, the seller is safe harbored irrespective of the omissions
of the buyer. To receive such protection, however, the seller must report the discount to the buyer and inform the buyer
of its obligation to report the discount. To emphasize that the seller's obligations require more than superficial
compliance with the safe harbor, we propose to add to that the seller must inform the buyer ``in an effective manner''
of its obligations to report the discount. We also propose adding a requirement that the seller ``refrain from doing
anything that would impede the buyer from meeting its obligations under this paragraph.'' Thus, if the seller, in
good faith, meets its obligations under the safe harbor and the buyer does not meet its obligations due to no fault of
the seller, the seller would receive safe harbor protection. However, when the seller submits a claim or request for
payment on behalf of the buyer, the seller must fully and accurately report the discount to Medicare or the State health
care program. Likewise, when an offeror of a discount meets its obligations under  1001.952(h)(3), and the
buyer or seller does not meet its obligations due to no fault of the offeror, the offeror would receive safe harbor protection.


In addition, we are proposing to clarify whether any reduction in price offered to a beneficiary

 could be safe harbored under this regulation. Congress protected ``a discount or other reduction in price 

obtained by a provider of services or other entity

'' (emphasis added) and made no provision for such discounts obtained by a beneficiary. In  1001.952(h)(3)(iv)
of the regulation, we removed from safe harbor protection a ``reduction in price offered to a beneficiary * * * .''
In that section, all we intended to remove from this safe harbor was ``routine reduction or waiver of any coinsurance
or deductible amount owed by a program beneficiary.'' Thus, to the extent that a discount is offered to a beneficiary
and all other applicable standards in the safe harbor are met, such a discount would receive safe harbor protection.

Many people have expressed confusion regarding the relationship between the safe harbor for discounts and the statutory
exception for discounts. (See section 1128B(b)(3)(A) of the Act.) Specifically, we are asked if there are any practices
involving discounts which were protected by Congress under the statutory exception which do not fit within the safe
harbor for discounts. Our intention is that 

all

 the discounts or reductions in price that Congress intended to protect under the statutory exception for discounts
are protected under the safe harbor for discounts. Moreover, as is illustrated by the discussion above regarding
discounts to beneficiaries, we are proposing to expand the safe harbor for discounts to include additional practices
that we do not consider abusive.

In the preamble to the final regulation, we stated that when reporting a discount, one only need report the actual purchase
price and note that it is a ``net discount'' (56 FR 35981). However, for purposes of submitting a claim or request for
payment, what is necessary is that the value of the discount is accurately reflected in the actual purchase price.
It is not necessary to distinguish whether this price is the result of a discount, or to state ``net discount.'' Consequently,
buyers who were uncertain about how and where to report on a particular form the fact that the price was due to a discount
need not be concerned with reporting that fact, as long as the actual purchase price accurately reflects the discount.
Finally, we are proposing some minor editorial changes that do not affect the substance of the provision, but hopefully
make it easier to understand.



F. Technical Correction



 A typographical error at 56 FR 35978 gave a citation to a HCFA rule on payment for intraocular lenses as ``55 FR
436.'' We would correct this citation to the HCFA rule to read as ``55 FR 4536.''

 We are proposing the deletion of  1001.953 which calls for the completion of an OIG report on compliance
with the investment interest safe harbor at  1001.952(a)(2)(i) and 1001.952(a)(2)(vi) within a specified
period of time after publication of the original safe harbor provisions. While the OIG is continuing its work on evaluating
this safe harbor provision, we believe completion of this report to be an internal administrative process that need
not be set forth in the regulations.



III. Regulatory Impact Statement



As we indicated in the original safe harbor final rule published on July 29, 1991, consistent with the intent of the
statute, the original safe harbor rulemaking and these proposed clarifications are designed to permit individuals
and entities to freely engage in business practices and arrangements that encourage competition, innovation and
economy. In doing so, the regulations impose no requirements on any party. Health care providers and others may voluntarily
seek to comply with these provisions so that they have the assurance that their business practices are not subject
to any enforcement action under the anti-kickback statute. We believe that the economic impact of these provisions
would be minimal. 

In addition, we generally prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis that is consistent with the Regulatory Flexibility
Act (5 U.S.C. 601-612). We have determined, and the Secretary certifies, that this proposed regulation would
not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small business entities, and we have, therefore,
not prepared a regulatory flexibility analysis.

(h) 

Discounts

. As used in section 1128B of the Act, ``remuneration'' does not include a discount, as defined in paragraph (h)(5)
of this section, on an item or service for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under Medicare or a State health
care program for a 

buyer

 as long as the buyer complies with the applicable standards of paragraph (h)(1) of this section; a 

seller

 as long as the seller complies with the applicable standards of paragraph (h)(2) of this section; and an 

offeror

 of a discount who is not a seller under paragraph (h)(2) of this section so long as such offeror complies with the applicable
standards of paragraph (h)(3) of this section:
(1) With respect to the following three categories of 

buyers,

 the buyer must comply with all of the applicable standards within one of the three following categories_
(i) If the buyer is an entity which is a health maintenance organization or a competitive medical plan acting in accordance
with a risk contract under section 1876(g) or 1903(m) of the Act, or under another State health care program, it need
not report the discount except as otherwise may be required under the risk contract.
(ii) If the buyer is an entity which reports its costs on a cost report required by the Department or a State health care
program, it must comply with all of the following four standards_
(A) the discount must be earned based on purchases of that same good or service bought within a single fiscal year of
the buyer.
(B) the buyer must claim the benefit of the discount in the fiscal year in which the discount is earned or the following
year.

(C) the buyer must fully and accurately report the discount in the applicable cost report; and
(D) the buyer must provide, upon request by the Secretary or a State agency, information provided by the seller as specified
in paragraph (h)(2)(ii) of this section, or information provided by the offeror as specified in paragraph (h)(3)(ii)
of this section.

for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under Medicare or a State health care program (not including individuals
or entities receiving items or services from entities defined as buyers in paragraph (h)(1)(i) or (h)(1)(ii) of this
section), the buyer must comply with all of the following three standards_
(A) the discount must be made at the time of the sale of the good or service (rebates are therefore not allowable);
(B) where an item or service is separately claimed for payment with the Medicare program or a State health care program,
the buyer (if submitting the claim) must fully and accurately report the discount on that item or service; and
(C) the buyer (if submitting the claim) must provide, upon request by the Secretary or a State agency, information
provided by the seller as specified in paragraph (h)(2)(iii)(B) of this section, or information provided by the offeror
as specified in paragraph (h)(3)(iii)(A) of this section.
(2) The seller is an individual or entity that furnishes an item or service for which payment may be made, in whole or
in part, under Medicare or a State health care program to the buyer and who permits a discount to be taken off the buyer's
purchase price. The seller must comply with all of the applicable standards within the following three categories_

(i) If the buyer is an entity which is a health maintenance organization or a competitive medical plan acting in accordance
with a risk contract under section 1876(g) or 1903(m) of the Act, or under another State health care program, the seller
need not report the discount to the buyer for purposes of this provision.

(ii) If the buyer, is an entity that reports its costs on a cost report required by the Department or a State agency, the

this section, the seller must fully and accurately report such discount on the invoice, coupon or statement submitted
to the buyer, inform the buyer in an effective manner of its obligations to report such discount, and refrain from doing
anything which would impede the buyer from meeting its obligations under this paragraph; or
(B) where the value of the discount is not known at the time of sale, the seller must fully and accurately report the existence
of a discount program on the invoice, coupon or statement submitted to the buyer, inform the buyer in an effective manner
of its obligations to report such discount under paragraph (h)(1) of this section and, when the value of the discount

and refrain from doing anything that would impede the buyer from meeting its obligations under this paragraph.
(3) The offeror of a discount is an individual or entity who is not a seller under paragraph (h)(2) of this section, but
promotes the purchase of an item or service by a buyer under paragraph (h)(1) of this section at a reduced price for which
payment may be made, in whole or in part, under Medicare or a State health care program. The offeror must comply with
all of the applicable standards within the following three categories_
(i) If the buyer is an entity which is a health maintenance organization or a competitive medical plan acting in accordance
with a risk contract under section 1876(g) or 1903(m) of the Act, or under another State health care program, the offeror
need not report the discount to the buyer for purposes of this provision. 
(ii) If the buyer is an entity that reports its costs on a cost report required by the Department or a State agency, the
offeror must comply with the following two standards_
(A) the offeror must inform the buyer in an effective manner of its obligation to report such a discount; and 
(B) the offeror of the discount must refrain from doing anything that would impede the buyer's ability to meet its obligations

Transportation for Individuals With Disabilities 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Office of the Secretary, Transportation.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM).






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This notice proposes two sets of amendments to the Department of Transportation's rules implementing the Americans
with Disabilities Act (ADA). The first group of proposals is based on petitions for rulemaking from members of the
public. While the Department is publishing proposed amendments based on these petitions, in order to seek public
comment on them, the Department is not now taking a position on whether these amendments should be adopted. The petitions
would create an exception to the provision requiring transit providers to allow persons with disabilities to use
every stop in the system, change the requirements affecting certain private schools that provide fixed route transportation,
change the provision of the Department's technical standards concerning gaps for higher-speed people mover vehicles
and eliminate the provision that requires paratransit systems to allow reservations to be made 14 days in advance.
Second, the Department is proposing a number of minor or technical adjustments to clarify or improve administration
of certain portions of the rule.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

Petitions for Rulemaking



The Department has received four petitions for rulemaking, each of which requests an amendment to the Department's
Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) rules. The Department is acting on the petitions by issuing this notice of proposed
rulemaking (NPRM). If, based on the comments and the Department's further consideration of the issues involved,
the Department believes the proposed changes have merit, it can issue final rules based on this NPRM. At this time,
however, the Department is not taking a position on whether the proposed changes should be adopted. 



1. Inadequate Bus Stops 



Seattle Metro seeks a change in 49 CFR 37.167(g), which provides as follows: 




The entity shall not refuse to permit a passenger who uses a lift to disembark from a vehicle at any designated stop,
unless the lift cannot be deployed, the lift will be damaged if it is deployed, or temporary conditions at the stop,
not under the control of the entity, preclude the safe use of the stop by all passengers.




In the Appendix to Part 37, DOT described the intent of this provision as follows:


 

It is inconsistent with this section for a transit provider to refuse to let a passenger use a lift at any designated
stop, unless the lift is physically unable to deploy or the lift would be damaged if it did. * * *
In addition, if a temporary situation at the stop (construction, an accident, a landslide) made the stop unsafe for
anyone to use, the provider could decline to use the lift there (just as it refused to open the door for other passengers
at the same point). The provider could not, however, declare a stop ``off limits'' to persons with disabilities that
is used for other persons. If the transit authority has concerns about barriers or safety hazards, that particularly
affect individuals with disabilities that would use the stop, it should consider making efforts to move the stop.
(56 FR 45755, September 6, 1991). 




Seattle Metro urges the Department to change this policy. Metro's petition says that its bus lifts need 4-5 feet
to deploy and that persons using mobility aids need another 4 feet in order to maneuver off the lift. The petition asserts
that it has 6220 fully accessible bus stops, 1571 that do not meet present ADA standards (i.e., a lift cannot deploy
at these stops), and 702 that could be used by standees but do not provide adequate space for wheelchair users. The inaccessibility
of stops is due, Metro says, to factors such as topography and terrain, line of sight, traffic speed, and access to shoulder
pullout areas, all of which are more or less permanent matters beyond its control. Often, local jurisdictions, rather
than Metro, control these factors as well as the locations of the bus stops themselves. This, in Metro's view, often
makes it impractical to relocate stops to more accessible locations.

Allowing passengers to choose to disembark at ``inaccessible'' locations may create safety hazards, Metro asserts.
Passengers with disabilities should not be allowed to decide it is safe to use a particular stop, in Metro's view, particularly
since the visual or cognitive disabilities of some passengers could impair their ability to make an adequate assessment
of the situation and since a visual inspection might not, in any event, reveal the problems of a site. Metro is concerned
about tort liability in such situations. 

With its petition, Metro provided a brief videotape, which we have made part of the docket. It shows wheelchair users
leaving or entering buses in locations where narrowness of the sidewalk (i.e., next to a retaining wall, adjacent
to a grassy knoll) or other conditions (e.g., an eroded, broken sidewalk) make it difficult (but not necessarily impossible)
to get on or off the bus. 

Metro has petitioned the Department to amend  37.167(g) in two ways. First, Metro would permit transit providers
to refuse to allow persons with disabilities to use stops available to other passengers if ``the lift, when fully deployed,
would leave inadequate space at the stop for the passenger to obtain a secure and maintainable position on the ground.''
Second, Metro would add a sentence saying that ``A stop which does not meet the specifications set forth in  10.2.1(1)
of appendix A to 49 CFR part 37 shall be deemed to provide inadequate space for passengers using common wheelchairs
to obtain a secure and maintainable position on the ground.'' For information of potential commenters, the bus stop
standards in Appendix A that Metro references are the following: 



10.2.1 New Construction 



(1) Where new bus stop pads are constructed at bus stops, bays, or other areas where a lift or ramp is to be deployed, they
shall have a firm, stable surface; minimum clear length of 96 inches (measured from the curb or roadway vehicle edge)
and a minimum clear width of 60 inches (measured parallel to the vehicle roadway) to the maximum extent allowed by legal
or site constraints; and shall be connected to streets, sidewalks, or pedestrian paths by an accessible route complying
with 4.3 and 4.4. The slope of the pad parallel to the roadway shall, to the extent practicable, be the same as the roadway.
For water drainage, a maximum slope of 1:50 (2%) perpendicular to the roadway is 
allowed. 




It should be noted that Metro's proposal would apply this 

new construction

 standard to make judgments about allowing wheelchair users to use 

existing

 bus stops. Also, the standard refers to ``bus stop pads,'' not to bus stops in general. In addition, the standard's
minimum clear width and length requirements are required ``to the extent allowed by legal or site constraints.''
Site constraints would appear to include the kinds of conditions of which Metro's petition speaks. 



The effect of its proposed amendment, Metro says, would be to allow transit providers to refuse to serve wheelchair
passengers at stops that did not meet Access Board standards. According to Metro, this would place an additional 702
stops (8 percent of the total number of stops in the system) off limits to wheelchair users. However, other passengers
with disabilities (e.g., standees) and passengers without disabilities would be served at these stops. While Metro's
petition does not specify how service to origins and destinations served by these stops (or the other 19 percent of
stops at which lifts will not deploy at all) would be made available to wheelchair users, the Department assumes individuals
who need accessible service to those destinations would be eligible for paratransit. 



2. Requirements for Private School Transportation 



Congress exempted ``public school transportation'' from the transportation requirements of the ADA, by defining
such transportation not to be ``designated public transportation.'' The House Public Works Committee Report on
the legislation says that it is the intent of Congress that the same exemption should apply to private elementary and
secondary school transportation if the school receives Federal financial assistance, is covered by section 504
of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and provides equivalent transportation service to students with disabilities
(see H. Rept. 101-485, Pt. 1, at 36). In addition, religiously-affiliated schools are exempt from the ADA altogether,
based on the ADA's exemption for religious organizations. Section 37.27 of the Department's ADA regulation implements
these exemptions. 

As pointed out in the petition of the National Association of Independent Schools (NAIS), schools that are private,
not religiously affiliated, and not recipients of Federal funds do not benefit from any of these exemptions. As private
entities not primarily in the business of transporting people providing (usually) fixed route transportation with
vehicles with a passenger capacity exceeding 16 persons, they are subject to a requirement to purchase all new accessible
school buses. 

NAIS says ``[t]he cost of this requirement is enormous, and in relation to the cost the benefit to disabled students
is minimal, because there is no need that every vehicle purchased be accessible; all disabled students may be served
as long as a sufficient number of the vehicles are accessible.'' The NAIS petition seeks a modification of the current
regulation to place its members on the same footing as other schools, saying that ``independent schools which do not
receive federal financial assistance are the only schools who are required to purchase accessible vehicles even
when the school already has sufficient such vehicles to provide adequate services to students with disabilities.''


The requested modification would amend  37.27 to apply the same requirement to private schools that do not receive
Federal assistance as to other private schools, i.e. a requirement to provide equivalent transportation services
to students with disabilities.

3. People Mover Gap Standards 



The Special Standards Division of the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) has petitioned the Department to
modify its technical standards concerning horizontal and vertical gaps for automated guideway transit (AGT) vehicles
and systems, better known as ``people movers.'' 49 CFR  38.173 requires that the horizontal gap between a stopped
AGT vehicle's door and the platform be no greater than one inch, with a vertical gap of plus or minus one half inch. The
regulation allows other rail systems (e.g., rapid and light rail) to have horizontal and vertical gaps of 3 inches
and plus or minus 5/8 inch, respectively. 

ASCE suggests that the regulation should recognize a distinction between AGT systems based on vehicle speed. AGT
systems vary in speed from 5 to 80 miles per hour, ASCE says, and it is, in the organization's view, more appropriate
for higher-speed AGTs to meet the more flexible standards applicable to rapid and light rail systems than the narrower
AGT standard. ASCE cites the Access Board's preamble discussion concerning AGT systems, which refers to ``AGT vehicles
that travel at slow speed,'' and subsequent Access Board manuals suggesting that the rapid/light rail gap should
apply to faster AGT vehicles.

ASCE surveyed existing AGT systems, determining that most do not comply with the current AGT gap standards. The petition
cites engineering reasons (e.g., the need in higher-speed vehicles for larger and more complex suspension systems,
which in turn make it more difficult to meet existing gap standards) for this phenomenon. Based on its data and engineering
analysis, ASCE recommends that 20 miles per hour be the dividing line: systems that operate below that speed can reasonably
meet the current AGT standard, while faster systems should be allowed to meet the rapid/light rail standard. (The
Access Board has interpreted its guidelines, as presently worded, to permit the construction urged by ASCE. The Department
does not object to this interpretation; nevertheless, for the sake of clarity in the rule text, we are proposing to
amend the language. The Department will also work with the Access Board to incorporate changes in the guidelines that
may be made with respect to vehicle/platform gaps in AGT systems.) 



4. 14-day Advance Reservations



49 CFR  37.131(b)(4) provides, with respect to complementary paratransit services, that ``the entity shall
permit advance reservations to be made up to 14 days in advance of an ADA paratransit eligible individual's desired
trip.'' This provision, not a part of the NPRM that led to the Department's final ADA rule, was added in response to comments
to the NPRM. 

Two separate petitions urge the Department to eliminate this provision. One is from Doug Douglas, Assistant Vice-President,
Paratransit Services, of Dallas Area Rapid Transit (DART). Mr. Douglas draws a distinction between advance reservations
in a context like the airline industry, where the customer goes to the point of service, and paratransit. In the former,
he says, if a passenger cancels a reservation or does not show up for the plane, the airline can simply fill in the reserved
spot with a standby passenger. Paratransit does not have this flexibility, since the vehicle must be rerouted in the
case of a cancellation or makes a futile trip in case of a no-show. Cancellations and no-shows are a major problem for
his system, Mr. Douglas asserts: 






There are a number of arguments to support the repeal of the 14 days advanced reservation requirements as prescribed
by  7.131. The most obvious reason is the waste of precious resources on clients who reserve trips well in advance,
forget the trip has been scheduled, and do not call the provider to cancel the trip. Even when the client does remember
to cancel the trip, they are only required to do so within an hour prior to the scheduled pick-up time, which does not
allow us to effectively utilize the time slot for another client. We are averaging 16,183 canceled trips and 2,936
no-shows per month. Fourteen days advance reservation does not appear to be operationally feasible in a paratransit
environment, and should be repealed or revised to make it more palatable for providers of specialized transportation
services. 






Patrisha Piras, a California transportation consultant and Board member of AC Transit, also petitioned the Department
to eliminate this provision. She views this provision as an impediment to the effective implementation of ``real-time''
scheduling for paratransit services. Her rationale is the following: 






Real-time scheduling provides a dynamic ability for the service provider to respond to the current level of demand
from service users. Adjustments in wait time and vehicle trip patterns are based on the current situation ``on the
street.'' This is a significant contrast to traditional ``advance reservation'' systems, where trips are booked
several days in advance, creating an artificial picture of actual service, since often users would subsequently
cancel or rearrange trips, and the provider would then have to rearrange planned vehicle deployment and assignments.


[In my experience] * * *, often up to one third of trips booked on an advance reservation system are ultimately
cancels or no-shows. This further creates a ``blocking'' mechanism, so that potential users would call farther and
farther in advance to ensure a better chance of getting a ride * * *.



What the 14-day advance provision does is to institutionalize capacity constraints, 

with a preference for people who have decided on their trip long in advance. This is counter to other philosophical
bases of the regulation, which call for paratransit service to be relatively comparable to fixed-route, including
the sense of ``spontaneity'' without having to pre-plan a trip. The 14-day advance provision also imposes or allows
an implicit priority to certain kinds of trips, such as medical or other appointments, where the rider (and often the
provider as well!) wants to have the certainty in advance that the trip is available. This, too, is counter to the basic
service criteria of the regulations. 

The 14-day advance reservation provision should be eliminated (or, at a minimum, be made permissive and subservient
to the other criteria) * * * (emphasis in original).






By eliminating the 14-day provision, or making it permissive, the NPRM would permit transit providers to decline
to accept reservations farther from the date of travel than the day before. The minimum reservation time requirement_that
providers must provide next-day service_would, of course, remain in place. 



DOT-Proposed Adjustments to the Rule 



1. Reduction of Paperwork for Paratransit Plan Updates 



Under the Department's ADA regulation, each fixed route public transit operator was required to submit a paratransit
plan to the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) by January 26, 1992. Section 37.135(c) of the rule requires that
``each entity shall submit an update to the plan on January 26 of each succeeding year.'' Section 37.139(j) requires
these updates to include information needed to update the information requirements applying to the original plan,
significant changes or revisions to the timetable, whether milestones for progress toward full compliance have
been met, explanations of any slippage that has occurred in meeting the timetable for full compliance, and corrective
action for any slippage. The same public participation requirements that applied to the original plan (including
notice, a public hearing, and consultation with the disability community) apply to updates.

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940721-1-00048 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940721-1-00012 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

FTA data indicate that about 117 of the 540 fixed route operators required to submit paratransit plans have indicated
that they expected to be fully in compliance by the end of 1993. Another 70 providers expected to be fully in compliance
by the end of 1994. By full compliance, we mean that the transit property meets all six service criteria spelled out
for paratransit systems in the regulation (concerning service area, response time, trip purpose, hours and days
of service, fares, and capacity constraints). It appears unnecessary to require transit properties which in fact
meet all criteria to do the paperwork for an update every year. If a system is fully in compliance, and no significant
changes have occurred, going through this process has no benefit for passengers with disabilities. 

For these reasons, the Department is proposing to modify   37.135(c) and 37.139(j) to allow transit properties
who fully comply with all service criteria for paratransit service to rely on the assurance of ADA compliance required
by  27.4, rather than submitting an update report. If significant changes occurred that could affect compliance,
or if the system fell out of compliance with respect to one or more of the service criteria, it would have to notify FTA
of the problem and submit annual updates until it had returned to compliance. 

The Department has some concern that, if it adopts this proposal, it may not have an adequate source of data about the
compliance status of transit authorities, ridership, or costs. Such data may be useful for program evaluation as
well as forming a basis for reports to Congress or the public. The Department seeks comment on whether, if this proposal
is adopted, there should be any additional data reporting requirements concerning paratransit compliance, ridership,
and costs. 



2. Visitor Eligibility



Section 37.127, concerning complimentary paratransit service for visitors, provides that a public entity is not
required to provide service to a visitor for more than 21 days from the date of the first paratransit trip used by the
visitor. We have been asked whether this means 21 consecutive days or a collection of days over a given period of time
adding up to 21. For the sake of simplicity and clarity, we propose to add the words ``per year.'' This means that a visitor
could have any 21 days of eligibility in any calendar year. 



3. Vehicle Acquisition for ``Private Not Primarily Engaged'' Providers



Section 37.101 contains the vehicle acquisition requirements for private entities not primarily engaged in the
business of transporting people. Because of the way that section 302 of the ADA itself it drafted, there is no specific
vehicle acquisition requirement for ``private not primarily engaged'' entities providing demand responsive service
with vehicles having a capacity of 16 or fewer passengers. Rather, entities in this situation must provide equivalent
service to passengers with disabilities. This requirement is set forth in  37.171. To avoid confusion, we propose
to add to  37.101 a new paragraph containing a cross-reference to  37.171.



4. Personal Care Attendants



Section 37.123(f)(1)(i) permits an eligible individual traveling on ADA paratransit to be accompanied by a ``personal
care attendant'' (PCA) as well as by any other person of the individual's choice. Section 37.131(c)(3) says that the
PCA rides without charge, while the other companion must pay the paratransit fare. These provisions have led to questions
about who should be regarded as a PCA. Section 37.123(f)(1)(ii) attempted to provide guidance on this issue by saying
that a family member or friend traveling with an eligible individual is not regarded as a PCA unless that person is acting
in the capacity of a PCA. The Appendix discussion of this section notes that a PCA is someone ``designated or employed
specifically to help the individual meet his or her personal needs,'' such as eating, drinking, using the bathroom,
communicating etc. The Appendix also notes that the paratransit provider may, as part of the eligibility certification
process, require that eligible individuals register as users of PCAs. The companion of someone not so registering
could be charged the paratransit fare. 

The Department is aware that there may be definitions of PCA used in other contexts (e.g., human services programs).
We seek comment on whether one of these definitions would be appropriate for use in the context of paratransit. 



5. Equivalent Facilitation 



The current provisions concerning ``equivalent facilitation'' (  37.7 and 37.9) require, as one condition
for obtaining a determination of equivalent facilitation, that an entity demonstrate its ``reasons for inability
to comply'' with the existing regulatory standards. In other words, before the Department can determine that something
is an equivalent facilitation, the applicant must show not only that it is proposing a solution providing equal or
greater accessibility, but also that it is precluded from using the solution provided for in the Department's standards.
The purpose of this provision was to limit departures from established regulatory standards to those situations
where they could not be applied and, therefore, to discourage a proliferation of solutions that might undermine the
goal of having uniform, predictable standards. This approach has the disadvantage, however, of also discouraging
newer technologies or more innovative solutions that might actually provide accessibility gains in some situations.
For this reason, the Department is proposing to delete the ``inability to comply'' language from the equivalent facilitation
sections of the rule. We seek comment on whether this is a good idea. 

We would point out that the proposed change is not intended to diminish the requirement that any equivalent facilitation
provide equal or greater accessibility. For example, it would not permit a rail system to avoid installing detectable
warnings meeting the regulatory standards without that system having demonstrated that a substitute design was
as detectable or more detectable by persons with impaired vision.

6. Clarification of Appendix Statement on Vehicle Lift 
Dimensions



Part 38, the Department
s standards for accessible 
vehicles, contains dimensions for wheelchair lifts on 
vehicles. The reference to these dimensions in the Part 37, 
Appendix A, discussion of  37.13 speaks of the ``new 30
'
' x 48
'
' lift platform specifications.'' While the dimensions are 30 x 48 inches at 
a distance of two inches above the platform, the width of 
the platform need only be 28.5 inches at the platform 
itself. This seeming discrepancy has confused some readers. To resolve it, we 
propose to remove the words ``30'' by ``48'' from the Appendix, 
so that the reference is simply to the lift standards of 
Part 38. 



7. Typographical Errors 



In  37.3, in the definition of ``designated public transportation,'' the word ``containing'' in the final
line should be ``continuing.'' In  37.11(a), the reference in the last line to ``Subpart F'' of 49 CFR Part 27
should be 
``Subpart C'' (Part 27 no longer contains any Subpart F). Commenters are encouraged to note other such errors, so that
they can also be corrected. 



Regulatory Analyses and Notices 



This NPRM does not propose a significant rule under 
Executive Order 12866. It is a significant NPRM under the 
Department's Regulatory Policies and Procedures, since it would amend the Department's Americans with Disabilities
Act rule, which is a significant rule. We expect economic impacts to be minimal, so we have not 
prepared a regulatory evaluation. There are no Federalism 
impacts sufficient to warrant the preparation of a Federalism assessment. The Department certifies that the proposals,
if adopted, will not have a 
significant economic impact on a substantial number of small 
entities.

For the reasons set forth in the preamble, the Department proposes to amend 49 CFR Part 37 and 49 CFR Part 38 as 
follows: 



PART 37_[AMENDED]



1. The authority citation for 49 CFR Part 37 is proposed to continue to read as follows:

 




Authority:

 Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 
12101-12213); 49 U.S.C. 322. 




2. The authority citation for 49 CFR Part 38 is proposed to be revised to 
read as follows:






Authority:

 Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 12101-12213); 49 U.S.C. 322.

 


3. In part 37,  37.27(b) is proposed to be revised to read as follows: 



 37. 27 

Transportation for elementary and secondary 
education systems. 



* * * * * 



(b) The requirements of this part do not apply to the transportation of school children to and from a private 
elementary or secondary school, and its school-related 
activities, if the school is providing transportation 
service to students with disabilities equivalent to that 
provided to students without disabilities. The test of equivalence is the same as that provided in  37.105.
If the school does not meet the 
requirement of this paragraph for exemption from the 
requirements of this part, it is subject to the requirements 
of this part for private entities not primarily engaged in transporting people. 

4. In part 37,  37.135 is proposed to be amended by revising paragraph (c) to read as follows: 



 37.135 

Submission of paratransit plan. 



* * * * * 



(c) 

Annual updates. 

Except as provided in this paragraph, each entity shall submit an annual update to its plan on January 26 of each succeeding
year. 

(1) If an entity has met and is continuing to meet fully all requirements for complementary paratransit in   37.121
through 37.133 of this part, the entity may submit to FTA on January 26 of each succeeding year a certification of compliance
in lieu of a plan update. Entities that have submitted a joint plan under  37.141 may submit a joint certification
under this paragraph. The requirements of   37.137 through 37.139 do not apply when a certification is
submitted under this paragraph. 

(2) In the event of any change in circumstances that results in an entity which has submitted a certification of compliance
falling short of full compliance with   37.121 through 37.133 in any respect, the entity shall immediately
notify FTA of the problem. In this case, the entity shall file a plan update meeting the requirements of   37.137
through 37.139 of this part on the next following January 26 and in each succeeding year until the entity returns to
full compliance. 

(3) An entity which has been granted a waiver from any provision of this part on the basis of undue financial burden shall
file a plan update meeting the requirements of   37.137 through 37.139 of this part on each January 26 during
which the waiver is in effect.

revising paragraph (g) to read as follows: 



 37.167 

Other service requirements. 



* * * * * 



(g) (1) The entity shall not refuse to permit a passenger who uses a lift to disembark from a vehicle at any designated
stop, unless_

(i) The lift cannot be deployed;

(iii) The lift, when fully deployed, would leave an 
inadequate space at the stop for the passenger to obtain a secure and maintainable position on the ground; or 
(iv) Temporary conditions at the stop, not under the control of the entity, preclude the safe use of the stop by all passengers.


(2) For purposes of this paragraph, a stop that does not meet the specifications set forth in  10.2.1(1) of Appendix
A to this part shall be deemed to provide inadequate space for passengers using common wheelchairs to 
obtain a secure and maintainable position on the ground. 

6. In part 38,  38.173(a) is proposed to be amended by adding the words ``(i.e., at a speed of no more than 20 miles
per hour at any location on 
their route during normal operation)'' after the words ``slow speed.'' 

7. In part 38,  38.173(d) is proposed to be amended by adding the following sentence at the end: ``AGT systems
whose vehicles travel at a speed of more than 20 miles per hour at any location on their route during normal operation
are covered under this paragraph rather than under paragraph (a) 
of this section.'' 

8. In part 37,  37.131(b)(4) is proposed to be removed or, in the alternative, to be amended by substituting the
word ``may'' for the word ``shall.''

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule; request for comments. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This proposed rule would allow non-Federal entities to apply for, and NMFS to issue, permits for the incidental take
of threatened species of sea turtles consistent with section 10(a) of the Endangered Species Act (ESA). Existing
regulations provide for the issuance of an incidental take permit for endangered sea turtles. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Background 


All sea turtles that occur in U.S. waters are listed as either endangered or threatened under the ESA. Kemp's ridley
(

Lepidochelys kempii

), leatherback (

Dermochelys coriacea

) and hawksbill (

Eretmochelys imbricata

) turtles are listed as endangered. Loggerhead (

Caretta caretta

), green (

Chelonia mydas

) and olive ridley (

Lepidochelys olivacea

) turtles are listed as threatened, except for breeding populations of green turtles in Florida and on the Pacific
coast of Mexico, and the breeding population of olive ridley turtles on the Pacific coast of Mexico, which are listed
as endangered. 
In 1990, the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) completed a review of the biology of sea turtles and the causes and extent
of their decline. The NAS concluded that incidental capture in shrimp trawls without turtle excluder devices (TEDs)
is by far the leading cause of human-induced mortality to sea turtles at sea, but that collectively, activities in
the non-shrimp fisheries constitute the second largest source of mortality. The study identified finfish trawls,
seine nets, pompano gillnets, and various passive fishing gear, such as sink gillnets, weirs, traps and longlines,
as potential sources of mortality to sea turtles. 
Because threatened sea turtles are often incidentally taken in state coastal fisheries, NMFS established a regulatory
framework that requires the use of TEDs on most shrimp trawls and allows NMFS to impose measures with respect to shrimp
trawl and other fisheries to protect sea turtles, such as the use of limited tow times, the requirement to carry observers,
and the closure of certain areas (57 FR 57348, December 4, 1992). Under this framework, measures are implemented as
temporary restrictions, which is a time-consuming, repetitious, and short-term means to accomplish conservation
measures for sea turtles. For example, NMFS has implemented many temporary restrictions allowing the North Carolina
shrimp fishery to comply with tow-time limits as an alternative to using TEDs in areas of high algae concentrations
(see 58 FR 48975, September 21, 1993).

As an addition to the regulatory framework governing state fisheries in which listed species of sea turtles are incidentally
taken, NMFS is proposing a rule that would extend section 10 permit regulations to all threatened species of sea turtles.
Section 10(a)(1)(B) of the ESA authorizes the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary) to permit under such terms and conditions
as he or she may prescribe, any taking otherwise prohibited by section 9(a)(1)(B) of the ESA, if the taking is incidental
to, and not the purpose of, carrying out an otherwise lawful activity. NMFS implemented regulations for the application
and issuance of incidental take permits, under section 10(a) of the ESA, which appear at 50 CFR parts 220 and 222, and
allow the Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, NOAA, (AA) to issue permits to incidentally take endangered marine
species during otherwise lawful activities. 

While sections 9 and 10 and corresponding regulations apply to species listed as endangered, they may be applied to
threatened species as well, pursuant to section 4(d) of the ESA. Section 4(d) provides that the Secretary issue such
regulations as deemed necessary and advisable to provide for the conservation of such species. For example, for those
threatened species whose taking is prohibited by NMFS (such as salmon (50 CFR 227.21) and Guadalupe fur seal (50 CFR
227.11)), NMFS has promulgated special regulations that allow incidental takings of such species in compliance
with a section 10 incidental take permit. Although NMFS has extended the section 9 takings prohibitions to threatened
sea turtles (50 CFR 227.71(a)), the exceptions to the prohibitions contained in 50 CFR 227.72 do not provide for the
issuance of an incidental take permit. This rule, as proposed, would make it possible to issue such permits for the
taking of threatened sea turtles. 

The extension of the section 10 incidental take permit exception to threatened sea turtles would allow the same substantive
protective measures that can be implemented, and the same fishing activities that can be carried out, as under the
current regulatory framework, while eliminating the procedural shortcomings of the regulatory framework, such
as the short duration of the rules and the length of time required to issue rules. Incidental take permits are not intended
to undermine the TED-use requirement or the taking prohibition in general. Furthermore, the regulatory framework
would remain in effect for any entity that has not been issued an incidental take permit. This proposed rule would provide
an additional means whereby non-Federal entities can engage in commercial fishing practices while affording adequate
protection to both endangered and threatened sea turtles. 

Through the implementation of this proposed rule, NMFS would accept and consider incidental take permit applications
from non-Federal entities, such as individuals, businesses, municipalities, fishery organizations and state
agencies. NMFS anticipates that it would invite state agencies, which are responsible for regulating state fisheries,
to apply for general permits that would cover specific fisheries known or believed to incidentally take threatened
or endangered sea turtles. This would be more efficient than requiring permits for individual vessels. It would also
allow the states to assume management of fisheries through the permits, which are limited to activities within the
territorial sea. 

The general permit procedures in 50 CFR part 220, as well as the endangered species permit requirements in 50 CFR part
222, would apply to the application, issuance, modification, revocation, suspension and amendment of an incidental
take permit for threatened, as well as for endangered sea turtles.

Classification 



This proposed rule has been determined to be not significant for purposes of E.O. 12866. 

This rule contains a collection-of-information requirement subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA). This
requirement has been approved previously by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB Control Number 0648-0230).
The reporting burden for this collection is estimated to average approximately 80 hours for permit applications,
0.5 hours for certificate of inclusion applications and 0.5 hours for reports. These estimates include the time for
reviewing instructions, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection
of information. Send comments regarding these burden estimates or any other aspect of this collection of information,
including suggestions for reducing this burden, to the National Marine Fisheries Service (F/PR), 1335 East-West
Highway, Silver Spring, MD 20910, and to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and
Budget, Washington, D.C. 20503 (Attn: Paperwork Reduction Act Project 0648-0230). 

The General Counsel of the Department of Commerce certified to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business
Administration that this proposed rule, if adopted, would not have significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities because the proposed rule establishes a discretionary permitting procedure that will,
by itself, have no economic impact on fisherman. As a result, a regulatory flexibility analysis was not prepared.


The AA prepared an EA for this proposed rule that concludes that the rule would have no significant impact on the human
environment. A copy of the EA is available (see 

ADDRESSES

) and comments on it are requested.

I. Technology Demonstration 


The purpose of the Technology Demonstration (see additional information under the headings DATES

 and 

ADDRESSES

, above) is to provide owners and operators of computer loan origination systems (CLOs) with an opportunity to demonstrate
or discuss the operation and benefits of their systems and the impact of the proposed rule on their systems, and to provide
consumer groups, industry organizations, and members of the public with an opportunity to witness such presentations
or demonstrations. 

As discussed more fully below, this rule proposes to modify the application of the current Regulation X to CLOs. Information
gained by the Department from the Technology Demonstration may be used in developing a final rule. Owners and operators
are invited to notify the Department of their interest in participating in this Technology Demonstration. Participants
will be free to make visual or conceptual presentations without including actual use of computer loan origination
systems. Based upon the number of interested parties and other practical considerations, the Department will determine
the format, timing, and logistical arrangements for the Technology Demonstration. To the extent feasible, the Department
will provide electrical and telephonic hook-ups for participants. The Department reserves the option of limiting
the length of presentations, or setting any other guidelines for participation, in accordance with the number of
participants. 



II. Background 


On November 2, 1992, HUD published a revised Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act of 1974 (12 U.S.C. 2601 et seq.)
(RESPA) rule (hereinafter ``final rule'' or ``1992 final rule''), which became effective on December 2, 1992, and
was amended on February 10, 1994 (59 FR 6505). Technical corrections were published on March 30, 1994 (59 FR 14748).
The final rule contained long-awaited provisions implementing amendments to RESPA regarding controlled businesses.
These amendments were originally enacted in 1983 as section 461 of the Housing and Urban-Rural Recovery Act (HURRA),
Pub. L. 98-181. The final rule also updated the original RESPA rule, which had not been amended since 1976. 
On October 28, 1992, a few days before publication of the final rule in the 

Federal Register

, then-President Bush signed the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 (Pub. L. 202-550) (1992 Act),
which amended RESPA to state specifically that the making of a mortgage loan was a covered transaction (a Federal court
case had created uncertainty) and that refinancing transactions were transactions covered by RESPA. The 1992 Act
also extended RESPA's coverage to all subordinate liens involving 1- to 4-family residential property. Implementing
provisions, along with revisions of the final rule, are set forth in the 

Federal Register

 of February 10, 1994, and are effective on August 9, 1994. The effect of the statutory and regulatory changes was to
expand substantially the coverage of this criminal and civil statute. 
Following issuance of the final rule, two lawsuits were filed: one by the Mortgage Bankers Association and one by a
group of independent service providers, called CRISIS. Both suits objected to provisions of the final rule and alleged
that HUD had not complied with the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 551 et seq.) in promulgating the November
2, 1992, rule. The cases have been dismissed, but are subject to being reinstituted at any time. 

Upon assuming office, HUD officials in the new Administration were inundated with comments_mostly complaints_about
the final rule issued in the last days of the previous Administration. Notably absent from the interests contacting
HUD about the final rule were any representatives of consumer interests. Instead, comments came almost entirely
from the affected industries. Some industry representatives argued that the provisions of the final rule benefited
consumers, while others argued that the provisions, sometimes the same provisions, were harmful to consumers.

<DOCNO> FR940721-1-00056 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940721-1-00014 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The Department also received allegations that the final rule created uncertainty about whether referral fees were
in fact prohibited by RESPA. Specifically, some commenters claimed that the introduction in the final rule of an employer-employee
exemption from the prohibition on referral fees prompted some persons to set up sham employer-employee relationships
to shield prohibited referral fees, and prompted others to ``extort'' referral fees from other settlement service
providers on the premise that HUD now allowed such compensation. The final rule did not authorize such practices;
however, some commenters argued that the existence of confusion about whether it did suggested that the final rule
failed to establish a bright line, comprehensible to industry participants, between permissible and impermissible
activities. 
Given the controversy over the final rule, the Secretary determined that a review of the previous policies was needed,
particularly focusing on the final rule's impact on consumers. The Secretary also articulated three principles
to guide that review: 

(1) HUD's responsibility is to protect the consumer_not to mediate among industry interests. 

(2) HUD should regulate multibillion dollar industries responsibly_principally by acting quickly to end uncertainty.


(3) Technological and business arrangement innovations have the potential to provide significant consumer benefits,
and HUD does not serve consumers well if its regulations unduly stifle such advancements.
On July 6, 1993, in an effort to ensure that the new Administration heard the views of all interested parties, the Department
published a ``notice of written comment period and informal public hearing'' (58 FR 38176), inviting testimony and
written comments on the impact on consumers of the following four provisions of the final rule: 



Issue 1



Section 3500.14(g)(2)(ii), which provides that RESPA Section 8 does not prohibit ``an employer's payment to its
own employees for any referral activities * * *.'' (Hereafter, this issue is referred to as the ``employer-employee
exemption'' or ``Issue 1''.) 


Issue 2



Section 3500.14(g)(2)(iii), which provides that Section 8 of RESPA does not prohibit ``any payment by a borrower
for computer loan origination services, as long as the disclosure set forth in Appendix E of [the final rule] is provided
the borrower.'' (Hereafter, this issue is referred to as the ``computer loan origination (CLO) exemption'' or ``Issue
2''.) 



Issue 3



Section 3500.13(b)(2), which provides that ``in determining whether provisions of State law or regulations concerning
controlled business arrangements are inconsistent with RESPA or this part, the Secretary may not construe those
provisions that impose more stringent limitations on controlled business arrangements as inconsistent with RESPA,
as long as they give more protection to consumers and/or competition.'' (Hereafter, this issue is referred to as ``preemption
policy'' or ``Issue 3''.) 



Issue 4



Section 3500.15(b)(1), which provides for a ``written disclosure in controlled business situations, in the format
of the Controlled Business Arrangement Disclosure Statement set forth in appendix D of this part'' of certain information
regarding the ownership and financial relationships between referring and referred-to parties, and for certain
timing and other methods for disclosure. (Hereafter, this issue is referred to as ``controlled business disclosure
policy'' or ``Issue 4''.) 

At a public hearing held on August 6, 1993, at the General Services Administration (GSA) Auditorium in Washington,
DC, all 36 parties who had requested to testify did so. Twenty-two witnesses opposed provisions of the rule and 14 witnesses
supported provisions of the rule. The Department also received 1,553 written comments.
 Of the 1,526 comments reviewed, 1,148 comments opposing provisions of the final rule were received from mortgage
lenders, or State or regional organizations representing mortgage lending professionals; consumer organizations;
3 Federal agencies; and, in both combined comments and separately, several State Attorneys General. An additional
325 critical comments were received from law firms and title insurance companies. Twenty-four comments were wholly
or generally supportive of the final rule, including comments from individuals and organizations in real estate-related
industries, lenders or title insurance providers, real estate brokers, a builder, and the Federal Reserve Board.
The remainder of the comments were not characterized.





III. The Secretary's Position: A Brief Summary 



Based on a complete review of the substantive arguments in support of and in opposition to the final rule provided in
the testimony at the August 6, 1993, hearing; the written comments received; and a review of the RESPA statute, its
purpose, and its history, the Department reached certain conclusions about its policy objectives on Issues 1-4,
set forth above. The Department therefore proposes to amend the final rule as described below. Recognizing the rapid
evolution of technology and business practices, the Department believes that development of the final rule will
require additional collateral information about how certain details of this proposal will work in practice and whether
these details will further the Department's policy objectives. Therefore, the Department has developed a series
of questions about specific aspects of the proposal and asks commenters to offer any information they may have about
how the rules would work. These questions are detailed throughout this preamble.

<TEXT>
 

The following are the Department's policy objectives in addressing each issue and the Department's conclusions
as set forth in the proposed rule: 



A. Issue 1: The Employer-Employee Exemption



(1) 

HUD's objective. 

Controlled business arrangements and so-called ``one-stop shopping'' 

may 

offer consumers significant benefits including reducing time, complexity, and costs associated with settlements.
If they do, the market should produce incentives for the creation of controlled business arrangements without HUD
authorizing incentive payments (otherwise impermissible under RESPA) to encourage these arrangements. However,
HUD cannot scrutinize every aspect of the financial relationship between interrelated companies. Therefore, HUD's
objective is primarily to prohibit compensation for business development for related entities at a point when that
compensation has the greatest potential for overwhelming the other considerations that go into business referrals,


e.g.,

 long-term customer satisfaction. 

(2) 

HUD Proposal. 

(a) The exemption under the final rule permitting employers to pay their own employees referral fees is proposed to
be withdrawn. Under this proposal, no employee of a company may be paid referral fees, even for referrals to an affiliate
company. This proposal is based on the Department's view that the exemption under the final rule was too expansive
and compromised the statute's purpose of protecting the consumer from being referred for settlement services based
on financial gain to the referrer, rather than on the highest quality and best price of the services. 

(b) In the interest of avoiding undue interference with the internal operations of controlled businesses, which
Congress has concluded are permitted business arrangements under RESPA, the proposed rule would allow the payment
of bonuses and compensation to managerial employees in controlled businesses for such purposes as the generation
of business among affiliates; provided, however, that the compensation: (i) Is not tied on a one-to-one basis or calculated
as a multiple of the number or value of any referrals; and (ii) these employees do not routinely deal with the public.




B. Issue 2. Computerized Loan Origination Systems 



(1) 

HUD's Objective. 

The comments and witnesses at the public hearing demonstrated that there is some confusion concerning the scope of
the Department's authority under RESPA to regulate CLOs. Thus, the Department's first objective in this area is to
clarify what the RESPA rules can and cannot do. (See section below describing the legal framework for analysis of payments
for CLO services.) In addition, the Secretary wishes to encourage the exploration and use of new technology, especially
when the new technology may provide information and services to better inform consumers about one of the largest and
most complex financial transactions in their lives, thus allowing the consumers to be more effective shoppers. However,
the use of that technology does not justify increasing the cost of mortgage loan originations when the technology
does not provide meaningful information otherwise available without charge, or when there is no additional convenience,
clarity, or other benefit. 

(2) 

HUD Proposal. 

The final rule would be amended to define a CLO and to provide that payments made by borrowers to CLO operators for use
of a 

qualified

 CLO are exempt from RESPA scrutiny. The definition would set forth reasonable requirements for qualified CLO systems
for access, lender-neutrality, and disclosure to consumers. Systems that fall outside the exemption would have
to meet the basic test of Section 8 of RESPA that the borrower's payments be for goods or facilities actually furnished
or for services actually performed.

C. Issue 3: Preemption


There are no proposed changes to the preemption provisions. The Secretary has concluded that change to these provisions
is not warranted at this time. 


D. Issue 4: Controlled Business Disclosure Form


The rule would be amended to add an acknowledgement provision on the controlled business disclosure form and to make
other small revisions. 


IV. Discussion of Comments


A. Commenters Opposing the 1992 Revised RESPA Rule 


The following summarizes the nature of the commenters and comments opposing and supporting provisions on which HUD
invited comment in its July 6, 1993, notice (58 FR 38176), as well as the positions taken in this proposed rule. In general,
commenters were responsive to the notice's invitation and focused their remarks on the four identified provisions
of the rule. A few comments raised other issues concerning the final rule, but the focus of the hearing and request for
comments was the four specific areas listed. This proposed rule deals only with the four issues on which comment was
invited. 
Eleven hundred forty-eight commenters opposed provisions of the final rule. Commenters included mortgage lenders,
realtors, and State or regional organizations representing mortgage lending professionals. The Department received
an additional 325 comments critical of the rule from law firms and title insurance providers. Opposition was also
expressed by six national organizations representing elements of the mortgage finance or title insurance industries,
two national consumer organizations, an economist, a legal aid society, a real estate consultant, a law student,
and four commenters whose professional interest could not be ascertained. A few national or regional computer service
providers also commented on the rule. 
Finally, 3 Federal agencies_the Federal Reserve Board, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), and the
Office of Thrift Supervision_submitted comments on the final rule, and 4 opposition comments were received from
State Attorneys General, including 1 comment representing the unified position of the Attorneys General of 16 States.



B. Commenters in Support of the Revised RESPA Rule 


Comments wholly or generally supportive of the final rule were received from 24 individuals and organizations engaged
in real estate-related industries, including 15 lenders or title insurance providers; 6 real estate brokers or agents;
an organization composed of controlled businesses, including realtors, which was formed in part to support the final
rule (RESPRO); a builder; and the Federal Reserve.





C. Summary of the Comments 


In the ensuing discussion, arguments presented by the commenters related to these four issues will be summarized
under the four issue headings. When commenters have asserted related arguments affecting the disposition of two
or more of these issues, those comments will be mentioned in the course of discussing the issue that HUD perceives to
be the core argument made by the particular commenter. 


(1) Issue 1: The Employer-Employee Exception 


The employer-employee exception provision in  3500.14(g)(2)(ii) of the final rule_allowing ``an employer's
payment to its own employees for any referral activities * * *''_was the subject of more adverse comment
than any other issue raised by the July 6, 1993, notice. 
Hundreds of lenders, attorneys, and settlement agents objected to the rule's provision permitting employer payments
to employees for ``referral activities''. Objections were focused, in large part, on what commenters perceived
as the anticompetitive effect of permitting referral-based payments. Additionally, the Mortgage Bankers Association,
sixteen State attorneys general, and a large number of other institutional and individual commenters saw the referral
payment provision as being directly contrary to the RESPA statute, or, at a minimum, as contravening statutory intent.

The supporting commenters cited the desirability of vertical integration and the difficulty in enforcing employer-employee
arrangements when the employer controlled all of the relevant documentation. 
(a) 

``Anticompetitive'' Arguments Against Referral Payments

. The central argument raised by numerous commenters, including the combined comments of attorneys general of several
States, was that referral payments were a breach of the trust of prospective home purchasers, particularly in transactions
involving real estate agents and affiliated companies:



Consumers expect to be treated fairly by their real estate agents and therefore trust that a referral to a settlement
service provider is based solely on their agent's knowledge of comparative prices and service features. When there
was no financial incentive for the [real estate agent], consumers were justified in thinking that they were referred
to a settlement service provider because that provider offered good service at a reasonable price, not because the
agent received a payment in exchange for the referral. This is no longer the case.



Comments of State Attorneys General

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940721-1-00059 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940721-1-00014 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

Referral payments, commenters repeatedly pointed out, permit vertically integrated real estate companies to provide
financial incentives to their employees to make all settlement service referrals to affiliated companies. As a result,
settlement service providers tied to a real estate company are ``insulated from competition on prices and services.''

RESPA was adopted, one commenter observed, because of Congress' recognition that the very nature of the real estate
transaction is arcane and cumbersome, and that the typical consumer lacks any comparable economic experiences.
The Consumers Federation of America (CFA) noted that the consumer has traditionally relied for assistance on the
real estate broker (who ordinarily is an agent of the seller)_a person in ``a highly privileged position of influence
over the consumer * * *.'' CFA concluded that RESPA evidences congressional recognition that this
influence can be easily abused for broker self-gain at the material expense of consumers. 
The Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA) and other commenters remarked that in the absence of referral fees, real estate
agents may be expected to afford good advice to home buyers. The real estate agent has an incentive (the prospect of
a sales commission, as well as potential business referrals and repeat business) to send a buyer to a lender offering
the best combination of service and price. However, when the person making the referral has another motive_a direct
financial interest_it becomes less clear that the agent or broker's referral will be made with the best interests
of the home buyer uppermost, the MBA asserted. 
According to its opponents, the principal consequences of the employer-employee exemption were: 
(i) Failure to refer home buyers to lenders and other settlement service providers that provide the best service and
prices; and 
(ii) Ultimate reduction or elimination of competition in the industry, brought about by ``unfair competition''
driving out small, independent settlement service providers. 
CFA echoed the arguments of lenders, attorneys, and title insurance providers who repeatedly asserted that home
buyers lacked the experience to be sophisticated consumers:



For better or worse, consumers are simply not effective financial services shoppers * * *. Since there
is no possibility of one-stop shopping because the consumer is not shopping, the core claim of consumer benefit offered
by controlled business arrangement advocates_consumer choice_crumbles under the weight of economic reality * * *.
Although shopping may not be occurring, there is, nonetheless, the profound opportunity for `reverse competition'
created by a captive market willing to pay higher-than-market prices. What this rule champions is not one-stop shopping,
but, rather, one-stop pick-pocketing of the consumer through the multi-layers of a diversified financial services
holding company.




Commenters opposed to referral payments were not persuaded by arguments in the 1992 final rule in support of permitting
employer-employee referrals. ``What matters,'' one commenter said, ``is not that the payment is going from employer
to employee * * * [but] that there is payment for a raw referral, creating the very anti-competitive
and anti-consumer financial incentive Section 8 [of RESPA] was intended to eliminate.'' 
(b) 

Legal Arguments Against Referral Payments

. Many of the same commenters who opposed referral payments on policy or economic grounds also argued that permitting
employer-employee payments for referrals directly violated the RESPA statute. CFA, after characterizing the events
that led to the Congress' 1983 controlled business arrangement amendments to RESPA, asserted that the Congress'
clear intent was to permit controlled business arrangements ``only under certain specific conditions.'' The final
rule, CFA claimed, ``grossly exceeds any reasonable interpretation of statutory authority, and * * *
has returned the settlement service marketplace_or at least the controlled business arrangement market_to the
pre-RESPA era of anti-consumer and anti-competitive brokerage steering.'' 
MBA and other commenters observed that Section 8(c)(4)(C) of RESPA states that controlled business arrangements
are permissible as long as ``the 

only thing of value

 that is received from the arrangement, other than payments permitted under this subsection, is a return on the ownership
interest or franchise relationship.'' MBA argued that because the final rule permits employees to receive a ``bonus''
when they refer settlement business to affiliates, the rule ``fails to give effect to the plain language of the statute.''

(c) 

Arguments in Support of the Employer-Employee Exception

. Several institutional commenters, along with real estate brokers, lenders, insurance companies, and vertically
integrated real estate service providers, expressed support for the employer-employee exception provided for
in  3500.14(g)(2)(ii) of the final rule. 
The Director of the Consumer and Community Affairs Division of the Federal Reserve System supported the rule's exemption
for employer payments to its own employees for referral services, saying that it is a ``legitimate expectation''
that an employee would make referrals for the employer and be compensated for the referrals. Prohibiting payment
for referrals, the Federal Reserve spokesperson said, would prove difficult from an enforcement standpoint, since
examiners would then be required to review employer bonus and salary policies to determine whether compensation
was based on general performance, or whether it included payments for referrals. 
The Federal Reserve spokesperson also expressed a concern related to the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 (12 U.S.C.
2901 et seq.) and to the Federal Reserve's efforts to encourage banks to refer business to community-based lenders:



* * * A bank may support these efforts by rewarding employees for referring potential applicants who
have not previously considered the [Community Reinvestment target] bank an accessible community lender. An adverse
interpretation by HUD of this provision could be detrimental to future innovations and developments in community
lending.



The Real Estate Services Providers Council (RESPRO) pointed out that the November 2, 1992, rule makes clear that employer
payments to employees cannot be reimbursed by the party receiving the referral, or that employer payments cannot
be made to nonemployees. 
The Consumer Bankers Association (CBA), although generally supportive of the final rule, urged HUD to go further
by expanding the exemption to the referral fee prohibition to allow payment for referrals to employees of 

affiliated

 businesses. In the absence of such an expansion, CBA argued, the structure of the institution could determine whether
an employee could receive a payment for referrals. CBA urged that the difference in the legal treatment of a referral
payment based on the internal structure of a banking organization lacks any policy justification. 
Other commenters asked for expansion of the employer payments principle to allow entities with common ownership
to pay referral fees to affiliated companies.

The Department reviewed the extensive history relating to this issue, including the history of the controlled business
arrangements amendment to RESPA. In enacting Section 8 of RESPA in 1974, Congress prohibited all fees, kickbacks,
or things of value for the referral of settlement service business. The statute, as originally enacted, did not address
referrals of business to affiliated companies. 


In 1980, the case of 

Coldwell Banker 

v. 

Department of Insurance 

(102 Cal.App.3d 381 (2d. Dist. 1980)) reached the courts. In that case the California Insurance Commissioner refused
to grant a license to a wholly owned subsidiary of a real estate company to act as a title insurer. The denial was based
on a concept of restriction of trade. This case drew HUD and congressional attention to whether this or similar controlled
business arrangements might violate Federal law. On July 24, 1980, HUD issued an Interpretive Rule (subsequently
withdrawn) that stated that ``controlled business arrangements may be a violation of Section 8.'' (49 FR 49360; withdrawn
on May 18, 1982, 47 FR 21304.). Two days of congressional hearings were held on September 15 and 16, 1981, and, in 1983,
Congress enacted the ``controlled business arrangement'' amendment to RESPA. 


The 1983 controlled business arrangement amendment represented a compromise between those who wanted no restrictions
on the ability of real estate settlement service professionals to refer settlement service business to entities
with which they had an ownership interest and those who wanted a blanket prohibition against such referrals. The compromise
(see H.R. Report 97-532, at page 52) made clear that controlled business arrangements do not violate RESPA_allowing
affiliated entities, such as real estate professionals, to refer settlement business to related entities_provided
that specified disclosure requirements and safeguards are satisfied, including: 
(1) A requirement that the relationship between the provider of settlement services and the person making the referral
be disclosed, along with the estimated charges of the provider; (2) a bar against the required use of a particular provider,
except under certain specified exceptions under Section 8; and (3) a bar against anything of value being received
by the referring party, beyond a return on ownership interest or franchise relationship or payments otherwise permissible
under Section 8(c) of RESPA. 



Between the enactment of the 1983 amendments to RESPA and the issuance of the 1992 final rule, HUD had issued several
informal legal opinions concerning the extent to which employers could pay referral fees to employees. The opinions
made clear that bona fide full-time employees could be compensated for generating business for their own employers,
as this would be within the scope of their employment. These opinions also made clear that uncompensated referrals
to affiliated companies were not prohibited. These opinions did 

not

, however, broadly approve compensation to all employees for referrals to affiliated companies. In the circumstances
addressed by HUD informal opinions prior to the final rule, the permissibility of compensation of employees for referral
related activities depended upon the structure of the affiliated companies or on whether the employees were acting
within the scope of their employment. 



The 1992 final rule went beyond any of these previous positions and created an exemption for any and all employer payments
to its own employees for referrals of business, including referrals to affiliated companies. The final rule only
retained the stricture that the company receiving the settlement business could not directly or indirectly compensate
anyone for such business. Although the rule did not limit this exemption to controlled businesses, the exemption
has little utility for entities other than affiliated companies, since it is unlikely that an employer would pay its
own employees for making referrals to unrelated individuals or companies. The preamble of the final rule set forth
the position that payments from an employer for referrals were exempt from Section 8 because a business entity acts
through its employees; the action of the employees is not sufficiently distinct from the action of the employer to
provide the requisite plurality of actors needed to violate Section 8. Although the rule permitted an employer to
compensate its own employees for referrals, it indicated that if the company receiving the referral reimbursed the
employer or the referring employees, Section 8 of RESPA would be violated. 



Entities critical of the 1992 final rule have characterized the provision permitting employers' payments to their
own employees for referrals as broadly sanctioning referral payments. Trade and business press have frequently
restated this position without examination. Also, the Department's attention has been drawn to a number of advertisements
and mailings in which various companies have cited RESPA as authority for bogus or sham programs under which fees may
be paid to individuals who will become ``employees.'' While the final rule did not permit sham arrangements, neither
did it adequately clarify the extent of the exemption.

Following a full consideration of the testimony and comments, the Secretary has concluded that the 1992 final rule's
employer-employee exemption was too broad. Accordingly, the Secretary proposes to amend the final rule by withdrawing
the exemption set forth in  3500.14(g)(2)(ii) of that rule. This amendment will have the effect of providing
that, while an employer may compensate its own bona fide employees for the generation of its own business, all compensation
for referrals to outside entities, including affiliates, will be prohibited under RESPA. 


In addition to withdrawing the exemption, the proposal clarifies specifically when compensation to employees runs
afoul of the requirements of RESPA. The rule provides that: 


(i) No employee or agent may receive compensation from his or her employer or any other source when the compensation
is tied on a one-to-one basis to, or is calculated as a multiple of the number or value of, referrals of business to an
affiliated entity; and 


(ii) The compensation of agents or employees who routinely are in direct contact with the consumer may not be based
in whole or in part on the value or number of referrals made to affiliated entities. 


These two clarifications are designed to minimize any incentive that a person in a position to make or influence a referral
might have to make a referral based on his or her own financial interests. Clearly, compensation calculated as a multiple
of the number or value of referrals creates a powerful incentive to make referrals that maximize one's own compensation.
Similarly, agents or employees who ordinarily are in direct contact with the consumer may be influenced in making
referrals if their overall performance is measured and compensation is set, even in part, based on the number or value
of referrals to affiliated entities. The proposal makes clear that RESPA prohibits such compensation. By withdrawing
the broad exemption, the potential for conflict of interest by those persons making referrals is reduced, increasing
the possibility of true competition among settlement service providers based on the cost and quality of the services
provided. 



Most facets of the settlement services business are very competitive, and the Secretary wants to assure that the rule
does nothing to harm this competitiveness. The provisions set forth above that would clarify how RESPA affects employee
compensation can be enforced and will not require HUD to interfere unduly with the internal operations of controlled
business arrangements. Because Congress has clearly ruled on the acceptability, with conditions, of controlled
business arrangements, the role of the Department is not to encourage or discourage controlled business arrangements,
but to clarify what activities between interrelated companies are permissible or not permissible under RESPA. 


With the withdrawal of the exemption, employees of controlled business arrangements could continue to send consumers
to affiliated companies, but they may be more likely to exercise independent judgment reflecting the interests of
the consumer if the inducement of referral-specific compensation is not present. 


The proposal to withdraw the exemption would obviate the need for a full examination of the question raised by some
commenters about whether the exemption in the proposed rule is contrary to the statute, particularly since the Department
has decided not to withdraw the employer-employee exemption without notice-and-comment rulemaking. In any event,
the Department believes the exemption in the final rule would be legally sustainable, because of the broad exemption
authority of the Secretary under Section 19 of RESPA. 


Pending this proposed rule becoming final, the existing employer-employee exemption remains operational and employer
payments made in accordance with the existing RESPA regulation will 

not 

be treated by the Department as conduct violative of the RESPA statute. However, the exemption in the existing rule
is only available for employees, not independent contractors, a class that, under the Internal Revenue Code, includes
most real estate agents and many others in the settlement services business. Those persons engaging in sham practices
in an attempt to avoid the strictures of RESPA are not protected under the 1992 final rule during the pendency of these
revisions. 


(e) 

Questions and comments on this proposal. 

The Secretary's proposal on the employer-employee issue seeks to clarify RESPA's consumer protections while avoiding
unnecessary intrusion into controlled businesses. The Secretary intends to be flexible in finalizing this proposal
in pursuit of these objectives. To assist in this rulemaking, the Secretary is particularly interested in comments
containing responses to the following questions: 


(i) To what extent do you believe the Secretary's proposal will accomplish the objectives of eliminating compensated
referrals and other payments that pose the greatest dangers to consumers without overwhelming other legitimate
considerations for referrals, such as long-term customer satisfaction? 


(ii) What effect will the proposal have on the ability of firms to provide high-quality and well-priced services to
consumers? 


(iii) To what extent do you believe the proposal will unduly interfere with the operations of controlled businesses?



(iv) What would be the effect of any such interference (with the operations of controlled businesses) on consumers?



(v) To what extent do you believe this proposal will interfere with legitimate business development programs of affiliated
companies? 


(vi) To what extent do you believe that the proposal will result in increased competition in the settlement services
industry? 


(vii) If you disagree with the approach embodied in the proposal, what alternative approaches would increase competition?



(viii) Do you believe that the proposal will adequately protect consumers from steering?

(ix) If you do not believe the proposals will provide adequate protection from steering, what alternatives would
provide such protection? 
(x) To what extent do you believe the proposal will lead to cost savings through increased efficiencies in the settlement
services industry? 
(xi) If you disagree that the proposal will lead to cost savings, what alternatives would you suggest to facilitate
efficiencies? 
In promulgating a final rule, the Secretary invites, and will consider, economic and other data submitted on the effect
on the settlement services industry and consumers of the Secretary's and other proposals. 


(2) Issue 2: Computer Loan Origination Services (``CLOs'') 


(a) 

Comments Critical of the CLO Provision.

 The final rule's revision of the RESPA regulations indicated that payment by a borrower for computer loan origination
services was 

not 


'prohibited by RESPA or Regulation X. This provision also drew hundreds of adverse comments, as well as support
from several commenters responding to the Department's July 6, 1993, notice. 
Many commenters treated the CLO issue and the issue of referral payments as closely related concerns. Computer loan
origination services, these commenters claimed, often are nothing more than thinly disguised arrangements for
the referral of settlement services. The commenters argued that both referral payments and superficial or nominal
CLO services involve the ``steering'' of homebuyers to a limited choice of service providers. A number of these commenters
indicated their belief that simple disclosure of the fact that a fee is being charged affords inadequate protection
against these dangers. 
The Consumer Federation of America (CFA) entered vigorous objections to the borrower fee authorized by the final
rule. ``If there is economic value to the adoption of electronic loan origination technology, CFA believes that the
marketplace will, on its own, adopt it. There is no reason why the consumer should foot the bill for the industry's capital
investment.'' The CFA asserted that the RESPA statute was ``suspicious'' of fees for services of unknown or questionable
value, and it objected to any ``sanctioned levy against consumers for CLO services.'' 
Several commenters expressed their confusion concerning a CLO-related question posed to the public in the July 6,
1993, notice. The question presented was whether further clarifications or additional conditions regarding CLOs
are needed or would be desirable to protect consumers, 

particularly if any payment for the CLO service comes directly or indirectly from a lender.

 (Emphasis supplied.) 
Some commenters addressing this issue said they had assumed that the final rule only permitted ``customer-pay''
systems. If lender-pay systems are permissible, these commenters claimed, a major new problem is presented. Lender-pay
systems are especially dangerous, the commenters declared, because the broker's financial gain and incentive to
steer may be totally hidden. 
A significant minority of the commenters (including many who otherwise opposed features of the final rule) believe
that CLO services are the wave of the future and that computer-based systems promise real benefit to prospective homebuyers.
These commenters, however, joined with other critics of the CLO provision in questioning the legitimacy of linking
CLO systems to referral fee arrangements. Others commenters objected to the final rule's failure to assure universal
access to CLOs by lenders doing business in a particular location. Hundreds of comments_predominantly from lenders
and related settlement service providers_urged that a comprehensive, limiting definition of CLO services be added
to the rule. 
A commenter representing an automated service provider expressed his fear that CLOs operated by real estate brokers
and agents could be used to ``display financial information [about other lenders] inferior to what [the broker's
affiliate] is offering, and charge the borrower for doing it; then use the CLO fee collected for payment of `employee
compensation' to guide the buyer to the broker-owned title company, closing service, insurance agency, home warranty
company, and pest control company. The referral fee will not come from the normal real estate commission, but instead
each service generates sufficient income to pay a referral fee to capture the next service, commencing with the CLO
fee.'' The commenter further stated:

 

Information provided through technology is not only valuable, but vital given today's complex and sophisticated
lending; but, to allow a real estate broker to charge a purchaser for providing this information without having adequate
guidelines in place assuring that the consumer will, in fact, receive information that is in the best interest of the
consumer * * * is a terrible disservice to the consumer * * *.

 

Commenters on the CLO issue had an array of suggestions for revising the RESPA regulations to limit, expand, or otherwise
control the use of homebuyer- or lender-compensated CLO services, and to add suitable definitions of the term ``CLO''.
Among these suggestions were: 
(i) Creating an (unspecified) ``market mechanism'' to keep CLO fees reasonable and closely related to the true value
of the service being performed; 
(ii) Requiring the borrower to pay for CLO services 

at the time the service is being provided

 (a number of commenters believed that such a requirement would help assure that the homebuyer would insist on receipt
of a ``real'' service, ``rather than unknowingly subsidize a disguised referral fee that is buried at the end of escrow'');

(iii) Mandating that a substantial number of lender participants be included in any CLO system, and defining the term
``computer loan origination service'' in such a way as to exclude CLO providers that afford the borrower only limited
information; 
(iv) Requiring CLOs operated by real estate brokers or agents to make special disclosures concerning use of CLO systems,
in greater detail than the disclosures set out in Appendix E to 24 CFR part 3500. (A large number of lender-commenters
asserted that special disclosure was unnecessary when CLOs are used by lenders, arguing that real estate brokers,
``who may be receiving another fee in the transaction,'' were the only parties for whom CLO-related disclosures should
be required.);

(v) Cautioning HUD 

not

 to permit 

lenders

 to pay for CLO services (arguing that any payment coming directly or indirectly from a lender should be subject to the
anti-kickback provisions of Section 8 of RESPA). While the 1992 final rule addressed only the issue of fees paid by
borrowers, commenters also discussed the issue of fees paid by lenders for inclusion on CLO systems, in response to
the invitation for such comments in the July 6, 1993, notice. Most commenters referred to such payments as thinly disguised
referral fees. 
(vi) Requiring disclosure that particular CLO listings provide only partial information about available loans.
(A few commenters urged that the CLO fee disclosure form include ``bold print'' disclosing that the same information
could be acquired by the prospective homebuyer ``for free'' by shopping on their own.); 
(vii) Recognizing that CLO services, if performed by a real estate broker or agent for a homebuyer, create a conflict
of interest and a ``potentiality for fraud'' for the broker or agent, whose fiduciary duty is to the 

seller.

 Unified comments from 16 State Attorneys General asserted that the use of CLOs by real estate agents is analogous to
the situation once prevalent in the travel industry:

 

* * * where independent travel agents using computer reservation services steered travelers to whichever
airline happened to own the computer system used by the travel agent. Those flights were not always the most convenient
or cheapest for the consumer. Private antitrust enforcement actions were required to rein in these practices.

 

The Attorneys General declared that the economic costs of these airline-industry practices are ``trivial compared
to the costs to consumers if CLOs are used to steer consumers in large numbers to more expensive mortgages than are readily
available [elsewhere] in the market.'' 
(viii) Suggesting that (in defining a CLO system) HUD require equal access to the system by any lender requesting access;

(ix) Urging that fees for CLO services be proscribed because access to lender information has, before, been a free
service performed by real estate agents or brokers; thus CLO charges would ``create a new fee for no real [new] value
or service provided;'' 
(x) Arguing that borrower information achieved through the CLO process was near-worthless, because lenders will
have to reverify any information provided before underwriting loan applications; and 
(xi) Requiring that the CLO disclosure (and acknowledgement) occur before the borrower agrees to use computer loan
origination services. 
In addition to these recommendations from multiple commenters, the Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA) recommended
specific modifications to  3500.14(g)(2)(iii): 
(one) Prohibiting the receipt of compensation for operating a CLO by any person who already receives compensation
for the same transaction in another capacity; 
(two) Defining ``computer loan origination services'' in a manner that would require interactive communication
with the computer systems and the listing of multiple lenders upon request and for no charge; and 
(three) If the first two recommendations are not accepted by HUD, requiring that the CLO fee be both disclosed and paid
for before the CLO is accessed. 
The MBA also urged that the rule set out the principle that the mere performance of ``clerical loan origination activities,
most or all of which will have to be repeated by the lender'' does not constitute a service justifying the collection
of a fee. 
(b) 

Comments Supportive of the CLO Provision.

 Comments in support of the CLO provision of the rule were varied. In general, these comments urged retention of the
final rule's disclosure-based authorization of CLOs and CLO charges to borrowers. However, supporters of the CLO
provision and other commenters on the provision expressed considerable sentiment that substantial clarification
of the rule was necessary in this area. 
Several commenters observed that the rule was silent on the question of what disclosure (if any) would be required
if the 

borrower

 was not charged a fee for access to a CLO service. 
One commenter ventured that, evidently, the rule's silence on the issue would indicate that no disclosure would be
required when, for example, the 

lender

 paid CLO-connected fees. While the commenter approved this result, he added that ``further clarification would
be welcome.'' The comment recommended that no separate disclosure be required for lender-pay or for ``no charge''
CLO services_even where it was clear that no-fee CLO systems were being paid for out of loan origination fees or lump-sum
fees that are charged to lenders and mortgage brokers to process and underwrite mortgage loan applications. In these
instances, the commenter maintained, the CLO services were less like traditional settlement services and more like
services purchased by a settlement service provider to help it perform its normal functions_``back office'' loan
origination services. 
In general remarks, the same commenter argued that overregulation of CLO services would stifle innovation and competitiveness.
It was pointed out that one of the major advantages of CLO services was the expansion of housing opportunity ``into
sectors of the U.S. economy not now adequately served by the mortgage lending industry.'' 
Several commenters suggested that, with the very recent revision of  3500.14(g)(2)(iii), the Department
should not make immediate changes, but should allow the marketplace to develop and experiment with CLOs without additional
regulation. However, in a number of instances commenters supportive of the final rule's treatment of CLO services
joined opponents in requesting that HUD provide clarifications of the rule that would: 
(i) Define the term ``computer loan origination services''; 
(ii) Indicate whether payment for CLO services must come solely from borrowers, or whether lender-paid services
are permitted; and

<TEXT>
 

(iii) Advise whether there exists an ``implicit limitation'' on the fees that can be paid to CLO providers (such as
a reasonable relationship to the market value of the services performed).

Other pro-rule commenters joined commenters that had objections to the CLO services provision in supporting an explicit
requirement that the CLO fee disclosure statement be given to the borrower 

before

 the fee is imposed, and that the fee be paid to the CLO operator 

before

 services are performed. ``By requiring upfront disclosure and payment,'' one commenter observed, ``the borrower
will be aware that a separate fee is being imposed for services not required by the mortgage lender and will be able to
determine whether the services provided by the CLO operator merit such a fee.''

On the subordinate issue of the number of lenders included on CLOs, commenters supporting the CLO provision generally
differed with opponents, many of whom urged much closer regulation of this aspect. The pro-CLO services commenters
generally advocated ``leaving to the marketplace'' the determination of how many lenders were appropriate for a
CLO service. One commenter argued that dictating how many lenders must appear on the CLO system ``is another example
of well-intentioned regulation which could ultimately hurt consumers.'' The commenter pointed out that individual
lenders may want to develop competing CLO products, each marketing its own software products, with the CLO operator
then having access to several single-lender CLOs. The commenter concluded, as did several other supporters of the
final rule's CLO services provision, that a consumer provided with full disclosure can determine the services for
which the consumer is willing to pay.

A few commenters anticipated adverse comment on the CLO systems issue and urged the Department not to bend to those
commenters who would impose limitations on fees for CLO services or would require that fees be collected up-front.

One commenter whose overall position strongly supported the final rule took a position comparable to many anti-CLO
commenters in several respects. To protect consumers this commenter supported the imposition of additional conditions
relating to CLO systems, such as:

(i) Up-front disclosure of the CLO fee, and payment in advance of the performance of services; and

(ii) A regulatory requirement that real estate brokers be required to perform services ``beyond electronically
providing a menu of lenders' interest rates and products.'' The same commenter, however, joined other CLO services
proponents in urging that HUD should not attempt to regulate the number of lenders to be included in CLOs.

One commenter, evidently the operator of a large, independent computer loan origination system, made several points
from that perspective:

(i) The commenter's independent CLO system avoided ``steering'' abuses because steering arises when lenders offer
commissioned loan officers or mortgage brokers a larger commission on some products than on others, thus encouraging
lenders to sell a particular type of loan. The commenter's system required uniform charges across loan products and
lenders, which are established by contract among participants and monitored by the CLO service provider;

(ii) The system encourages competitive loan pricing, by including a wide variety of information affecting the overall
cost of a loan to a consumer and making it simple for a loan counselor to find the ``best deal'';

(iii) The system increases competition in rural areas, by expanding the number of lenders offering loans;

(iv) The system helps to avoid racial and other forms of discrimination against borrowers by making the loan-decision
process ``demonstrably race-blind'';

(v) The system avoids the criticism that CLO systems are mere ``kickback schemes,'' because the loan counselors working
with the system perform full loan-origination functions.

This commenter recommended that RESPA be revised to stipulate that real estate brokers may not charge for origination
services (implicitly, CLO services) unless they actually register a loan commitment with the lender. ``This assures
that the [broker] has at least qualified the borrower, and made a loan selection with the borrower's concurrence.
These are non-trivial functions for which a payment is justified,'' the commenter said. The commenter favored this
``functional'' test, as opposed to a regulatory limitation on the number of CLO services provided or a ban on single-lender
CLOs.

Several comments from real estate brokers stated their support for the CLO services provision of the final rule. Among
these, at least two real estate broker commenters assumed that CLO services would involve multiple lenders:




[I assume that] all CLOs will offer the rates and costs of many lenders. When lenders realize that they are in competition
with other lenders, they will be forced to deliver the best rates at the lowest cost * * *. I can assure
you that if a home buyer walks into a lender's office to obtain a loan, there is little chance that lender would send the
buyer to a competitor even though the rates and costs may be lower.




A second real estate broker described his company's CLO service as having access to an affiliate and 20 competitors,
indicating that this variety and choice afforded borrowers with distinct advantages over borrower-initiated loan
shopping.

(c) 

Description of the Legal Framework for Analysis of Payments for CLO Services. 

HUD has found that the use of the term ``CLO exemption'' in the preamble of the 1992 final rule may have created certain
misperceptions. To ensure that there is no confusion about the scope of the regulatory exemption proposed below,
the Department believes that it will be helpful to set out the legal framework for its analysis of payments for CLO services.

In general, the provision of CLO services may be financed by the operator of a CLO system in several ways:



</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940721-1-00065 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940721-1-00014 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

(i) The operator could charge lenders to have information about their products displayed on the CLO system;

(ii) The operator could charge borrowers to use the CLO system;

(iii) The operator could charge both lenders and borrowers; and

(iv) The operator could provide the service free of charge to both lenders and borrowers in the belief that providing
the service will attract more customers for the operator's related settlement service business.

Section 8(a) of RESPA prohibits a lender from paying a CLO operator a referral fee. Section 8(b) of RESPA prohibits
a CLO operator from accepting a payment from a borrower ``other than for services actually performed.'' Therefore,
in the absence of any regulatory exemption, under RESPA:

(one) Payments by a lender to a CLO operator are subject to scrutiny to determine whether the payment is a referral fee
or is bona fide compensation for goods or facilities actually furnished or for services actually performed; 
(two) Payments by a borrower to a CLO operator are subject to scrutiny to determine whether the payment is a sham or duplicative
charge, rather than a payment for goods or facilities actually furnished or services actually performed; and

(three) When neither borrowers nor lenders pay a fee for the CLO services, only certain disclosures are required.

The 1992 final rule created an exemption from Section 8 for ``any payment by a 

borrower

 for computer loan origination services,'' as long as certain disclosures were provided (emphasis added). This rule
did not address payments made by lenders, thus leaving such payments subject to Section 8 scrutiny. Although the term
``CLO exemption'' is frequently used, including in the preamble of the 1992 final rule, the exemption was not for the
CLO itself, but only for payments made for CLO services by borrowers.

Many commenters were concerned about whether any system that merely claimed to be a CLO deserved to be given an exemption
from RESPA's requirements. As noted in the above statement of HUD's objective, the Department seeks to encourage
the use of new technology in ways that provide meaningful information and services to consumers. Uncertainty about
how RESPA applies to CLOs may inhibit their development. Therefore, the Department has determined that continuation
of such an exemption is justified; however, the Department seeks to limit the exemption only to payments for access
to CLO systems that provide meaningful information and services to consumers. Payments for access to systems that
provide such benefits will not be subject to scrutiny under Section 8.

Accordingly, the Department proposes to amend the 1992 final rule to limit the exemption to payments made by borrowers
for services from ``qualified CLOs'' only, and to define qualified CLOs to be those systems that the Department believes
provide meaningful information and services to consumers. Payments by borrowers for services of systems other than
``qualified'' CLOs are not prohibited; rather those payments are subject to scrutiny under the Section 8 test articulated
above.

Similarly, the 1992 final rule did not mention payments made by lenders to CLO operators. However, having proposed
to limit the scope of the exemption for borrower payments and certain lender payments, the Department asks commenters
to address whether a parallel exemption for payments made by lenders to operators of ``qualified CLOs'' would be in
the best interest of consumers.

(d) 

Position of the Proposed Rule on CLOs. 

Based upon a review of the comments and testimony on this issue, the Secretary concluded that the potential of CLOs
to be convenient and provide consumers with meaningful information about their choices justified the encouragement
of certain CLOs and the continuation of an exemption for borrower payments for certain CLOs. The Secretary also determined
that it is necessary to amend the rule to define the type of CLO for which borrower payments are permitted without further
RESPA scrutiny, in order to maximize the potential consumer benefits from this developing technology and protect
consumers. Accordingly, the Secretary proposes to amend the rule to provide that payments made by borrowers for qualified
CLO services only are exempt, and to define qualified CLOs as those systems meeting the following requirements:

(i) Qualified CLOs must be responsive to information about the borrower and provide information regarding loan options
for that borrower. (This provision is responsive to commenters who feared that without definition, a system using
FAX-transmitted data or even telephone calls might qualify as a CLO system.)

(ii) Qualified CLOs must meet certain fair participation and display requirements, including that participation
and display of loan products from numerous lenders offering various loan products must be allowed, factors for selecting
lenders to participate on the CLO system be fair and legitimate; and information on individual loan products must
be displayed in a lender-neutral manner. While the Department recognizes that there are practical limits on the number
of lenders that can be included usefully on a system, because of technological and other limitations, the proposed
rule contemplates that a minimum of 20 lenders will participate on a qualified CLO system. (The Department asks for
comments on whether this number is appropriate or another number would better ensure competition while providing
a meaningful level of information to the consumer.) The exemption is still available when less than 20 lenders choose
to participate, as long as the CLO system remains open to and accepts additional lenders. Selection of lenders for
participation must be done as a result of the fair application of impartial criteria, which may include, but are not
limited to, the date of the lender's application for participation on the CLO system (

e.g.,

 first-come, first-served), the quality of services and capabilities a lender provides to consumers, the types of
loan products offered by a lender and its pricing practices, and the extent to which a lender's participation will
increase the variety of loan products offered to consumers by the system. (The application of factors may not be used
to avoid the 20 lender requirement.) CLO system operators must have a reasonable justification supported by documentation
for selection decisions. No lender may be favored or disfavored by the 

manner

 in which information regarding the lender or its products is presented to the borrower or is utilized on the system,
or by the scope of information that a particular lender is permitted to include as compared to another lender.

(iii) Qualified CLOs must provide borrowers with a CLO disclosure form that states that use of the system is not required,
space on the system is limited, the full range of products meeting the borrowers' needs may not be listed on the system,
and other lenders not listed on the system may offer better terms and conditions including lower rates. A disclosure
format for this and other information is set forth in the proposed rule as Appendix E.

(iv) Qualified CLOs must charge borrowers the same fee for the same CLO service or the same components of service. The
exemption does not attempt to fix a price for CLO services; market forces and market experiences should continue to
shape the evolution and development of qualified CLO systems. Rather, where fees are charged, all borrowers must
be treated equally. If fees are waived by a CLO provider, they must be waived fairly and not because of the choice of a
particular lender. If the fee is contingent on use of a loan product on the system, the contingency must apply equally
to all loan products and lenders on the system.

(v) An operator of a qualified CLO may also charge lenders for access to the system and for a portion of maintenance and
operation costs of the system. However, the schedule of charges for each lender on the system must be identical. Furthermore,
qualified CLOs must disclose to the borrower, on the form prescribed in Appendix E and on the HUD-1 or the HUD-1A,
the amount of any anticipated payments by a lender.

(vi) Fees and disclosures about the CLO system must also be prominently displayed and visible to the potential borrower
on the premises near where the CLO terminal is located. The information that more advantageous loan alternatives
may exist that are not displayed on the system must be similarly disclosed.

(vii) Any borrower payment to a CLO operator for use of a qualified CLO must be paid outside of and before closing. A borrower
must receive full disclosure of the amount of the fee before the CLO services are performed. 

In this proposed rule, the Department is establishing the minimum requirements that must be met by a qualified CLO
system if payments by a borrower to the operator of the system are to enjoy an exemption from RESPA. The Department believes
that these requirements are responsive to the many comments on CLOs, and that compliance with the requirements will
assure that: CLO systems receiving the benefit of the exemption are operated fairly; these systems will not be used
as disguised means of steering borrowers to particular lenders on a basis other than the quality of services provided;
and lenders wishing to participate in qualified CLO systems will be permitted to do so on a fair and equitable basis.


In addition, this proposed rule would continue and augment certain requirements for all providers of CLO services,
whether or not the CLO is a qualified CLO. In all circumstances where a CLO is utilized, the CLO disclosure set forth
in Appendix E must be provided to borrowers before the CLO services are performed. The existence of any controlled
business arrangement involving the operator of a CLO and any participating lender must be disclosed to the borrower
before the system is utilized. Similarly, lender payments to other settlement service providers for CLO services
must continue to be disclosed on the Good Faith Estimate and on the HUD-1 or HUD-1A, in accordance with the
February 10, 1994 (59 FR 6505) revision of the regulations, and the possibility of such payments must be noted on the
CLO disclosure. 

(e) 

Questions and comments on this proposal.

 In formulating the final rule, the Department may modify the requirements for the exemption, based on comments from
the public. The Department seeks public comment on all aspects of its proposal to limit the exemption for borrower
payments to payments made for qualified CLOs, including: 

(i) Does the approach embodied in this proposal_establishing a safe harbor for borrower payments for qualified systems,
continuing to scrutinize borrower payments for nonqualified systems under RESPA, and mandating certain disclosures
for all systems_the best approach to encourage the use of technology to benefit consumers and, at the same time, protect
consumers from unfair practices? Instead, should the Department provide that any payment for a CLO system that does
not qualify for the safe harbor is presumed to violate RESPA? (Commenters who believe that there should be broader
prohibitions should detail the legal and other justifications for this belief.) 

(ii) Would establishment of a parallel exemption for payments made by lenders to operators of qualified CLOs be in
the best interest of consumers? If so, should the requirements for a lender payment CLO exemption be the same as the
requirements for the borrower payment exemption? Those commenters who believe the requirements should be different
should specify what differences they recommend. 

(iii) Are most CLO systems likely to be financed using borrower payments, lender payments, or a combination of both?
Will any CLO system provide access to the system to lenders and borrowers free of charge? 

(iv) Are the benefits of having borrower payments exempt from RESPA scrutiny sufficient to encourage CLO operators
to develop qualified CLOs? Will CLO operators prefer to be subject to the general test under RESPA that borrower payments
must be in exchange for services actually performed or to meet the requirements for qualified CLOs? 

(v) Will the requirements for qualified CLOs in the proposal result in cost-effective CLOs offering meaningful services
to consumers? 

(vi) Is the requirement for CLO disclosure to consumers in this proposal reasonable and does it serve the consumers'
best interests?

(vii) Is the definition of a qualified CLO sufficiently flexible, considering the nature of this emerging industry
and the Secretary's consumer protection objectives? 

(viii) Are the requirements concerning lender-neutrality and the selection of lenders on a qualified CLO reasonable?


(ix) Is the minimum number of lenders on a qualified CLO (i.e., 20) practical from an operational perspective? Is it
sufficient to ensure competition? (If another number is suggested, please explain why this number would be superior
in promoting competition and the consumers' interests?) 

(x) Is the requirement that all disclosures be made before performance of CLO services reasonable? 

(xi) What will be the impact of the requirement that any borrower payments must be made outside of and before closing?


(xii) Does the requirement that qualified CLOs must provide the borrower with certain information about loans generally
available; collect information about the borrower, the property, and the loan sought; and provide the borrower with
information about loan products available to that borrower accomplish the intended objective of ensuring that a
meaningful service is provided? 

The Department anticipates that the Technology Demonstration that it plans to conduct (see Section I of this preamble)
will also be a useful vehicle for developing answers to some of these questions. 



(3) Issue 3: Preemption of State Laws or Regulations 



In  3500.13(b)(2), the November 2, 1992, final rule provided that ``in determining whether provisions of State
law or regulations concerning controlled business arrangements are inconsistent with RESPA or this part, the Secretary
may not construe those provisions that impose more stringent limitations on controlled business arrangements as
inconsistent with RESPA so long as they give more protection to consumers and/or competition.'' In connection with
the preemption issue, the Department's July 6, 1993, notice requested comments on establishing standards to be used
in evaluating whether provisions in State laws provide greater protection to consumers. The Department also invited
any other comment relative to the preemption provision of the 1992 final rule. 

(a) 

Positions Taken by Commenters Critical of the Rule's Preemption Policy.

 While the Department received hundreds of comments addressing the preemption question, this issue attracted fewer
expressions of opinion than did the other three issues raised in the July 6, 1993, notice. Most of the commenters addressing
the issue (excluding identical-form responses) were attorneys or major institutional commenters. However, even
among the comments from organizations representing institutional interests or segments of the real estate and real
estate finance industries, preemption was the least-frequently addressed of the four issues. 

Commenters who were critical of other aspects of the rule had a mixed approach to the preemption issue and reflected
suspicion of the Department's motives. These comments assumed that, despite the benign phrasing of  3500.13(b)(2),
HUD would (in light of the other features of the 1992 final rule) use preemption in the future to weaken State-initiated
regulation of controlled business arrangements. Those commenters who shared this suspicion varied in their recommendations
for improvement of the rule's preemption feature. Several commenters advised HUD to provide ``greater clarity''
regarding a State's right to 

ban 

or closely regulate controlled business arrangements. Other commenters referenced particular existing State
laws that require controlled business entities to seek a substantial portion of their business from sources other
than their affiliated entities. These commenters urged that HUD provide explicitly that State laws and regulations
of this type would not be subject to preemption.

The tone of these comments suggested that the standard set out in the final rule_i.e., no preemption, so long as a State
law affords ``more protection to consumers and/or competition''_ was insufficient assurance against Federal preemption.
Apparently the final rule was perceived by the commenters as being ``anti-consumer'' in the guise of a consumer protection
regulation. The commenters believed it was clear that State laws forcing controlled businesses to draw business
from nonaffiliates should 

never

 be preempted under RESPA authority. The commenters were not persuaded that the Department intended to apply  3500.13(b)(2)
in a manner that would treat these State laws as ``pro-consumer''. 

Concerned commenters made diverse recommendations: several asked the Department to clarify in the rule that preemption
would not be applied; other commenters, clearly equally averse to preemption of State laws, recommended case-by-case
judgments regarding preemption, using the existing standard set out in  3500.13(b)(2). These latter commenters
often combined their 

status quo 

recommendation with an urging that HUD modify or reverse positions taken on the employer-employee exception or CLO
issues. Their thrust was that HUD's preemption policy would 

not

 be objectionable if the RESPA rule were modified to cure the specific problems being addressed by commenters in their
accompanying remarks. 

The combined comment of the 16 State Attorneys General stated the belief that it would be too difficult to ``define
criteria for preemption in the abstract.'' The comment recommended a case-by-case approach. (Again, this comment
was made in the context of a strong statement of opposition to the final rule's employer-employee fee policy and CLO
exemption.) 

The predominant position of institutional commenters addressing the preemption issue was that it is unnecessary
for HUD to set out strict standards to evaluate whether State law provisions provide greater protection to the consumer.
However, there was considerable sentiment in favor of regulatory ``clarifications'' to serve, in essence, as guarantees
that the Department would 

not

 preempt State laws in any instance where its goal was to limit controlled business arrangements. Consumers Union
believed that HUD's own rules should be changed to afford consumers stronger protections, but, if this was not to be,
``at the very least States should be free to protect their own consumers''. Accordingly, Consumers Union favored
the enunciation of standards for determining whether State law provisions provide greater protection: 




* * * These standards are necessary since the final rule is anti-consumer, but was presented as if it
were pro-consumer. To eliminate any resulting ambiguity, HUD should clarify that [State-originated] rules totally
eliminating any incentive to steer business to an affiliate would be viewed as stronger consumer protection. 




A large number of comments received from individuals and small businesses (mainly lenders) 

favored

 the establishment of written standards for the evaluation of State laws. However, these comments offered no specific
advice concerning the content of the favored written standards. 

Comments submitted by the American Land Title Association (ALTA) claimed that the November 1992 rule on preemption
had ``frightened'' State legislators and regulators ``into believing that the RESPA disclosure provisions [would
be read by HUD to] preempt more stringent state legislation or regulations.'' The ALTA expressed the belief that the
new regulations were ``perverting'' congressional policy regarding the circumstances warranting preemption.
The ALTA further claimed that the preemption provision suggests that ``only 

if the Secretary of HUD

 determines that a state controlled business provisions gives more protection to consumers and competition would
the state provisions 

not

 be preempted.'' (Emphasis in original.) 

The ALTA also complained that the final rule was deterring State governments from considering more stringent regulation
of controlled business, and suggested that the Department support legislative revisions to RESPA to replace ``ineffective''
consumer disclosure requirements with Federal ``public business'' requirements (i.e., requirements that controlled
businesses derive a significant proportion of their business from nonaffiliates).

One of the Federal agencies commenting on the rule, the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS), suggested that separate
review standards for preemption determinations were unnecessary and that HUD could employ a case-by-case analysis,
using the review method outlined in  3500.13(c) of the final rule. (OTS submitted comments critical of the final
rule on the referral fee and CLO issues.) 

(b) 

Positions Taken by Supporters of the Preemption Provisions.

 As in the case of commenters critical of the final rule, supporters of the rule commented less frequently on the preemption
issue than any of the other questions raised in the July 6, 1993, notice. However, there was perhaps a greater gulf between
supporters of the 1992 final rule and its opponents on this issue than on any other. As indicated earlier in this preamble,
opponents of the rule expressed widespread fear that the Department would use its preemption power to nullify what
the opponents perceived as salutary State regulation of controlled business. Proponents of the final rule 

also

 read  3500.13(b)(2) of the rule as promising extensive HUD employment of preemption; however, these commenters
welcomed it. 

The commenters regarded RESPA as sufficient to provide consumers with protection against unfair pricing by settlement
service providers. Often, the commenters claimed, State laws that purport to be protective of consumers are actually
designed to benefit local settlement service providers, by hindering the entry of larger, broad-based providers
into local markets. 

Commenters appeared to assume that the chief intended target of preemption would be State laws directly or indirectly
preventing real estate brokers from owning affiliated title businesses, prohibiting mortgage lenders from affiliating
with title agencies, or restricting the percentage of business that can be derived from referrals from affiliated
businesses. 

A lender with nationwide business objected strongly to the inefficiencies it said resulted from multiple and inconsistent
State law requirements. While these varying requirements are justified if they provide identifiable consumer benefits,
the commenter said, they frequently represent attempts to limit competition among lenders, and actually increase
the costs paid by consumers. 




The experience in Kansas is instructive. After the state enacted a law limiting referrals to affiliated entities,
many title agent affiliates of real estate brokers and mortgage companies were forced out of business. Freed from
the need to compete with such providers, we understand that independent title agents increased their rates by approximately
60%. The Department need look no further than this example to recognize that protection of ``turf,'' rather than protection
of consumers, is normally at the heart of such limitations. 




The commenter went on to urge that HUD make clear that State limitations affecting controlled business arrangements
are preempted by RESPA. 

One commenter said that RESPA regulations encourage nationwide service providers to diversify their product offerings
and enter new geographic markets. Accordingly, Federal preemption of adverse State laws would result in increased
competition. 

While a few commenters appeared to be recommending summary preemption of the array of State laws affecting controlled
business, other commenters, responding to the Department's direct question, urged the establishment of standards
for the case-by-case determination of whether State laws or regulations are inconsistent with RESPA in the controlled
business area, i.e., whether a particular law ``give(s) more protection to consumers and/or competition'' than
does RESPA. 

One commenter suggested that the final rule's treatment of preemption should be fundamentally changed because it
is ``unclear and vaguely worded'': ``What is meant by `stringent limitations' and `give more protection to * * *
competition?''' 

Another commenter cited the legislative history of the 1983 RESPA amendments as indicating Congress' expectation
that, if necessary to protect consumers or encourage competition, HUD would recommend further legislation to place
a percentage limitation on the amount of controlled business that could be transacted. The commenter observed that
in the ten years since the controlled business exemption became law, HUD has not recommended further legislation
in this area. Additionally, the commenter claimed, many State governments have not seen the necessity of enacting
restrictions on the percentage of business that can be derived from affiliated entities. The commenter concluded
that State ``percentage of business'' laws were inconsistent with RESPA and should be preempted as anticompetitive.


(c) 

Position on Preemption in the Proposed Rule.

 Based upon the comments and testimony, the Secretary has determined that it is unnecessary at this time to set out specific
written standards for preemption of State laws. As numerous commenters, including the State Attorneys General,
observed, setting out comprehensive and informative preemption standards presents an almost insurmountable task,
in the absence of a wide array of specific fact situations that are raising preemption issues. If it becomes necessary
to consider this issue further, the Secretary may reopen the issue by rulemaking or deal with specific preemption
issues by means of interpretive rules. No amendments are proposed on this subject in this rule. 



(4) Issue 4: Adequacy of the Controlled Business Disclosure Statement 



In  3500.15(b)(1) of the 1992 final rule, provision was made for ``written disclosure, in the format of the Controlled
Business Arrangement Disclosure Statement set forth in appendix D of this part.'' This disclosure referred to certain
information regarding the ownership and financial relationships between referring and referred-to parties, as
well as information regarding the timing of the disclosure and other methods for disclosure. 

HUD solicited the views of commenters in its July 6, 1993, 

Federal Register

 notice concerning whether the controlled business disclosures outlined in appendix D ``are adequate to protect
the consumer, and, if not, how they might be improved.''

(a) 

Comments Critical of the Disclosure Statement. 

A majority of the commenters expressing dissatisfaction with one or more features of the 1992 final rule's employer
payments provisions also objected to the Controlled Business Arrangement Disclosure Statement set out in Appendix
D to part 3500. 
Generally, these objections were twofold. First, commenters argued that even the best and most complete form of disclosure
imaginable was not an effective means of coping with what the commenters perceived as anticonsumer aspects of controlled
business arrangements. Second, opposition commenters urged that if, against their advice, HUD continued to sanction
referral payments by employers to employees, the form of disclosure required should be strengthened substantially,
and the timing of the required disclosure should be pinpointed for maximum effect in affording consumers a realistic
opportunity to choose alternative settlement service providers. 
More than 800 comments from lenders and settlement attorneys urged expansion of the controlled business disclosure
to assure that borrowers understand that the referral ``will provide a financial benefit to the related parties.''

4

 




Perhaps the most comprehensive criticism of the disclosure policy was expressed by the 16 State Attorneys General
in their comments. After criticizing both the referral payments provision and the CLO exemption, the Attorneys General
said that they were skeptical that disclosures can remedy the inherent dangers to consumers when there are financial
incentives for referrals of business. Conceding that the 1983 RESPA amendments expressly permitted controlled
business arrangements, the Attorneys General urged that the disclosure contemplated by the regulatory amendment
``be as clear and explicit as possible to alert consumers to the potential for harm.'' The comment advocated that the
disclosure form state with greater clarity the purpose for which a disclosure is made and the harm against which it
is aimed. 
Specifically, the State Attorneys General criticized as vague the form's reference to a ``business relationship''
and advocated the inclusion of a statement that, in making the referral to the controlled business, the referring
company or agent (to be identified by name) would benefit ``financially or otherwise.'' The State Attorneys General
wanted the form to indicate that, in addition to lower rates, consumers might receive ``better services'' by shopping
around. ``Indeed, consumers must be affirmatively encouraged to shop around * * * consumers should
be warned in clear, unambiguous language of the pitfalls of relying on a controlled business referral and encouraged
to make intelligent choices among settlement service providers.'' Consumers should also be told in explicit terms,
the comment continued, that they are ``free to choose [their] own settlement service provider and will not be denied
any services or loan for exercising this choice.'' 
Finally, the State Attorneys General favored disclosure of the ``existence of and amounts of'' any fees or kickbacks
paid, directly or indirectly, to the real estate broker or another referring party, or to an affiliated provider,
for the performance of settlement services. A large number of individual commenters and the Coalition to Retain Independent
Services in Settlements (CRISIS) echoed this position. 
The CFA disparaged disclosure, by itself, as being an ``inadequate remedy for the market risks that consumers are
exposed to in the purchase of real estate'':

 

The Department's rule has placed before the consumer a new array of fees for which the delivery of the equivalent of
a tollgate ticket is hardly ample protection. 
One of the central problems of controlled business arrangements is that the underlying purchase is carried out under
conditions of urgency and stress that will always overwhelm a captive consumer. The ability to distinguish between
what must be done_and purchased_and what is optional, is limited. 



The MBA advocated elimination of the employer-employee referral fee exception, but urged that, at least, the disclosure
form should be expanded to include the existence and amount of the referral fee. Similar advice was received from Consumers
Union and from individual commenters. 
The FDIC also expressed some doubt about the efficacy of written disclosure, calling the disclosure form ``just one
of dozens of confusing papers handed to [consumers] over the course of a real estate transaction.'' FDIC nevertheless
advocated strengthening the form by requiring the disclosing entity to meet specific content guidelines and to use
layman's language, ``* * * so less opportunity [is] given for `creative writing'.'' The FDIC also
advocated the use of an acknowledgement line or box on the form, to show that the consumer had read and understood the
controlled business arrangement disclosure. 
The Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS), while expressing concern about employer-employee referral fees and the
efficacy of CLO disclosures, commented that the content and timing requirements for controlled business disclosures,
as set out in the final rule, seemed adequate to protect consumers. 
Departing from the recommendations of other commenters to the effect that the disclosure form should be expanded
to highlight the presence of referral fees and other relationships between the referrer and the service provider,
ALTA's spokesman called the disclosure process ``worthless as a consumer protection measure in the settlement services
arena.'' The ALTA claimed that the consumer is likely to rely upon the recommendation of a trusted professional, ``even
where a personal financial inducement is disclosed.'' ALTA's spokesman advocated legislative solutions, including
amendment of RESPA to permit a competitor's right of action and the institution of blanket prohibitions on controlled
businesses.

(b) 

Comments from Supporters of the Final Rule's Disclosure Statement. 


The Department received detailed comments on controlled business disclosure policy from more than a dozen commenters
who supported the final rule in most of its particulars. Typically, these commenters believed that the form and level
of detail of disclosure of controlled business arrangements that were in the final rule were ``more than adequate''
to permit informed choice by consumers concerning settlement service providers. 
Several commenters pointed out that the required form of disclosure appeared to exceed the statutory disclosure
requirements in several respects. One, the commenters urged that the statute required only that the ``existence''
of a financial interest be disclosed, while the regulation required that the disclosure outline the ``ownership
and financial interest.'' Two, the regulation requires that all disclosures, not just those related to costs, be
made in writing. Three, the regulations require 

separate

 disclosure of controlled business relationships. Finally, the ``suggested format'' for the disclosure (although
not the regulation itself) includes the caution: ``You may be able to get these services at a lower rate by shopping
with other settlement service providers.'' 
Most commenters who raised these points did not address them as objections to, or criticisms of, the 1992 final rule.
Instead, these observations were cited as indications that, in the commenters' views, the rule already was suitably
attentive to consumer protection concerns, in that it went beyond bare-bones statutory disclosure requirements.
Several of these comments went on to urge that the Department continue to limit its RESPA regulations to disclosure-related
concerns, and 

not

 bend to the will of advocates of other methods of regulating or curbing controlled business arrangements: 



RESPA is predicated on the belief that consumers, when provided with appropriate disclosures, are capable of making
informed decisions. Those who argue otherwise frequently do so only to protect their competitive position, not to
advance the interests of consumers. * * * [T]he information contained in the existing controlled
business arrangement disclosures is sufficient and the requirements should not be disturbed.

 

The Federal Reserve Board's comment agreed that the controlled business disclosure policy set out in the rule and
the format were ``more than adequate'' as disclosures. ``* * * [I]f anything, it may be over-disclosing
given the quantity of information that a consumer receives when applying for a mortgage loan.'' A few lender-commenters
expressed a similar view. The Federal Reserve suggested that the consumer needs to know that the two parties involved
in the referral are related, but may not need further details. While the Federal Reserve agreed it is important that
the consumer know that use of the provider is not required, it suggested that including the estimated charges for the
service was ``redundant,'' since such costs would have been disclosed on the Good Faith Estimate. 
One lender argued that controlled business arrangements arise in a variety of situations, and that it is ``impossible''
to mandate the use of a form that is suitable for all providers in all situations. The commenter asked the Department
to provide for flexibility concerning format, ``as long as consumers are informed of the referral and the relationship
between the parties.''

5

 




Another comment urged that the controlled business disclosure form 

not

 be required for disclosure of the specific providers of ``lender required services such as credit reports, appraisals,
[or] flood plain searches.'' The commenter suggested that early disclosure of the identity of these providers was
impractical and provided ``absolutely no benefit to the consumer.'' The information, the commenter concluded,
would appear on the HUD-1 Settlement Statement. 
The most frequent criticism of the rule's controlled business disclosure requirements from commenters supportive
of the rule was that, in some instances, it was unclear when a controlled business arrangement was required to be disclosed.
Several commenters asked whether the disclosure was required when a bank has a wholly-owned subsidiary mortgage
company or when a mortgage company is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the same holding company as the bank. 
The situations in which related businesses were required to make disclosure also were questioned. One commenter
asked whether, if a bank is affiliated with a mortgage company by common ownership, the bank has to make disclosures
to consumers in the following circumstances: 
 When a consumer is directly referred to the mortgage company for a mortgage loan; 
 When the consumer is simply informed of the availability of loans from the mortgage company; and 
 When the bank includes references to the mortgage company in its advertising or its brochures. 
One commenter, stating that the entire category of ``referrals'' was not intended to fall within the coverage of the
controlled business arrangement rules, recommended creation of an exemption to the controlled business arrangement
rules for ```referrals' between bank holding companies' wholly-owned subsidiaries.'' Two commenters asserted
that failing to provide this exemption would be placing mortgage companies within bank holding companies at a competitive
disadvantage when compared to bank mortgage departments. ``The purpose of RESPA is not to dictate the form in which
a bank structures its lending business.'' 
(c) 

Position Taken in the Proposed Rule on the Controlled Business Disclosure Statement. 

The Secretary concluded that the elimination of the employer-employee exception would, in turn, eliminate a number
of the strongest concerns regarding the information in the controlled business disclosure. However, the Secretary
has accepted some suggestions for modifications to the disclosure as useful and beneficial to the consumer. Accordingly,
certain of these suggestions have been included in the proposed rule and in the format of Appendix D. 
The suggested borrower-acknowledgement box has been added to the controlled business disclosure format. Additional
plain language has been added to the format. Section 3500.15(b) proposes a requirement that disclosure be given at
a time to be relevant to the consumer: either (i) at the time of referral or no earlier than 3 days before; or (ii) if the
lender requires the use of a particular provider, the time of the loan application. The preamble of revisions that
extended RESPA coverage to subordinate lien transactions (59 FR 6505, 6510, February 10, 1994) also discussed the
appropriateness of disclosures, stating that ``incidental and uncompensated referrals, such as brochures in a
bank lobby or street directions given by a bank employee, are not perceived as rising to the level necessary to require
a controlled business disclosure.'' 
More sweeping modification of the controlled business disclosure form is not considered necessary. While many commenters
disparaged the use of written disclosure as a means of coping with perceived controlled business-related problems,
the Department continues to believe that full disclosure is useful as a means of informing consumers. Disclosure
is also a preeminent principle of the RESPA statute. 


V. Other Matters

 3500.2 

Definitions. 


* * * * * 


CLO 

means computer loan origination. 


CLO access fee

 means a fee paid by a borrower to a CLO operator for CLO services. 


CLO operator

 means a provider of settlement services who operates a CLO system for a borrower. 


CLO services

 means services provided to a borrower by a CLO operator using a CLO system. 


CLO system

 means a computer system that: 
(1) Provides to prospective borrowers information regarding the rates and terms of federally related mortgage loans;

(2) Collects, assembles, and transmits information concerning the borrower, the property, and other information
on a potential mortgage loan for evaluation by a lender(s); and 
(3) Based on the data transmitted, responds to the borrower with detailed information, including, without limitation,
loan terms, rates, and payment schedules for various loan products that would be available to the borrower from such
lender(s). 


* * * * * 




Managerial employee

 means an employee of a settlement service provider who does not routinely deal directly with the public, and who either
hires, directs, assigns, promotes, and rewards other employees or is in a position to formulate, determine, or influence
the policies of their employer. Neither the term ``managerial employee'' nor the term ``employee'' includes real
estate agents or other independent contractors. 


* * * * * 




Qualified CLO system

 means a CLO system that meets the requirements of  3500.14(g)(3). 


* * * * *

3. Section 3500.14 is amended by revising paragraph (g)(2); by redesignating paragraphs (g) (3) and (4) as paragraphs
(g) (5) and (6), respectively; and by adding new paragraphs (g) (3) and (4), to read as follows: 


 3500.14 

Prohibition against kickbacks and unearned fees. 


* * * * * 


(g) * * * 
(2) Section 8 of RESPA does not prohibit normal promotional and educational activities that are not conditioned on
the referral of business and that do not involve the defraying of expenses that otherwise would be incurred by persons
in a position to refer settlement services or other related business. 
(3) Section 8 of RESPA does not prohibit any payment by a borrower for CLO services provided by a qualified CLO system
that provides CLO services and meets the following requirements: 
(i) 

Multiple Products and Lenders.

 The qualified CLO system shall provide openings for 20 or more lenders offering various loan products. The factors
for selecting the lenders to be included on a qualified CLO system (see paragraph (g)(3)(ii) of this section) may not
be designed to limit or have the effect of limiting eligibility to less than 20 lenders. When the qualified CLO system
has less than 20 lenders, the system shall remain open to and accept additional lenders until at least 20 lenders participate.

(ii) 

Selection Factors.

 To determine eligibility for inclusion in the system, the qualified CLO system shall utilize selection factors that
are fair and impartial and are designed to contribute to the efficiency and quality of the system. These factors may
include, but are not limited to, the date of the lender's application for participation on the qualified CLO system,
the quality of services and capabilities the lender provides to consumers, the types of loan products offered by the
lender and its pricing practices, and the extent to which the lender's participation will increase the variety of
loan products offered to consumers by the system. Qualified CLO system owners shall have a reasonable justification
for selection decisions, supported by documentation which they must maintain. 
(iii) 

Neutrality.

 The CLO operator of a qualified CLO system and the qualified CLO system shall provide borrowers with information in
a neutral manner. No lender shall be favored or disfavored by the manner in which information regarding the lender
or its products is utilized or is presented to the borrower, is used on the system, or is presented by the CLO operators,
or by the scope of information that one lender is permitted to include as compared to another lender. No payments, disincentives,
or penalties may be provided directly or indirectly to CLO operators of qualified CLO systems by any person, including
the CLO operator's employer, to influence the CLO operator to favor any lender on the qualified CLO system. 
(iv) 

Disclosure Statement.

 The CLO operator of a qualified CLO system shall provide a CLO disclosure form to the borrower before CLO services are
performed. The CLO operator shall require the borrower to sign on the CLO disclosure form an acknowledgment that the
borrower has received the disclosure. An enlarged, completed copy of the CLO disclosure form (no smaller than 16''
by 20''), including any applicable fee, shall be displayed prominently within 5 feet of the CLO terminal. The CLO disclosure
form shall: 
(A) Be in the format established in Appendix E of this part; 
(B) Specify the fee and services being provided; and 
(C) Include statements that use of the system is not required; space on the system is limited; the full range of products
meeting the borrower's needs may not be listed on the system; and other lenders not listed on the system may offer better
terms and conditions, including lower rates. 
(v) 

CLO Access Fee.

 The CLO operator of a qualified CLO system shall charge all borrowers using the qualified CLO system the same CLO access
fee(s) for the same service or the same components of service. The CLO operator of a qualified CLO system shall require
the borrower to pay any CLO access fee outside of and before the closing of any loan that may be obtained through use of
this system. The CLO operator of a qualified CLO system may only waive the CLO access fee based on business considerations
of the operator and not on any action of a lender. If the payment of the CLO access fee is contingent on use of a loan product
on the qualified CLO system, the contingency shall apply equally to all loan products and lenders on the qualified
CLO system. 
(vi) 

Lender Charges for Access.

 The CLO operator of a qualified CLO system may charge lenders for access to the qualified CLO system if: 
(A) Charges are set forth in a written schedule of charges; 
(B) Charges for the same services and components of services are the same for all lenders on the system; and 
(C) The charges are reasonably related to the costs of maintenance and operation of the qualified CLO system (

i.e.,

 the facilities furnished or the services actually performed). 
(4) Any payment by a borrower to a CLO operator for services from a nonqualified CLO system, and any payments by a third
party settlement service provider to a CLO operator for access to any CLO system in relation to a federally related
mortgage loan, will be subject to examination under Section 8 of the Act and this part. The disclosure format set forth
in Appendix E of this part and Box 2 of Appendix E of this part shall be utilized by all CLO operators for all CLO systems
and shall be completed before any CLO services are performed. 


* * * * * 


4. Section 3500.15 is amended by revising paragraph (b)(1); by removing the word ``and'' at the end of paragraph (b)(3)(i)(A);
by removing the period at the end of paragraph (b)(3)(i)(B) and replacing it with ``; and''; and by adding paragraph
(b)(3)(i)(C), to read as follows: 


 3500.15 

Controlled business arrangements. 


(b) * * * 
(1) The person making a referral has furnished to each person whose business is referred a written disclosure, in the
format of the Controlled Business Arrangement Disclosure Statement set forth in Appendix D of this part. This disclosure
shall specify the nature of the relationship (explaining the ownership and financial interest) between the provider
of settlement services (or business incident thereto) and the person making the referral, and shall describe the
estimated charge or range of charges (using the same terminology, as far as practical, as Section L of the HUD-1
or HUD-1A settlement statement) generally made by the provider of settlement services. The disclosure must
be provided on a separate piece of paper at or no earlier than 3 business days before each referral, or, if the lender
requires the use of a particular provider, the time of loan application, except that: 


* * * * * 


(3) * * * 
(i) * * * 
(C) No agent or employee may accept any payment from his or her principal or employer or any other source when that payment
is correlated on a one-to-one basis or calculated as a multiple of the number or value of any referrals of business from
his or her employer or principal to an affiliated entity. For example, no person shall pay any managerial employee
or any employee or agent who is in direct contact with the public a bonus or other compensation correlated on a one-to-one
basis or calculated as a multiple of the number or value of any referral of settlement service business by the employee
or the employee's organizational unit to an entity affiliated with the employer or principal. In addition, no compensation
of an employee or agent who is routinely in direct contact with the public may be based in whole or in part on the number
or value of referrals that the employee or agent makes to affiliated entities.

Appendix B to Part 3500_Illustration of Requirements of RESPA 


* * * * * 


11. 

Facts: 

A, a mortgage lender, is affiliated with B, a title company, and C, an escrow company, and offers consumers a package
of mortgage title and escrow services at a discount from the prices at which such services would be sold if purchased
separately. Neither A, B, or C, requires consumers to purchase the services of their sister companies, and each company
sells such services separately and as part of the package. A also pays its employees (i.e., loan officers, secretaries,
etc.) a bonus for each loan, title insurance, or closing that A's employees generate for A, B, or C. A pays such employees
bonuses out of its own funds and receives no bonuses or reimbursements for these bonuses from B or C. At or before the
time that customers are told by A or its employees about the services offered by B and C and about the package of services
that is available, the customers are provided with a controlled business arrangement disclosure form. 


Comments: 

Selling a package of settlement services at a discount is not prohibited by RESPA. Also, A may compensate its own employees
for business generated for A's company, but A may not directly or indirectly compensate A's employees who are routinely
in contact with consumers for business generated for B or C. Nor may B or C directly or indirectly compensate A or A's
employees for business referred to B or C by A's employees. Sections 3500.15(b)(3)(i) (A) and (B) set forth the permissible
exchanges of funds between controlled business entities. No employee or agent may receive compensation correlated
on a one-to-one basis or calculated as a multiple of the number or value of referrals of business to an affiliated entity.
Nothing in the RESPA rule prohibits bonuses or other compensation based, in part, on the generation of business by
A to B and C being paid to managerial employees who are not routinely in contact with consumers.

Medical Devices; Proposed Exemptions From Premarket Notification for Certain Classified Devices 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Food and Drug Administration, HHS.

 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule.

 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is proposing to exempt 164 generic types of class I devices from the requirement
of premarket notification, with limitations. For the exempted devices, FDA has determined that manufacturers'
submissions of premarket notifications are unnecessary for the protection of the public health and that the agency's
review of such submissions will not advance its public health mission. Granting the exemptions will allow the agency
to make better use of its resources and thus better serve the public.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
I. Background 


The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act), as amended by the Medical Device Amendments of 1976 (Pub. L. 94-295,
hereinafter called the amendments) and the Safe Medical Devices Act of 1990 (the SMDA), establishes a comprehensive
system for the regulation of medical devices intended for human use. Section 513 of the act (21 U.S.C. 360c) establishes
three classes of devices, depending on the regulatory controls needed to provide reasonable assurance of their safety
and effectiveness: Class I, general controls; class II, special controls; and class III, premarket approval. 
Section 513(d)(2)(A) of the act (21 U.S.C. 360c(d)(2)(A)) authorizes FDA to exempt, by regulation, a generic type
of class I device from, among other things, the requirement of premarket notification in section 510(k) of the act
(21 U.S.C. 360(k)). Such an exemption permits manufacturers to introduce into commercial distribution generic
types of devices without first submitting a premarket notification to FDA. When FDA issued proposed regulations
classifying preamendments devices, the agency focused on granting exemptions from the requirement of premarket
notification principally when the advisory panels included them in their recommendations to the agency. Subsequently,
FDA decided to exempt certain additional class I devices from the requirement of premarket notification in order
to reduce the number of unnecessary premarket notifications. This action helped to free agency resources for the
review of more complex notifications to FDA. 
Previously, FDA exempted 293 generic types of class I devices from the requirement of premarket notification, with
limitations. Some of these devices were exempted from the requirement of premarket notification when the devices
were initially classified into class I. However, the majority of these devices were exempted from the requirement
of premarket notification after being classified into class I. These subsequent exemptions from the requirement
of premarket notification appear in the following 

Federal Register

 publications (see Table 1).

II. Description of Proposed Exemptions 


In considering whether to exempt additional class I devices from premarket notification, FDA focused on whether
notification for the type of device is unnecessary for the protection of the public health. For the devices proposed
in this document to be exempted from premarket notification, FDA has concluded that notification is unnecessary
primarily for the following reasons: 
(1) The device does not have a significant history of false or misleading claims or of risks associated with inherent
characteristics of the device, such as device design or materials. When making these determinations, FDA generally
has considered the frequency, persistence, cause, or seriousness of such claims or risks, as well as other factors
deemed relevant. 
(2) In general, the following factors apply: (a) Characteristics of the device necessary for its safe and effective
performance are well established; (b) anticipated changes in the device that could affect safety and effectiveness
will either: (i) Be readily detectable by users by visual examination or other means, such as routine testing, before
causing harm, e.g., testing of a clinical laboratory reagent with positive and negative controls; or (ii) not materially
increase the risk of injury, incorrect diagnosis, or ineffective treatment; and (c) any changes in the device would
not be likely to result in a change in the device's classification. 
FDA has made the determinations described above based on its knowledge of the device, including past experience and
relevant reports or studies on device performance. If FDA has concerns only about certain types of changes to a particular
class I device, the agency may grant a limited exemption from premarket notification for that generic type of device.
A limited exemption will specify the types of changes to the device for which manufacturers are required to submit
a premarket notification. For example, FDA may exempt a device from the requirement of premarket notification except
when a manufacturer intends to use a different material. 
FDA advises manufacturers that an exemption from the requirement of premarket notification is not an exemption from
any of the other general controls, including current good manufacturing practices (CGMP's), unless explicitly
stated. Indeed, FDA's decision to propose 510(k) exemptions for these devices is based, in part, on the fact that compliance
with CGMP's will help insure product quality. 
FDA's decision to grant an exemption from the requirement of premarket notification for a generic type of class I device
will be based upon the existing and reasonably foreseeable characteristics of commercially distributed devices
within that generic type. Because FDA cannot anticipate every change or modification of a class I device exempt from
premarket notification requirements that could significantly affect the safety or effectiveness, manufacturers
of any commercially distributed class I device for which FDA has granted an exemption from the requirement of premarket
notification are still required to submit a premarket notification to FDA before introducing a device or delivering
it for introduction into interstate commerce for commercial distribution when: 
(1) The device is intended for a use different from its intended use before May 28, 1976, or the device is intended for
a use different from the intended use of the preamendments device to which it has been determined to be substantially
equivalent; e.g., the device is intended for a different medical purpose, or the device is intended for lay use instead
of use by health care professionals; or 
(2) The modified device operates using a different fundamental scientific technology than used by the device before
May 28, 1976; e.g., a surgical instrument cuts tissue with a laser beam rather than with a sharpened metal blade, or
an in vitro diagnostic device detects or identifies infectious agents by using a deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) probe
or nucleic acid hybridization technology rather than culture or immunoassay technology. 
Such changes or modifications to class I devices that are exempt from premarket notification would mean the exemption
would no longer apply. Changes or modifications to devices that are not exempt from premarket notification requirements
under any regulation must undergo a more comprehensive assessment to determine the impact of the change or modification
on the device's safety and effectiveness. FDA intends to develop guidance clarifying when a change or modification
to a device requires submission of a premarket notification as defined in 21 CFR 807.81(a)(3). 
On the dates listed, FDA published final regulations classifying, among others, the devices listed below. When FDA
classified these devices, the agency did not propose exempting them from the requirement of premarket notification.
Based on the analysis described above, FDA has now determined that premarket notification with respect to the devices
listed below is unnecessary for the protection of the public health and will not advance FDA's public health mission.
This approach is consistent with the recommendation in the May 1993 report of the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations
of the Committee on Energy and Commerce, U.S. House of Representatives, entitled ``Less Than the Sum of its Parts Reforms
Needed in the Organization, Management, and Resources of The Food and Drug Administration's Center for Devices and
Radiological Health.'' 
Earlier this year, the Office of Device Evaluation undertook a risk assessment of all devices in order to ensure the
proper allocation of resources in the review process. All of the class I devices listed below were placed in Tier I,
the category of devices which have a minimal inherent risk and whose review focuses upon intended use. A number of class
II devices were also included in the Tier I evaluation process. FDA intends to consider proposing exemptions from
the requirement of premarket notification for these devices. In the near future, FDA believes that exempting these
devices from premarket notification will allow the agency to better use its available resources to protect the public
health. 
FDA is proposing to exempt from the requirement of premarket notification, with limitations, the 164 generic type
of class I devices listed in Table 2 below:

III. Environmental Impact 



The agency has determined under 21 CFR 25.249(e)(2) that this action is of a type that does not individually or cumulatively
have a significant effect on the human environment. Therefore, neither an environmental assessment nor an environmental
impact statement is required. 



IV. Analysis of Impacts 



FDA has examined the impacts of the proposed rule under Executive Order 12866 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub.
L. 96-354). Executive Order 12866 directs agencies to assess all costs and benefits of available regulatory
alternatives and, when regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits (including
potential economic, environmental, public health and safety, and other advantages; distributive impacts; and
equity). The agency believes that this proposed rule is consistent with the regulatory philosophy and principles
identified in the Executive Order. In addition, the proposed rule is not a significant regulatory action as defined
by the Executive Order and so is not subject to review under the Executive Order. 

The Regulatory Flexibility Act requires agencies to analyze regulatory options that would minimize any significant
impact of a proposal on small entities. Because this proposal would reduce a regulatory burden by exempting manufacturers
of devices subject to the rule from the requirements of premarket notification, the agency certifies that the proposed
rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Therefore, under the Regulatory
Flexibility Act, no further analysis is required. 



V. Request for Comments 



Interested persons may, on or before October 19, 1994, submit to the Dockets Management Branch (address above) written
comments regarding this proposal. Two copies of any comments are to be submitted, except that individuals may submit
one copy. Comments are to be identified with the docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document. Received
comments may be seen in the office above between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.
