<DOCTITLE>Agency Form Under Review by the Office of Management and Budget</DOCTITLE>



DOC has submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for clearance the following proposal for collection
of information under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. chapter 35).



Agency: 

Bureau of the Census.


Title: 

Investment Plans Survey (Formerly Plant and Equipment Expenditures Survey).


Form Number(s): 

IP-1, IP-2.


Agency Approval Number: 

0607-0641.


Type of Request: 

Revision of a currently approved collection.


Burden: 

44,000 hours.


Number of Respondents: 

30,000.


Avg Hours Per Response: 

42 minutes.


Needs and Uses: 

The Bureau of the Census proposes to replace the Plant and Equipment Expenditures Survey (P&E) with a new economic
indicator survey called the Investment Plans Survey (IPS) which will have close connection to the Annual Capital
Expenditures Survey (ACES) (OMB approval number 0607-0782). The reasons for replacing the P&E are: 1)
to improve the quality of the economic indicator of investment plans, 2) to improve consistency and definition of
investment data, and 3) to simplify respondent reporting. The IPS will provide an early estimate of investment in
structures and equipment for the year ending and an indicator of planned investment for the upcoming year. The Federal
Reserve Board, the Council of Economic Advisors, and the Bureau of Economic Analysis are among the principal data
users. We plan to replace the P&E with this new survey beginning in November 1994. At that time we will collect actual
expenditure data for 1994 and planned spending for 1995.


Affected Public: 

Businesses or other for-profit organizations and non-profit institutions.


Frequency: 

Semi-annually.


Respondent's Obligation: 

Voluntary.


OMB Desk Officer: 

Maria Gonzalez, (202) 395-7313.

Copies of the above information collection proposal can be obtained by calling or writing Gerald Tach&eacute;, DOC
Forms Clearance Officer, (202) 482-3271, Department of Commerce, room 5312, 14th and Constitution Avenue,

<DOCTITLE>Agency Form Under Review by the Office of Management and Budget</DOCTITLE>



DOC has submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for clearance the following proposal for collection
of information under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. chapter 35).



Agency: 

Bureau of the Census.


Title: 

Single Audit Questionnaires.


Form Number(s): 

SAC-1, SAC-2.


Agency Approval Number: 

0607-0518.

Revision of a currently approved collection.


Burden: 

28,400 hours.


Number of Respondents: 

100,000.


Avg Hours Per Response: 

17 minutes.


Needs and Uses: 

The Single Audit Act of 1984 and OMB Circulars A-128 and A-133 require state and local governments and institutions
of higher education and other non-profit institutions receiving $100,000 or more in Federal financial aid
to have an annual audit of their financial operations. OMB has designated the Census Bureau as the central clearinghouse
for these audits. We use the Single Audit Questionnaires to contact those entities that have not sent in their audit
reports to request that they forward the report or clarify their reporting status. Information on the reporting status
of non-profit institutions was collected on a one-time basis during FY 1991. This activity was not funded
during Fiscal Years 1992 and 1993 but will be reinstituted for 1994.


Affected Public: 

State or local governments and non-profit institutions.


Frequency: 

Annually.


Respondent's Obligation: 

Voluntary.

The petitions were submitted pursuant to Section 251 of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2341). Consequently, the United
States Department of Commerce has initiated separate investigations to determine whether increased imports into
the United States of articles like or directly competitive with those produced by each firm contributed importantly
to total or partial separation of the firm's workers, or threat thereof, and to a decrease in sales or production of
each petitioning firm.
Any party having a substantial interest in the proceedings may request a public hearing on the matter. A request for
a hearing must be received by the Trade Adjustment Assistance Division, Room 7023, Economic Development Administration,
U.S. Department of Commerce, Washington, DC 20230, no later than the close of business of the tenth calendar day following
the publication of this notice.

<DOCTITLE>Revocation of Antidumping Duty Order on Photo Albums and Photo Album Filler Pages From Hong Kong (A-582-501)

<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 International Trade Administration/Import Administration, Department of Commerce.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of revocation of antidumping duty order. 





</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 
The Department of Commerce is notifying the public of its revocation of the antidumping duty order on photo albums
and photo album filler pages from Hong Kong because it is no longer of any interest to domestic interested parties.






</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Background 


On December 27, 1993, the Department of Commerce (the Department) published in the 

Federal Register

 (58 FR 68391) its notice of intent to revoke the antidumping duty order on photo albums and photo album filler pages
from Hong Kong (December 16, 1985). 

Additionally, as required by 19 CFR  353.25(d)(4)(ii), the Department served written notice of its intent
to revoke this antidumping duty order on each domestic interested party on the service list. Domestic interested
parties who might object to the revocation were provided 30 days to submit their comments. 



Scope of the Order 



Imports covered by the revocation are shipments of photo albums and photo album filler pages from Hong Kong. This merchandise
is currently classifiable under Harmonized Tariff Schedules (HTS) item numbers 3920.00.00, 3921.00.00, 3926.90.00,
4819.50.00, 4820.50.00, 4820.90.00, and 4823.90.00. The HTS numbers are provided for convenience and customs purposes.
The written description remains dispositive. 

The Department may revoke an antidumping duty order if the Secretary concludes that the duty order is no longer of any
interest to domestic interested parties. We conclude that there is no interest in an antidumping duty order when no
interested party has requested an administrative review for five consecutive review periods and when no domestic
interested party objects to revocation (19 CFR  353.25(d)(4)(iii)). 

In this case, we received no request for review for five consecutive review periods. Furthermore, no domestic interested
party, as defined under  353.2 (i)(3), (i)(4), (i)(5), or (i)(6) of the Department's regulations, has expressed
opposition to revocation. Based on these facts, we have concluded that the antidumping duty order on photo albums
and photo album filler pages from Hong Kong is no longer of any interest to interested parties. Accordingly, we are
revoking this antidumping duty order in accordance with 19 CFR  353.25(d)(4)(iii). 

This revocation applies to all unliquidated entries of photo albums and photo album filler pages from Hong Kong entered,
or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after December 1, 1993. Entries made during the period December
1, 1992, through November 30, 1993, will be subject to automatic assessment in accordance with 19 CFR  353.22(e).
The Department will instruct the Customs Service to proceed with liquidation of all unliquidated entries of this
merchandise entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after December 1, 1993, without regard to
antidumping duties, and to refund any estimated antidumping duties collected with respect to those entries. This
notice is in accordance with 19 CFR  353.25(d).

The Department of Commerce is notifying the public of its revocation of the antidumping finding on portland cement

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

Background 



On May 3, 1994, the Department of Commerce (the Department) published in the 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 22822) its notice of intent to revoke the antidumping finding on portland cement from the Dominican Republic
(May 4, 1963). 

Additionally, as required by 19 CFR  353.25(d)(4)(ii), the Department served written notice of its intent
to revoke this antidumping finding on each domestic interested party on the service list. Domestic interested parties
who might object to the revocation were provided the opportunity to submit their comments not later than the last day
of the anniversary month. 



Scope of the Order 



Imports covered by the revocation are shipments of portland cement from the Dominican Republic. This merchandise
is currently classifiable under Harmonized Tariff Schedules (HTS) item number 2523.29.00. The HTS number is provided
for convenience and customs purposes. The written description remains dispositive. 

The Department may revoke an antidumping finding if the Secretary concludes that the finding is no longer of any interest
to domestic interested parties. We conclude that there is no interest in an antidumping finding when no interested
party has requested an administrative review for five consecutive review periods and when no domestic interested
party objects to revocation (19 CFR  353.25(d)(4)(iii)). 

In this case, we received no request for review for five consecutive review periods. Furthermore, no domestic interested
party, as defined under  353.2 (i)(3), (i)(4), (i)(5), or (i)(6) of the Department's regulations, has expressed
opposition to revocation. Based on these facts, we have concluded that the antidumping finding on portland cement
from the Dominican Republic is no longer of any interest to interested parties. Accordingly, we are revoking this
antidumping finding in accordance with 19 CFR  353.25(d)(4)(iii). 

This revocation applies to all unliquidated entries of portland cement from the Dominican Republic entered, or withdrawn
from warehouse, for consumption on or after May 1, 1994. Entries made during the period May 1, 1993, through April 30,
1994, will be subject to automatic assessment in accordance with 19 CFR  353.22(e). The Department will instruct
the Customs Service to proceed with liquidation of all unliquidated entries of this merchandise entered, or withdrawn
from warehouse, for consumption on or after May 1,1994, without regard to antidumping duties, and to refund any estimated
antidumping duties collected with respect to those entries. This notice is in accordance with 19 CFR  353.25(d).

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of revocation of antidumping duty order.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Department of Commerce is notifying the public of its revocation of the antidumping duty order on spun acrylic
yarn from Japan because it is no longer of any interest to domestic interested parties.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
Background


On May 4, 1994, the Department of Commerce (the Department) published in the 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 23051) its notice of intent to revoke the antidumping duty order on spun acrylic yarn from Japan (April 8, 1980).
Additionally, as required by 19 CFR  353.25(d)(4)(ii), the Department served written notice of its intent
to revoke this antidumping duty order on each domestic interested party on the service list. Domestic interested
parties who might object to the revocation were provided 30 days to submit their comments.


Scope of the Order


Imports covered by the revocation are shipments of spun acrylic yarn from Japan. This merchandise is currently classifiable
under Harmonized Tariff Schedules (HTS) item number 5509.32.00. The HTS number is provided for convenience and customs
purposes. The written description remains dispositive.
The Department may revoke an antidumping duty order if the Secretary concludes that the duty order is no longer of any
interest to domestic interested parties. We conclude that there is no interest in an antidumping duty order when no
interested party has requested an administrative review for five consecutive review periods and when no domestic
interested party objects to revocation (19 CFR 353.25(d)(4)(iii)).
In this case, we received no request for review for five consecutive review periods. Furthermore, no domestic interested
party, as defined under  353.2 (i)(3), (i)(4), (i)(5), or (i)(6) of the Department's regulations, has expressed
opposition to revocation. Based on these facts, we have concluded that the antidumping duty order on spun acrylic
yarn from Japan is no longer of any interest to interested parties. Accordingly, we are revoking this antidumping
duty order in accordance with 19 CFR  353.25(d)(4)(iii).
This revocation applies to all unliquidated entries of spun acrylic yarn from Japan entered, or withdrawn from warehouse,
for consumption on or after April 1, 1994. Entries made during the period April 1, 1993, through March 31, 1994, will
be subject to automatic assessment in accordance with 19 CFR  353.22(e). The Department will instruct the Customs
Service to proceed with liquidation of all unliquidated entries of this merchandise entered, or withdrawn from warehouse,
for consumption on or after April 1, 1994, without regard to antidumping duties, and to refund any estimated antidumping
duties collected with respect to those entries. This notice is in accordance with 19 CFR  353.25(d).

Plan for Compliance With Regulation 5 of Annex V to the MARPOL Convention 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Department of the Navy, DOD.

 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 DON is announcing the preparation of a plan for the compliance of all ships owned or operated by the Navy with the requirements
of Regulation 5 of Annex V to the MARPOL Convention. The DON will consult with the Secretary of State, the Secretary
of Commerce, the Secretary of Transportation and the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency on the
special area compliance plan and solicits public participation and comment on the special area compliance plan.
In order to obtain and consider public comments on the Navy's compliance with the MARPOL requirements, the Navy will
host a public meeting prior to preparing the special area compliance plan.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The United States Navy has explored ways to comply with restrictions on the discharge into the ocean of solid waste
generated aboard its ships. The basis for the restrictions, the Navy's efforts to comply and its strategy for achieving
future compliance are set out below. 


Restrictions on Discharge of Solid Waste at Sea 


The United States is a party to the International Convention on Prevention of Pollution from Ships, 1973, S. Treaty
Doc. No. 3, 100th Cong., 1st Sess. (1987). The 1973 Convention was amended by the MARPOL Protocol in 1978, 17 I.L.M.
546 (1978), and the combination is frequently referred to as MARPOL 73/78. MARPOL 73/78 protects the ocean environment
by prohibiting some discharges altogether, restricting other discharges to particular distances from land, and
establishing ``special areas'' within which additional discharge limitations apply. MARPOL 73/78 deals with particular
types of discharges in five annexes. Annex V addresses discharge of garbage from ships. MARPOL 73/78 was implemented
for the United States in the Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships (APPS), 33 U.S.C. 1901 

et seq.

 Annex V has been implemented for the U.S. by the Marine Plastic Pollution Research and Control Act (MPPRCA), Pub. L.
No. 100-220, 101 Stat. 1460 (1987), 

codified at

 33 U.S.C. 1901 

et seq.

, and section 1003 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1994, Pub. L. No. 103-160, 107 Stat.
1745 (DAA-94). 
MARPOL 73/78 provides enhanced protection to particular bodies of water, designated ``special areas,'' because
their oceanographic characteristics and ecological significance requires protective measures more strict than
other areas of the ocean. The stricter requirements become applicable once the International Maritime Organization
declares that the special areas are ``in effect'' after determining that the littoral countries have sufficient
capacity to handle wastes from ships.

The international community has long recognized that the characteristics of warships pose special problems for
strict compliance with MARPOL 73/78, which reasonably focuses on civilian vessels which are far more prevalent than
warships on the world's oceans. Article 3 of MARPOL 73/78 recognizes the special nature of warships by exempting them
from strict compliance with the provisions of the Convention. It provides that the Convention:

 

[S]hall not apply to any warship, naval auxiliary or other ship * * *. Each Party shall ensure by the
adoption of measures not impairing the operational capabilities of such ships * * * that such ships
act in a manner consistent, so far as is reasonable and practicable.

 

For U.S. public vessels, implementation of MARPOL 73/78 generally preserves the sovereign immunity of warships
and public vessels, excluding them from strict application of the standards but requiring the Secretary of Defense
to prescribe regulations ensuring ``so far as is reasonable and practicable without impairing the operations or
operational capabilities'' of the ships that they act ``in a manner consistent with the MARPOL Protocol.'' 

See

 33 U.S.C. 1902(b) and (d). As required by MARPOL 73/78 and APPS, 33 U.S.C. 1901 

et seq.

, the Navy has prescribed discharge limits and operational practices for Navy ships that are at least as protective
as those required under MARPOL 73/78 under most circumstances. Under the MPPRCA, however, Navy ships were required
to come into full compliance with the requirements of Annex V of MARPOL 73/78. Under the MPPRCA, the Navy was to come
into full compliance with Annex V to MARPOL 73/78 by January 1, 1994 or to notify Congress if it was unable to comply.



Navy Compliance Efforts 


Since the early 1980's, the Navy has been developing technological means to eliminate or mitigate discharge of solid
waste from its ships. Through a combination of material substitution, source reduction and management practices,
for example, the discharge of plastic waste was cut by over 70 percent. The Navy also pursued development of other technology
to help manage solid waste at sea. By 1993, the Navy had installed equipment and imposed procedures to fully comply
with MARPOL restrictions on non-plastic waste everywhere but in special areas, and had achieved an estimated 70 percent
compliance with restrictions on plastic waste. In addition, the Navy developed new technology that, when finally
procured and installed, will allow Navy surface ships to come into full compliance with restrictions on discharge
of plastic waste. 
Concurrent with the technical studies, the Navy engaged numerous stakeholders in a dialogue in which the Keystone
Center acted as a facilitator. The stakeholders included Federal and state agencies, Congressional staff, and environmental
groups. The dialogue allowed the Navy to provide information to the participants about the special problems it faces
in continuing military operations on the world's oceans while still complying with restrictions on the discharge
of solid waste. The Navy was also better able to understand the concerns and interests of the representative stakeholders
on the subject. 
The Navy reported its efforts at managing shipboard solid waste in ``U.S. Navy Compliance with the Marine Plastic
Pollution Research and Control Act of 1987'' (June 1993). Congress responded by extending the original deadlines
in the MPPRCA. As required by section 1003(a) of the DAA-94, surface ships must eliminate all discharges of plastics
by December 31, 1998 and must comply with limits on discharges of other solid waste in special areas that are ``in effect''
by December 31, 2000. Submarines must comply with both requirements by December 31, 2008. 


Plan for Compliance in Special Areas

The Navy has identified the solution to the problem of plastic discharges from surface ships and is working hard on
a solution for submarines. Strict compliance with all requirements for discharges of nonplastic solid waste in special
areas, however, presents a larger problem because of the nature of the waste stream and the military mission of warships.
Regulation 5 of Annex V pertains to discharges in special areas and prohibits discharges of solid wastes, other than
food wastes. Although the Navy has made important strides in studying the shipboard waste stream, in developing management
strategies, and in developing equipment that can mitigate the effects of solid waste discharges, the Navy has not
identified a final solution that would eliminate all non-food discharges in special areas. Recognizing the difficulty
in achieving strict compliance with all requirements of Annex V, in section 1003(b) of the DAA-94, Congress
required the Navy to prepare a plan for compliance with the requirements of Regulation 5 under Annex V. The special
area compliance plan must be submitted to Congress by November 30, 1996. If the special area compliance plan demonstrates
that full compliance with all the requirements of Regulation 5 of Annex V is not technologically feasible in the case
of certain ships under certain conditions, it must include the following information: 

a. The ships for which full compliance is not technologically feasible; 

b. the technical and operational impediments to achieving such compliance as rapidly as is technologically feasible;
and 

c. such other information as the Secretary of the Navy considers relevant and appropriate. 

In accordance with DAA-94 and to ensure the broad public understanding of the problem, the Navy will consult
with the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Commerce, the Secretary of Transportation and the Administrator of
the Environmental Protection Agency as it prepares the special area compliance plan. The Navy will also provide the
opportunity for public participation in preparation of the special area compliance plan, including public review
and comment. This notice is provided to inform the public that preparation of the special area compliance plan is beginning
and to solicit public comments on the scope of the studies to be planned and the alternatives to be studied. 



Navy Mission and Resource Constraints

Any solution to the Navy's solid waste problem in special areas must consider the types of missions that the Navy is
directed to carry out in special areas and the constraints and challenges inherent in operating warships at sea. These
considerations include the following: 

The Navy must be prepared to carry out duties assigned by the President to protect the nation's interests around the
world. Most of the designated special areas include locations of great strategic and economic interest, including
the Mediterranean Sea, the Red Sea, the Persian Gulf, the Gulf of Mexico, the North Sea and the Baltic. Navy missions
in such areas often require that ships remain on station at sea for prolonged periods of time. For example, surveillance
and tracking missions for drug interdiction or for enforcement of economic sanctions would be compromised if ships
were required to leave station and steam to port to offload waste. For another example, Naval ships maintaining combat
air patrol over a crisis area like Bosnia often must remain on station at sea for months at a time to prevent a break in
coverage. Navy ships have also often been ordered to remain for weeks or months off the coast of nations in turmoil so
that U.S. forces can evacuate U.S. citizens if necessary. In other circumstances, Navy ships may be required to remain
offshore to provide access to sophisticated medical care in case of injury or wounding of peacekeeping troops. Some
Navy ships, especially submarines, necessarily must operate without underway logistic support from other Navy
ships. Thus, the special area compliance plan must consider any impacts that it may impose on mission effectiveness
and operational flexibility. 

The special area compliance plan must be compatible with warship design. Navy ships are designed to maximize their
ability to perform their missions, especially combat missions. Ships are self-contained units with severe limits
on space, weight and power requirements for their equipment. While naval architecture and ship design always require
compromise among competing priorities, Navy ships must be equipped, manned and constructed to function effectively
and survive in far more rigorous circumstances than commercial ships. Navy ships must devote considerable space
and weight to specialized combat systems equipment and damage control features. They have far larger crews than commercial
vessels because more systems must be operated, and most routine equipment maintenance must be done by the ship's crew
at sea. 

Many classes of Navy ships are already classified as ``space and weight critical,'' which means that any equipment
added to the ship (for example, to manage solid waste) must be compensated for by removing other equipment already
devoted to some other portion of the ship's mission. Many ships also have only modest additional power available to
drive additional equipment and would have to turn off other important systems to use a waste control system with high
power requirements. Thus the Navy's special area compliance plan must carefully address the size, weight and power
requirements of any additional equipment. 

The crew size on Navy ships, an important factor in determining the size of the waste stream, varies tremendously.
Submarines have crews of approximately 120. Cruisers have crews of approximately 380. Large amphibious ships have
crews of approximately 2000. Aircraft carriers have crews approaching 6000. The Navy's special area compliance
plan must address solutions that can be adapted successfully to several different capacities. 

Because they operate independently in a dynamic, often physically hostile marine environment, Navy ships and the
equipment on them must be designed to withstand stresses and operating conditions not encountered on shore. The Navy
has experienced difficulty with some ``off the shelf'' equipment not specifically designed for shipboard use. Shipboard
equipment must also be reliable, maintainable by Navy crews, and capable of being logistically supported by the Navy
supply system. The Navy's special area compliance plan must address reliability and maintainability of any new equipment
in a marine environment. 

The Navy faces a fiscal environment where many meritorious programs must compete for a declining total amount of resources,
in terms of both funding and personnel. Development, acquisition, installation and operation of new equipment,
therefore, must be cost efficient. The Navy's special area compliance plan must address the resources needed to implement
it.

For the reasons discussed above, to be feasible for use by the Navy for vessels throughout the fleet, equipment or strategies
to implement an alternative must balance operational, design, cost, and environmental considerations in the same
manner that equipment designed for propulsion, communications, weapons or other shipboard functions are evaluated.
The criteria normally considered by the Navy for shipboard systems include those set out in the Appendix to this notice.




Alternatives To Be Studied 



In developing the special area compliance plan, the Navy proposes to analyze three different categories of alternatives.
The first two categories would ensure full compliance with Regulation 5 under Annex V. The third alternative would
not ensure full compliance with Regulation 5 under Annex V, but may preserve many or all of the environmental values
protected by Regulation 5 in the event that full compliance is not feasible. The Navy remains committed to full compliance,
but is taking this opportunity to increase the information available on ways to mitigate discharges in special areas.
The Navy will also analyze combinations of the technologies from the distinct alternatives. The general categories
of alternatives are: 



On Board Destruction of Waste Alternative 



This category of alternatives focuses on technologies that result in virtually complete destruction of waste aboard
the vessel. These might include incineration or more technologically advanced thermal destruction. Study of these
technologies would include study of the proper handling of any residue as well any safety concerns and cross media
pollution. 



Store and Retrograde Waste Alternative



The second category of alternatives focuses on technologies that permit storage and retrograde of waste, either
on board the generating ship or by service force ships. These would include study of refrigeration, compaction, odor
barrier bags and other means to facilitate storage and retrograde of waste for disposal on shore. 



Process Solid Waste Until It Is ``Environmentally Benign'' and Discharge Alternative 



The third category of alternatives focuses on technologies that are designed to process waste to produce an effluent
that is environmentally benign if discharged to the sea. The study of this alternative would also include fate and
effect studies of the discharge and the relative effect of such discharges in comparison to other discharges from
land or sea sources. 


Public Participation 



The Navy solicits public input to the special area compliance plan. Among other topics, public comments could address
the scope of the alternatives to be considered, the studies considered necessary, the measures of merit by which to
evaluate the alternatives, and suggested technologies or strategies for compliance. As described above, the Navy
will hold a public meeting to obtain and consider public comments on the Navy's compliance with the MARPOL requirements.
Members of the public are invited to attend.

Following the public meeting the Navy will analyze the alternatives (including combinations of the alternatives),
conduct required research and prepare a draft special area compliance plan. Comments should be submitted in writing
to the Officer in Charge, Naval Surface Warfare Center, Carderock Division, Annapolis Detachment, 3A Leggett Circle,
Annapolis, MD 21402-6067 (Attn: Code 634A) in time to be received not later than 30 days after the date of the public
meeting. The Navy expects to formally consult with the other concerned agencies on the draft special area compliance
plan in late 1995 and to make the draft special area compliance plan available for public comment in Spring, 1996. After
public review and comment, the Navy will submit the plan to Congress.

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Department of Energy announced that pursuant to the provisions of 10 CFR 600.14, it intends to provide additional
funding and extend the budget period for Grant No. DE-FG02-91CE23810 based on an unsolicited application
received from Air Conditioning and Refrigeration Technology Institute (ARTI) for Phase IV of the project, Materials
Compatibility and Lubricant Research to Accelerate Introduction of CFC_Refrigerant Substitutes. The determination
to extend this grant is based on the following information: A technical evaluation of the proposed project was performed
pursuant to 10 CFR 600.14 (d) and (e). The proposed project assists DOE in carrying out its mission of seeking alternative
refrigerants for Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and Hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) in refrigeration and insulation
in an effort to reduce the deleterious effects of refrigeration chemicals on stratospheric ozone. ARTI has made available
substantial and unique facilities and resources not available elsewhere. This includes considerable amounts of
information that are proprietary to the member industries participating in the project. It is determined that the
proposed project is meritorious in significantly improving the information data base upon which new refrigerants
and lubricants can be selected, and refrigeration equipment can be designed to utilize these chemical compounds.
The probability of success is extremely high due to the high level of industry participation and commitment to the
effort, particularly cost sharing or in-kind support. The key personnel assigned to the project have capabilities
critical to the accelerated development of alternative refrigerants and the refrigeration equipment required
to effectively utilize these new chemical compounds. DOE knows of no other entity which is conducting or planning
to conduct such an effort. This effort is not considered suitable for competitive financial assistance. The DOE share
of funding is estimated at $3,190,000 and ARTI's cost share is estimated at $226,493 for a two-year budget period estimated
to be from September 30, 1994 through September 30, 1996.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The objective of the project is continue tests to evaluate the supercritical water oxidation (SCWO) pilot plant developed
under Cooperative Agreement DE-FC07-88ID12711. The pilot plant configuration was developed to treat
corrosive wastes and waste with high solids content. DOE has no recent, current, or planned solicitations under which
this proposal would be eligible. The activity to be funded is necessary to the satisfactory continuation of an activity
funded by DOE and for which competition for support would have a significant adverse effect on continuity or completion
of the project. DOE and commercial implementation of SCWO technology will reduce the volume of hazardous and mixed
waste currently stored and generated in the United States. SCWO technology is recognized as a high potential alternative
technology to incineration, providing cleaner effluents and with less institutional barriers than incineration.
The award will be for one year at a total estimated cost of $700,000. Cost share is anticipated to be 10% of the project
costs. Statutory authority for this award is Pub. L. 93-577, Federal Non-Nuclear Energy Research and Development

FORIA Hydro Corp.; Environmental Assessment Scoping 


July 15, 1994. 


On March 28, 1994, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (Commission) issued a notice indicating that staff is
ready to conduct an environmental analysis (REA Notice) for the proposed Fort Dodge Mill Dam Project, located on the
Des Moines River, in Webster County, Iowa. The REA Notice also requested comments from federal, state, and local resource
agencies, licensees and developers, Indian tribes, and any other interested groups (parties). Parties were given
until May 28, 1994, to file comments. 
The purpose of this notice is to advise all parties as to the scope of our environmental analysis and to seek additional
information pertinent to this analysis. The scope as presented herein is based on the information filed with the Commission
by FORIA Hydro Corporation (the Applicant), comments received from the parties thus far, and the staff's independent
analysis. 


Proposed Action 


The Applicant proposes to install new generating equipment at an existing dam, reservoir and powerhouse to be called
the Fort Dodge Mill Dam Project. 
The proposed project would include the following features: (1) an existing dam 372 feet long and 18 feet high; (2) an
existing impoundment with a surface area of 90 acres with a normal surface elevation of approximately 990 feet above
mean sea level; (3) an existing powerhouse containing two new turbine-generator units at a total installed capacity
of 1,260 kilowatts; and (4) a proposed 13.8-kilovolt transmission line. 
In addition to the proposed two new turbine-generator units, the Applicant proposes install a new flat trashrack
(with 2.75-3.5-inch clear bar spacing) above the project intake. 
To enhance public recreation, the Applicant proposes to develop a new boat ramp at the Fort Dodge Park, located adjacent
to proposed project. 
The Applicant proposes measures relating to project operation to protect environmental resources in the project
area. A 24-cubic feet per second minimum flow over the project dam is proposed to protect water quality and fishery
resources in the downstream pool area and side channel. The project would be operated in a run-of-river mode, with
only minor fluctuations in the headpond elevation to account for natural variations in river flow. In the operational
plan for the Fort Dodge Mill Dam Project, the Applicant also proposes to implement a plan to verify run-of-river operation
and a seasonal water quality monitoring program for the impoundment. 


Project Alternatives 


The Commission staff will consider alternatives, including enhancement measures not proposed by the Applicant.
The staff will review and consider alternative recommendations for additional resource protection, or enhancement
measures that may be appropriate to include in an original license. Modifications could include recommendations
by the agencies, the general public, and the staff. 
In addition to these alternatives, the staff will evaluate the no-action alternative, which maintains the existing
environment or status quo at the project. 


Scope of the Environmental Impact Statement 


The geographic scope of analysis defines the physical limits or boundaries of the proposed actions' effects on the
resources. Since the proposed actions affect each resource differently, the geographic scope for each resource
varies. For fishery resources, flow analysis, water quality, flood control, and power, the geographic scope of analysis
will encompass the mainstem Des Moines River. 
The temporal scope includes a discussion of the past, present, and future actions and their effects on the resources.
Based on the license term, the temporal scope will look 30 to 50 years into the future, concentrating on the effect on
the resource from reasonably foreseeable future actions (e.g., the effect on water quality from potential future
water withdrawals within the basin). The historical discussion will, by necessity, be limited to the amount of available
information for each resource. 


Environmental Issues 


A preliminary list of environmental issues identified by the staff for coverage in an Environmental Assessment (EA)
is presented in this section. The list is not intended to be exhaustive or final, but is an initial listing of issues
that have been raised and appear to be important. The staff will review all issues raised during the scoping process
and make decisions as to the level of analysis needed. If preliminary analysis indicates that any issues presented
in this scoping document have little potential for causing significant impacts, the issue or issues will be identified
and the reasons for not providing a more detailed analysis will be given. 
The following issues apply to the Fort Dodge Mill Dam Project: 
 An evaluation of the project's potential effect on dissolved oxygen (DO) downstream of the project and the
need for additional studies of DO. 
 Effects of project operation and non-project factors on vegetation and wildlife. 
 Effects of project operation on any federally listed threatened or endangered species in the project area.

 Probability of eligibility of dam and powerhouse on the National Register of Historic Places. 
 Opportunities for recreational facility improvements and public access enhancements. 
The EA will assess the project-specific impacts on the above resources and whether these impacts contribute to significant
adverse impacts. Both project-specific impacts and cumulative effects will weigh in selecting an action to recommend
for the licensing decision on the project. 


EIS Preparation Schedule 


The preliminary schedule for preparing the EA for the Fort Dodge Mill Dam Project is: 





Request for Comments 


The Commission's scoping objectives are to: 
 identify significant environmental issues, 
 determine the depth of analysis appropriate to each issue,

 identify the resource issues not requiring detailed analysis, and 
 identify reasonable project alternatives. 
Federal, state, and local resource agencies, licensees and developers, Indian tribes, other interested groups,
and the general public are invited to forward to the Commission any information that they believe will assist the Commission
staff in conducting an accurate and thorough analysis of the site-specific and cumulative environmental effects
of the proposed licensing activities on the Des Moines River. The types of information sought include: 
 Information, quantified data, or professional opinion that may contribute to defining the geographical
and temporal scope of the analysis and identifying significant environmental issues. 
 Identification of and information from any other environmental assessment, environmental impact statement,
or similar document or study (previous, on-going, or planned) relevant to the proposed licensing activities in the
Des Moines River Basin. 
 Existing information and any data that would aid in describing the past and present actions and effects of the
projects and other developmental activities on the physical/chemical, biological, and socioeconomic environments.
For example, fish stocking/management histories, historic water quality data and the reasons for improvement or
degradation of the quality, any wetland habitat losses or proposals to develop land and water resources within the
basin. 
 Identification of any federal, state, or local resource plans and future project proposals that encompass
the Des Moines River Basin with information on when they will be implemented, if known. For example, proposals to construct
or operate water treatment facilities, recreation areas, water diversions, or implement fishery management programs.

 Documentation that would support a conclusion that the actions or a project(s) 

does

 or 

does not

 contribute to cumulative adverse or beneficial effects on resources and therefore should be excluded from further
study or excluded from further consideration of cumulative effects within the Des Moines River Basin. Documentation
should include, but is not limited to: how the projects interact with other projects within the river basin and other
developmental activities; results from studies; resource management policies; and reports from federal, state,
and local agencies. 
To be useful in preparing the draft EA, the requested information must be received by the Commission no later than 30
days past the date of this notice. Address all communications to: Secretary, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission,
825 North Capitol Street NE., Washington, DC 20426. 
All correspondence must clearly show at the top of the first page ``Fort Dodge Mill Dam Project, FERC No. 11346''. 
When filing scoping comments, you should submit an original and 8 copies; this will assure that staff receives your
information quickly. Parties to the proceedings (as identified on the official Service List for the Fort Dodge Mill
Dam Project) must also send copies of their filings, and all attachments, to the other parties listed on the official
service list. The official service list is available from the Commission Secretary at the same address above. 
Any questions concerning the scoping process should be directed to Mary Golato (202-219-2804) at the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Office of Hydropower Licensing, 825 North Capitol Street NE., Washington,
DC 20426.

Holliday Historic Restoration Associates, Ltd.; 


July 15, 1994. 


On January 10, 1994, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (Commission) issued a notice indicating that staff
is ready to conduct an environmental analysis (REA Notice) for the proposed Holliday Hydroelectric Plant, located
on the West Fork of the White River in Noblesville Township, Hamilton County, Indiana. The REA Notice also requested
comments from Federal, state, and local resource agencies, licensees and developers, and any other interested groups
(the parties). Parties were given until March 10, 1994, to file comments. 
The purpose of this notice is to advise all parties as to the proposed scope of the staff's environmental analysis and
to seek additional information pertinent to this analysis. The proposed scope of analysis as presented herein is
based on the information filed with the Commission by Holliday Historic Restoration Associates, Ltd. (the Applicant),
comments received from the parties thus far, and the staff's independent analysis. 


Proposed Action 


The Applicant proposes to rehabilitate a retired hydroelectric facility owned by Public Service Company of Indiana,
Inc. (PSI). The facility is located on the West Fork of the White River, a tributary of the Wabash River, in central Indiana,
and used as a source of cooling water for an adjacent coal-fired, steam-electric generating plant owned and operated
by PSI. (From 1950 to 1965, the hydroelectric facility, then known as the unlicensed Noblesville Project, was operated
by PSI to provide energy for use at PSI's adjacent coal-fired, steam-electric generating plant.) The Applicant intends
to use revenues from the rehabilitated project to restore the historic powerhouse and open it to the public for historic
tours. 
The proposed project would include the following features: (1) an existing concrete dam, 350 feet long and 10 feet
high; (2) an existing 11-acre impoundment, with a normal water surface elevation of 764 feet mean sea level; and (3)
an existing 25-foot by 50-foot powerhouse that would contain two new turbine-generator units having a total generating
capacity of 450 kilowatts. 
In addition to the proposed two new turbine-generator units, the Applicant proposes to renovate an existing upstream
fish passage facility (concrete flume) and install two new angled trashracks (with 3/4-inch clear bar spacing) above
the project intakes, and provide a downstream fish passage facility. 
To enhance public recreation, the Applicant proposes to develop a new parking area and picnic facilities on the west
bank upstream from the dam, as well as a footbridge across the PSI inlet area, connecting to an existing canoe portage
around the dam. Other improvements to the area would include the construction of safety fencing and other safety measures.
As indicated earlier, historical tours of the powerhouse would be conducted on weekends for the public. 
The Applicant proposes measures relating to project operation to protect and enhance environmental resources in
the project area. A 40-cubic feet per second (cfs) minimum flow over the project dam is proposed to protect water quality
and fishery resources in the downstream pool area and side channel. The project would be operated in a run-of-river
mode, with only minor fluctuations in the headpond elevation to account for natural variations in river flow. In the
operational plan for the Holliday Project, the Applicant also proposes to implement a plan to verify run-of-river
operation and a seasonal water quality monitoring program for the impoundment. 


Project Alternatives 


The staff will consider alternatives, including enhancement measures not proposed by the Applicant. The staff will
review and consider alternative recommendations for additional resource protection, or enhancement measures
that may be appropriate to include in an original minor license. Modifications could include recommendations by
the agencies, the general public, and the staff. 
In addition to these alternatives, the staff will evaluate the no-action alternative, which maintains the existing
environment or status quo at the facility. Under this alternative the project impoundment would continue to provide
cooling water for the adjacent coal-fired, steam-electric generating plant, as at present. We use this alternative
to set baseline environmental conditions for comparison with other alternatives. 


Scope of the Environmental Assessment 


The geographic scope of analysis defines the physical limits or boundaries of the proposed action's effects on the
resources. Since the proposed action affects each resource differently, the geographic scope for each resource
varies. We have identified no affects of operating the Holliday Project that, when coupled with other activities
on the West Fork of the White River, would affect environmental resources in a cumulative manner. Therefore, for water
quality, fish and wildlife resources, cultural resources, recreation, and all other resources we will focus our
analysis on the project area and the West Fork of the 
White River, unless persuaded by comments during the scoping process. 
The temporal scope includes a discussion of the past, present, and future actions and their effects on water quality,
fish and wildlife resources, cultural resources, recreation, and other resources. Based on the license term, the
temporal scope will look 30 to 50 years into the future, concentrating on the effect on the resource from reasonably
foreseeable future actions. The historical discussion will, by necessity, be limited to the amount of available
information for each resource.

Environmental Issues 



A preliminary list of environmental issues identified by the staff for coverage in an Environmental Assessment (EA)
is presented in this section. The list is not intended to be exhaustive or final, but is an initial listing of issues
that have been raised and appear to be important. The staff will review all issues raised during the scoping process
and make decisions as to the level of analysis needed. If preliminary analysis indicates that any issues presented
in this scoping document have little potential for causing significant adverse effects, the issue or issues will
be identified and the reasons for not providing a more detailed analysis will be given. 

The following issues apply to the Holliday Project: 

 effects of the proposed mode of operation on dissolved oxygen and water temperature in the project impoundment
and downstream river reach; 

 effects of flow-pattern changes from operating the proposed project, and minimum flow needs for the protection
of fishery resources and water quality in the pool area and side channel immediately downstream of the project dam;


 project effects of entrainment and turbine-induced mortality on resident fishes; 

 fish passage needs at the project dam; 

 effects on the historical value of the project dam and powerhouse, both determined eligible for inclusion
in the National Register of Historic Places; and 

 effects on public recreational use at the project. 

The EA will assess the project-specific effects on the above resources and whether these effects contribute adversely
or beneficially to the affected environment. 



EA Preparation Schedule 



The preliminary schedule for preparing the EA for the Holliday Project is: 




 

Request for Comments 



The Commission's scoping objectives are to: 

 identify significant environmental issues; 

 determine the depth of analysis appropriate to each issue; 

 identify the resource issues not requiring detailed analysis; and 

 identify reasonable project alternatives. 

Federal, state, and local resource agencies, licensees and developers, other interested groups, and the general
public are invited to file with the Commission information that they believe will assist the Commission staff in conducting
an accurate and thorough analysis of the environmental effects of the proposed licensing of the Holliday Project.
The types of information sought include: 

 information, quantified data, or professional opinion that may contribute to defining the geographical
and temporal scope of the analysis and identifying significant environmental issues; 

 identification of, and information from, any other environmental assessment, environmental impact statement,
or similar document or study (previous, on-going, or planned) relevant to the proposed licensing activity on the
West Fork of the White River; 

 existing information and any data that would assist in describing the past and present actions and effects
of the project and other developmental activities on water quality, fish and wildlife resources, cultural resources,
and recreation. For example, fish stocking/management histories of the West Fork of the White River, historic water
quality data and the reasons for improvement or degradation of the quality, locations of wastewater treatment outfalls
or water intakes, or proposals to develop land and water resources within the river; 

 identification of any Federal, state, or local resource plans and future project proposals that encompass
the West Fork of the White River, with information on when the plans would be implemented, if known. For example, proposals
to construct or operate water treatment facilities, recreation areas, water diversions, or implement fishery management
programs; and 

 documentation that would support a conclusion that the proposed project 

does

 or 

does not

 contribute to cumulative adverse or beneficial effects on resources and, therefore, should be excluded from further
study or included for further consideration of cumulative effects. Documentation should include, but not be limited
to: how the project interacts with other projects on the river and other developmental activities; results from studies;
resource management policies; and reports from Federal, state, and local agencies. 

To be useful in preparing the draft EA, the requested information must be filed with the Commission no later than 30
days past the date of this notice. Address all communications to: Secretary, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission,
825 North Capitol Street NE., Washington, DC 20426.
 
All correspondence must clearly show at the top of the first page ``Holliday Project, FERC No. 10867.'' 

When filing scoping comments, you should submit an original and 8 copies; this will assure that the staff receives
your information. Parties to the proceedings (as identified on the official Service List for the Holliday Project)
must also send copies of their filings, and all attachments, to the other parties listed on the official Service List.
The official Service List is available from the Secretary of the Commission at the same address above. 

Any questions concerning the scoping process should be directed to Mary Golato (202-219-2804) or Frank
Karwoski (202-219-2782) at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Office of Hydropower Licensing,
810 First Street NE., Washington, DC, 20426.

<DOCTITLE>El Paso Natural Gas Co., et al.; Natural Gas Certificate Filings </DOCTITLE>



July 14, 1994. 



Take notice that the following filings have been made with the Commission: 



1. El Paso Natural Gas Company 



[Docket No. CP94-635-000] 



Take notice that on June 30, 1994, El Paso Natural Gas Company (El Paso), P.O. Box 1492, El Paso, Texas 79978, filed in
Docket No. CP94-635-000 a request pursuant to Sections 157.205 and 157.216 of the Commission's Regulations
under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.205, 157.216) for authorization to abandon the delivery point known as the Anaconda
Copper Company Meter Station located in Cibola County, New Mexico under El Paso's blanket certificate issued in Docket
No. CP82-435-000 and CP88-433-000 pursuant to Section 7 of the Natural Gas Act, all as more
fully set forth in the request that is on file with the Commission and open to public inspection. 

El Paso proposes to remove one 2'' O.D. tap and valve assembly, with appurtenances, and one 4'' O.D. positive displacement
meter at approximately milepost 343.41 on El Paso's Permian-San Juan Crossover Line in the NW/4 of Section 18, Township
12 North, Range 10 West, Cibola County, New Mexico. The metering facility will be removed with only minimal ground
disturbance with that being limited to existing, previously-disturbed right-of-way. 

El Paso states that it provides firm transportation service for Gas Company of New Mexico (GCNM) at the Anaconda Copper
Company Meter Station pursuant to the terms and conditions of a Transportation Service Agreement dated November
12, 1990. 

El Paso understands that Atlantic Richfield Company (ARCO), successor to Anaconda Copper Company has closed an operating
site and terminated its June 19, 1974 gas purchase contract with GCNM. This gas purchase contract covered gas service
to ARCO's Bluewater Millsite in Cibola County, New Mexico. El Paso understands further that as part of ARCO's termination
request, ARCO also requested that the segment of GCNM's line feeding the Bluewater Millsite be disconnected at El
Paso's metering station. 

El Paso asserts that as a direct result of the Bluewater Millsite closing, and since GCNM has not requested gas service
from this meter station since May 1989, GCNM has requested that El Paso abandon and remove the Anaconda Copper Company
Meter Station. This meter station serves no purpose and may obstruct ARCO's clean up of the Bluewater Millsite. Accordingly,
El Paso proposes to abandon by removal the Anaconda Copper Company Meter Station. 

Comment date: August 29, 1994, in accordance with Standard Paragraph G at the end of this notice.

Notice of Availability of Dredged Material Testing Manual, Request for Comment, and Announcement of Public Information
Sessions



<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This notice announces the availability of and requests public comment on the draft testing manual entitled ``Evaluation
of Dredged Material Proposed for Discharge in Waters of the U.S._Testing Manual (Draft)''. The manual was prepared
by an Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)/Corps of Engineers (CE) workgroup comprised of individuals from headquarters,
field offices, and research laboratories of both agencies with scientific and/or programmatic expertise related
to dredged material discharge activities. Copies of the draft manual can be requested by writing to Ms. Shirley Walker
at the address listed below under 

ADDRESSES

. Public information sessions will be held at various locations around the country to discuss the draft manual.

Comments may be mailed or delivered to: Mike Kravitz, Mail Code 4305, Attention: Testing Manual Comments, Office
of Science and Technology, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M Street SW., Washington, DC 20460; telephone:
202-260-8085. Commenters are requested to submit an original and 3 copies of their written comments and
enclosures. Commenters who want receipt of their comments acknowledged should include a self-addressed, stamped
envelope. No facsimiles (faxes) will be accepted.



<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Proposed discharges of dredged or fill material in fresh, estuarine, and saline (near-coastal) waters, or ``waters
of the United States,'' must be evaluated to determine the potential environmental impacts of such activities. Specifically,
Section 404 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972, Public Law 92-500, as amended by the Clean Water
Act (CWA), Public Law 95-217, requires that the discharge of dredged or fill material into waters of the U.S.
be permitted by the Corps of Engineers (CE). EPA has the primary role in developing the environmental guidelines_the
section 404(b)(1) Guidelines (Guidelines)_in conjunction with CE, by which permit applications must be evaluated.
The Guidelines are published at 40 CFR part 230. Fundamental to the Guidelines is the precept that dredged or fill material
should not be discharged into the aquatic ecosystem, unless it can be demonstrated that such a discharge will not have
an unacceptable adverse impact either individually or in combination with known and/or probable impacts of other
activities affecting the ecosystems of concern.



Dredged material testing is part of the larger evaluation of a proposed discharge activity to determine its compliance
with the Guidelines. Sections 230.60 and 230.61 of the Guidelines provide the basis for certain contaminant-related
factual determinations regarding the potential environmental effects of a proposed discharge. The present draft
testing manual, ``Evaluation of Dredged Material Proposed for Discharge in Waters of the U.S._Testing Manual (Draft),''
details the physical, chemical, and biological evaluation procedures outlined in   230.60 and 230.61.
The manual includes technical guidance on sampling and analysis, physical and chemical evaluations, bioassays
(toxicity and bioaccumulation), quality assurance/quality control, evaluation of discharges from confined disposal
facilities, evaluation of mixing, statistical methods, and identification of ammonia toxicity. It uses a tiered
testing approach which is scientifically valid and cost-effective. Conclusions reached utilizing this manual
will be used to make factual determinations of the potential environmental effects of a proposed discharge of dredged
material.

This manual will replace the May 1976 testing protocol, ``Ecological Evaluation of Proposed Discharge of Dredged
or Fill Material into Navigable Waters,'' which will no longer be applicable. Since development of the 1976 guidance,
EPA and CE have gained a great deal of experience in testing dredged material for environmental effects. Much of this
experience has been used in the development of a 1991 ``ocean'' testing manual to implement requirements in the Marine
Protection Research and Sanctuaries Act for evaluation of potential environmental impacts associated with the
discharge of dredged material in waters seaward of the baseline of the territorial sea. Further technical improvements,
such as the refinement of bioassay tests, have been incorporated in the present draft testing manual, ``Evaluation
of Dredged Material Proposed for Discharge in Waters of the U.S._Testing Manual (Draft),'' which implements dredged
material testing requirements under the CWA.

The final testing manual will be published in approximately 6 months after review and consideration of the comments
received on this draft.

State Grants to Support Development of Nutrition Intervention Programs 


Introduction 


The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announces the availability of fiscal year (FY) 1994 funds for
grants to support the development of State and community nutrition intervention programs. This announcement addresses
two distinct components:



I. ``Nutrition Intervention Assistance'' for supporting the implementation of nutrition interventions. 
II. ``5 A Day Evaluation'' for supporting the evaluation of 5 A Day for Better Health nutrition intervention programs.




Applicants may apply for either the Nutrition Intervention Assistance component or the 5 A Day Evaluation component
or both components.
The Public Health Service (PHS) is committed to achieving the health promotion and disease prevention objectives
of ``Healthy People 2000,'' a PHS-led national activity to reduce morbidity and mortality and improve the quality
of life. This announcement is related specifically to the priority area of nutrition and, generally, to several other
priority areas of health promotion and preventive services_including physical activity and fitness, heart disease,
cancer, and diabetes. (For ordering a copy of ``Healthy People 2000,'' see the section, ``Where to Obtain Additional
Information.'') 


Authority 


This program is authorized under sections 301(a), [42 U.S.C. 241 (a)] and 317(k)(2), [42 U.S.C. 247b(k)(2)] of the
Public Health Service Act, as amended. 


Smoke-Free Workplace 


The Public Health Service strongly encourages all grant recipients to provide a smoke-free workplace and promote
the non-use of all tobacco products. This is consistent with the PHS mission to protect and advance the physical and
mental health of the American people. 


Eligible Applicants 


A. Nutrition Intervention Assistance 


Assistance will be provided only to the health departments of States or their bona fide agents. This includes the District
of Columbia, American Samoa, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia,
Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the Republic of Palau, and federally recognized
Indian tribal governments. 
Eligible applicants for nutrition intervention program grants have been restricted to official health departments
of States or their bona fide agents or instrumentalities because: 
1. The methodology to conduct this program has been structured to support the national goals and objectives of ``Healthy
People 2000.'' In many instances, State health departments have already embraced or established their own goals
and objectives which match or are synonymous with those outlined in ``Healthy People 2000.'' 
2. The conduct of Statewide health promotion, health education, and risk reduction programs directed towards reducing
the prevalence of behavioral risks in the population lie solely with State Health Departments. 
3. Program evaluation is expected to be useful to State Health Departments in program and intervention development.
Because comparable methods are used from State to State and from year to year, States can compare data and intervention
methods with other States and monitor the effects of interventions over time. 





B. 5 A Day Evaluation 


Eligible applicants are restricted to official health departments of States or their bona fide agents or instrumentalities
for the reasons listed in (A) above. Eligibility for this component is further restricted to States who have established,
clearly defined, evaluable, long range 5 A Day for Better Health projects in a specific community channel. 


Availability of Funds 


Approximately $740,000 is available in FY 1994 to fund approximately 29 awards. Awards may be made for the Nutrition
Intervention Assistance, or 5 A Day Evaluation or both. 


A. Nutrition Intervention Assistance 


Approximately $450,000 is available to fund approximately 25 awards. It is expected that the average award will be
$18,000, ranging from $10,000 to $30,000. States are encouraged to use these funds to expand the community involvement
toward the goals of this program.

B. 5 A Day Evaluation 


Approximately $290,000 is available to fund approximately 4 awards. It is expected that the average award will be
$75,000, ranging from $60,000 to $90,000. Awards will be considered only for applicants who have an established,
clearly defined, and evaluable long range 5 A Day for Better Health project in a specific community channel (e.g.,
supermarkets, schools, churches, food assistance programs, worksites, health clinics, media, etc.). 

It is expected that the awards will begin on or about 
September 30, 1994, and will be made for a 12-month budget period within a project period of one year. Funding estimates
may vary and are subject to change. 

Awards under this announcement will not be sufficient to fully support an applicant's proposed activities, but are
meant to be used in conjunction with other resources_whether direct funding or in-kind contributions_that the applicant
may have available. 



Purpose 


The awards will support State efforts to develop and evaluate nutrition intervention programs. Emphasis will be
placed on supporting activities of partnerships to carry out interventions and/or evaluations designed to increase
the consumption of fruits and vegetables, to decrease fat intake, and/or to increase physical activity while improving
diet. 



Program Requirements 


A. Nutrition Intervention Assistance 


Promote programmatic activities to achieve Healthy People 2000 dietary objectives that relate to increased consumption
of fruits and vegetables, reduced intake of fat, and/or improving diet while increasing physical activity. Applicants
should propose specific and discrete activities, but applicants are given latitude in deciding which specific activities
to propose. Activities proposed by applicants might include but are not limited to the following: 

1. Assist a Statewide or community-wide coalition to implement a 5 A Day for Better Health project by using effective
public and private partnerships. 

2. Implement an intervention to promote physical activity and improved diet among a defined low-income population.


3. Evaluate a health communication campaign. (Such campaigns could be broad-based, could target specific populations,
or could support specific programs, such as Project LEAN or 5 A Day for Better Health.) 

4. Integrate a nutrition education component into an existing State chronic disease program (e.g., diabetes, cancer,
and heart disease prevention programs) or into appropriate services of a managed care provider. 



B. 5 A Day Evaluation 


An evaluation of a 5 A Day intervention in a specific community channel. Applicants should propose a plan for an evaluation
of a clearly defined, long range effort in a specific community channel. 



Evaluation Criteria 


Applications for the Nutrition Intervention Assistance and the 5 A Day Evaluation components will be allocated 100
points each and will be reviewed and evaluated according to the following criteria: 



A. Nutrition Intervention Assistance 


1. Background 


The degree to which the applicant succinctly describes the problems to be addressed and current activities for resolving
them. (10 points) 


2. Objectives

Determination of Regulatory Review Period for Purposes of Patent Extension; Aceon

TM




<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Food and Drug Administration, HHS.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has determined the regulatory review period for Aceon

TM

 and is publishing this notice of that determination as required by law. FDA has made the determination because of the
submission of an application to the Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks, Department of Commerce, for the extension
of a patent which claims that human drug product.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (Pub. L. 98-417) and the Generic Animal Drug
and Patent Term Restoration Act (Pub. L. 100-670) generally provide that a patent may be extended for a period
of up to 5 years so long as the patented item (human drug product, animal drug product, medical device, food additive,
or color additive) was subject to regulatory review by FDA before the item was marketed. Under these acts, a product's
regulatory review period forms the basis for determining the amount of extension an applicant may receive.


A regulatory review period consists of two periods of time: a testing phase and an approval phase. For human drug products,
the testing phase begins when the exemption to permit the clinical investigations of the drug becomes effective and
runs until the approval phase begins. The approval phase starts with the initial submission of an application to market
the human drug product and continues until FDA grants permission to market the drug product. Although only a portion
of a regulatory review period may count toward the actual amount of extension that the Commissioner of Patents and
Trademarks may award (for example, half the testing phase must be subtracted as well as any time that may have occurred
before the patent was issued), FDA's determination of the length of a regulatory review period for a human drug product
will include all of the testing phase and approval phase as specified in 35 U.S.C. 156(g)(1)(B).
FDA recently approved for marketing the human drug product Aceon

TM

. Aceon

TM

 (perindopril erbumine) is indicated for the treatment of patients with essential hypertension. Subsequent to this
approval, the Patent and Trademark Office received a patent term restoration application for Aceon

TM

 (U.S. Patent No. 4,508,729) from Adir, and the Patent and Trademark Office requested FDA's assistance in determining
this patent's eligibility for patent term restoration. FDA, in a letter dated May 10, 1994, advised the Patent and
Trademark Office that this human drug product had undergone a regulatory review period and that the approval for Aceon

TM

 represented the first permitted commercial marketing or use of the product. Shortly thereafter, the Patent and Trademark
Office requested that FDA determine the product's regulatory review period.
FDA has determined that the applicable regulatory review period for Aceon

TM

 is 2,284 days. Of this time, 1,367 days occurred during the testing phase of the regulatory review period, while 917
days occurred during the approval phase. These periods of time were derived from the following dates:
1. 

The date an exemption under section 505(i) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act became effective

: October 1, 1987. The applicant claims October 23, 1987, as the date the investigational new drug application (IND)
became effective. However, FDA records indicate that the IND effective date was October 1, 1987, which was 30 days
after FDA receipt of the IND. 
2. 

The date the application was initially submitted with respect to the human drug product under section 505(b) of the
Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act

: June 28, 1991. FDA has verified the applicant's claim that June 28, 1991, was the date the new drug application (NDA)
for Aceon

TM

 (NDA 20-184) was initially submitted. 
3. 

The date the application was approved

: December 30, 1993. FDA has verified the applicant's claim that NDA 20-184 was approved on December 30, 1993.
This determination of the regulatory review period establishes the maximum potential length of a patent extension.
However, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office applies several statutory limitations in its calculations of the actual
period for patent extension. In its application for patent extension, this applicant seeks 1,588 days of patent extension.
Anyone with knowledge that any of the dates as published is incorrect may, on or before September 19, 1994, submit to
the Dockets Management Branch (address above) written comments and ask for a redetermination. Furthermore, any
interested person may petition FDA, on or before January 17, 1995, for a determination regarding whether the applicant
for extension acted with due diligence during the regulatory review period. To meet its burden, the petition must
contain sufficient facts to merit an FDA investigation. (See H. Rept. 857, part 1, 98th Cong., 2d sess., pp. 41-42,
1984.) Petitions should be in the format specified in 21 CFR 10.30.
Comments and petitions should be submitted to the Dockets Management Branch (address above) in three copies (except
that individuals may submit single copies) and identified with the docket number found in brackets in the heading
of this document. Comments and petitions may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday
through Friday.

will include all of the testing phase and approval phase as specified in 35 U.S.C. 156(g)(1)(B).
FDA recently approved for marketing the human drug product Demadex

TM

. Demadex

TM

 (torsemide) is indicated for the treatment of edema associated with congestive heart failure, renal disease, or
hepatic disease. Subsequent to this approval, the Patent and Trademark Office received a patent term restoration
application for Demadex

TM

 (U.S. Patent No. Re. 30,633) from A. Christians Societe Anonyme, and the Patent and Trademark Office requested FDA's
assistance in determining this patent's eligibility for patent term restoration. FDA, in a letter dated December
9, 1993, advised the Patent and Trademark Office that this human drug product had undergone a regulatory review period
and that the approval of Demadex

TM

 represented the first permitted commercial marketing or use of the product. Shortly thereafter, the Patent and Trademark
Office requested that FDA determine the product's regulatory review period.
FDA has determined that the applicable regulatory review period for Demadex

TM

 is 2,790 days. Of this time, 1,882 days occurred during the testing phase of the regulatory review period, while 908
days occurred during the approval phase. These periods of time were derived from the following dates:
1. 

The date an exemption under section 505(i) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act became effective

: January 4, 1986. FDA has verified the applicant's claim that January 4, 1986, was the date the investigational new
drug application (IND) became effective. The applicant claims January 10, 1986, as the date the IND became effective.
However, FDA records indicate that the IND effective date was January 4, 1986, which was 30 days after FDA receipt of
the IND.
2. 

The date the application was initially submitted with respect to the human drug product under section 505(b) of the
Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act

: February 28, 1991. FDA has verified the applicant's claim that February 28, 1991, was the date the new drug application
(NDA) for Demadex

TM

 (NDA 20-136) was initially submitted.
3. 

The date the application was approved

: August 23, 1993. FDA has verified the applicant's claim that NDA 20-136 was approved on August 23, 1993.
This determination of the regulatory review period establishes the maximum potential length of a patent extension.
However, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office applies several statutory limitations in its calculations of the actual
period for patent extension. In its application for patent extension, this applicant seeks 5 years of patent term
extension. 
Anyone with knowledge that any of the dates as published is incorrect may, on or before September 19, 1994, submit to

Every advisory committee meeting shall have an open public hearing portion. Whether or not it also includes any of
the other three portions will depend upon the specific meeting involved. The dates and times reserved for the separate
portions of each committee meeting are listed above.
The open public hearing portion of each meeting shall be at least 1 hour long unless public participation does not last
that long. It is emphasized, however, that the 1 hour time limit for an open public hearing represents a minimum rather
than a maximum time for public participation, and an open public hearing may last for whatever longer period the committee
chairperson determines will facilitate the committee's work.
Public hearings are subject to FDA's guideline (subpart C of 21 CFR part 10) concerning the policy and procedures for
electronic media coverage of FDA's public administrative proceedings, including hearings before public advisory
committees under 21 CFR part 14. Under 21 CFR 10.205, representatives of the electronic media may be permitted, subject
to certain limitations, to videotape, film, or otherwise record FDA's public administrative proceedings, including
presentations by participants.
Meetings of advisory committees shall be conducted, insofar as is practical, in accordance with the agenda published
in this 

Federal Register

 notice. Changes in the agenda will be announced at the beginning of the open portion of a meeting.
Any interested person who wishes to be assured of the right to make an oral presentation at the open public hearing portion
of a meeting shall inform the contact person listed above, either orally or in writing, prior to the meeting. Any person
attending the hearing who does not in advance of the meeting request an opportunity to speak will be allowed to make
an oral presentation at the hearing's conclusion, if time permits, at the chairperson's discretion.
The agenda, the questions to be addressed by the committee, and a current list of committee members will be available
at the meeting location on the day of the meeting.
Transcripts of the open portion of the meeting may be requested in writing from the Freedom of Information Office (HFI-35),
Food and Drug Administration, rm. 12A-16, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857, approximately 15 working
days after the meeting, at a cost of 10 cents per page. The transcript may be viewed at the Dockets Management Branch
(HFA-305), Food and Drug Administration, rm. 1-23, 12420 Parklawn Dr., Rockville, MD 20857, approximately
15 working days after the meeting, between the hours of 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday. Summary minutes of
the open portion of the meeting may be requested in writing from the Freedom of Information Office (address above)
beginning approximately 90 days after the meeting. 
The Commissioner has determined for the reasons stated that those portions of the advisory committee meetings so
designated in this notice shall be closed. The Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA) (5 U.S.C. app. 2, 10(d)), permits
such closed advisory committee meetings in certain circumstances. Those portions of a meeting designated as closed,
however, shall be closed for the shortest possible time, consistent with the intent of the cited statutes.
The FACA, as amended, provides that a portion of a meeting may be closed where the matter for discussion involves a trade
secret; commercial or financial information that is privileged or confidential; information of a personal nature,
disclosure of which would be a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy; investigatory files compiled for
law enforcement purposes; information the premature disclosure of which would be likely to significantly frustrate
implementation of a proposed agency action; and information in certain other instances not generally relevant to
FDA matters.
Examples of portions of FDA advisory committee meetings that ordinarily may be closed, where necessary and in accordance
with FACA criteria, include the review, discussion, and evaluation of drafts of regulations or guidelines or similar
preexisting internal agency documents, but only if their premature disclosure is likely to significantly frustrate
implementation of proposed agency action; review of trade secrets and confidential commercial or financial information
submitted to the agency; consideration of matters involving investigatory files compiled for law enforcement purposes;
and review of matters, such as personnel records or individual patient records, where disclosure would constitute
a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.
Examples of portions of FDA advisory committee meetings that ordinarily shall not be closed include the review, discussion,
and evaluation of general preclinical and clinical test protocols and procedures for a class of drugs or devices;
consideration of labeling requirements for a class of marketed drugs or devices; review of data and information on
specific investigational or marketed drugs and devices that have previously been made public; presentation of any
other data or information that is not exempt from public disclosure pursuant to the FACA, as amended; and, deliberation
to formulate advice and recommendations to the agency on matters that do not independently justify closing.
This notice is issued under section 10(a)(1) and (2) of the Federal Advisory Committee Act (5 U.S.C. app. 2), and FDA's
regulations (21 CFR part 14) on advisory committees.

<DOCTITLE>Privacy Act of 1974; Systems of Records</DOCTITLE>


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA).


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of proposed new routine use for existing systems of records.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

HCFA is proposing to revise the system notices for the ``Carrier Medicare Claims Records'' (CMCR), System No. 09-70-0501,
and the ``Intermediary Medicare Claims Records'' (IMCR), System No. 09-70-0503. The Privacy Act permits
disclosure of information without the prior written consent of an individual for ``routine use'' that is; disclosure
for purposes compatible with the purpose for which the data is collected. HCFA is proposing to revise the CMCR and IMCR
by adding a new routine use for release of intermediary and carrier maintained beneficiary data to servicing Medicare
banks and/or provider banks.


The purpose of this new routine use is to allow fiscal intermediaries (FIs) and carriers to send claims payment and
beneficiary information to providers or their banks either directly, or through a Value Added Network (VAN) telecommunications
service and for provider banks to use this information to perform account management activities on behalf of providers.
Under this scenario, the electronic funds transfer (EFT) and the electronic remittance advice (ERA) flow together
through the banking system. The consolidation of Medicare beneficiary and payment information will reduce paperwork
and administrative costs.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The IMCR and the CMCR exist to assure proper health insurance benefit payments to or on behalf of entitled Medicare
Part A and Part B beneficiaries. The Privacy Act permits disclosure of information without the prior written consent
of an individual for ``routine use'' that is; disclosure for purposes compatible with the purpose for which the data
is collected.


The IMCR and CMCR systems of records were last published in the 

Federal Register

 at 55 FR 37549; September 12, 1990. Currently, there are 23 routine uses in the IMCR system and 25 in the CMCR system that
permit disclosure of information to individuals and/or organizations for a variety of reasons, the majority of which
relate to the timely and accurate processing of Medicare claims, payment safeguards activities, and research. There
are safeguards in place, as described in the safeguard section of both systems, to protect the data which have been
developed in accordance with part 6 of the HHS Information Resource Management Manual and the National Institute
of Standards and Technology Information Process Standards.

We are proposing to add a new routine use (number (24)/(26)) to the Carrier and Intermediary systems of records, for
the release of data without an individuals' prior written consent. The new routine use would permit the release of
beneficiary data via ERA to servicing Medicare banks and to provider banks. Servicing Medicare banks enter into agreements
with the Health Care Financing Administration and with contracted Medicare claims processors to provide check clearing,
account maintenance and electronic payment origination services for the Medicare program. The proposed routine
use allows release of data from the IMCR and the CMCR to servicing Medicare banks and/or Medicare provider banks for
one or more of the following purposes: (1) For servicing Medicare banks to transmit ERAs on behalf of Medicare contractors
to Medicare providers directly or through the banking system to either the provider's bank or a VAN; (2) For provider
banks to receive ERAs from the servicing Medicare banks and to transmit the remittance information directly to Medicare
providers via mail, telefax, or electronic transmission; (3) For provider banks to receive ERAs from the originating
Medicare banks in order to perform account maintenance activities at the request of Medicare providers.
Transmitting remittance data electronically to providers or their banks directly from the servicing Medicare bank,
and/or electronically transmitting beneficiary and provider data along with payment information from the servicing
Medicare bank to providers, their banks or a VAN service, allows for more efficient payment and reconciliation processes
for both HCFA and providers. The new routine use number (24), for the IMCR, and (26), for the CMCR, will read as follows:
(24)/(26) Servicing Fiscal Intermediary/Carrier banks, Automated Clearing Houses, VANs and provider banks to
the extent necessary to transfer to providers electronic remittance advices of Medicare payments, and with respect
to provider banks, to the extent necessary to provide account management services to providers using this information.
Technical amendments have been made to routine use number (24)/(26) for consistency with the current notices. The
IMCR and CMCR systems maintain information for the purpose of processing and paying Medicare benefits to or on behalf
of eligible individuals. The proposed new routine use is consistent with the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. 552a(a)(7), since
it is compatible with this purpose. In accordance with OMB Guidelines (Circular A-130, 58 FR 36068, 36077 July
2, 1993), this addition of a routine use constitutes a significant change in the system of records. Accordingly, we
have prepared a report of an altered system of records under 5 U.S.C. 552a(r). In addition, for the convenience of the
reader, we are publishing the notice for both systems in their entirety below.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION.





Policies and practices for storing, retrieving, accessing, retaining, and disposing of records in the system:

Storage:



Records maintained on paper forms and/or electronic media.



Retrievability:



The system is indexed by health insurance claim number. The record is prepared by the hospital or other provider with
identifying information received from the beneficiary to establish eligibility for Medicare and document and support
payments to providers by the intermediaries. The bill data are forwarded to the Health Care Financing Administration,
Bureau of Data Management and Strategy, Baltimore, MD, where they are used to update the central office records.



Safeguards:



Disclosure of records is limited. Physical safeguards are established in accordance with Department standards
and National Institute of Standards and Technology guidelines (e.g., security codes) will be used, limiting access
to authorized personnel. System securities are established in accordance with HHS Information Resource Management
(IRM) Circular 

#

10, Automated information Systems Security Program, and HCFA Automated Information Systems (AIS) Guide, System
Security Policies.



Retention and disposal:



Records are closed out at the end of the calendar year in which paid, held 2 more years, transferred to the Federal Records
Center and destroyed after another 6 years.



System manager(s) and address:



Health Care Financing Administration, Director, Bureau of Program Operations, 6325 Security Boulevard, Baltimore,
MD 21207.



Notification procedure:



Inquiries and requests for system records should be addressed to the social security office nearest the requester's
residence, the appropriate intermediary, the HCFA Regional Office, or to the system manager named above. The individual
should furnish his or her health insurance number and name as shown on social security records. An individual who requests
notification of or access to a medical record shall, at the time the request is made, designate in writing a responsible
representative who will be willing to review the record and inform the subject individual of its contents at the representative's
discretion.



Record access procedures:



Same as notification procedures. Requesters should also reasonably specify the records contents being sought.
These procedures are in accordance with Department Regulations, 45 CFR 5b.5(a)(2).



Contesting record procedures:



Contact the official at the address specified under notification procedure above, and reasonably identify the record
and specify the information to be contested. State the corrective action sought and the reasons for the correction
with supporting justification. These procedures are in accordance with Department Regulations, 45 CFR 5b.7. 



Record source categories:



The identifying information contained in these records is obtained by the provider from the individual or, in the
case of some Medicare secondary payer situations, through third party contacts. The medical information is entered
by the provider of medical services.



Systems exempted from certain provisions of the act:



None.

<DOCTITLE>Privacy Act of 1974; Report of Revised System of Records </DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Social Security Administration (SSA), Department of 
Health and Human Services (HHS). 


 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Revision to a system of records. 

 


</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 In accordance with the Privacy Act (5 U.S.C. 552a(e) 
(11)), we are issuing public notice of our intent to revise the 
name and description of a system of records entitled ``Master 
Files of Social Security Number Holders, HHS/SSA/OSR, 09-60-0058'' 
(last published at 58 FR 35025, June 30, 1993). 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

I. Discussion of Proposed Revision 



We are changing the name of the system of records and the 
description of its purpose to clarify the fact that it includes 
applications for Social Security numbers (SSNs) submitted with 
suspicious or fraudulent evidence, as well as the records of 
individuals who have applied for and been assigned SSNs. The 
vast majority of SSN applications with complete evidence are soon 
approved and SSNs are assigned to the applicants in a few days. 
In some cases, however, an application may be held and a record 
maintained for up to 120 days while SSA determines whether the 
evidence of identity, age or citizenship/alien status is proper 
and authentic. SSA disallows applications which are supported by 
fraudulent documents, and maintains records of such applications. 
These records prevent individuals whose applications are 
supported by fraudulent or suspicious documents from obtaining 
SSNs by visiting other SSA offices which might unwittingly accept 
these documents. 

Besides changing the name of the system and showing that its 
purpose includes protecting against SSN applications supported by 
suspicious or fraudulent evidence, we have changed some of the 
other language: 

 To show that the system covers paper applications for SSNs 
as well as electronic records, and 

 To explain how a record is retrieved when it does not 
include an SSN. 



II. Effect of the Proposed Changes on Individual Rights 



The proposed changes will clarify the types of information which 
SSA maintains about persons who apply for SSNs. They will have 
no effect on individuals' rights.

System name: 



Master Files of Social Security Number (SSN) 
Holders and SSN Applications, HHS/SSA/OSR. 



Security classification: 



None. 



System locations: 



Social Security Administration, Office of Systems Operations, 6401 Security Boulevard, Baltimore, MD 21235 

Social Security Administration, Office of Central Records Operations, Metro West Building, 300 N. Greene Street,
Baltimore, MD 21201. 




Records may also be maintained at contractor sites (contact the 
system manager at the address below to obtain contractor 
addresses). 



Categories of individuals covered by the system: 



This system contains a record of each individual who has applied for and 
obtained a Social Security number (SSN) and of each individual 
whose application was supported by documents which are suspected 
to be fraudulent and are being verified with the issuing agency, 
or have been determined to be fraudulent. 



Categories of records in the system: 



This system contains all of 
the information received on original applications for SSNs (e.g., 
name, date and place of birth, sex, both parents' names, and 
race/ethnic data), and any changes in the information on the 
applications that are submitted by the SSN holders. It also 
contains applications supported by evidence suspected or 
determined to be fraudulent, along with the mailing addresses of 
the individuals who filed such applications and descriptions of 
the documentation which they submitted. Cross-references may be 
noted where multiple numbers have been issued to the same 
individual and an indication may be shown that a benefit claim 
has been made under a particular SSN(s). 



Authority for maintenance of the system: 



Sections 205(a) and 205(c)(2) of the Social Security Act. 



Purpose(s): 



Information in this system is used by the Social 
Security Administration (SSA) to assign SSNs. The information 
also is used for a number of administrative purposes, such as: 

 By SSA components for various title II, XVI, and XVIII 
claims purposes including usage of the SSN itself as a 
case control number and a secondary beneficiary cross- 
reference control number for enforcement purposes and 
use of the SSN record data for verification of claimant 
identity factors and for other claims purposes related 
to establishing benefit entitlement; 

 By SSA as a basic control for retained earnings 
information; 

 By SSA as a basic control and data source to prevent 
issuance of multiple SSNs; 

 As the means to identify reported names or SSNs on 
earnings reports; 

 For resolution of earnings discrepancy cases; 

 For statistical studies; 

 By the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), 
Office of Inspector General, Office of Audit Services, 
for auditing benefit payments under Social Security 
programs;

 By the HHS Office of Child Support Enforcement for 
locating parents who owe child support; 
 By the National Institute of Occupational Safety and 
Health for epidemiological research studies required by 
the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1974; 
 By the SSA Office of Refugee Resettlement for 
administering Cuban refugee assistance payments; and 
 By the HHS Health Care Financing Administration for 
administering Title XVIII claims. 
Information in this system is also used by SSA to prevent the 
processing of an SSN card application for an individual whose 
application is identified as having been supported by evidence 
that either: 
 Is suspect and being verified, or 
 Has been determined to be fraudulent. 
With this system in place, clerical investigation and 
intervention is required. Social Security offices are alerted in 
case an applicant attempting to obtain an SSN might visit other 
offices and might attempt to find one which would unwittingly 
accept fraudulent documentation. 


Routine uses of records maintained in the system, including 
categories of users and the purposes of such uses: 


Disclosure may be made for routine uses as indicated below: 
1. Employers are notified of the SSNs of employees in order to 
complete their records for reporting wages to SSA pursuant to the 
Federal Insurance Contributions Act and section 218 of the Social

Policies and practices for storing, retrieving, accessing, retaining, and disposing of records in the system: 

Storage: 



Records in this system are maintained in paper form 
(e.g., paper lists, punch cards, Forms SS-5 (Application for an 
SSN), and systems generated forms); magnetic media (e.g., 
magnetic tape and disk with on-line access); and in microfilm and 
microfiche form. 



Retrievability: 



Records of SSN holders are indexed by both SSN 
and name. Records of applications that have been denied because 
the applicant submitted fraudulent evidence, or that are being 
verified because the evidence is suspected to be fraudulent, are 
indexed either by the applicant's name plus month and year of 
birth, or by the applicant's name plus the eleven-digit reference 
number of the disallowed application. 



Safeguards: 



Safeguards for automated records have been 
established in accordance with the HHS Automated Data Processing 
Manual, ``Part 6, ADP Systems Security.'' This includes 
maintaining the magnetic tapes and disks within a secured 
enclosure attended by security guards. Anyone entering or 
leaving this enclosure must have a special badge issued only to 
authorized personnel. 

For computerized records electronically transmitted between 
Central Office and Field Office locations (including 
organizations administering SSA programs under contractual 
agreements), safeguards include a lock/unlock password system, 
exclusive use of leased telephone lines, a terminal-oriented 
transaction matrix, and an audit trail. All microfilm, 
microfiche, and paper files are accessible only by authorized 
personnel who have a need for the records in the performance of 
their official duties. 

Expansion and improvement of SSA's telecommunications systems has 
resulted in the acquisition of terminals equipped with physical 
key locks. The terminals also are fitted with adapters to permit 
the future installation of data encryption devices and devices to 
permit the identification of terminal users. 



Retention and Disposal: 



All paper forms are retained for 5 years 
after they have been filmed or entered on tape and the accuracy 
has been verified. They then are destroyed by shredding. All 
tape, disks, microfilm, and microfiche files are updated 
periodically. Out-of-date magnetic tapes and disks are erased. 
Out-of-date microfiches are disposed of by applying heat.

System manager and address: 



Director, Division of Data Support and Enumeration, Office of Systems Requirements, Social Security Administration,
6401 Security Boulevard, Baltimore, MD 21235. 



Notification procedures: 



An individual can determine if this 
system contains a record pertaining to him/her by providing 
his/her name, signature, and SSN to the address shown under 
``System Manager'' above. (Furnishing the SSN is voluntary, but it 
makes searching for an individual's record easier and avoids 
delay.) If the SSN is unknown or no SSN has been assigned 
because the evidence presented with the application is being 
verified or has been determined to be fraudulent, the individual 
should provide name, signature, date and place of birth, sex, 
mother's birth name, and father's name, and evidence of identity. 
These procedures are in accordance with HHS Regulations 45 CFR 
part 5b. 



Record access procedures: 



Same as notification procedures. Also, 
requesters should reasonably specify the record contents which 
they are seeking. These procedures are in accordance with HHS 
Regulations 45 CFR part 5b. 



Contesting record procedures: 



Same as notification procedures 
above. Also, requesters should reasonably identify the record, 
specify the information which they are contesting, and state the 
corrective action sought and the reasons for the correction, with 
supporting justification showing how the record is incomplete, 
untimely, inaccurate, or irrelevant. These procedures are in 
accordance with HHS Regulations 45 CFR part 5b. 



Record source categories: 



Information in this system is obtained 
from SSN applicants (or individuals acting on their behalf). The 
SSN itself is assigned to the individual as a result of internal 
processes of this system. 



System exempted from certain provisions of the act: 



None.

ACTION: 

Notice of Public Meetings.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

HUD is charged with the administration and enforcement of the Fair Housing Act, including the promulgation of Fair
Housing Act, including the promulgation of Fair Housing Act regulations. Prior to promulgation of a regulation on
nondiscrimination in property insurance practices, HUD is seeking public comment on property insurance practices

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 


I. Background



HUD is committed to initiatives that will provide access to capital and economic empowerment for all Americans. HUD
has launched creative programs to stem disinvestment in cities and disadvantaged communities throughout the country,
increase the flow of capital into these communities, and create communities of opportunity throughout the nation.

Among HUD's priorities are: (1) Empowerment of local communities by supporting local economic development efforts;
(2) expansion of housing opportunities through partnerships with State and local government and private developers
and financial institutions; and (3) opening housing markets through vigorous enforcement of the Federal Fair Housing
Act (42 U.S.C. 3601-3619). A critical component of these initiatives is assuring access to capital for homeownership
and business development. Assuring fair access to property insurance is essential. Insurance is necessary for access
to capital. 

HUD is charged with the administration and enforcement of the Fair Housing Act, including the promulgation of regulations.
Prior to promulgation of a regulation on nondiscrimination in property insurance under the Fair Housing Act, HUD
is seeking public comment on: property insurance practices that may or may not be discriminatory; specific provisions
within the regulation; disclosure requirements and best practices.

This notice announces four public meetings to be conducted by the Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity

Task Force on Occupancy Standards in Public and Assisted Housing 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Office of the Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and 
Equal Opportunity, HUD.

 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of Availability of Final Report.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Task Force on Occupancy Standards in Public and Assisted Housing was established on December 31, 1992 in accordance
with the provisions of section 643 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 (P.L. 102-550) and the
Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA) (5 U.S.C. App 2). The Task Force's charter was published in the 

Federal Register

 on January 7, 1993 at 58 FR 3039. The Task Force was created to review all rules, policy statements, handbooks and technical
assistance memoranda issued by the Department on the standards and obligations governing residency in public and
assisted housing; and make recommendations in its final report to HUD and Congress for the establishment of reasonable
criteria for occupancy, so that HUD could revise its standards, regulations, and guidelines to provide accurate
and complete guidance to owners and managers of federally assisted housing.



The preliminary report of the task force was made available by a 

Federal Register

 Notice published on August 31, 1993, at 58 FR 45905. The public was given 60 days to submit comments on the preliminary
report.


This notice is to provide the public with the Executive Summary of the Report and announce the availability of the Task
Force's Final Report from the Fair Housing Clearinghouse (1-800-343-3442) or (TDD) (1-800-927-9275),
1600 Research Boulevard, Rockville, Maryland 20850. This Report reflects the opinions of the Task Force and does
not necessarily represent Departmental policy or procedures. The Department is presently considering all the recommendations
and expects to publish rules and guidance addressing the issues raised in the Report.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The Executive Summary of the Report.



Preface_Funding and Finance Issues



Throughout its deliberations and recommendations, one theme about which Occupancy Task Force members agreed was
that low-income people should have more housing choices than they do at present. The issue of housing choice, along
with many other concerns the Task Force addressed, is complicated by scarcity of resources. The Task Force therefore
proposes a number of recommendations aimed specifically at funding and cost issues.



Chapter 1_The Application Process


In preparing its report, the Occupancy Task Force decided that it would be more useful to begin by addressing the sequential
tenancy process: the application process, occupancy and eviction. The first stage of this process, during which
applicants are screened for eligibility and tenant selection criteria, is an extremely important one in that the
applicants who are selected will become members of the resident community and those who are not selected will be denied
the opportunity to live in federally assisted housing. Thus, the Task Force spent significant time considering the
issues contained in the Application Process Chapter. In doing so, the Task Force balanced the rights of housing providers
to choose residents who will fulfill their lease obligations and the rights of applicants to be chosen fairly.

In addition to including the Task Force's specific recommendations, Chapter One describes the application process
from start to finish in order to provide a full context for the recommendations. In particular, the application process
issues addressed by the Task Force include the following:

 Guiding principles for the application process;

 Accessibility of the application process and the need for plain language forms and documents;

 Marketing;

 Waiting lists;

 Occupancy standards;

 Rent reform;

 Screening applicants, including applicants with non-traditional tenant histories;

 Reasonable accommodations in the application and screening process;

 Disability-related inquiries; and

 Determinations involving alcohol and controlled substances.



Chapter 2_Management



The application process ends when the housing provider makes the decision to admit an applicant. Next, the housing
management process begins, encompassing orientation, execution of the lease, move-in, occupancy and lease compliance.
The Task Force addressed the following topics within the housing management process;

 Guiding Principles for the housing management process;

 The lease;


 Preventing and addressing lease violations;

 Unit transfers; and

 Retention of housing during hospitalization or residential treatment.



Chapter 3_Evictions




Eviction from public or assisted housing is a very serious sanction; it not only displaces the resident, it also discontinues
the subsidy that makes housing affordable to that resident. Eviction is nonetheless occasionally necessary. Experience
shows that some individuals are not willing to meet the essential obligations of tenancy and must be removed in order
to preserve the viability of the housing development. Given the shortage of public and assisted housing, and the difficulty
of preserving this housing, the Task force also stresses the need to remove those whose conduct is destructive to the
development.

An equitable eviction policy will authorize the eviction, in appropriate circumstances, of those residents whose
conduct violates essential provisions of the lease, those whose conduct repeatedly violates minor provisions of
the lease, and those who allow others to do so. The Task Force reviews the proper use of eviction as focusing generally
on whether and how seriously the conduct in question adversely affects the housing community. In addition, the Task
Force recommends that except as noted, the status, regulations, handbooks and lease provisions regarding eviction
not be changed.


The report addresses the following topics:

 Alternatives to eviction;

 Alternatives after eviction, to prevent homelessness;

 Notices;

 Drug abuse and drug related crime;

 Criminal activity as grounds for eviction;

 Former users of illegal drugs;

 Fraud;

 Minor crimes and off-premises criminal activity;

 Public housing grievance procedure;

 Residents' liability for the actions of others;

 Consideration of all the facts and circumstances;

 Criminal activity prior to admission;

 Subsidy termination_certificate and voucher programs; and

 Subsidy termination_assisted housing.



Chapter 4_Reasonable Accommodations



Reasonable accommodation is a creative, challenging and evolving area of disability law and practice, affecting
every aspect of admissions, occupancy and evictions. The Task Force believes that, despite many uncertainties as
to what is required by law, it is possible to craft sound, basic, reasonable accommodation policies and procedures
which will satisfy the intent of the law without subjecting either persons with disabilities or housing providers
to unintended burdens.

This chapter tackles a wide range of reasonable accommodations issues with the intention of providing guidance on
the procedural elements essential to achieving compliance. Specifically, the chapter is organized as follows:

 Regulatory and case-law references that provide background on the concept of reasonable accommodation followed
by brief discussion of program accessibility requirements (the self-evaluation and transition plan);

 Discussion of a definition of reasonable accommodation;

 Statement of principles applicable to reasonable accommodations, drawn from current law and regulation
and describing both affirmative requirements and the regulatory limits placed on the implementation of the concept;

 Examination of the regulatory limits that apply to accommodations (undue burdens and fundamental alterations);

 Recommendations on effective implementation of reasonable accommodations;

<TEXT>
 

 Review of diverse reasonable accommodation issues including disagreements about types of accommodation,
accommodations in the occupancy cycle, procedures related to service animals, and the use of interpreters; and 
 Recommendations for HUD Technical Assistance. 


Chapter 5_Fundamental Alterations


Both Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988 anticipate that, at some
level, the compliance action requested or required may exhaust available resources or so alter the housing program
that the action becomes infeasible. Housing providers are required to judge the feasibility of compliance actions
against two criteria; fundamental alternations in the nature of the program and undue financial and administrative
burdens. This chapter frames these issues in the context of program operations and management. 
Fundamental alternations in the nature of the program and undue financial and administrative burdens raise issues
of resource management, capital planning, and ultimately, program funding. Many compliance actions can be absorbed
with existing program funds, but the cost of making some programs accessible and responding to some requests for accommodations
will require that Congress recognize the need for increased funding levels. Greater flexibility in HUD's rules governing
the use of operating and capital budgets is also required. Specific changes in budget operating procedures and formula
calculations are recommended. 
The Task Force also makes a general recommendation to increase the level of modernization funds for both public and
assisted housing. 
This chapter includes: 
 Examples of actions that might result in fundamental alternations; 
 Suggestions for evaluating fundamental alternations in light of the program purpose and any services delivered
on site; 
 Treatment of profit at assisted housing properties; 
 Principles that explain how the undue burdens test is unique to each reasonable accommodation request and
how to judge the impact of compliance actions against available program resources; 
 Use of operating and capital budgeting line items for reasonable accommodation and other compliance requirements;

 Program factors to consider when assessing undue burdens; 
 Procedural frameworks for evaluating undue financial burdens in public and assisted housing; and 
 A plan for identifying unfunded accessibility needs. 


Chapter 6_Certificates and Vouchers


During the course of its deliberations, the Task Force generally discussed issues that could be addressed in a unified
manner for all federally subsidized housing programs, such as the need for plain language forms and communications.
Thus, the Task Force wishes to make clear that all such global recommendations, such as the need for plain language
and timely and adequate notice, apply in the Section 8 Certificate and Voucher programs. 
However, the Task Force also dealt with issues in the public housing and project-based assistance programs, such
as admissions procedures, that could not be so readily carried over into the context of the Certificate and Voucher
programs; this posed a particular challenge. In those programs the housing authority does not admit an applicant
to housing, is not the resident's landlord and does not evict. Instead, in a delicate balance among the three parties
involved, the housing agency provides a rental subsidy to the participant and, as a quid pro quo to the private landlord's
receipt of a portion of the market rent, enforces specific regulatory provisions incorporated into the Housing Assistance
Payments contract. Between the private landlord and the resident-recipient flow another set of rights and obligations,
arising from the lease, the HAP contract, federal law and regulation and state law. 
In this chapter, the Task Force has addressed only those issues that were of particular concern to Task Force members
or were congruent with issues raised in the project-based context. The Task Force has not attempted a wholesale critique
of the Certificate and Voucher programs not wholly rewritten any area of program administration. Nor has the Task
Force, in particular, dealt with the proposed regulations to consolidate the Certificate and Voucher programs,
which have not yet been implemented and so do not represent current practice. This Chapter includes recommendations
concerning: 
 Expirations/extensions of time; 
 Exemptions to fair market rents; 
 Assistance for individuals with disabilities; 
 Waiting lists; 
 Evictions/terminations of assistance; 
 Lease terminations in the first year of the lease; 
 Damage and vacancy claims;

 Portability/mobility. 


Chapter 7_Support Services


This chapter examines the intersection of housing and services and makes recommendations to Congress, HUD and the
Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) about improving coordination, access, and delivery of services in
an independent housing context. Many people who live in federally subsidized housing need, want and are eligible
for services that have some form of federal subsidy or some form of federal mandate or encouragement. Services could
help maintain tenancies and independence, promote economic and educations opportunity, and generally enhance
the lives and opportunities of those who live in federally subsidized housing. The Task Force believes that one major
problem is that the housing and service systems often do not understand one another or work in a coordinated way to help
the same individual. Because issues of coordination can be addressed only if HUD and HHS work together, this chapter
makes recommendations to HHS even though the Task Force was created to advise Congress about HUD matters. 
Part A of this chapter covers general services and housing issues and recommendations to ensure the provision of services
to residents. Part B reviews the planning and funding complexities of federal, state and local programs, including
recommendations to HUD and HHS. Part C discusses collaborative agreements between housing and services providers.



Chapter 8_Clearinghouse


In a number of discussions, the Task Force addressed the problems associated with the lack of effective coordination
among housing providers, supportive service providers, tenant representatives and advocates. We were also troubled
by the general unavailability of adequate, reliable, technical assistance on reasonable accommodation procedures
and substance. 
The Task Force concluded that one way of addressing both problems was to recommend that Congress require that each
state receiving federal housing assistance establish a model clearinghouse program, to be funded by the HOME and
CDBG programs. This chapter discusses the scope and purposes of such clearinghouses. 


Chapter 9_Confidentiality


Because every housing file contains personal information about applicants and residents, privacy and confidentiality
and persistent concerns. The civil rights and housing program laws and regulations all address some aspects of privacy
and confidentiality, but they leave many questions unanswered. Thus, the Task Force recommends that HUD research
the variety of questions and issues that the chapter lists, consult with interested parties, and issue prompt and
responsive guidance. The questions include issues relating to law enforcement, reasonable accommodations, resident
screening and eviction committees, state and local laws, and service coordinator and provider responsibilities.



Chapter 10_NIMBY


NIMBY, the Not In My Back Yard syndrome, both contributes to and is a form of housing discrimination. Like all forms
of discrimination, NIMBY has ripple effects on subsidized housing providers. When a neighborhood association successfully
prevents people with disabilities, people with low incomes, and people with no homes from moving in, it not only exacerbates
the pressure on subsidized housing providers to house these groups, but it reinforces the stereotype that subsidized
housing exists for the purpose of keeping ``the undesirables'' out of ``decent'' neighborhoods. 
NIMBY, like the dearth of affordable housing, has permeated the Task Force's deliberations. Thus, the purpose of
this chapter is two-fold. It describes how community perceptions and stereotypes can limit housing opportunities
for individuals and families with low- and very low-incomes; while emphasizing that every individual and family
should have an opportunity to choose from a variety of housing options, including private, public, federally-assisted,
scattered site and supportive housing. Second, this chapter offers a number of specific recommendations to Congress

and the Executive Agencies with regard to housing discrimination. This chapter is not an enforcement of one type of
housing option over others but rather an enforcement of individual choice and empowerment. The Task Force was unanimous
in its identification of discrimination as a major problem for everyone involved in the housing industry. 


Closing Note on Recommendations to HUD



Most of the Task Force's recommendations for HUD action suggest that HUD develop ``guidance'' for housing providers.
The term ``guidance'' means examples, models, and samples, of letters, forms, procedures, systems, etc., designed
to help housing providers without imposing new requirements on them. The Task Force recommendations for guidance
should not be interpreted by HUD as creating new requirements.

Intent to Amend the California Desert Conservation Area Plan



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Bureau of Land Management, Interior.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of intent.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

Pursuant to 43 CFR 1610.2(a), notice is hereby given that the Bureau of Land Management proposes to change the Multiple
Use Classification from Class L to Class M for the following public lands:



San Bernardino Meridian, Imperial County, California



T. 16S., R. 16 E.,



Sec. 25, SE1/4NW1/4.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

In the 

Federal Register 

of March 20, 1992 (Vol. 57, No. 55, p. 9743), a Notice of Intent was published initiating the 1992 Review of the California
Desert Conservation Plan and inviting requests for amendments to the Plan from individuals, public and private organizations,
and the Bureau's own observation. Those amendment proposals were included on the agenda at the public meeting of the
California Desert District Advisory Council Meeting on June 3-4, 1992. A Notice was published in the 

Federal Register

 of May 22, 1992 (Vol. 57, No. 100, p. 21820) announcing the meeting.



The proposal to reclassify the above-described land from Multiple Use Class L to Class M was presented at the meeting
and no adverse comments were received. This Notice of Intent is being published to re-initiate the public scoping
period. The forty-acre parcel described above is being considered for direct sale at fair market value to General
Farm Investment Company, owner and operator of the farmland that borders three sides of this land. The subject land
extends into the farming operations and is an obstacle to efficient farming and irrigating. Disposal would establish
a more manageable ownership boundary benefiting both the Bureau of Land Management and General Farm. The proposed
plan amendment and decision on disposal will be determined through environmental analysis in accordance with 43
CFR 1610.5-5.

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of Emergency Closure in the 

Arabis pusilla

 Habitat Management Area, Green River Resource Area, Wyoming.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) hereby gives notice that, effective immediately, all public lands within the


Arabis pusilla

 Habitat Management Area (HMA) are closed to all mechanized/non-motorized vehicular use to preserve the habitat
of this Candidate plant species. This species, commonly called the small rockcress, is being proposed as Endangered
by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Its single known population is located at Pine Creek, near South Pass, Wyoming,
and consists of approximately 1000 individuals. Approximately 500 acres of land within the Habitat Management Area
(HMA) exclosure will be closed.


Vehicular use of the existing roads and trails in the area is causing unacceptable levels of damage to these plants
and their limited habitat adjacent to the roads and trails. Unauthorized vehicular use off these roads is also impacting
the species. Due to the extremely small population number, and the fragile nature of the plant, damage from vehicular
activity could be causing irreversible impacts to the species.
The 

Arabis pusilla

 Habitat Management Plan calls for elimination of all motorized vehicle activity within the HMA exclosure.




</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Monitoring of the Habitat Management Area has revealed that violations of the ``existing road and trail'' ORV designation
commonly occurs and causes adverse impacts to the species.




The emergency closure applies to all BLM administered public lands within the 

Arabis pusilla

 Habitat Management Area located approximately 20 miles southwest of the town of South Pass, Wyoming, in T29N, R101W,
sections 26, 27 and 35, Sixth Principle Meridian. The closure prohibits use of all mechanized motorized and nonmotorized
vehicles within the habitat management area, with the exception of:
(1) Any Federal, State, or local officers engaged in fire, military, emergency, or law enforcement activities.

(2) BLM employees engaged in official duties.
Authority for closure orders is provided under 43 CFR Subpart 8364.1. Violations of this closure are punishable by
a fine not to exceed $1,000 and/or imprisonment not to exceed 12 months.

SUMMARY: 

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service announces the availability for public review of a draft Recovery Plan for the Dismal

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Background



Restoring an endangered or threatened animal or plant to the point where it is again a secure, self-sustaining member
of its ecosystem is a primary goal of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's endangered species program. To help guide
the recovery effort, the Service is working to prepare Recovery Plans for most of the listed species native to the United
States. Recovery Plans describe actions considered necessary for conservation of the species, establish criteria
for the recovery levels for downlisting or delisting them, and estimate time and cost for implementing the recovery
measures needed.

The Endangered Species Act of 1973 (Act), as amended (16 U.S.C. 1531 

et seq

.) requires the development of Recovery Plans for listed species unless such a Plan would not promote the conservation
of a particular species. Section 4(f) of the Act, as amended in 1988, requires that public notice and an opportunity
for public review and comment be provided during Recovery Plan development. The Service will consider all information
presented during a public comment period prior to approval of each new or revised Recovery Plan. The Service and other
Federal agencies will also take these comments into account in the course of implementing Recovery Plans.

The document submitted for review is the draft Dismal Swamp Southeastern Shrew (

Sorex longirostris fisheri

) Recovery Plan. This new subspecies, listed as threatened in 1986, is known to occur within the Great Dismal Swamp
of Virginia and North Carolina. Originally extending over 2200 square miles, the swamp now comprises fewer than 320
square miles. Some 189 square miles of habitat are protected within the Great Dismal Swamp National Wildlife Refuge
and adjacent North Carolina State Park land.

Known habitat outside Refuge and Park boundaries is being list to agriculture, silviculture, and urbanization.
Within the Refuge, changes in the swamp's hydrologic regime are resulting in succession to a more mesic habitat type,
possibly allowing invasion by an upland subspecies (

Sorex longirostris longirostris

), which could ultimately result in genetic extinction of 

S.1. fisheri

 through interbreeding.

New findings indicate that the Dismal Swamp southeastern shrew may be more widespread than previously thought; this
possibility is taken into account by defining dual recovery objectives: (1) To confirm that this shrew subspecies
is widely distributed throughout the coastal plain of southeastern Virginia and northeastern North Carolina and
is relatively free from threats; or (2) to perpetuate self-sustaining Dismal Swamp southeastern shrew populations
within more restricted areas in the wild. The attainment of either of these objectives would enable the shrew's removal
from the Federal list of endangered and threatened wildlife and plants.

Conditions that must be met to delist the Dismal Swamp southeastern shrew include either (1) confirmation of the shrew's
range, and, if studies confirm that it is restricted to areas of the Great Dismal Swamp; (2) maintenance of six ``shrew
conservation areas'' of at least 5,000 acres each; (3) management of hydrological conditions within shrew habitat;
(4) effective long-term management of other factors affecting the species; and (5) sufficient data to indicate that
``genetic swamping'' by 

S.1. fisheri

 is not occurring.

These conditions will be met through distributional and taxonomic studies, hydrological studies, implementation
of management beneficial to the shrew within Refuge and Park boundaries, protection of shrew habitat outside Refuge
boundaries, and a public information program.

The draft Recovery Plan is being submitted for agency review. After consideration of comments received during the
review period, the Plan will be submitted for final approval.



Public Comments Solicited



The Service solicits written comments on the Recovery Plan described. All comments received by the date specified
above will be considered prior to approval of the Plan.

<DOCTITLE>Privacy Act of 1974_Deletion of Notice of System of Records</DOCTITLE>



Pursuant to the provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended (5 U.S.C. 552a), notice is hereby given that the Department
of the Interior is deleting from its inventory of Privacy Act systems of records a notice describing records maintained
by the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement. The system of records notice being abolished is entitled
``Applicant/Violator System (AVS)_Interior, OSMRE-9'' It was previously published in the 

Federal Register

 on November 16, 1989 (54 FR 47734). A review of the system of records has determined that the records are not subject
to the Privacy Act.

The review was prompted by an opinion issued by the General Counsel, Office of Management and Budget (OMB), on August
30, 1988, affirming OMB's 1975 guidelines which interpreted the statutory term ``individual'' to exclude natural
persons acting in an entrepreneurial capacity from the coverage of the Privacy Act. A review of the Applicant/ Violator
System conducted by the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement indicated that the records contain
information about persons in their entrepreneurial capacity and not in their capacity as individuals. Therefore,
the notice is being deleted from the Department's compilation of Privacy Act systems of records notices.

This change shall be effective on publication in the 

Federal Register

. Additional information regarding this action may be obtained from the Departmental Privacy Act Officer, Office
of the Secretary, Office of Administrative Services, 1849 ``C'' Street NW., Mail Stop 5412 MIB, Washington, DC 20240,

<USDEPT>INTERSTATE COMMERCE COMMISSION</USDEPT>





The Indiana Rail Road Company and CSX Transportation, Inc._Joint Relocation Project Exemption_in Bloomington,
Monroe County, IN 


On July 11, 1994, The Indiana Rail Road Company (INRD) filed a notice of exemption under 49 CFR 1180.2(d)(5) to relocate
a line of railroad. The transaction, which is the subject of ongoing agreements among INRD, CSX Transportation, Inc.
(CSXT), and the City of Bloomington, IN, is to be consummated either by July 21, 1994, or at a later date to be agreed upon
in writing among the parties. 
The project involves INRD's relocating a portion of its Bloomington Southern Branch track and operations in Bloomington,
Monroe County, IN, from the present location to a nearby track owned and operated by CSXT. The relocation of operations
covers 3.05 miles on the CSXT line. INRD and CSXT propose to consolidate rail traffic over the CSXT line extending from
the CSXT-INRD ``Uptown Connection'' between the CSXT line and INRD's main east-west line to the CSXT McDoel
Yard connection to INRD's Southern Branch near Country Club Road. As part of the relocation INRD will remove a 1.2 mile
portion of its Southern Branch track extending south from INRD's main line. INRD trains will operate over the CSXT
track to reach industry located on the Southern Branch in southwestern Bloomington. INRD states that a trackage agreement
is being formalized with CSXT and copies will be filed with the Commission when the agreement is completed. 
The line relocation project will eliminate excess and duplicate railroad facilities, remove unnecessary railroad-street
crossings, and furnish the City of Bloomington with a needed roadway corridor to be accomplished by the removal of
INRD track. INRD asserts that service to shippers will not be affected. 
The Commission will exercise jurisdiction over the abandonment component of a relocation project, and require separate
approval or exemption, only where the proposal involves, for example, a change in service to shippers, expansion
into new territory, or a change in existing competitive situations. See, generally, Denver & R.G.W.R. Co._Jt.
Proj._Relocation over BN, 4 I.C.C.2d 95 (1987). The Commission has determined that line relocation projects may
embrace trackage rights transactions such as the one involved here. See D.T.& I.R._Trackage Rights, 363 I.C.C.
878 (1981). Under these standards, the embraced incidental trackage rights component requires no separate approval
or exemption when the relocation project, as here, will not disrupt service to shippers and thus qualifies for the
class exemption at 49 CFR 1180.2(d)(5). 
As a condition to the use of this exemption, any employees affected by the trackage rights agreement will be protected
by the conditions in 

Norfolk and Western Ry. Co._Trackage Rights_BN, 

354 I.C.C. 605 (1978), as modified in Mendocino Coast Ry., Inc._Lease and Operate, 360 I.C.C. 653 (1980). 
Petitions to revoke the exemption under 49 U.S.C. 10505(d) may be filed at any time. The filing of a petition to revoke
will not stay the transaction. Pleadings must be filed with the Commission and served on INRD's counsel: John H. Doeringer,
20180 Governors Highway, Olympia Fields, IL 60461. 



Decided: July 14, 1994.

<DOCTITLE>Lodging of Consent Decree Modification Pursuant to the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and
Liability Act (``CERCLA'')</DOCTITLE>



In accordance with Departmental policy, notice is hereby given that a proposed Modification to Consent Decree with
an Intervening Plaintiff and the Defendants in 

United States 

v. 

Raymark Industries, Inc., et al.,

 C.A. No. 85-3073 (E.D. Pa.), was lodged on June 29, 1994, with the United States District Court for the Eastern
District of Pennsylvania. This proposed Modification to Consent Decree conforms the remedy for certain groundwater
contamination affecting municipal drinking water wells in Hatboro Borough, Pennsylvania to the remedy chosen by
the United States Environmental Protection Agency (``EPA'') in its Record of Decision (``ROD'') to abate groundwater
contamination at and under a Site located at Jacksonville Road, Hatboro Borough commonly referred to as the ``Raymark
Site.'' The original Consent Decree was entered prior to EPA's publication of the ROD and required the Hatboro Borough
Municipal Authority (which had been compensated under the Decree by Defendants' payments of $612,500) to perform
pumping and treating of water at a location different than that later set forth in the ROD. Under the proposed Modification
to Decree, Hatboro will remain responsible for performing work which ultimately will exhaust the $612,500 it received
under the Decree, as well as interest earned on those funds. EPA will perform all other remedial measures, using Superfund
money.
The Department of Justice will receive, for a period of thirty (30) days from the date of this publication, comments
relating to the proposed Consent Decree Modification. Comments should be addressed to the Assistant Attorney General
for the Environment and Natural Resources Division, Department of Justice, Washington, DC 20530, and should refer
to 

United States 

v. 

Raymark Industries, Inc., et al.,

 DOJ Ref. 

#

90-11-2-12.

The proposed Modification to Consent Decree may be examined at the Office of the United States Attorney for the Eastern
District of Pennsylvania, 615 Chestnut Street, 12th Floor, suite 1200, Philadelphia Life Building, Philadelphia,
Pennsylvania 19107; the Region III Office of the Environmental Protection Agency, 801 Chestnut Building, Philadelphia,
Pennsylvania 19107; and at the Consent Decree Library, 601 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20044, 202-347-2072.
A copy of the proposed Modification to Consent Decree may be obtained in person or by mail from the Consent Decree Library,
601 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW., Box 1097, Washington, DC 20044. In requesting a copy of the proposed Modification and
accompanying Amended Work Plan (Appendix A to the Modification), please refer to the referenced case and enclose
a check in the amount of $9.00 (25 cents per page reproduction costs), payable to the Consent Decree Library. Please
enclose an additional $19.25 should you wish to order a copy of the ROD (Appendix B).

Company for past and future response costs incurred and to be incurred at the site for a payment by Berwind Land Company
of $75,000 to the United States. Shaffer Equipment Company and Berwind Land Company agree in the consent decrees to
provide access to the United States to their property at the site for any future response actions. The consent decree
with Johns Hopkins University resolves claims against Johns Hopkins University for past and future response costs
incurred and to be incurred at the Site for a payment by Johns Hopkins University of $50,000 to the United States.

The Department of Justice will receive comments relating to the proposed consent decrees for a period of thirty days
from the date of publication of this notice. Comments should be addressed to the Assistant Attorney General of the

<DOCTITLE>Records Schedules; Availability and Request for Comments</DOCTITLE>


<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

National Archives and Records Administration, Office of Records Administration.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of availability of proposed records schedules; request for comments.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) publishes notice at least once monthly of certain Federal
agency requests for records disposition authority (records schedules). Records schedules identify records of
sufficient value to warrant preservation in the National Archives of the United States. Schedules also authorize
agencies after a specified period to dispose of records lacking administrative, legal, research, or other value.
Notice is published for records schedules that (1) propose the destruction of records not previously authorized
for disposal, or (2) reduce the retention period for records already authorized for disposal. NARA invites public
comments on such schedules, as required by 44 USC 3303a(a).


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Each year U.S. Government agencies create billions of records on paper, film, magnetic tape, and other media. In order
to control this accumulation, agency records managers prepare records schedules specifying when the agency no longer
needs the records and what happens to the records after this period. Some schedules are comprehensive and cover all
the records of an agency or one of its major subdivisions. These comprehensive schedules provide for the eventual
transfer to the National Archives of historically valuable records and authorize the disposal of all other records.
Most schedules, however, cover records of only one office or program or a few series of records, and many are updates
of previously approved schedules. Such schedules also may include records that are designated for permanent retention.


Destruction of records requires the approval of the Archivist of the United States. This approval is granted after
a thorough study of the records that takes into account their administrative use by the agency of origin, the rights
of the Government and of private persons directly affected by the Government's activities, and historical or other
value.
This public notice identifies the Federal agencies and their subdivisions requesting disposition authority, includes
the control number assigned to each schedule, and briefly describes the records proposed for disposal. The records
schedule contains additional information about the records and their disposition. Further information about the
disposition process will be furnished to each requester.

I. Background 



The terms ``compatible'' and ``adequate'' constitute core concepts in the Commission's Agreement State program
under Section 274 of the Atomic Energy Act (AEA) of 1954, as amended, in 1959. Subsection 274d. states that the Commission
shall enter into an Agreement under subsection b., discontinuing NRC's regulatory authority over certain materials
in a State, if the State's program is both adequate to protect public health and safety and compatible with the Commission's
regulatory program. Subsection 274g. authorizes and directs the Commission to cooperate with the States in the formulation
of standards to assure that State and Commission standards will be coordinated and ``compatible.'' Subsection 274(j)(1)
requires the Commission to periodically review the Agreements and actions taken by the States under the Agreements
to ensure compliance with the provisions of section 274. Although the terms ``compatible'' and ``adequate'' are
fundamental requirements in the Agreement State program under Section 274 of the AEA, these terms are not defined
in the Act. Neither has the Commission provided a formal definition or formal comprehensive guidance on how the terms
should be interpreted in implementing Section 274. The guiding concept over the years since the beginning of the Agreement
State program in the area of compatibility has been to encourage uniformity to the maximum extent practicable while
allowing flexibility, where possible, to accommodate local regulatory concerns. This concept has been implemented
in case-by-case decisions by the Commission and in internal procedures developed by the staff to assign designations
of degrees of ``compatibility'' (i.e. uniformity), from ``essentially verbatim'' to ``no degree of uniformity
required,'' to sections of the Commission's regulations. More recently, the Commission has attempted to involve
the States earlier in the process of developing new regulations and determining what level of ``compatibility''
(i.e. uniformity) will be required of the Agreement States. 
The Commission's approach to making compatibility determinations has evolved slowly over the life of the Agreement
State program. At the same time, since 1962, the Agreement State program has expanded and developed significantly
both in the number of Agreement States, as well as depth of experience and expertise of State regulators. To clarify
the matter of compatibility, the Commission has directed the staff to develop a comprehensive interpretation and
application of compatibility.

On April 2, 1993, the Commission directed the staff to develop a compatibility policy for all program areas other than
low level radioactive waste. While developing the policy, the staff participated in discussions with the Agreement
States, the non-Agreement States, the regulated community, and the general public. A working group was formed and
a draft issues paper was developed. The draft issues paper was discussed with the Agreement States in a public meeting
in May 1993 and draft options, SECY-93-290, were discussed in October 1993 at the All Agreement States
Meeting. The Agreement and non-Agreement States, the regulated community and the general public participated in
a public workshop on the final issues paper in July 1993. 



Results of Discussions With Various Groups 


A. States 



The States would like to see a minimum number of requirements for compatibility determinations. From the comments
at the July 1993 public workshop and during the October 1993 All Agreement States Meeting in Tempe, Arizona, the following
positions, though not a formal consensus, emerged: 

The States are in favor of: 


1. uniformity of requirements that are necessary to assure interstate commerce, i.e., labels, signs and symbols.

2. uniformity of radiation standards necessary to protect public health and safety. However, States want the flexibility
to set stricter dose limits when local conditions warrant them. 


3. early and substantive involvement in the deliberations on the development of regulations. 



B. Regulated Community 


The regulated community desires strict adherence to uniform national radiation standards so that licensees meet
the same standards in all States and will not be subject to different regulations in different States. 


C. Environmental Group 


An environmental advocacy group indicated that Federal and State regulations should be the minimum requirements
with the proviso that communities may have the flexibility to go beyond those regulations. 
In the formulation of this draft policy statement, the staff has carefully considered the views of the Agreement States,
the regulated community, the environmental group and other members of the public. 


II. Discussion 


The question posed by the current task to develop a compatibility policy centers on making a determination of what
components or elements of a State radiation control program are needed beyond those which establish and maintain
an adequate radiation control program. Presently, adequacy of Agreement State programs is only applied to program
elements in terms of their direct or indirect bearing on public health and safety and compatibility is only applied
to the degree of conformity between State regulations and NRC's regulations. However, staff believes that some regulations
should be a matter of adequacy to protect public health and safety and some program elements should be a matter of compatibility.
In order to fully understand this concept, the relationship between adequacy and compatibility must be examined.

Section 274 of the Atomic Energy Act requires that Agreement State programs be both ``adequate to protect the public
health and safety'' and ``compatible with the Commission's program.'' Thus, under the proposed compatibility policy,
these separate findings must be based on consideration of two different objectives; first, providing for an acceptable
level of protection for public health and safety in an Agreement State (the ``adequacy'' component), and second,
providing for the overall national interest in radiation protection, (the ``compatibility'' component). An ``adequate''
program, including regulations or other legally binding measures (e.g., license conditions) and program elements
(e.g., organization and resources) should consist of those attributes considered necessary by the Commission to
maintain an acceptable level of protection of the public health and safety within the Agreement State. A ``compatible''
program, including radiation protection standards and other program elements, should consist of those attributes
considered necessary by the Commission to meet a larger national interest in radiation protection. The requirements
for adequacy would focus on the protection of public health and safety within a particular State, whereas the requirements
for compatibility would focus on the extraterritorial effect of State action or inaction either on other States or
on the national program for radiation protection. As a basis for determining what ultimately will be required for
compatibility, the Commission must first identify what is necessary for a State program to be ``adequate.''

A. Adequate 


Under the draft policy, ``adequate'' would focus on those elements of a State program that are necessary to provide
a level of protection of the public health and safety within the State that is equivalent to, or greater than, that provided
by the NRC regulatory program for its licensees. The requirements for ``adequate'' would not require that NRC regulations
or other program elements be incorporated in an essentially identical manner. Under the adequate provision, States
would also be allowed to establish requirements through measures other than regulations, such as license conditions.



B. Compatibility 


The ``compatibility'' requirement would focus on those elements of a State program which would be required to be essentially
identical with the NRC regulatory framework in order to achieve a larger national interest beyond that required for
adequate protection of the public health and safety within the State. The draft policy establishes four criteria

1

 that the NRC would use to determine which elements of the NRC regulatory program, including specific NRC regulations,
that the State would be required to incorporate in an essentially identical manner into its regulatory program. The
dose limits and radiation-protection related release limits in 10 CFR Part 20 and 10 CFR Part 61 applicable to all licensees,
or any subsequent amendments thereto, or other NRC regulations which are required to be essentially identical for
compatibility purposes will automatically be required to be identical.

2

 States will not have the flexibility to deviate from the program elements that the Commission requires for compatibility.






C. Compatibility and Adequacy Determination of Agreement States 


The staff has developed a management directive for the use of common performance indicators in review of the Agreement
States and regional materials program. The development of the common performance indicators for the evaluation
of Agreement States and the NRC regional offices will be directly related to adequacy requirements for Agreement
State programs, and consequently, will need to be closely coordinated with the staff efforts to define the elements
of an adequate State program. In January 1994, the staff provided to the Commission a paper further describing the
use of common performance indicators in NRC region and Agreement State reviews. The staff is currently implementing
a pilot program on the common performance indicators program. The current proposed common performance indicators
program contemplates using a Management Review Board (MRB) to make the decision on the adequacy of existing Agreement
State programs. The initial adequacy determination of a proposed new Agreement State program will be made by the Office
of State Programs, rather than the MRB, because the adequacy of a proposed new program is not dependent on effectiveness
of actual program implementation. The staff plans to follow this same split of responsibilities for the compatibility
determination of an Agreement State program, with the MRB making the compatibility determinations for existing
Agreement State programs, and the Office of State Programs making the initial compatibility determinations for
proposed new programs. The initial adequacy and compatibility determinations for proposed new Agreement State
programs are reviewed and approved by the Commission. Indicators of compatibility will also be developed by the staff.

D. Termination of Agreements 


Termination of an Agreement can occur when an Agreement State program is either inadequate or incompatible. The proposed
MRB, reviewing discrete common performance indicators, would judge the overall adequacy of an Agreement State program.
Similarly, the MRB would review discrete ``compatibility indicators'' and determine the overall compatibility
of an Agreement State program. For either of the adequacy or compatibility determination, failure to satisfy an individual
indicator may not necessarily result in an overall finding of inadequacy or incompatibility. In some situations,
individual indicator weakness(es) could result in a ``marginal'' finding by the MRB calling for Agreement State
improvements and the State program may be placed on probation. In extreme cases, indicator(s) failure could lead
to inadequate or incompatible findings resulting in the initiation of program suspension or termination. In terms
of the compatibility evaluation, the significance of performance indicator ``incompatibility'' in an individual
State will be judged on the basis of the impact on the national program. 


E. Specific Questions for Public Comment 


In responding to this notice, the following questions should be specifically addressed along with any additional
comments. 
1. Under what circumstances should Agreement States be permitted to establish more stringent requirements, for
their licensees, than those established by the Commission? Should this also include the ability to establish stricter
dose limits for particular classes of licensees? 
2. Are the four criteria in the proposed policy statement for determining whether a Commission regulation or other
program element should be adopted in a manner essentially identical by the Agreement States sufficient to ensure
protection of the national interest in radiation protection? What examples could be used to illustrate how each criterion
would be applied? 
3. What are some examples of State action to establish stricter requirements than those established by the Commission,
or establish requirements where the NRC has not? 
4. What limits, if any, should be placed on the power of a State to preclude or, by exceptionally stringent regulations,
effectively preclude a particular practice? 
5. Are there any other dose or radiation-protection related release limits in the Commission's regulations which
should be included under the criterion number 3 of the compatibility criteria? Should the dose limits contained in
10 CFR Part 61 be included under this criterion? 
6. Should the draft adequacy and compatibility policy statement be applicable to the regulation of low-level waste
disposal instead of continuing to consider questions of compatibility in this area on a case-by-case basis? 
7. Are there currently areas or situations in Agreement State regulations or other Agreement State requirements
that would not meet the proposed policy statement? 
8. Should States be permitted to establish more stringent standards for radiation-protection related release limits?



III. Policy Statement 


The purpose of this Policy Statement is to provide a comprehensive interpretation and application of the terms ``adequate''
and ``compatible'' as they apply to the NRC Agreement State regulatory programs. 
The terms ``compatible'' and ``adequate'' constitute core concepts in the Commission's Agreement State program
under Section 274 of the Atomic Energy Act (AEA) of 1954, as amended, in 1959. Subsection 274d. states that the Commission
shall enter into an Agreement under subsection b., discontinuing NRC's regulatory authority over certain materials
in a State, if the State's program is both adequate to protect public health and safety and compatible with the Commission's
regulatory program. Subsection 274g. authorizes and directs the Commission to cooperate with the States in the formulation
of standards to assure that State and Commission standards will be coordinated and ``compatible.'' Subsection 274j(1)
requires the Commission to periodically review the Agreements and actions taken by the States under the Agreements
to insure compliance with the provisions of section 274. 


A. Definitions 


For the purpose of evaluating the adequacy of Agreement State regulatory programs to protect public health and safety,
the following terms are defined: 


1. Adequate 


The acceptable level of protection for the public health and safety from the radiation hazards associated with the
use of byproduct, source, and special nuclear materials.

2. An Adequate Agreement State Program 


An effectively implemented regulatory program containing elements considered necessary by the Commission to provide
an acceptable level of protection for the public health and safety from the radiation hazards associated with the
use of byproduct, source, and special nuclear materials. 


3. Compatible 


The consistency between NRC and Agreement State regulatory programs which is needed for the regulation of byproduct,
source and special nuclear material which assures an orderly and effective regulatory pattern in the administration
of the national radiation protection program. Compatibility shall be aimed at ensuring that interstate commerce
is not impeded, that effective communication in the radiation protection field is maintained, that dose limits and
radiation-protection related release limits applicable to all licensees are maintained, and that information
needed for the study of trends in radiation protection and other national program needs is obtained. 


4. A Compatible Agreement State Program 


A regulatory program containing elements considered necessary by the Commission to effectively implement the term
``compatible'' as defined above. 


5. Element 


``Element'' or ``program element'' is used to describe any of the essential components and functions of a radiation
protection regulatory program. The term includes any aspect of a radiation protection regulatory program that is
necessary to implement a program that is adequate to protect public health and safety and is compatible with the NRC
regulatory program. The term ``element'' may include organizational structure, staffing level, inspection frequency,
regulations, policies and procedures or any other component or function that the Commission considers necessary.



6. Practice 


The term ``practice'' describes a use, procedure or activity associated with the application, possession, storage
or disposal of byproduct, source and special nuclear materials. The term ``practice'' is very broad and encompassing
in nature. For example, the term ``practice,'' as applied in the policy statement, not only applies to very general
activities involving radioactive materials such as industrial radiography, low-level waste disposal, nuclear
medicine procedures, and well logging, but also includes specific activities conducted within these very broad
activities, such as shallow land burial, sanitary sewerage disposal, and incineration of materials. 


7. Radiation Protection Standards 


As used in this Policy Statement, the term ``radiation protection standards'' means dose limits and radiation-protection
related release limits in 10 CFR Part 20 and 10 CFR Part 61 applicable to all licensees, or any subsequent amendments
thereto. 


B. Elements of an Adequate Program 


1. Protection 


The Agreement State program shall be designed and administered to protect the public health and safety of its citizens
against radiation hazards. 


2. Regulations 


Except for dose limits and radiation-protection related release limits in 10 CFR Part 20 and 10 CFR Part 61 applicable
to all licensees, or any subsequent amendments thereto, or other regulations which are required to be essentially
identical for compatibility purposes, an Agreement State program shall adopt regulations or other legally binding
measures, equivalent to, or more stringent than, those designated by the NRC.

3. Inspection 


The State regulatory program shall provide for the inspection of the possession and use of radioactive materials
by the regulatory authority. The State inspection of licensee facilities, equipment, procedures and use of materials
shall provide reasonable assurance that the public health and safety is being protected. Inspection and testing
shall be conducted to assist in determining compliance with regulatory requirements. Frequency of inspection shall
be related directly to the hazards associated with amount and kind of material and type of operation licensed. The
minimum inspection frequency, including initial inspections, shall be no less than the NRC inspection frequency.
An adequate inspection program includes: preparation and use of procedures and policy memoranda to assure technical
quality in the inspection program and review of inspection actions by senior staff or supervisors. The inspection
staff technical expertise should be similar to NRC staff qualifications. 


4. Enforcement Program 


Licensee noncompliance with requirements necessary for the safe possession and use of radioactive materials shall
be subject to enforcement through legal sanctions, and the regulatory authority shall be authorized by law with the
necessary powers for prompt enforcement. 


5. Staffing and Personnel Qualifications 


The regulatory agency shall be sufficiently staffed with an adequate number of qualified personnel to implement
the radiation control program effectively. Agreement State staff shall be qualified using criteria no less stringent
than criteria used for NRC staff. 


6. Administrative Procedures 


State practices for assuring the effective administration of the radiation control program, including provisions
for public participation where appropriate, shall be incorporated in procedures for: 
(a) Formulation of rules of general applicability; 
(b) Approving or denying applications for licenses authorizing the possession and use of radioactive materials;
and 
(c) Taking enforcement actions. 


7. Statutes 


State statutes and/or duly promulgated regulations shall be established to authorize the State to carry out the requirements
under Section 274b of the Atomic Energy Act, as amended and any other statutes as appropriate, such as Public Law 95-604,
Uranium Mill Tailings Radiation Control Act (UMTRCA). 


8. Laboratory Support 


The State shall have available calibrated field and laboratory instrumentation sufficient to independently determine
the licensee's control of materials, to validate the licensee's measurements, and to respond to events involving
radioactive material. 


9. Licensing 


The State regulatory program review of license applications for the purpose of evaluating the applicant's qualifications,
facilities, equipment, procedures and use of materials shall provide reasonable assurance that the public health
and safety are being protected. An adequate licensing program includes: preparation and use of licensing guides
and policy memoranda to assure technical quality in the licensing program and review of licensing actions by senior
staff or supervisors. In addition, procedures involving the licensing of products containing radioactive material
intended for interstate commerce should require a high degree of uniformity with those of the NRC. The review staff
technical expertise should be similar to NRC staff qualifications. 


10. Investigation (Response to Events) 


The State regulatory program shall provide for timely and effective investigation of incidents, reportable events,
allegations and any potential wrongdoing.

11. Budget 



The State radiation control program (RCP) shall have adequate budgetary support to implement an effective program.
The total RCP budget must provide adequate funds for salaries, training, travel costs associated with the compliance
program, laboratory and survey instrumentation and other equipment, contract services, and other administrative
costs. 



C. Elements of a Compatible Program 



1. Radiation Labels, Signs, and Symbols 



States must have radiation labels, signs and symbols identical to that of the national standard. 



2. Uniform Manifest 



State regulatory programs shall establish a manifest system in accordance with 10 CFR Part 20. 



3. Transportation Regulations 



State regulations regarding transportation of radioactive materials must be identical or essentially verbatim
with those in 10 CFR Part 71. 



4. Event Reporting 



The State regulatory program shall require licensee reporting in a manner so that information on identical type events
is consistent with the reporting established by the NRC. This information shall be provided to the NRC. 



5. Reciprocity 



The State regulatory program shall have reciprocal recognition of out-of-State licensees and Federal licensees
through a process which authorizes the safe conduct of similar operations within the Agreement State. 



6. Records and Reports 



The State regulatory program shall require that holders and users of radioactive materials (a) maintain records
covering personnel radiation exposures, radiation surveys and disposal of materials, (b) keep records of the receipt
and transfer of the material, (c) maintain reports of significant incidents involving radioactive materials. 



7. Radiation Protection Terminology 



The State regulatory program shall adopt fundamental radiation protection terminology in a manner essentially
identical to NRC definition of these terms to ensure clear communication about radiation protection. Some examples
of these terms are ``byproduct material;'' ``total effective dose equivalent;'' ``sievert;'' ``gray;'' and ``becquerel.''




8. Radiation Protection Standards 



The State regulatory program shall adopt dose limits and radiation-protection related release limits in 10 CFR Part
20, and 10 CFR Part 61 applicable to all licensees, or any subsequent amendments thereto. 



D. Compatibility Criteria 



The following criteria shall be applied to program elements and regulations to determine whether they must be adopted
by Agreement States in a manner essentially identical to that of the NRC for the purposes of compatibility: 

1. avoids a significant burden on interstate commerce; 

2. ensures clear communication on fundamental radiation protection terminology; 

3. ensures the establishment of the dose limits and radiation-protection related release limits in 10 CFR Part 20
and 10 CFR Part 61 applicable to all licensees, or any subsequent amendments thereto; 

4. assists the Commission in evaluating the effectiveness of the overall national program for radiation protection.


If none of the above criteria is met, the State would have the flexibility to design its own program including incorporating
more stringent

3

 requirements provided that: 





a. the requirements for adequacy are still met; and 

b. the more stringent requirements do not preclude or effectively preclude a practice within the national interest
without an adequate public health and safety or environmental basis.

<DOCNO> FR940721-2-00114 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940721-2-00065 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

E. Implementation 



Notwithstanding the provisions above, the Agreement States shall exercise their regulatory authority in a responsible
manner and shall not adopt more stringent regulations or requirements as a means to bar or preclude a practice without
an adequate safety or environmental basis, or bar a practice needed in the national interest. In order to permit the
NRC to provide early coordination and oversight of any proposed more stringent regulations or requirements, NRC
will request Agreement States to identify any such regulations or requirements and provide opportunity for NRC review
before publication as a draft rule for comment or before the institution of the requirement as a legally binding measure.




F. Examples

4

 for the Compatibility Criteria 





1. Avoids a Significant Burden on Interstate Commerce



_The adoption of transportation requirements for all Agreement States should be essentially identical to assure
that the flow of radioactive materials in or through another jurisdiction is not impeded. For example, if States were
allowed to change 10 CFR 71.47, ``External Radiation Standards for all Packages'' then it would be very difficult
to transport radioactive material packages. 



2. Ensures Clear Communication on Fundamental Radiation Protection Terminology
 


_The definition of the terms ``sievert'' and ``gray'' (or ``rem,'' ``rad'') would need to be adopted essentially
identically by all Agreement States. 



3. Ensures the Establishment of Dose Limits and Radiation-Protection Related Release Limits in 10 CFR Part 20 and
10 CFR Part 61 Applicable to all Licensees, or Any Subsequent Amendments Thereto



_The basic dose limits and radiation-protection related release limits for all classes of licensees set forth in
Subpart C, ``Occupational Dose Limits,'' and Subpart D, ``Radiation Dose Limits for Individual Members of the Public,''
of 10 CFR Part 20 would need to be adopted essentially identical by all Agreement States along with any other subsequent
amendments to 10 CFR Part 20 that may set forth dose limits. 10 CFR Part 61.41, ``Protection of general population from
releases of radioactivity'' and 10 CFR Part 61.43, ``Protection of individuals during operations'' would also need
to be adopted essentially identically by all Agreement States. 



4. Assists the Commission in Evaluating the Effectiveness of the Overall National Program for Radiation Protection



_The adoption of 10 CFR 35.33, ``Notifications, reports, and records of misadministrations'' would be adopted by
the Agreement States in a manner essentially identical to that of the NRC. 



G. Examples

5

 of More Stringent Requirements 





As noted above, if the State program is equivalent to, or more stringent than, NRC's program to assure the protection
of the public health and safety, and it incorporates all the elements of the NRC program identified by the Commission
as necessary to achieve the national interest in radiation protection, including the requirement to establish regulations
which are uniform with the dose limits and radiation-protection related release limits in 10 CFR Part 20 and 10 CFR
Part 61 applicable to all licensees, or any subsequent amendments thereto, then a State should generally have the
flexibility to tailor its program. More stringent requirements, other than the above mentioned dose limits and radiation-protection
release limits could be applicable to all classes of licensees in a State. For example, an Agreement State's recordkeeping
provisions for all licenses could be more stringent than NRC's. Other examples of State actions which impose stricter
requirements than NRC regulations, and which would be ``adequate'' under the draft policy statement, are_



1. State of Florida_20.304

<DOCNO> FR940721-2-00115 </DOCNO>

<TEXT>
 

Between 1957 and 1981, several State representatives expressed concern to the Commission over the risk from burials
of radioactive waste allowed by 10 CFR 20.304, that was in effect at that time. This regulation, ``Standards for Protection
Against Radiation; Burial of Small Quantities of Radionuclides'' provided that licensees could bury small quantities
of radionuclides without prior NRC approval. The State of Florida submitted a request to the NRC to be more stringent
by precluding this practice within the State because of its high ground water level. The State's exemption request
was reviewed and approved by the NRC. 




2. Shallow Land Burial 




Several States prohibit the practice of shallow land burial of low-level waste. These more stringent regulations
would be allowed under the draft policy statement even though a practice is prohibited. There is no overriding national
interest in allowing shallow land burial of low-level waste. A different result would likely be obtained if disposal
of low-level waste altogether was prohibited, unless the State was able to convince NRC of special public health and
safety or environmental basis for this action. 




3. Texas Industrial Radiography Certification 




Texas has established a program for the certification of industrial radiography that is more rigorous than Commission
requirements. This program requires persons to perform 200 hours of on-the-job training, complete 40 hours of classroom
instruction and successfully complete an examination before receiving authorization to conduct radiographic
services with radioactive materials. (This example is based on the assumption that the training requirements in
10 CFR 34 do not meet any of the four compatible criteria.) 




IV. Paperwork Reduction Act Statement 




This draft statement of policy does not contain a new or amended information collection requirement subject to the
Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (434 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.). Existing requirements were approved by the Office of Management
and Budget, approval number 3150-0029.

<DOCTITLE>The Curators of the University of Missouri-Columbia, Columbia, Missouri; Confirmatory Order Modifying License
(Effective Immediately)</DOCTITLE>


I


The Curators of the University of Missouri-Columbia (Licensee) is the holder of NRC License No. 24-00513-32
issued by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC or Commission) pursuant to 10 CFR Parts 30 and 35. The license authorizes
the Licensee to conduct research and development, instrument calibration, student instruction and medical diagnosis
and therapy. The license was issued on April 6, 1962, was most recently amended on May 11, 1994, and is due to expire on
July 31, 1998.


II


From January 24 through January 28, 1994, the NRC conducted a safety inspection of licensed activities at the University
of Missouri-Columbia. Numerous apparent violations were identified during the inspection. The findings of the
inspection were documented in Inspection Report No. 030-02278/94001(DRSS) issued to the Licensee on February
23, 1994.
The NRC is concerned that the circumstances surrounding the numerous violations reflect inadequate control over
the safe use of licensed material. The Licensee met with the NRC staff during a management meeting on February 24, 1994,
and during an open enforcement conference on February 28, 1994, at the NRC Region III office to review the circumstances
that led to the violations. During the enforcement conference, the Licensee proposed various corrective actions
that could be taken to prevent recurrence of the violations and to ensure compliance with NRC requirements. The Licensee
agreed to submit these proposals to the NRC in writing for review and approval.
In a letter dated March 9, 1994, the NRC concluded its assessment of the inspection findings and issued a Notice of Violation
and Proposed Imposition of Civil Penalty (Notice) in the amount of $5,000. The violations identified during the inspection
are of significant regulatory concern because they indicated that:
 The radiation safety staff and radioactive material users had insufficient knowledge of license conditions
and NRC requirements and an inadequate sense of accountability regarding compliance with radiation safety requirements,
and
 Licensee management was ineffective in completing self-assessments that assured safe program implementation.
The Notice required the Licensee to respond to the specific violations. In addition to that response, the NRC requested
that the Licensee provide a Safety Performance Improvement Program (SPIP) which would result in: (1) A complete and
thorough evaluation of the radiation safety practices and program by qualified persons to determine how the Licensee
is currently complying with NRC regulations and the conditions of the license; (2) a compilation of radiation safety
deficiencies from that effort; (3) a complete root cause analysis of those deficiencies; and (4) a description of
corrective actions to accomplish the improvements necessary for lasting correction of the deficiencies.


III


On April 7, 1994, and May 25, 1994, the Licensee provided written responses to the Notice, including payment of the
$5,000 proposed civil penalty and a description of the SPIP. After discussion of the SPIP with NRC staff on June 14 and
June 17, 1994, the Licensee submitted a revised SPIP to the NRC on June 20, 1994. The Licensee's revised SPIP is divided
into four phases. The Licensee has agreed to follow the specific actions and time milestones outlined in the SPIP.
Phase One of the SPIP involves hiring and directing an independent health physics consulting firm to review the Licensee's
authorized activities and report the findings to the Licensee's management by July 15, 1994.

<TEXT>
 

Phase Two of the SPIP involves assigning specific Radiation Safety Committee (RSC) members and Health Physics staff
members to groups of authorized users to assist users in complying with the licensed program and NRC regulations and
to provide a conduit for reporting the status of licensed activities to Licensee management. The Health Physics staff
will also be assigned segments of the radiation safety program to review and assure compliance with the license and
NRC requirements and, as necessary, draft procedures and associated documentation to implement the program. This
phase will also include: (1) Development of an internal enforcement program that addresses compliance with radiation
safety requirements and establishes protocols for implementing corrective actions; (2) assessment of personnel
training and qualifications; (3) evaluation of laboratory equipment; and (4) development of computerized management
systems. The Licensee also has committed to hire one additional health physicist to assist with the radiation safety
program improvement. Phase Two will be completed by the end of December 1994.
Phase Three of the SPIP involves an ongoing assessment of the corrective actions taken in response to findings in Phases
One and Two, a second independent audit by an outside health physics consultant and annual audits by the RSO and RSC
with reports to the Chancellor, Provost, and Vice Chancellor for Administrative Services. Phase Three will be completed
by the end of December 1995.
Phase Four involves continuing reassessment of the program.
In light of the violations underlying the March 9, 1994 enforcement action, the public health and safety require improvement
of the Licensee's radiation safety program. The NRC staff has reviewed the Licensee's SPIP. I find that the Licensee's
commitments as set forth in its letter of June 20, 1994, are acceptable and necessary and conclude that if these commitments
are effectively implemented the public health and safety are reasonably assured. In view of the foregoing, I have
determined that the public health and safety require that the Licensee's commitments in its June 20, 1994 letter be
confirmed by this Order. The Licensee agreed to the issuance of this Order during a telephone call between Mr. John
A. Grobe, Chief, Nuclear Materials Inspection Section II, Region III, NRC, and Dr. Susan Langhorst, Radiation Safety
Officer, of the Licensee's staff on July 12, 1994. Pursuant to 10 CFR 2.202, I have also determined that, based on the
Licensee's consent to this Order and the significance of the necessary program improvements described above, the
public health and safety require that this Order be immediately effective.


IV


Accordingly, pursuant to sections 81, 161b, 161i, 161o, 182 and 186 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, and
the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 2.202 and 10 CFR Parts 20, 30 and 35, it is hereby ordered that, effective immediately,
license no. 24-00513-32 is modified as follows:
The Licensee shall complete the specific action items within the time limitations stated in the Safety Performance
Improvement Program submitted to the NRC in its letter dated June 20, 1994. If additional time is required to meet a
step, a written request must be submitted with the reason for the request and the new timeframe for completion. Until
approved in writing by the Regional Administrator, Region III, the previously approved schedule must be met.
The Regional Administrator, Region III, may relax or rescind, in writing, any aspect of the above condition upon a
showing by the License of good cause.

Self-Regulatory Organizations; Delta Government Options Corp.; Order Approving Proposed Rule Change Modifying
Exercise Settlement Date and Buy-In Procedures


July 14, 1994.


On December 27, 1993, Delta Government Options Corp. (``DGOC'') filed a proposed rule change (File No. SR-DGOC-94-04)
with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') pursuant to Section 19(b) of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934 (``Act'').
 On February 16, 1994, and on March 4, 1994, DGOC submitted substantive amendments to the filing.
 Notice of the proposal was published in the 

Federal Register

 on May 25, 1994, to solicit comments from interested persons.
 No comments were received. This order approves the proposal.






I. Description of the Proposal


The proposed rule change modifies DGOC's exercise settlement procedures. Under current practice, the exercise
settlement date, depending on certain factors, occurs from two to five business days following the expiration date
or the date on which an exercise notice is tendered. For an option contract on a Treasury bond or a Treasury note exercised
on a day preceding the expiration date, the exercise settlement date is the next business day following the day on which
the exercise notice is properly assigned to a participant. The proposal makes no change to this provision of DGOC's
rules. For an option contract on a Treasury bond or a Treasury note exercised on the expiration date, the exercise settlement
date will now be the next business day following the expiration date for those contracts. Currently, the exercise
settlement date for such contracts is the third business day following the expiration date. Also, under the proposed
rule change, for an option contract on a Treasury bill, the exercise settlement date will be the next business day after
an exercise notice is properly tendered. Currently, the exercise settlement date is Thursday of the week in which
the exercise notice is properly tendered.
In connection with the modifications to the exercise settlement date, DGOC has amended Section 1005 of its Procedures
to provide that DGOC will allocate exercise settlement obligations prior to 8:00 a.m. on the business day prior to
the exercise settlement date. Previously, DGOC allocated exercise settlement obligations on the second business
day prior to the exercise settlement date.
DGOC also has amended Section 1102 of its Procedures to clarify its buy-in process applicable when a participant fails
to make a required delivery of Treasury securities to DGOC. First, upon the request of the participant failing to deliver
and with good cause shown, DGOC is now authorized to defer the execution of a buy-in if Delta has reason to believe that
the delivery default will be cured on that other arrangement adequate to protect Delta's interests have been made.
 Previously, DGOC could defer the execution of a buy-in for no more than twenty-four hours from the time delivery was
due. Second, the timing for the execution of a buy-in has been set forth with specificity. Under the more specific procedures,
DGOC may transmit a notice of buy-in to the participant which failed to deliver after the elapse of thirty calendar
days after the failure to deliver. DGOC must deliver in duplicate a written notice of buy-in no later than 12:00 noon
five business days before the proposed execution date of the buy-in. The amended section also sets forth the information
DGOC must supply to the participant in the buy-in notice.




II. Discussion


The Commission believes that the proposal is consistent with the Act and particularly with Section 17A of the Act.
 Sections 17A(b)(3) (A) and (F) of the Act
 require that the rules of clearing agencies be designed to promote the prompt and accurate clearance and to assure
the safeguarding of funds which are under the custody or control of a clearing agency or for which it is responsible
and to foster cooperation and coordination with persons engaged in the clearance and settlement of securities transactions.




</TEXT>
</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940721-2-00123 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940721-2-00070 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

One purpose of the proposal is to respond to participants who have requested that DGOC's settlement procedures more
closely follow the practices already established in the over-the-counter (``OTC'') marketplace for the settlement
of purchases and sales of Treasury securities and for the settlement of exercised options on such securities. by shortening
DGOC's settlement periods to conform to the industry standards, DGOC will reduce the amount of time such settlement
obligations remain outstanding which in turn will reduce credit exposure to DGOC as well as generally in the settling
of options on Government securities. DGOC's use of the same settlement period as is used in settlement of similar OTC
options will help to ensure a consistent approach among clearing entities and should serve as a platform for additional
coordination among clearing entities clearing identical or complimentary securities.
Because DGOC's current settlement period of two to five business days is longer than the settlement period for similar
OTC products cleared outside of DGOC, DGOC-issued options carry a price adjustment for the additional financing
costs. As a result, the price of DGOC-issued options does not match exactly those of similar OTC-traded options. Implementation
of DGOC's revised settlement procedures will make the relative values of DGOC-issued options comparable to those
of OTC-traded options and will eliminate participants' need to make the additional calculations necessary to correlate
the price of DGOC-issued options with the price of OTC-traded options. Therefore, this proposal should provide participants
greater ease in trading and exercising options issued by DGOC. The proposal also should result in more options on Government
securities being cleared and settled through the automated facilities of DGOC, a registered clearing agency which
participates in the national system for the clearance and settlement of securities transactions. These are options
transactions that otherwise would be cleared through decentralized and labor intensive processes.
In connection with the shorter settlement time frames, the rule change enables DGOC to allocate exercise settlement
obligations prior to 8:00 a.m. on the day prior to settlement and, as noted above, permits accelerated settlement
time frames that are more consistent with settlement of exercised options and settlement of securities in the cash
market. These changes should help DGOC to promote the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of securities
transactions and should foster cooperation and coordination by persons engaged in the clearance and settlement
of securities transactions. The proposal also clarifies DGOC's buy-in procedures while providing DGOC with more
flexibility concerning buy-ins. The Commission believes that these changes improve DGOC's ability to deal with
the risks associated with the failure of a participant to fulfill its delivery obligation. By doing so, the modified
buy-in procedures better enables DGOC to fulfill its statutory obligations to safeguard securities and funds within
its possession or control for which it is responsible.


III. Conclusion


For the reasons discussed above, the Commission believes that the proposal is consistent with the requirements of
the Act, particularly Section 17A of the Act, and the rules and regulations thereunder.
It is therefore ordered, pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act,
 that the above-mentioned proposed rule change (File No. SR-DGOC-93-04) be, and hereby is, approved.





For the Commission by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Notice of Filing of Proposed Rule Change by New York Stock Exchange, Inc., Relating
to Approval of Member Organizations in Other Than Partnership or Corporate Form Under Rule 311(f)</DOCTITLE>



July 15, 1994.




Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby
given that on February 22, 1994, the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (``NYSE'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II and III below, which
Items have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit
comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons.





I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change





The NYSE is proposing to amend Rule 311(f) as follows, with italics representing the language added:









Rule 311







(f) Every member firm shall be a partnership and every member corporation shall be a corporation created or organized
under the laws of, and shall maintain its principal place of business in, the United States or any State thereof. 

The Exchange may, in its discretion, and on such terms and conditions as the Exchange may prescribe, approve as a member
organization entities that have characteristics essentially similar to corporations, partnerships, or both.
Such entities, and persons associated therewith, shall, upon approval, be fully, formally and effectively subject
to the jurisdiction, and to the Constitution and Rules, of the Exchange to the same extent and degree as are any other
member organizations and persons associated therewith.




II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change







In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose
of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text
of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The self-regulatory organization has
prepared summaries, set forth in Sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.









A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change






1. Purpose





The Article 1, Section 3 of the NYSE Constitution states that the term ``member organization'' includes a ``member
firm'' and ``member corporation.'' A ``member firm'' is defined as a partnership.



Recently, the Exchange has received requests from several member organizations to permit them to reorganize as business
trusts or limited liability companies. Neither of these organizational structures is currently specifically included
in the definition of a member organization.



The proposed amendment would enable the Exchange, in its discretion, and on such terms and conditions as the Exchange
may prescribe, to approve business trusts,
 limited liability companies,
 and other organizational structures as member organizations. However, any such entity would be required to have
characteristics essentially similar to corporations or partnerships.






Noncorporate or partnership entities would have to be structured in such a format that would qualify as a broker or
dealer registered with the Commission pursuant to the Act, since this is a prerequisite to becoming an Exchange member
organization.



The NYSE staff would review each application on a case-by-case basis as it does with all member organization applicants.
However, prior to approving any such organization for membership, the staff would have to be satisfied that: (1) the
Exchange would legally have appropriate jurisdiction over such an entity; and (2) the permanency of the entity's
capital is consistent with that required of other member organizations.

<DOCNO> FR940721-2-00125 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940721-2-00071 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

2. Statutory Basis 


The proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6(b)(5) of the Act in that it permits registered brokers or dealers
as set forth herein to become member organizations of the Exchange. 

The proposed rule change is also consistent with Section 6(b)(5) of the Act in that it broadens the types of entities
which the Exchange may approve as a member organization and therefore avoids possible unfair discrimination. 

Finally, it is consistent with Section 6(b)(8) of the Act in that it serves to remove possible burdens on competition
resulting from organizational structure not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act.





B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition



The Exchange believes that the proposed rule change will impose no burden in competition that is not necessary or appropriate
in furtherance of the purposes of the Act.



C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants
or Others 



The Exchange has not solicited, and does not intend to solicit, comments regarding the proposed rule change. The Exchange
has not received any unsolicited written comments from members or other interested parties. 




III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action



Within 35 days of the publication of this notice in the 

Federal Register

 or within such other period (i) as the Commission may designate up to 90 days of such date if it finds such longer period
to be appropriate and publishes its reasons for so finding or (ii) as to which the self-regulatory organization consents,
the Commission will: 

(A) By order approve the proposed rule change, or 
(B) Institute proceedings to determine whether the proposed rule change should be disapproved. 



IV. Solicitation of Comments 



Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street NW., Washington DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying at the Commission's
Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of such filing will also be available
for inspection and copying at the principal office of the NYSE. All submissions should refer to File No. SR-NYSE-94-01
and should be submitted by August 11, 1994.

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Notice of Filing and Order Granting Accelerated Approval of Proposed Rule Change
and Amendment Nos. 1 and 2 by the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc., Relating to Listing of Reduced-Value Long-Term
Options on the National Over-the-Counter Index</DOCTITLE>


July 15, 1994.


Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby
given that on January 12, 1994, the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc. (``PHLX'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (``Commission'' or ``SEC'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I and II below,
which Items have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization.
 The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons.





I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change



The PHLX proposes to amend its rules to list long-term reduced-value options equal to one-tenth the value of the Exchange's
current National Over-the-Counter Index (``Index'' or ``XOC''). Options on the long-term, reduced-value XOC (``reduced-value
XOC'') will have expirations of up to 36 months. For aggregation purposes, 10 reduced-value long-term XOC options
are the equivalent of one full-value XOC contract.

The text of the proposed rule change is available at the Office of the Secretary, PHLX, and at the Commission.



II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change



In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose
of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text
of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The self-regulatory organization has
prepared summaries, set forth in Sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.



A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the proposed Rule Change



1. Description of the Proposal



Since 1985 the PHLX has been trading options on the XOC, a broad-based, capitalization-weighted index comprised
of the 100 largest domestic corporations whose stocks are traded over-the-counter (``OTC'') by at least four market
makers and are not listed on any exchange.
 All of the XOC's component stocks are traded through the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations
(``NASDAQ'') system and are National Market Securities (``NMS''). On February 26, 1991, the Commission approved
a proposed rule change, SR-PHLX-90-38, allowing the Exchange to list long-term options having
up to 36 months to expiration on any of the Exchange's broad-based index options.







The PHLX proposes to list long-term options on a reduced-value XOC index that would be computed at one-tenth the value
of the Exchange's current XOC index. The proposed options will have expirations of up to 36 months. The PHLX believes
that the listing of long-term, reduced-value XOC options will provide retail investors with the opportunity to obtain
long term portfolio protection at an affordable price.



2. Composition of the Index



The XOC is a capitalization-weighted index comprised of the 100 most highly capitalized NMS common stock issues traded
through the NASDAQ system. The XOC, which was developed by the Exchange and is computed by Bridge Data, is comprised
of stocks from approximately thirty industry groups and responds to the general market trends of the OTC market. The
Index is updated every 15 seconds during the trading day. Pursuant to PHLX Rule 1100A, ``Dissemination of Information,''
updated Index values are disseminated and displayed by means of the Consolidated Last Sale Reporting System and the
facilities of the Options Price Reporting Authority (``OPRA''). The closing Index value is published in The Wall
Street Journal and other financial publications.



3. Index Construction and Calculation



In order to keep the XOC current and representative of general market trends in the OTC market, each January and July
the Exchange identifies and ranks the 125 most highly capitalized NMS common stock issues. The stocks included in
the 125 ranking are compared to the issues in the Index, and issue(s) not ranked within the 100 most highly capitalized
issues are deleted from the Index and replaced by the issue(s) which has increased in capitalization since the previous
ranking. Thus, on a semi-annual basis, the XOC is adjusted to reflect changes in the capitalization ranking of NMS
stock issues. In addition, any time a component stock registers on a national securities exchange or is the subject
of a merger or acquisition, the stock is deleted from the Index and replaced by the next highest capitalized issue as
identified in the most current ranking of the 125 most highly capitalized NMS issues. The Index is adjusted to reflect
stock splits and dividends.

</DOC>



<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940721-2-00127 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940721-2-00072 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

In computing the value of the Index, the current market value of each component stock is multiplied by the number of
outstanding shares. The resulting market values are added together to determine the current aggregate market value
of the issues in the Index. To compute the current Index value, the aggregate market value is divided by the base market
value and multiplied by 100. The base value is adjusted periodically to account for changes in capitalization of any
of the component stocks resulting from mergers, acquisitions, listings, and substitutions.



4. Contract Specifications



The proposed long-term reduced-value XOC options will trade independently of an in addition to currently listed
full-value XOC options and will be subject to the same rules that presently govern the trading of full-value XOC options,
including sales practice rules, margin requirements, and floor trading procedures. The strike price intervals
for the proposed options will be fixed at no less than $2.50, and the proposed options will be aggregated with full-value
XOC options for position and exercise limit purposes.

The PHLX has determined that since positions in the full-value XOC options and those in the proposed reduced-value
long-term XOC options are based upon the same underlying stock index, the proposed reduced-value XOC options will
be aggregated with full-value XOC options for position and exercise limit purposes. Accordingly, the PHLX proposes
to amend PHLX Rule 1001A to state that for aggregation purposes, ten reduced-value long-term XOC options are the equivalent
of one full-value XOC contract. Since one full-value XOC contract is equivalent to ten reduced-value XOC contracts,
each reduced-value XOC contract will be considered one-tenth of a full-value XOC contract when the contracts are
aggregated for position and exercise limit purposes.

Thus, under the current XOC position limit of 10,000 contracts, an option holder with no full-size XOC contracts would
be permitted to hold 100,000 reduced-value XOC contracts. Similar to full-value XOC options, the proposed reduced-value
options will feature American-style exercise. The PHLX will continuously calculate and disseminate the underlying
index value for the proposed reduced-value XOC options in addition to the full-value Index.

As a result of the one-tenth reduced-value feature of the proposed options, the reduced-value XOC may vary slightly
from one-tenth of the full-value Index. In this regard, the PHLX intends to adopt the following procedure in rounding
the reduced-value Index: the PHLX will divide the calculated value of the XOC by ten and round the resulting quotient
to the nearest one-hundredth. The digits one through four will be rounded down to the next number and digits five through
nine will be rounded up to the next number.

Upon Commission approval of the proposal, the PHLX intends to list initial long-term option series on the new reduced-value
XOC with December 1995 and December 1996 expirations. While the initial series listings would have less than 36 months
to expiration, thereafter, the PHLX plans to list options with 36-month expirations at each December expiration,
resulting in the introduction of a December 1977 expiration after the December 1994 expiration. Initially, three
strike prices for calls and puts will be listed at and surrounding the prevailing reduced-value XOC option. However,
the Exchange may list only a put or a call if two strike prices are introduced. The Exchange also proposes to list additional
strike prices when the market reaches either the highest or lowest existing strike price. The Exchange believes this
procedure will result in the listing of only a limited number of series for any expiration, thereby eliminating confusion
that might otherwise be caused by a myriad of strike prices and expirations.

The Exchange expects that its proposed policy of listing strike prices on the reduced-value XOC will permit the offering
of options at premiums between $2.00 and $7.00 ($200 to $700 per contract) based upon current market volatility and
other pricing considerations. Such premiums appear to be in the desired range of prices that investors have favored
in trading index warrants. Such premiums could not be achieved by using full-size XOC options without the listing
of strike prices so deeply out of the money and away from the current index value as to offer investors limited ability
to participate in the market or protect a portfolio of primarily OTCV stocks.

The PHLX believes that the proposal is consistent with Section 6 of the Act, in general, and in particular, with Section
6(b)(5), in that it is designed to facilitate transactions in securities and protect investors and the public interest.



B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition



The Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any burden on competition.

C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants
or Others



No written comments were either solicited or received.



III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action



The PHLX has requested that the proposed rule change be given accelerated effectiveness pursuant to Section 19(b)(2)
of the Act.

The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, the requirements of Section
6(b)(5).
 Specifically, the Commission believes that the reduced-value long-term XOC options will benefit investors by providing
them with a valuable hedging and investing vehicle that should reflect accurately the overall movement of the OTC
market and provide investors with additional means to hedge portfolios against long-term market risk at a reduce
cost. The Commission believes that the lower cost of the reduced-value XOC options should allow investors to hedge
their portfolios with a smaller outlay of capital and may facilitate investor participation in the market for XOC
options, which should, in turn, help to maintain the depth and liquidity of the market for XOC options, thereby protecting
investors and the public interest.





The Commission believes that trading in the reduced-value XOC options will not have an adverse market impact or be
susceptible to manipulation.
 The Commission has determined previously that the full-value XOC is a broad-based index
 and does not believe that dividing the XOC by ten changes this determination. The reduced-value XOC index will contain
the same stocks with the same weightings as the XOC and will be calculated in the same manner as the XOC (with the exception
of being one-tenth the value of the XOC). Accordingly, the Commission finds that the reduced-value XOC is a broad-based
index. Moreover, the Commission believes that any potential manipulation concerns raised by the reduced-value
XOC options are minimized by the fact that positions in the reduced-value XOC options and full-value XOC options will
be aggregated for position and exercise limit purposes.
 In addition, the Commission notes that the same Exchange surveillance procedures applied to full-value XOC options
will be used for the reduced-value XOC options.









Because the Exchange's existing rules applicable to stock index options, including, among others, sales practice
rules, margin requirements, and position and exercise limits, will apply to the reduced-value XOC options, the Commission
believes that the market for the reduced-value XOC options should be fair and orderly and does not raise any new customer
protection concerns.

The Commission finds good cause for approving the proposal and Amendment Nos. 1 and 2 prior to the thirtieth day after
the date of publication of notice of filing thereof in the 

Federal Register

. In light of the fact that the Commission has approved proposals by other exchanges to list reduced-value options
on existing indexes, and in light of PHLX rule 1101A(b)(iii), which allows the PHLX to list series of long term options
on stock indexes, the Commission believes that the proposal to list long term reduced-value XOC options presents
no new regulatory issues. In addition, the Commission believes that Amendment Nos. 1 and 2 clarify and strengthen
the Exchange's proposal. Accordingly, the Commission believes that it is consistent with the Act to approve the proposal
and Amendment Nos. 1 and 2 on an accelerated basis.



IV. Solicitation of Comments



Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may withheld from the public
in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying at the Commission's
Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of such filing will also be available
for inspection and copying at the principal office of the PHLX. All submissions should refer to File No. SR-PHLX-94-03
and should be submitted by [insert date 21 days from date of publication].

It is therefore ordered, pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act
 that the proposed rule change (SR-PHLX-94-03) is approved.






For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

Approval of Noise Compatibility Program Kent County International Airport Grand Rapids, Michigan



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Federal Aviation Administration, DOT.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) announces its findings on the noise compatibility program submitted
by Kent County, Michigan, under the provisions of Title I of the Aviation Safety and Noise Abatement Act of 1979 (Pub.
L. 96-193) and 14 CFR Part 150. These findings are made in recognition of the description of Federal and nonfederal
responsibilities in Senate Report No. 96-52 (1980). On October 29, 1993, the FAA determined that the noise exposure
maps submitted by Kent County under Part 150 were in compliance with applicable requirements. On April 26, 1994, the
Assistant Administrator for Airports approved the Kent County International Airport noise compatibility program.



A total of ten (10) measures were included in the Kent County International Airport recommended program. Of the ten
(10) measures, two (2) are ``Program Management,'' three (3) are ``Noise Abatement,'' and five (5) are ``Land Use.''
The FAA gave outright approval for nine (9) measures; the tenth measure was given partial approval.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

This notice announces that the FAA has given its overall approval to the noise compatibility program for Kent County
International Airport, effective April 26, 1994.




Under section 104(a) of the Aviation Safety and Noise Abatement Act of 1979 (hereinafter referred to as ``the Act''),
an airport operator who has previously submitted a noise exposure map may submit to the FAA a noise compatibility program
which sets forth the measures taken or proposed by the airport operator for the reduction of existing noncompatible
land uses and prevention of additional noncompatible land uses within the area covered by the noise exposure maps.
The Act requires such programs to be developed in consultation with interested and affected parties including local
communities, government agencies, airport users, and FAA personnel.

Each airport noise compatibility program developed in accordance with Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) Part
150 is a local program, not a Federal program. The FAA does not substitute its judgment for that of the airport proprietor
with respect to which measures should be recommended for action. The FAA's approval or disapproval of FAR Part 150
program recommendations is measured according to the standards expressed in Part 150 and the Act, and is limited to
the following determinations:

a. The noise compatibility program was developed in accordance with the provisions and procedures of FAR Part 150;

b. Program measures are reasonably consistent with achieving the goals of reducing existing noncompatible land
uses around the airport and preventing the introduction of additional noncompatible land uses;

<DOCNO> FR940721-2-00130 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940721-2-00073 </PARENT>

c. Program measures would not create an undue burden on interstate or foreign commerce, unjustly discriminate against
types or classes of aeronautical uses, violate the terms of airport grant agreements, or intrude into areas preempted
by the Federal Government; and

d. Program measures relating to the use of flight procedures can be implemented within the period covered by the program
without derogating safety, adversely affecting the efficient use and management of the navigable airspace and air
traffic control systems, or adversely affecting other powers and responsibilities of the Administrator prescribed
by law.

Specific limitations with respect to the FAA's approval of an airport noise compatibility program are delineated
in FAR Part 150,  150.5. Approval is not a determination concerning the acceptability of land uses under Federal,
state, or local law. Approval does not by itself constitute an FAA implementing action. A request for Federal action
or approval to implement specific noise compatibility measures may be required, and an FAA decision on the request
may require an environmental assessment of the proposed action. Approval does not constitute a commitment by the
FAA to financially assist in the implementation of the program nor a determination that all measures covered by the
program are eligible for grant-in-aid funding from the FAA. Where federal funding is sought, requests for project
grants must be submitted to the FAA Detroit Airports District Office in Belleville, Michigan.

Kent County submitted to the FAA on May 4, 1992, noise exposure maps, descriptions, and other documentation produced
during the noise compatibility planning study conducted from September 24, 1987 through May 4, 1992. The Kent County
International Airport noise exposure maps were determined by the FAA to be in compliance with applicable requirements
on March 4, 1993. Notice of this determination was published in the Federal Register on March 22, 1993.

The Kent County International Airport study contains a proposed noise compatibility program comprised of actions
designed for phased implementation by airport management and adjacent jurisdictions from the date of study completion
to the year 1995. It was requested that the FAA evaluate and approve this material as a noise compatibility program
as described in section 104(b) of the Act. The FAA began its review of the program on October 29, 1993, and was required
by a provision of the Act to approve or disapprove the program within 180 days (other than the use of new flight procedures
for noise control). Failure to approve or disapprove such program within the 180-day period would have been deemed
to be an approval of such program.

The submitted program contained ten (10) proposed actions for noise mitigation. The FAA completed its review and
determined that the procedural and substantive requirements of the Act and FAR Part 150 have been satisfied. The overall
program, therefore, was approved by the Assistant Administrator for Airports effective April 26, 1994.

Outright approval was granted for nine (9) of the specific program elements. ``Land Use Measure No. 2'' was partially
approved. The measure included non-noise related zoning (height and safety). For the purpose of Part 150, only the
noise zoning was approved. The other approved measures include: Noise Abatement Advisory Committee, Noise Complaint
Program, Noise Abatement Departure Procedures, Greater Percent of Stage 3 Aircraft, Portable Noise Monitoring
Equipment, Comprehensive Land Use Planning and Zoning, Utilize Disclosure Ordinance, Acoustical Treatment/Aviation
Easements, and Purchase Assurance Program.

These determinations are set forth in detail in a Record of Approval endorsed by the Assistant Administrator for Airports
on April 26, 1994. The Record of Approval, as well as other evaluation materials and documents which comprised the
submittal to the FAA, are available for review at the following locations.

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This notice announces the location and dates of public meetings to be held in Houston, TX, and New Orleans, LA, on the
development of the Automated Export System (AES). Dates and locations of further meetings on this subject will be
scheduled and announced in a subsequent notice. These meetings are being held to (1) give Customs managers an opportunity
to provide the public with information related to the development of AES and (2) give attendees an opportunity to ask
questions, make suggestions, and provide Customs with informal ideas related to AES design and functionality. A
notice published by Customs in the 

Federal Register

 on June 13, 1994 (59 FR 30383) announced that the first of these meetings would be held in Washington, D.C. on July 8,
1994. Customs is now announcing that AES meetings will be held in Houston, Texas, on July 27, 1994 and in New Orleans,
Louisiana, on July 28, 1994. Those planning to attend a meeting are requested to so notify Customs in the city where
the meeting will be held in advance.



</SUMMARY>

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

Background 





In a notice published in the 

Federal Register

 on June 13, 1994, (59 FR 30383) Customs announced its intention of developing an Automated Export System (AES) and
informed the public that a series of meetings would be held around the country regarding the AES. That notice provided
information on the first such meeting which was scheduled in Washington, DC. This notice is being issued to inform
the public of the date and time of meetings which will be held in Houston, TX, and New Orleans, LA. 



Since AES is in the very early design stage, the AES Development Team intends to hold a series of public meetings for
the purpose of (1) giving Customs managers an opportunity to provide the public with information related to the development
of AES and (2) giving attendees an opportunity to ask questions, make suggestions, and provide Customs with informal
ideas related to AES design and functionality. Each meeting will open with a short presentation on AES, past, present
and future. After this presentation, the floor will be open to all attendees for general informal discussion of the
AES program. 



In this document, Customs is announcing the following public meetings on AES:

 




1. Houston, Texas.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Paperwork Reduction Act Statement 


The information collection requirements that would be applicable through this notice have been approved by the Office
of Management and Budget, under section 3504(h) of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501-3520),
and assigned OMB control number 2577-0189. 


Authority 


Section 22 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437t) provides for the establishment of Family Investment
Centers (FICs). On February 28, 1994, the Department published a Notice of Funding Availability announcing the first
competition for grant funds under the program (59 FR 9592; amended at 59 FR 18570 (April 19, 1994) and 59 FR 29816 (June
9, 1994)). In the February 28 notice, the Department also indicated that it:

 

* * * intends to use $1 million for purposes of demonstrating ways for families living in public
and Indian housing in a neighborhood undergoing a concentrated effort of local revitalization to gain access to education
and employment activities to achieve self-sufficiency and independence, by enabling housing authorities to develop
training and support services. These funds will be used to mobilize public and private resources to expand and improve
delivery of services, to provide funding for essential training and support services that cannot otherwise be funded,
to improve the capacity of management to assess the training and services needs of eligible families, to coordinate
the provision of training and services that meet such needs and to ensure the long-term provision of such training
and services. The Department expects that this funding will demonstrate the importance of comprehensive support
services in contributing to the local neighborhood revitalization.

 

59 FR 9592 (February 28, 1994)

 

In accordance with the requirements of section 470(a) of the Housing and Urban-Rural Recovery Act of 1983 (42 U.S.C.
3542), this notice describes the proposed demonstration and invites public comment. Any changes made in this demonstration
as a result of the Department's consideration of public comments, and any extension of time for the commitment of funds
necessary because of these changes, also will be published in the 

Federal Register

. The Department will not commit funds for the proposed demonstration until after the latest of: (1) the date the Department
has considered any comments received in response to this notice; (2) September 19, 1994, which is 60 days after today's
publication date; and (3) the date the Department has received and approved an application that meets the requirements
imposed in this notice and any subsequent notice announcing changes in the demonstration. If funds are committed
for this demonstration, the Department also will publish in the 

Federal Register

 a notice announcing this fact. 


Background of Demonstration 


Community Building in Partnership (CBP) is a long-term partnership between the residents of the Sandtown-Winchester
neighborhood, the City of Baltimore (Maryland), and The Enterprise Foundation. CBP acts as a focal point for coordinated
planning and action to achieve objectives set by the residents of Sandtown-Winchester, as supported by planning
professionals and City staff, over a two-year planning and program design period. The Housing Authority of Baltimore
City (HABC) also is integrally involved in the effort to transform the neighborhood, which contains over 850 units
of public housing.

<TEXT>
 

For purposes of this demonstration, the Department will make up to $1 million available to the HABC for use in establishing
a FIC in the Sandtown-Winchester neighborhood. The funding will be used in accordance with the statutory requirements
of the FIC program to contribute to an integrated network of supportive services for public housing and other neighborhood
residents. 

The system of services and outreach planned by the community, CBP, the City, and the HABC will not only increase the
intensity and variety of educational and supportive services available to neighborhood residents, it will also
establish a delivery system involving residents who will work with neighbors to ensure progression towards self-sufficiency.
Residents involved as ``Family Advocates'' will work with trained social workers to manage the most complex cases.
Together with service providers, the advocates and case workers will form ``Family Support Teams'' and will create
a new system to integrate, at the community level, the multiple supportive service programs that affect most Sandtown-Winchester
residents. 

The focal point of this service provision and outreach activity will be a Family Resource Center located in a City-owned
facility on Mount Street in Sandtown-Winchester. Most of the funding provided under this demonstration will be used
to renovate and expand the Mount Street facility. Remaining funds will be used for service coordination by the Family
Support Teams and for core support services. Core support services will help families and individuals to overcome
personal difficulties that inhibit their readiness to work, and will include such services as literacy and G.E.D.
training and drop-in day care. 

In addition to the FIC funding proposed under this demonstration, public and private organizations will support
the Family Resource Center, its core services, and the Family Support Teams. This network will deliver necessary
services to public housing residents as part of the larger community, through the community-wide system developed
by HABC, the City, and CBP. The Department believes that the institutional integration_of which this demonstration
will be one part_will enhance the quality, continuity, and impact of support provided to public housing residents.
HABC will be a particularly active partner in this endeavor, drawing upon its experience with the Family Development
Center at Lafayette Courts, which provided one of the models for the national FIC program. 

Core support services and Family Support Team activities supported by FIC funding provided under this demonstration
will be targeted to ensure that a proportionate number of public housing families are served. Funding from other sources
will support the provision of services to other neighborhood residents. Private foundations and the City of Baltimore
have both committed funding and in-kind donations to the project. The Department expects that this demonstration
will leverage more public and private funding as the project progresses. 

The Department will allocate up to $1 million to HABC to carry out its part of the project, pending receipt and approval
of an application that is consistent with program and submission requirements as established in this notice and any
subsequent notice issued after the comment period has closed. 



Sandtown-Winchester 



Throughout the nation, collaborations between community-based organizations and private foundations are establishing
partnerships to address the full range of human needs in disadvantaged communities_public safety, education, job
training and placement, health and human services, housing and open space development, and others. These comprehensive
community development and revitalization efforts seek not only to accomplish specific projects, but also to build
community-based institutions that will continue to provide for residents' needs over the long term. Government
at the local, State and Federal levels, as well as corporate partners and intermediary development organizations,
have become involved in these projects to varying degrees.

In Baltimore, the CBP comprehensive community-based strategy is especially well-advanced. Working with the CBP,
the City of Baltimore and its Housing Authority have made the transformation of the Sandtown-Winchester neighborhood
one of their highest priorities. The CBP partnership aims to ``transform all of the dysfunctional conditions and
systems in Sandtown to enable all residents to achieve their highest potential.'' The dysfunctional systems the
partnership addresses cross the full range of typical public and human services. 

Additional Federal, State, and private participants in the transformation of the neighborhood include: the United
States Departments of Housing and Urban Development, Transportation, and Health and Human Services; the Maryland
State Housing Finance Agency and Community Development Agency; the National Community Development Initiative;
the Kellogg Foundation; the Abell Foundation; the Mott Foundation; the Goldseker Foundation; the Strauss Foundation;
Baltimore Gas & Electric Company; NationsBank; Habitat for Humanity; local churches; and many local community
development groups, including Baltimoreans United in Leadership Development. 

The community of Sandtown-Winchester contains the 571-unit Gilmor Homes public housing development, as well as
over 300 scattered-site public housing units. Nearly half of Sandtown-Winchester residents able to work are unemployed;
one-third of the residents have no health insurance. The rate of death from influenza and pneumonia is 2.5 times that
of the City of Baltimore. The rate of HIV infection is double that of the City, and is sixth in the State of Maryland. Students
in local public schools consistently perform far below state standards on reading, writing, and math tests, and absenteeism
is a major problem. Forty-nine percent of all residents live in poverty, and five of six poor children live in single-parent
households headed by women. The Sandtown-Winchester crime rate is one of the highest in the City. Typical systems
for delivering basic public services of employment, human services, health, education, housing, and public safety
have not met the complex and interrelated needs of the residents in Sandtown-Winchester, who have needs typical of
residents in many disadvantaged neighborhoods throughout the nation. 

Large amounts of resources have flowed into the neighborhood from various public and private sources, particularly
from government programs meant to address only distinct elements of the many interrelated problems, which have persisted
from generation to generation, that are faced by Sandtown-Winchester's residents. CBP is working to change the delivery
systems for these programs and resources, to make these services and housing opportunities more accessible to and
effective for neighborhood residents. Through the Family Support Teams that will work with clients and their changing
needs, the Family Resource Center will transform the delivery system for supportive services from a fragmented maze
into a highly responsive personal- and neighborhood-based system. 

In addition to the core services planned to be available at the Family Resource Center, public housing and other residents
of the Sandtown-Winchester neighborhood will be able to access other CBP and partner activities and programs. The
Family Resource Center, with its outreach and case management capabilities, will identify residents' needs, connect
them to neighborhood-based and City-wide service providers, and monitor their clients' progress. 

Programs available to residents will include community-based job training, job placement and small business technical
assistance, and health care that is focused on preventative measures and primary health care needs. A new Neighborhood
Development Center has begun to coordinate the efforts of several community development corporations and other
housing providers to construct or renovate housing in the area and to offer counselling and referrals for rental,
special needs, and ownership opportunities. Plans to treat substance abuse in the neighborhood include residential,
outpatient, support group, and in-home counselling. Youth education and activities programs will include targeted
outreach to children from birth to five years of age, to ensure school readiness through a variety of support strategies.
Extensive school to work programs and expanded summer recreation and after-school activities involving parents
are also planned. 

Because of the initiative already taken at the local level and the working partnership forged there, the Sandtown-Winchester
neighborhood transformation project is an ideal demonstration environment for service delivery integrated across
existing Federal program lines. Too often, the requirements of Federal programs have dictated institutional structures
at the local level that stand in the way of comprehensive delivery of housing and services to those who need these services
to achieve self-sufficiency. The City of Baltimore, HABC, and the community have all come together, supported by
The Enterprise Foundation and many private contributors, to implement the Sandtown-Winchester neighborhood transformation.
This coordination creates a rare opportunity for the Department to test the capacity of its existing programs to serve
in the context of a truly integrated and comprehensive transformation effort. 



Applicable Requirements 



Through this demonstration, the Department will explore ways to encourage neighborhood transformation partnerships
by, for example, meshing its programs to the needs of the local agencies to coordinate the delivery of programs and
services. The strategy to which the demonstration will contribute will integrate public housing residents fully
into the services and activities available to the rest of the community, in order to reduce the isolation often imposed
by different institutional delivery systems acting within small geographical areas. 

In order to receive the funding proposed in this notice, the HABC will be required to meet the applicable programmatic
and application requirements set out in the NOFA for Public and Indian Housing Family Investment Centers (published
at 59 FR 9592 (February 28, 1994), and amended at 59 FR 18570 (April 19, 1994) and 59 FR 29816 (June 9, 1994)) and any subsequent
notice that is published after the comment period has closed. 

When applicable, the certifications, findings, determinations, and requirements listed by the Department under
the ``Other Matters'' section of that NOFA also apply to this notice.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Introduction and Purpose 



The purpose of this program announcement is to announce the anticipated availability of fiscal year 1995 funds, authorized
under the Native American Programs Act (Act), as amended, to promote the goal of social and economic self-sufficiency
for American Indians, Alaska Natives, Native Hawaiians, and Native American Pacific Islanders in four competitive
areas. 

In order to streamline the application process for eligible Native American applicants, ANA is issuing one program
announcement announcing fiscal year 1995 funds. Therefore, information regarding ANA's mission, policy, goals,
application requirements, review criteria and closing dates for each competitive area is now in one comprehensive
announcement. 

In previous years, the Administration for Native Americans promoted the goal of self-sufficiency in Native American
communities primarily through Social and Economic Development Strategies (SEDS) projects. Amendments to the Native
American Programs Act have expanded ANA's granting authority to establish two additional programs for (1) environmental
regulatory enhancement, and (2) Native American languages preservation and enhancement. 

Projects are awarded funds under sections 803(a), 803(d) and 803C of the Native American Programs Act of 1974, as amended
(Public Law 93-644, 88 Stat. 2324, 42 U.S.C. 2991b). 

The Indian Environmental Regulatory Enhancement Act of 1990 (Public Law 101-408) authorizes financial assistance
for projects to address environmental regulatory concerns (Section 803(d) of the Native American Programs Act of
1974, as amended).

The Native American Languages Act of 1992 (Public Law 102-524) authorizes financial assistance for projects
to promote the survival and continuing vitality of Native American languages (Section 803C of the Native American
Programs Act of 1974, as amended). 

This program announcement is being issued in anticipation of the appropriation of funds for fiscal year 1995, and
the availability of funds for the four competitive areas is contingent upon sufficient final appropriations. Proposed
projects will be reviewed on a competitive basis against the evaluation criteria under each respective competitive
area in this announcement. 

Eligible applicants may compete for and receive a grant award in each of the three competitive areas. However, ANA
continues its policy that an applicant may only submit one application per competitive area. 

This program announcement consists of three parts. 



PART I_ANA POLICY AND GOALS 
 


Provides general information about ANA's policies and goals for the four competitive areas. 



PART II_ANA COMPETITIVE AREAS 

 

Describes the four competitive areas under which ANA is requesting applications: 
 
 Governance, Social and Economic Development (SEDS); 
  Governance, Social and Economic Development (SEDS) for Alaska Native entities; 
  Environmental Regulatory Enhancement; and 
  Native American Languages Preservation and Enhancement. 
 
Each competitive area includes the following sections which provide area-specific information to be used in developing
a funding application: 




A Purpose and Availability of Funds; 
 B Background; 
 C Proposed Projects to be Funded; 
 D Eligible Applicants; 
 E Grantee Share of the Project; 
 F Review Criteria; 
 G Application Due Date(s); and 
 H Contacts to Obtain Further Information 



PART III_GENERAL APPLICATION INFORMATION AND GUIDANCE 

 

Provides information and guidance that applies to all four competitive areas and that must be taken into account in
developing an application in any of the four areas. 


PART I_ANA POLICY AND GOALS 



The mission of the Administration for Native Americans (ANA) is to promote the goal of social and economic self-sufficiency
for American Indians, Alaska Natives, Native Hawaiians, and other Native American Pacific Islanders. 

The Administration for Native Americans believes that a Native American community is self-sufficient when it can
generate and control the resources necessary to meet its social and economic goals, and the needs of its members. 

The Administration for Native Americans also believes that the responsibility for achieving self-sufficiency
resides with the governing bodies of Indian tribes, Alaska Native villages, and in the leadership of Native American
groups. A community's progress toward self-sufficiency is based on its efforts to plan, organize, and direct resources
in a comprehensive manner which is consistent with its established long-range goals.

The Administration for Native Americans' policy is based on three interrelated goals: 

1. 

Governance: 

To assist tribal and village governments, Native American institutions, and local leadership to exercise local
control and decision-making over their resources. 

2. 

Economic Development: 

To foster the development of stable, diversified local economies and economic activities which will provide jobs
and promote economic well-being. 

3. 

Social Development: 

To support local access to, control of, and coordination of services and programs which safeguard the health, well-being
and culture of people, provide support services and training so people can work, and which are essential to a thriving
and self-sufficient community. 

The Administration for Native Americans assists eligible applicants in the four competitive areas to undertake
one to three year development projects that are part of long-range comprehensive plans to move toward governance,
social, and/or economic self-sufficiency. For each type of project, applicants must describe a concrete locally-determined
strategy to carry out a proposed project with fundable objectives and activities. 

Local long-range planning must consider the maximum use of all available resources, how the resources will be directed
to development opportunities, and present a strategy for overcoming the local issues that hinder movement toward
self-sufficiency in the community. 

Under each competitive area, ANA will only accept one application which serves or impacts a reservation. If a Tribe
chooses not to submit an application under a specific competitive area, it may support another applicant's project
(e.g., a tribal organization) which serves or impacts the reservation. 

In this case, the applicant must include a Tribal resolution which clearly demonstrates the Tribe's support of the
project and the Tribe's understanding that the other applicant's project supplants the Tribe's authority to submit
an application under that specific competitive area for the duration of the approved grant period. 



PART II_ANA COMPETITIVE AREAS 



The four competitive areas under this Part describe ANA's funding authorities, priorities, special initiatives,
requirements, and review criteria. However, most of the requirements are standard for all applications to be submitted
under this program announcement. The standard requirements necessary for each application, as well as standard
ANA program guidance and technical guidance are described in Part III of this announcement. 

An applicant may submit a separate application under any of the competitive areas described in this Part, as long as
the applicant meets the eligibility requirements that are listed separately under each area. Applications for SEDS
grants from Alaska Native entities may be submitted under either Competitive Area 1 or Competitive Area 2. An Alaska
Native entity may not submit an application under both Competitive Areas 1 and 2 for the same closing date. 



ANA Competitive Area 1. Social and Economic Development Strategies (SEDS) Projects 



A. Purpose and Availability of Funds 



The purpose of this competitive area is to announce the anticipated availability of fiscal year 1995 financial assistance
to promote the goal of social and economic self-sufficiency for American Indians, Alaska Natives, Native Hawaiians,
and Native American Pacific Islanders through locally developed social and economic development strategies (SEDS).


Approximately $14 million of financial assistance is anticipated to be available under this priority area for governance,
social and economic development projects. In fiscal year 1995, ANA anticipates awarding approximately 120 competitive
grants ranging from $30,000 to $1,000,000 under this competitive area. 



B. Background 



To achieve its goals, ANA supports tribal and village 
governments, and Native American organizations, in their efforts to develop and implement community-based, long-term
governance, social and economic development strategies (SEDS). These 
strategies must promote the goal of self-sufficiency in local communities. 

The SEDS approach is based on ANA's program goals and incorporates two fundamental principles: 

1. The local community and its leadership are responsible for determining goals, setting priorities, and planning
and implementing programs aimed at achieving those goals. The local community is in the best position to apply its
own cultural, political, and socio-economic values to its long-term strategies and programs.

<TEXT>
 

2. Governance and social and economic development are interrelated. In order to move toward self-sufficiency, development
in one area should be balanced with development in the others. Consequently, comprehensive development strategies
should address all aspects of the governmental, economic, and social infrastructures needed to promote self-sufficient
communities. 

ANA's SEDS policy is based on the use of the following definitions: 

 ``Governmental infrastructure'' includes the constitutional, legal, and administrative development
requisite for independent governance. 

 ``Economic infrastructure'' includes the physical, commercial, industrial and/or agricultural components
necessary for a functioning local economy which supports the life-style embraced by the Native American community.


 ``Social infrastructure'' includes those components through which health, economic well-being and culture
are maintained within the community and that support governance and economic goals. 

These definitions should be kept in mind as a local social and economic development strategy is developed as part of
a grant application. 

A community's movement toward self-sufficiency could be jeopardized if a careful balance between governmental,
economic and social development is not maintained. For example, expansion of social services, without providing
opportunities for employment and economic development, could lead to dependency on social services. 

Conversely, inadequate support services and training could seriously impede productivity and local economic development.
Additionally, the necessary infrastructures must be developed or expanded at the community level to support social
and economic development and growth. In designing their social and economic development strategies, ANA encourages
an applicant to use or leverage all available human, natural, financial, and physical resources. 

In discussing their community-based, long-range goals, and the objectives for the proposed projects, ANA recommends
that non-Federally recognized and off-reservation groups include a description of what constitutes their specific
community. 

ANA encourages the development and maintenance of comprehensive strategic plans which are an integral part of attaining
and supporting the balance necessary for successful activities that lead to self-sufficiency. 



C. Proposed Projects To Be Funded 



This section provides descriptions of activities which are consistent with the SEDS philosophy. Proposed activities
should be tailored to reflect the governance, social and economic development needs of the local community and should
be consistent and supportive of the proposed project objectives. 

The types of projects which ANA may fund include, but are not limited to, the following: 



Governance 



 Improvements in the governmental, judicial and/or administrative infrastructures of tribal and village
governments (such as strengthening or streamlining management procedures or the development of tribal court systems);


 Increasing the ability of tribes, villages, and Native American groups and organizations to plan, develop,
and administer a comprehensive program to support community social and economic self-sufficiency (including strategic
planning); 

 Increasing awareness of and exercising the legal rights and benefits to which Native Americans are entitled,
by either treaties, the Federal trust relationship, legislative authority, or as citizens of a particular state,
or of the United States. 

 Status clarification activities for Native groups seeking Federal or State tribal recognition, such as performing
research or any other function necessary to submit a petition for Federal acknowledgement or in response to any obvious
deficiencies cited by the Bureau of Acknowledgement and Research (BAR), Department of Interior, in a petition from
a Native group seeking Federal recognition; and 

 Amendments to tribal constitutions, court procedures and functions, by-laws or codes, and council or executive
branch duties and functions.

 Stabilizing and diversifying a Native community's economic base through business development ventures;


 Creation of microenterprises or private sector development; and 

 Establishment or expansion of businesses and jobs that utilize Indian tax incentives passed in the Omnibus
Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993. 



Social Development 



 Enhancing tribal capabilities to design or administer programs aimed at strengthening the social environment
desired by the local community; 

 Developing local and intertribal models related to comprehensive planning and delivery of services; 

 Developing programs or activities to preserve and enhance tribal heritage and culture; and 

 Establishing programs which involve extended families or tribal societies in activities that strengthen
cultural identity and promote community development or self-esteem. 



D. Eligible Applicants 



Current ANA SEDS grantees whose project period terminates in fiscal year 1995 (October 1, 1994-September 30,
1995) are eligible to apply for a grant award under this program announcement. (The Project Period is noted in Block
9 of the ``Financial Assistance Award'' document). 

Additionally, provided they are not current ANA SEDS grantees, the following organizations are eligible to apply
under this competitive area: 

 Federally recognized Indian Tribes (as listed by the Bureau of Indian Affairs in an October 21, 1993 

Federal Register

 notice, 58 Fed. Reg. 54. 364(1993)); 

 Consortia of Indian Tribes; 

 Incorporated non-Federally recognized Tribes; 

 Incorporated nonprofit multi-purpose community-based Indian organizations; 

 Urban Indian Centers; 

 National or regional incorporated nonprofit Native American organizations with Native American community-specific
objectives; 

 Alaska Native villages as defined in the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA) and/or nonprofit village
consortia; 

 Incorporated nonprofit Alaska Native multi-purpose community-based organizations; 

 Nonprofit Alaska Native Regional Corporations/Associations in Alaska with village specific projects;


 Nonprofit Native organizations in Alaska with village specific projects;

E. Grantee Share of the Project 



Grantees must provide at least 20 percent of the total approved cost of the project. The total approved cost of the project
is the sum of the ACF share and the non-Federal share. The non-Federal share may be met by cash or in-kind contributions;
although applicants are encouraged to meet their match requirements through cash contributions. Therefore, a project
requesting $300,000 in Federal funds must include a match of at least $75,000 (20% total project cost). 

While we encourage applicants to secure non-Federal funds for their match, the non-Federal share may be satisfied
through other Federal funding sources, provided the other Federal program source relates to the proposed ANA project,
as follows: 

 Indian Child Welfare funds, through the Department of Interior; 

 Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance funds, through the Department of Interior and the Department
of Health and Human Services; and 

 Community Development Block Grant funds, through the Department of Housing and Urban Development. 

An itemized budget detailing the applicant's non-Federal share, and its source, must be included in an application.
A request for a waiver of the non-Federal share requirement may be submitted in accordance with 45 CFR 1336.50(b)(3)
of the Native American Program Regulations. 

Applications originating from American Samoa, Guam, Palau, or 
the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands are covered under Section 501(d) of Public Law 95-134, as amended
(48 U.S.C. 1469a) under which HHS waives any requirement for local matching funds under $200,000 (including in-kind
contributions). 



F. Review Criteria 



A proposed project should reflect the purposes of ANA's SEDS policy and program goals (described in the Background
section of this competitive area), include a social and economic development strategy which reflects the needs and
specific circumstances of the local community, and address the specific developmental steps that the tribe or Native
American community is undertaking toward self-sufficiency. 

The evaluation criteria are closely related to each other and are considered as a whole in judging the overall quality
of an application. Points are awarded only to applications which are responsive to this competitive area and these
criteria. Proposed projects will be reviewed on a competitive basis using the following evaluation criteria: 

(1) 

Long-range goals and available resources.

 (15 points) (a) The application explains how specific social, governance and economic long-range community goals
relate to the proposed project and strategy. It explains how the community intends to achieve these goals. It documents
the type of involvement and support of the community in the planning process and implementation of the proposed project.
The goals are described within the context of the applicant's comprehensive community social and economic development
plan. (Inclusion of the community's entire development plan is not necessary). The application has a clearly delineated
social and economic development strategy (SEDS).

 




Note: 

Applications from National Indian and Native organizations must demonstrate a need for the project, explain how
the project was originated, state who the intended beneficiaries will be, and describe how the recipients will actually
benefit from the project. 




(b) Available resources (other than ANA and the non-Federal share) which will assist, and be coordinated with the
project are described. These resources should be documented by letters or documents of commitment of resources,
not merely letters of support. ``Letters of support'' merely express another organization's endorsement of a proposed
project. Support letters are not binding commitment letters or documents that factually establish the authenticity
of other resources. Letters and other documents of commitment are binding in that they specifically state the nature,
amount and conditions under which another agency or organization will support a project funded with ANA monies. For
example, a letter from another Federal agency or foundation pledging a commitment of $200,000 in construction funding
to complement proposed ANA funded pre-construction activity is evidence of a firm funding commitment. These resources
may be human, natural or financial, and may include other Federal and non-Federal resources. Applicant statements
that additional funding will be sought from other specific sources is 

not

 considered a binding commitment of outside resources.

Competitive Area 2. Alaska-Specific Social and Economic Development Strategies (SEDS) Projects 


A. Purpose and Availability of Funds 


The purpose of this competitive area is to announce the anticipated availability of fiscal year 1995 funds for Alaska
Native social and economic development projects. Approximately $1.5 million of financial assistance is anticipated
to be available under this competitive area for Alaska Native governance, social and economic development projects.

ANA plans to award approximately 15-18 grants under this competitive area. For individual village projects,
the funding level for a budget period of 12 months will be up to $100,000; for regional nonprofit and village consortia,
the funding level for a budget period of 12 months will be up to $150,000, commensurate with approved multi-village
objectives. 


B. Background 


Based on the three ANA goals described in Part I, ANA implemented a special Alaska social and economic development
initiative in fiscal year 1984. This special effort was designed to provide financial assistance at the village level
or for village-specific projects aimed at improving a village's governance capabilities and for social and economic
development. 
This competitive area continues to implement this special initiative. ANA believes both the nonprofit and for-profit
corporations in Alaska can play an important supportive role in assisting individual villages to develop and implement
their own locally determined strategies which capitalize on opportunities afforded to Alaska Natives under the
Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA), Public Law 92-203. 
The Administration for Native Americans does not fund objectives or activities for the core administration of an
organization. However, ANA will consider funding core administrative capacity building projects at the village
government level if the village does not have governing systems in place. 


C. Proposed Projects To Be Funded 


Examples of the types of projects that ANA may fund include, but are not limited to, projects that will: 


Governance 


 Initiate demonstration programs at the regional level to allow Native people to become involved in developing
strategies to maintain and develop their economic subsistence base; 
 Assist villages in developing land use capabilities and skills in the areas of land and natural resource management
and protection, resource assessment and conducting environmental impact studies; 
 Assist village consortia in the development of tribal constitutions, ordinances, codes and tribal court
systems; 
 Develop agreements between the State and villages that transfer programs jurisdictions, and/or control
to Native entities; 
 Strengthen village government control of land management, including land protection, through coordination
of land use planning with village corporations and cities, if appropriate; 
 Assist in status clarification activities; 
 Initiate village level mergers between village councils, village corporations and others to coordinate
programs and services which safeguard the health, well being and culture of a community and its people;

 Strengthen local governance capabilities through the development of village consortia and regional IRAs
(Indian Reorganization Act councils organized under the Indian Reorganization Act, 25 U.S.C. 473a);

 Assist villages in preparing and coordinating plans for the development and/or improvement of water and sewer
systems within the village boundaries;

 Assist villages in establishing initiatives through which youth may participate in the governance of the
community and be trained to assume leadership roles in village governments; and 

 Consider strategies and plans to protect against, monitor, and assist when catastrophic events occur, such
as oil spills or earthquakes. 



Economic Development 



 Assist villages in developing businesses and industries which: (1) use local materials; (2) create jobs for
Alaska Natives; (3) are capable of high productivity at a small scale of operation; and (4) complement traditional
and necessary seasonal activities;

 Substantially increase and strengthen efforts to establish and improve the village and regional infrastructure
and the capabilities to develop and manage resources in a highly competitive cash-economy system;

 Assist villages, or consortia of villages, in developing subsistence compatible industries that will retain
local dollars in villages;

 Assist in the establishment or expansion of new native-owned businesses; and 

 Assist villages in labor export; i.e., people leaving the local communities for seasonal work and returning
to their communities. 



Social Development 



 Assist in developing training and education programs for local jobs in education, government, and health-related
fields; and work with these agencies to encourage job replacement of non-Natives by trained Natives;

 Develop local models related to comprehensive planning and delivery of social services;

 Develop new service programs, initially established with ANA funds, which will be funded for continued operation
(after the ANA grant terminates) by local communities or the private sector;

 Develop or coordinate with State-funded projects, activities designed to decrease the incidence of child
abuse and neglect, fetal alcohol syndrome, and/or suicides;

 Assist in obtaining licenses to provide housing or related services from State or local governments; and 

 Develop businesses to provide relief for caretakers needing respite from human service-related care work.




D. Eligible Applicants 



Current ANA SEDS grantees in Alaska whose project period terminates in fiscal year 1995 (October 1, 1994-September
30, 1995) are eligible to apply for a grant award under this program announcement. (The Project Period is noted in Block
9 of the ``Financial Assistance Award'' document).

Additionally, provided they are not current ANA SEDS grantees, the following organizations are eligible to apply
under this competitive area: 

 Federally recognized Indian Tribes in Alaska (as listed by the Bureau of Indian Affairs in an October 21, 1993


Federal Register

 notice, 58 Fed. Reg. 54. 364(1993));

 Alaska Native villages as defined in the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA) and/or nonprofit village
consortia;

 Incorporated nonprofit Alaska Native multi-purpose community-based organizations;

 Nonprofit Alaska Native Regional Corporations/Associations in Alaska with village specific projects;
and 

 Nonprofit Native organizations in Alaska with village specific projects. 

Proof of an applicant's nonprofit status, such as an IRS determination of nonprofit status under IRS Code 501(c)(3),
must be included in the application. 

Although for-profit regional corporations established under ANCSA are not eligible applicants, individual villages
and Indian communities are encouraged to use the for-profit corporations as subcontractors and to collaborate with
them in joint-venture projects for promoting social and economic self-sufficiency. ANA encourages the for-profit
corporations to assist the villages in developing applications and to participate as subcontractors in a project.


Under each competitive area, ANA will only accept one application which serves or impacts a reservation. If a Tribe
chooses not to submit an application under a specific competitive area, it may support another applicant's project
(e.g., a tribal organization) which serves or impacts the reservation. 

In this case, the applicant must include a Tribal resolution which clearly demonstrates the Tribe's support of the
project and the Tribe's understanding that the other applicant's project supplants the Tribe's authority to submit
an application under that specific competitive area for the duration of the approved grant period. 



E. Grantee Share of the Project 



Grantees must provide at least 20 percent of the total approved cost of the project. The total approved cost of the project
is the sum of the ACF share and the non-Federal share. The non-Federal share may be met by cash or in-kind contributions,
although applicants are encouraged to meet their match requirements through cash contributions. Therefore, a project
requesting $300,000 in Federal funds must include a match of at least $75,000 (20% total project cost). 

While we encourage applicants to secure non-Federal funds for their match, the non-Federal share may be satisfied
through other Federal funding sources, provided the source relates to the ANA project, as follows: 
 Indian Child Welfare funds, through the Department of Interior;

 Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance funds, through the Department of Interior and the Department
of Health and Human Services; and 

 Community Development Block Grant funds, through the Department of Housing and Urban Development. 

An itemized budget detailing the applicant's non-Federal share, and its source, must be included in an application.
A request for a waiver of the non-Federal share requirement may be submitted in accordance with 45 CFR 1336.50(b)(3)
of the Native American Program Regulations. 



F. Review Criteria 



A proposed project should reflect the purposes of ANA's SEDS policy and goals (described in the Background section
of this competitive area and in the Background section of Competitive Area (1), include a social and economic development
strategy which reflects the needs and specific circumstances of the local community, and address the specific developmental
steps that the tribe or Native American community is undertaking toward self-sufficiency. 

The evaluation criteria are closely related to each other and are considered as a whole in judging the overall quality
of an application. Points are awarded only to applications which are responsive to this competitive area and these
criteria. Proposed projects will be reviewed on a competitive basis using the following evaluation criteria:

The purpose of this competitive area is to announce the anticipated availability of fiscal year 1995 funds for environmental
regulatory enhancement projects. Approximately $3 million of financial assistance is anticipated to be available
under this announcement for environmental regulatory enhancement projects. ANA expects to award approximately
35 grants under this competitive area. The funding level for a budget period of 12 months will be up to $250,000. 



B. Background 



Despite an increasing environmental responsibility and growing awareness of environmental issues on Indian lands,
there has been a lack of resources available to tribes to develop tribal environmental programs that are responsive
to tribal needs. In many cases, this lack of resources has resulted in a delay in action on the part of the tribes. 

Some of the critical issues identified by tribes before Congressional committees include: 

 The need for assistance to train professional staff to monitor and enforce tribal environmental programs;


 The lack of adequate data for tribes to develop environmental statutes and establish environmental quality
standards; and 

 The lack of resources to conduct studies to identify sources of pollution and the ability to determine the impact
on existing environmental quality. 

As a result, Congress enacted the Indian Environmental Regulatory Enhancement Act of 1990 (Public Law 101-408)
to strengthen tribal governments through building capacity within the tribes in order to identify, plan, develop,
and implement environmental programs in a manner that is consistent with tribal culture. ANA is to support these activities
on a government-to-government basis in a way that recognizes tribal sovereignty and is consistent with tribal culture.


The Administration for Native Americans believes that responsibility for achieving environmental regulatory
enhancement rests with the governing bodies of Indian tribes, Alaska Native villages, and with the leadership of
Native American groups.

Progress toward the goal of environmental regulatory enhancement would include the strengthening of tribal environmental
laws, providing for the training and education of those employees responsible for ensuring compliance with and enforcement
of these laws, and the development of programs to conduct compliance and enforcement functions. 

Other functions leading toward enhancing local regulatory capacity include, but are not limited to: 

 Environmental assessments; 

 Development and use of environmental laboratories; and 

 Development of court systems for enforcement of tribal and Federal environmental laws. 

Ultimate success in this program will be realized when the applicant's desired level of environmental quality is
acquired and maintained. 


C. Proposed Projects To Be Funded 



Financial assistance provided by ANA is available for developmental projects designed to assist tribes in advancing
their capacity and capability to plan for and: 

 Develop or enhance the tribal environmental regulatory infrastructure required to support a tribal environmental
program, and to regulate and enforce environmental activities on Indian lands pursuant to Federal and Indian law;


 Develop regulations, ordinances and laws to protect the environment; 

 Develop the technical and program capacity to carry out a comprehensive tribal environmental program and
perform essential environmental program functions; 

 Promote environmental training and education of tribal employees; 

 Develop technical and program capability to meet tribal and Federal regulatory requirements; 

 Develop technical and program capability to monitor compliance and enforcement of tribal environmental
regulations, ordinances, and laws; and 

 Ensure the tribal court system enforcement requirements are developed in concert with and support the tribe's
comprehensive environmental program. 



D. Eligible Applicants 



The following organizations are eligible to apply under this competitive area: 

 Federally recognized Indian tribes (as listed by the Bureau of Indian Affairs in an October 21, 1993 

Federal Register

 notice, 58 Fed. Reg. 54. 364 (1993)); 

 Incorporated non-Federally recognized Indian tribes; 

 Alaska Native villages as defined in the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA) and/or nonprofit village
consortia; 

 Nonprofit Alaska Native Regional Corporations/Associations with village specific projects; and 

 Other tribal or village organizations or consortia of Indian tribes. 

The following organizations are not eligible to apply: 

 Urban Indian Centers; 

 Incorporated nonprofit multi-purpose community-based Indian organizations; 

 Public and nonprofit private agencies serving: Native Hawaiians, peoples from Guam, American Samoa, Palau,
or the Commonwealth of Northern Mariana Islands; 

 Incorporated nonprofit Alaska Native multi-purpose community based organizations; and 

 National or regional incorporated nonprofit Native American organizations with Native American community-specific
objectives. 

Proof of an applicant's nonprofit status, such as an IRS determination of nonprofit status under IRS Code 501(c)(3),
must be included in the application. 

Under each competitive area, ANA will only accept one application which serves or impacts a reservation. If a Tribe
chooses not to submit an application under a specific competitive area, it may support another applicant's project
(e.g., a tribal organization) which serves or impacts the reservation. 

In this case, the applicant must include a Tribal resolution which clearly demonstrates the Tribe's support of the
project and the Tribe's understanding that the other applicant's project supplants the Tribe's authority to submit
an application under that specific competitive area for the duration of the approved grant period. 


E. Grantee Share of the Project 



Grantees must provide at least 20 percent of the total approved cost of the project. The total approved cost of the project
is the sum of the ACF share and the non-Federal share. The non-Federal share may be met by cash or in-kind contributions;
although applicants are encouraged to meet their match requirement through cash contributions. Therefore, a project
requesting $300,000 in Federal funds must include a match of at least $75,000 (20% of total project cost). 

The non-Federal share may be met by cash or through the provision of in-kind property or services, but only to the extent
that cash or property is from any source (including any Federal agency where legislation or regulation authorizes
using specific types of funds for a match) other than a program, contract or grant authorized under the Native American
Programs Act of 1974, as amended. An itemized budget detailing the applicant's non-Federal share, and its source,
must be included in an application. A request for a waiver of the non-Federal share requirement may be submitted in
accordance with 45 CFR 1336.50(b)(3) of the Native American Program Regulations.

F. Review Criteria 



A proposed project should reflect the environmental regulatory purposes stated and described in the Background
section of this competitive area. The evaluation criteria are closely related to each other and are considered as
a whole in judging the overall quality of an application. Points are awarded only to applications which are responsive
to this competitive area and these criteria. Proposed projects will be reviewed on a competitive basis using the following
evaluation criteria: 

(1) 

Long-range goals and available resources. 

(15 points). (a) The application explains how the specific environmental regulatory enhancement goal(s) relates
to the proposed project. The description includes local objectives related to the program purpose of this competitive
area. The discussion should highlight specific environmental regulatory needs and explain how the community intends
to achieve the goal. It documents the type of involvement and support of the community in the planning and implementation
of the project. The application has a clearly delineated strategy to improve the capability of the governing body
of a tribe to regulate environmental quality through enhancing local capacity to perform necessary regulatory functions.


(b) Available resources (other than ANA and the non-Federal share) which will assist and be coordinated with the project
are described. These resources should be documented by letters or documents of commitment of resources, not merely
letters of support. ``Letters of support'' merely express another organization's endorsement of a proposed project.
Support letters are not binding commitment letters or documents that factually establish the authenticity of other
resources. Letters and other documents of commitment are binding in that they specifically state the nature, amount
and conditions under which another agency or organization will support a project funded with ANA money. For example,
a letter from another Federal agency or foundation pledging a commitment of $200,000 in construction funding to complement
proposed ANA funded pre-construction activity is evidence of a firm funding commitment. These resources may be human,
natural or financial, and may include other Federal and non-Federal resources. Applicant statements that additional
funding will be sought from other specific sources is not considered a binding commitment of outside resources. 

(2) 

Organizational capabilities and qualifications. 

(15 points). (a) The management and administrative structure of the applicant is described and explained. Evidence
of the applicant's ability to manage a project of the scope proposed is well documented. The application clearly shows
the successful management of projects of similar scope by the organization, and/or by the individuals designated
to manage or consult on the project. The tribe itself may not have experience to meet this requirement but the proposed
staff and consultants should have the required qualifications and experience. The application should clearly describe
any previous or current activities of the applicant organization or proposed staff and/or consultants in support
of environmental regulatory enhancement. 

(b) Position descriptions or resumes of key personnel, including those of consultants, are presented. The position
descriptions and resumes relate specifically to the staff proposed in the Approach Page and in the proposed Budget
of the application. Position descriptions very clearly describe each position and its duties and clearly relate
to the personnel staffing required to achieve the project objectives. Resumes indicate that the proposed staff are
qualified to carry out the project activities. Either the position descriptions or the resumes contain the qualifications
and/or specialized skills necessary for overall quality management of the project. 





Note:

 Applicants are strongly encouraged to give preference to Native Americans in hiring staff and subcontracting services
under an approved ANA grant. 




(3) 

Project objectives, approach and activities. 

(40 points). The application proposes specific project objective work plans with activities related to each specific
objective. The objective work plan(s) in the application includes project objectives and activities for 

each

 budget period proposed and demonstrates that each of the objectives and its activities: 

 Is measurable and/or quantifiable in terms of results or outcomes; 

 Supports the community's strategy for environmental regulatory enhancement; 

 Clearly relates to the community's long-range environmental goals;

 (20 points). Completion of the proposed objectives will result in specific, measurable results. The application
shows how the expected results will help the community meet its long-range environmental goals. The specific information
provided in the narrative and objective work plans on expected results or benefits for each objective is the standard
upon which its achievement can be evaluated at the end of each budget year. 
(5) 

Budget.

 (10 points). There is a detailed, and fully explained, budget with comprehensive narrative provided for each budget
period requested. It justifies each line item in the budget categories in Section B of the Budget Information of the
application, including the applicant's non-Federal share and its source. Sufficient cost and other necessary details
are included and explained to facilitate the determination of cost allowability and the relevance of these costs
to the proposed project. The funds requested are appropriate and necessary for the scope of the project.

Competitive Area 4. Native American Languages Preservation and Enhancement Projects 


A. Purpose and Availability of Funds 


The purpose of this competitive area is to announce the anticipated availability of fiscal year 1995 funds for projects
which assist Native Americans to assure the survival and continuing vitality of their languages. Approximately
$1 million of financial assistance is anticipated to be available under this announcement for projects to promote
the survival and continuing vitality of Native American languages. 
For Category I, Planning Grants, the funding level for a budget period of 12 months will be up to $50,000. For Category
II, Design and/or Implementation Grants, the funding level for a budget period of 12 months will be up to $125,000.



B. Background 


The Congress has recognized that the history of past policies of the United States toward Indian and other Native American
languages has resulted in a dramatic decrease in the number of Native American languages that have survived over the
past five hundred years. Consequently, the Native American Languages Act was enacted (Title I, Public Law 101-477)
to address this decline. 
This legislation invested the United States government with the responsibility to work together with Native Americans
to ensure the survival of cultures and languages unique to Native America. This law declared that it is the policy of
the United States to ``preserve, protect, and promote the rights and freedom of Native Americans to use, practice,
and develop Native American languages.'' While the Congress made a significant first step in passing this legislation
in 1990, it served only as a declaration of policy. No program initiatives were proposed, nor any funds authorized
to enact any significant programs in furtherance of this policy. 
In 1992, Congressional testimony provided estimates that of the several hundred languages that once existed, only
about one hundred and fifty-five (155) languages are still spoken or remembered today. However, only 20 are spoken
by persons of all ages, 30 are spoken by adults of all ages, about 60 are spoken by middle-aged adults, and 45 are spoken
only by the most elderly. 
In response to this testimony, the Congress passed the Native American Languages Act of 1992 (Public Law 102-524)
to assist Native Americans in assuring the survival and continuing vitality of their languages. Passage of this law
is an important second step in attempting to ensure the survival and continuation of Native American languages, as
it provides the basic foundation upon which the Tribal nations can rebuild their economic strength and rich cultural
diversity. 
While the Federal government recognizes that substantial loss of Native American languages has occurred over the
past several hundred years, the nature and magnitude of the status of Native American languages will be better defined
when eligible applicants have completed language assessments. 
The Administration for Native Americans (ANA) believes that responsibility for achieving self-sufficiency rests
with the governing bodies of Indian tribes, Alaska Native villages, and in the leadership of Native American groups.
This belief supports the ANA principle that the local community and its leadership are responsible for determining
goals, setting priorities, and planning and implementing programs which support the community's long range goals.

Therefore, since preserving a language and ensuring its continuation is generally one of the first steps taken toward
strengthening a group's identity, activities proposed under this program announcement will contribute to the social
development of a native community and significantly contribute to its path toward self-sufficiency.

The Administration for Native Americans recognizes that eligible applicants must have the opportunity to develop
their own language plans, technical capabilities and access to the necessary financial and technical resources
in order to assess, plan, develop and implement programs to assure the survival and continuing vitality of their languages.
ANA also recognizes that potential applicants may have specialized knowledge and capabilities to address specific
language concerns at various levels. This competitive area reflects these special needs and circumstances. 


C. Proposed Projects To Be Funded 


Applicants may apply for 12-month Planning Grants, under Category I, or for projects of up to 36 months duration under
Category II, Design and/or Implementation Grants. 


Category I_Planning grants.

 The purpose of the planning grants is to conduct the assessment and planning needed to identify the current status
of the Native American language(s) to be addressed and to establish community long-range language goal(s). 
These activities may include, but are not limited to, the following: 
 Data collection, compilation and analysis to ascertain current language status through ``formal'' (e.g.,
work performed by a linguist, and/or a language survey conducted by community members) or ``informal'' (e.g., a community
consensus of the language status based on elders, tribal scholars, and/or other community members) methods; 
 Establishment of the community's long-range language goals; and 
 Acquisition of the necessary training and technical assistance to assure the achievement of the project goal(s).



Category II_Design and/or implementation grants.

 The purpose of design and/or implementation grants is to allow communities to design and/or implement, as appropriate
to the applicant, a language program or programs that will contribute to the achievement of the community's long-range
language goal(s). Applicants under Category II must be able to document that: (a) language statistics have been collected
and analyzed, and that these statistics are current (compiled within thirty-six months prior to the grant application);
(b) that the community has established long-range language goals; and (c) that community representatives are adequately
trained to achieve the proposed project goals. 
Under Category II grants, applicants may include the purchase of specialized equipment (including audio and video
recording equipment, computers, and software) which is necessary to accomplish project objectives. The applicant
must fully justify the need for this equipment and explain how it will assist them in achieving their project objectives.

The types of activities ANA is seeking to fund under Category II grants include, but are not limited to, the following:

 Establishment and support of community Native American language projects to bring older and younger Native
Americans together to facilitate and encourage the transfer of Native American language skills from one generation
to another; 
 Establishment of projects to train Native Americans to teach Native American languages to others or to enable
them to serve as interpreters or translators of such languages; 
 Development, printing, and dissemination of materials to be used for the teaching and enhancement of Native
American languages; 
 Establishment or support of projects to train Native Americans to produce or participate in television or
radio programs to be broadcast in Native American languages; and 
 Compilation, transcription, and analysis of oral testimony to record and preserve Native American languages.

The Institute of American Indian and Alaska Native Culture and Arts Development is established by the Act as the repository
for copies of products from Native American languages grants funded under this program announcement. Products of
Native American languages grants funded by this program announcement must be transmitted to this designated repository.
Federally recognized Indian Tribes (as listed by the Bureau of Indian Affairs in an October 21, 1993

Proof of an applicant's nonprofit status, such as an IRS determination of nonprofit status under IRS Code 501(c)(3),
must be included in the application. 
Under each competitive area, ANA will only accept one application which serves or impacts a reservation. If a Tribe
chooses not to submit an application under a specific competitive area, it may support another applicant's project
(e.g., a tribal organization) which serves or impacts the reservation. 
In this case, the applicant must include a Tribal resolution which clearly demonstrates the Tribe's support of the

an application under that specific competitive area for the duration of the approved grant period. 


E. Grantee Share of the Project 


Grantees must provide at least 20 percent of the total approved cost of the project. The total approved cost of the project
is the sum of the ACF share and the non-Federal share. The non-Federal share may be met by cash or in-kind contributions;
although applicants are encouraged to meet their match requirements through cash contributions. Therefore, a project
requesting $300,000 in Federal funds must include a match of at least $75,000 (20% total project cost). 
The non-Federal share may include funds distributed to a tribe, including interest, by the Federal government: 
 Pursuant to the satisfaction of a claim made under Federal law; 
 From funds collected and administered on behalf of such tribe or its constituent members; or 
 For general tribal administration or tribal development under a formula or subject to a tribal budgeting priority
system, such as, but not limited to, funds involved in the settlement of land or other judgment claims, severance or
other royalty payments, or payments under the Indian Self-Determination Act (25 U.S.C. 450f et seq.) or tribal budget
priority system. 
An itemized budget detailing the applicant's non-Federal share, and its source, must be included in an application.
A request for a waiver of the non-Federal share requirement may be submitted in accordance with 45 CFR 1336.50(b)(3)
of the Native American Program Regulations. 
Applications submitted as a partnership arrangement with a school, college, or university, may use contributions
from the ``partner'' organization(s) to meet the non-Federal share, as appropriate. Applications originating
from American Samoa, Guam, Palau, or the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands are covered under section 501(d)
of Public Law 95-134, as amended (48 U.S.C. 1469a) under which HHS waives any requirement for local matching
funds under $200,000 (including in-kind contributions).

(b) The application explains how the community and existing tribal government (where one exists) intends to achieve
these goals. It clearly documents the involvement and support of the community members in the planning process and
implementation of the proposed project as appropriate (e.g., tribal resolutions, minutes of Community meetings,
etc.). 
(c) Available resources (other than ANA and the non-Federal share) which will assist and be coordinated with the project
are described. These resources should be documented by letters or documents of commitment of resources, not merely
letters of support. ``Letters of support'' merely express another organization's endorsement of a proposed project.
Support letters are not binding commitment letters or documents that factually establish the authenticity of other
resources. Letters and other documents of commitment are binding in that they specifically state the nature, amount
and conditions under which another agency or organization will support a project funded with ANA monies. These resources
may be human, natural or financial, and may include other Federal and non-Federal resources. Applicant statements
that additional funding will be sought from other specific sources is 

not

 considered a binding commitment of outside resources. 
If the applicant proposes to enter into a partnership arrangement with a school, college, or university, documentation
of this commitment must be included in the application. 





Note: 

Applicants from the Native American Pacific Islands are not required to provide a 20% match for the non-Federal share
if it is under $200,000 and may not have points reduced for this policy. They are, however, expected to coordinate non-ANA
resources for the proposed project, as are all ANA applicants.



(3) 

Project objectives, approach and activities. 

(25 points). The application proposes specific project objective work plans with activities related to the goal
to ensure the survival and continuing vitality of the Native American language(s). The objective work plan(s) in

(4) 

Evaluation plan. 

(15 points). The proposed objectives will result in specific, measurable outcomes to be achieved that will clearly
contribute to the completion of the overall project and will help the applicant meet its goal to ensure the survival
and continuing vitality of the Native American language(s) addressed. A detailed evaluation plan is provided to
measure project outcomes, including, but not limited to, a demonstration of effective language growth (e.g., increase
of ``language use''). 
(5) 

Replication plan and product preservation plan. 

(10 points). (a) Identify opportunities for the replication of the project or the modification of the project for
use by other Native Americans, if appropriate. If replication is not appropriate, applicant must provide reasons

PART III_GENERAL APPLICATION INFORMATION AND GUIDANCE



A. Definitions 


Funding areas in this program announcement are based on the following definitions: 
 A 

multi-purpose community-based Native American organization

 is an association and/or corporation whose 
charter specifies that the community designates the Board of Directors and/or officers of the organization through
an elective procedure and that the organization functions in several different areas of concern to the members of
the local Native American community. These areas are specified 
in the by-laws and/or policies adopted by the organization. They may include, but need not be limited to, economic,
artistic, cultural, and recreational activities, and the delivery of human services such as health care, day care,
counseling, education, and training. 
 A 

multi-year project

 is a project on a single theme that requires more than 12 months to complete and affords the applicant an opportunity
to develop and address more complex and in-depth strategies than can be completed in one year. A multi-year project
cannot be a series of unrelated objectives with activities presented in chronological order over a two or three year
period. 
 

Core administration

 is funding for staff salaries for those functions which support the organization as a whole, or for purposes unrelated
to the actual management or implementation of work conducted under an ANA approved project.

Environmental regulatory enhancement

 encompasses (but is not limited to) the planning, development, and application of laws, training, monitoring, and
enforcement procedures, tribal courts, environmental laboratories and other facilities, and associated regulatory
activities to strengthen the tribal government's capacity to enhance the quality of reservation life as measured
by the reduction of pollutants in the air, water, soil, food and materials encountered by inhabitants of tribes and
villages. 

 

Language preservation

 is the maintenance of a language so that it will not decline to non-use. 
``Language vitality'' is the active use of a language in a wide range of domains of human life. 

 

Language replication

 is defined as the application of a language program model developed in one community to other linguistically similar
communities. 

 Language survival is defined as the maintenance and continuation of language from one generation to another
in a wide range of aspects of community life. 


B. General Considerations 



Non-ANA resources should be leveraged to strengthen and broaden the impact of the proposed project in the community.
Project designs should explain how those parts of projects which ANA does not fund will be financed through other sources.
For example, ANA does not fund construction. Applicants must show the relationship of non-ANA funded activities
to those objectives and activities that are funded with ANA grant funds. 
Costs of fundraising, including financial campaigns, endowment drives, solicitation of gifts and bequests, and
similar expenses incurred solely to raise capital or obtain contributions are unallowable under a grant award. However,
even though these costs are unallowable for purposes of computing charges to Federal awards, they must be treated
as direct costs for purposes of determining indirect cost rates and be allocated their share of the organization's
indirect costs if they represent activities which (1) include the salaries of personnel, (2) occupy space, and (3)
benefit from the organization's indirect costs. 
All projects funded by ANA must be completed, or self-sustaining or supported with other than ANA funds at the end of
the project period. ``Completed'' means that the project ANA funded is finished, and the desired result(s) have been
attained. ``Self-sustaining'' means that a project will continue without outside resources. ``Supported by other
than ANA funds'' means that the project will continue beyond the ANA project period, but will be supported by funds
other than ANA's. 


C. Activities That Cannot Be Funded By ANA 



The Administration for Native Americans does not fund projects that operate indefinitely or require ANA funding
on a recurring basis. The Administration for Native Americans does not fund objectives or activities for the core
administration of an organization. Under Competitive Area 2, ANA will consider funding core administrative capacity
building projects at the village government level if the village does not have governing systems in place. 

However, functions and activities that are clearly project related are eligible for grant funding. For example,
the management and administrative functions necessary to carry out an ANA approved project are not considered ``core
administration'' and are, therefore, eligible costs. Additionally, ANA will fund the salaries of approved staff
for time actually and reasonably spent to implement a funded ANA project. 

Projects or activities that generally will not meet the purposes of this announcement are discussed further in Part
III, Section H, General Guidance to Applicants, below. 


D. Multi-Year Projects 



Applicants may apply for projects of up to three years. A multi-year project is a project on a single theme that requires
more than 12 months to complete and affords the applicant an opportunity to develop and address more complex and in-depth
strategies than can be completed in one year. Applicants are encouraged to develop multi-year projects. A multi-year
project cannot be a series of unrelated objectives with activities presented in chronological order over a two or
three year period. 

Awards, on a competitive basis, will be for a one-year budget period, although project periods may be for three years.
Applications for continuation grants funded under these awards beyond the one-year budget period, but within the
three-year project period, will be entertained in subsequent years on a non-competitive basis, subject to the availability
of funds, satisfactory progress of the grantee and determination that 
continued funding would be in the best interest of the Government. Therefore, this program announcement does not
apply to current ANA grantees with multi-year projects that apply for continuation funding for their second or third
year budget periods. 


E. Intergovernmental Review of Federal Programs 



This program is not covered by Executive Order 12372 or 45 CFR Part 100.

2. Application Submission 


One signed original, and two copies, of the grant application, including all attachments, may be mailed by the specific
closing date to: 
 Department of Health and Human Services, 
 Administration for Children and Families, 
 Division of Discretionary Grants, 
 370 L'Enfant Promenade, SW., 6th Floor East, OFM/DDG, 
 Washington, DC 20447, Attention: William J. McCarron, 
 ANA No. 93612-951. 

Hand delivered applications are accepted during the normal working hours or 8:00 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., Monday through
Friday, on or prior to the established closing date at: 
 Administration for Children and Families, 
 Division of Discretionary Grants, 
 6th Floor OFM/DDG, 
 901 D Street, SW., Washington, DC 20447. 

The application must be signed by an individual authorized (1) to act for the applicant tribe or organization, and
(2) to assume the applicant's obligations under the terms and conditions of the grant award, including Native American
Program statutory and regulatory requirements. 
Each tribe, Native American organization, or other eligible applicant may compete and receive a grant award in each
of the three competitive areas under this announcement. The Administration for Native Americans will accept only
one application per competitive area from any one applicant. Alaska Native entities may submit a SEDS application
under either competitive area 1 or 2, but not under both. 
If an eligible applicant sends in two applications for the same competitive area, the one with the earlier postmark
will be accepted for review unless the applicant withdraws the earlier application. 


3. Application Consideration 


The Commissioner of the Administration for Native Americans determines the final action to be taken on each grant
application received under this program announcement. 
The following points should be taken into consideration by all applicants: 
 Incomplete applications and applications that do not conform to this announcement will not be accepted for
review. Applicants will be notified in writing of any such determination by ANA. 
 Complete applications that conform to all the requirements of this program announcement are subjected to
a competitive review and evaluation process (discussed in section G below). Independent review panels consisting
of reviewers familiar with (1) American Indian Tribes and Native American communities and organizations, (2) environmental
issues, and (3) Native American languages, as appropriate, evaluates each application using the published criteria
in each funding competitive area. As a result of the review, a numerical score will be assigned to each application.

 The Commissioner's funding decision is based on the review panel's analysis of the application, recommendation
and comments of ANA staff, State and Federal agencies having contract and grant performance related information,
and other interested parties. 
 The Commissioner makes grant awards consistent with the purpose of the Act, all relevant statutory and regulatory
requirements, this program announcement, and the availability of funds. 
 After the Commissioner has made decisions on all applications, unsuccessful applicants are notified in writing
within approximately 120 days of the closing date. The notification will be accompanied by a critique including recommendations
for improving the application. Successful applicants are notified through an official Financial Assistance Award
(FAA) document. The Administration for Native Americans staff cannot respond to requests for information regarding
funding decisions prior to the official notification to the applicants. The FAA will state the amount of Federal funds
awarded, the purpose of the grant, the terms and conditions of the grant award, the effective date of the award, the
project period, the budget period, and the amount of the non-ACF matching share requirement. 



G. The Review Process 


1. Initial Application Review 


Applications submitted by the closing date and verified by the postmark under this program announcement will undergo
a pre-review to determine that: 
 The applicant is eligible in accordance with the Eligible Applicants Section of this announcement; and 
 The application narrative, forms and materials submitted are adequate to allow the review panel to undertake
an in depth evaluation. (All required materials and forms are listed in the Grant Application Checklist in the Application
Kit). 


2. Competitive Review of Accepted Applications 


Applications which pass the pre-review will be evaluated and rated by an independent review panel on the basis of the
specific evaluation criteria listed in Part II. These criteria are used to evaluate the quality of a proposed project,
and to determine the likelihood of its success.

3. Determination of Ineligibility 


Applicants who are initially rejected from competitive evaluation because of ineligibility, may appeal an ANA decision
of applicant ineligibility. Likewise, applicants may also appeal an ANA decision that an applicant's proposed activities
are ineligible for funding consideration. Section 810(b) of the Native American Programs Act, as amen
