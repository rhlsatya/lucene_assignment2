Office of the Secretary

Privacy Act; System of Records



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Office of the Secretary, USDA.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of a New Privacy Act System of Records; Request for Comments.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Forest Service (FS) is proposing to establish a new system of records in accordance with the Privacy Act of 1974
(5 U.S.C. 552a). This system of records, entitled Electronic Corpsmember Information System (ELCID), USDA/FS-51,
is necessary to monitor individual Job Corps Enrollees' educational progress as well as to provide cumulative results
of training programs at each individual Forest Service Job Corps Center. The data could be used to counsel enrollees
as well as to adjust a Center's training program to more effectively meet enrollee needs.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Pursuant to the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. 552a, USDA is proposing to create a new system of records to be maintained by FS.
The purpose of the system of records, entitled ELCID, would be to track administrative information on Job Corps students
so that training for the students may be presented in a most efficient and effective manner. The information compiled
on Job Corps students would include: Name, social security number, address, phone number, date of birth, date of entry,
race, legal guardian, recruiter, test scores from the Test of Adult Basic Education, educational progress, vocational
progress, Job Corps Center progress, behavioral reports, leave record, dormitory assignment, and pay status. The
Forest Service Job Corps Center frequently require such data to be updated and reviewed to train Job Corps students
more effectively. Some of this information (name, address, social security number, date of birth, date of entry,
test scores, educational progress, vocational progress, overall program progress, and pay status) also would be
shared with the Department of Labor's Student Pay Allowance and Management Information System (SPAMIS) date base,
which is located in San Marcos, Texas, at Gary Job Corps Center. SPAMIS is the system that provides the students with
their monthly living allowance. The information that ELCID will compile is currently recorded in the administrative
record of each enrollee. Currently, these records must be reviewed manually for the purpose of discerning trends
in educational progress of enrollees or in the effectiveness of a particular training course. Data would originate
and be maintained at each individual Center.

Availability of Environmental Assessments and Findings of No Significant Impact


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, USDA.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 We are advising the public that 17 environmental assessments and findings of no significant impact have been prepared
by the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service relative to the issuance of permits to allow the field testing of
genetically engineered organisms. The environmental assessments provide a basis for our conclusion that the field
testing of these genetically engineered organisms will not present a risk of introducing or disseminating a plant
pest and will not have a significant impact on the quality of the human environment. Based on its findings of no significant
impact, the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that environmental impact statements need
not be prepared.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The regulations in 7 CFR part 340 (referred to below as the regulations) regulate the introduction (importation,
interstate movement, and release into the environment) of genetically engineered organisms and products that are
plant pests or that there is reason to believe are plant pests (regulated articles). A permit must be obtained before
a regulated article may be introduced into the United States. The regulations set forth the procedures for obtaining
a limited permit for the importation or interstate movement of a regulated article and for obtaining a permit for the
release into the environment of a regulated article. The Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) has stated
that it would prepare an environmental assessment and, when necessary, an environmental impact statement before
issuing a permit for the release into the environment of a regulated article (see 52 FR 22906).


In the course of reviewing each permit application, APHIS assessed the impact on the environment that releasing the
organisms under the conditions described in the permit application would have. APHIS has issued permits for the field
testing of the organisms listed below after concluding that the organisms will not present a risk of plant pest introduction
or dissemination and will not have a significant impact on the quality of the human environment. The environmental
assessments and findings of no significant impact, which are based on data submitted by the applicants and on a review
of other relevant literature, provide the public with documentation of APHIS' review and analysis of the environmental
impacts associated with conducting the field tests.

<USDEPT>COMMODITY FUTURES TRADING COMMISSION</USDEPT>



<DOCTITLE>Proposed Amendments to the NYFE NYSE Composite Index Futures </DOCTITLE>
and Futures Option Contracts 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Commodity Futures Trading Commission.

 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of Proposed Contract Market Rule Changes.

 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The New York Futures Exchange (NYFE) has submitted proposed rule amendments to its NYSE Composite Index (Index) futures
contract to base the final settlement price on the closing level of the Index on the third Friday of the contract month,
rather than on the special opening quotation on the third Friday, and change the last day of trading in the Index futures
and futures option contracts to the third Friday of the contract month from the day preceding the third Friday. 



In accordance with Section 5a(a)(12) of the Commodity Exchange Act, the Commission has determined that publication
of the proposal is in the public interest and will assist the Commission in considering the views of interested persons.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 In April 1987, the Commission approved rule amendments to the NYFE's NYSE Composite Index futures contract providing
that the final settlement price of the futures contract would be based on the special opening quotation of the Index,
rather than on the closing level of the Index, on the third Friday of the contract month. These amendments first went
into effect for the June 1987 contract month.

1

 




The effect of the proposed amendments would be that the final settlement price determination and last trading day
provisions would be identical to the previous rules of the subject contracts, as noted above. Current rules would
continue to apply to contracts expiring prior to June 
1995.

2

 




In its submission, the NYFE noted that the use of the special opening quotation as a basis of cash settlement has caused
confusion among public customers. The level of the Index is disseminated based on the last transaction price of each
of the over 2,400 component stocks. However, the special opening quotation is calculated based on the opening price
of each component stock. Such opening stock prices typically are not determined contemporaneously. Thus, the level
of the special opening quotation may vary from the range of the cash Index level on the expiration Friday. The NYFE noted
such variations have resulted in numerous complaints from public customers. 

The Commission notes that the final settlement prices for certain other broad-based stock index futures contracts
also are based on the closing levels of the relevant indices.

3

 Further, the final settlement prices for certain broad-based stock index option contracts traded on national securities
exchanges also are based on the closing levels of the relevant indices.

4

 





In support of its proposed change, the NYFE noted its belief that the proposed amendments would have no detrimental
impact on the underlying market. According to NYFE staff, there is not significant futures trading volume associated
with direct arbitrage between the subject futures contract and the equities comprising the Index. 

The Commission is requesting comment on the proposed amendments, considering the appropriateness of the revised
procedures relative to the requirements of Commission Guideline No. 1. for cash settled futures contracts. Also,
the Commission requests comment as to whether there are any issues, in addition to the relative extent of cash/futures
arbitrage in this Index, that should be considered by the Commission in its review of the proposal. 

Copies of the proposed amendments will be available for inspection at the Office of the Secretariat, Commodity Futures
Trading Commission, 2033 K Street, NW., Washington, DC 20581. Copies of the proposed rule amendments can be obtained
through the Office of the Secretariat by mail at the above address or by phone at (202) 254-6314. 

The materials submitted by the NYFE in support of the proposed amendments may be available upon request pursuant to
the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) and the Commission's regulations thereunder (17 CFR Part 145 (1987)).
Requests for copies should be made to the FOI, Privacy and Sunshine Act Compliance Staff of the Office of the Secretariat
at the Commission's headquarters in accordance with 17 CFR 145.7 and 145.8. 

Any person interested in submitting written data, views, or arguments on the proposed amendments should send such
comments to Jean A. Webb, Secretary, Commodity Futures Trading Commission, 2033 K Street, NW., Washington, DC 20581
by the specified date.

 


Issued in Washington, DC, on July 19, 1994.

Notice of the Availability of the Environmental Assessment and Negative Declaration Regarding the Consolidation
of the Defense Mapping Agency (DMA) Printing and Distribution Functions to St. Louis, MO



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Defense Mapping Agency.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

In July 1993, in response to a tasking by Major General Raymund E. O'Mara, U.S. Air Force, the Director, DEFENSE MAPPING
AGENCY (DMA), 8613 Lee Highway, Fairfax, VA 22031-2137, and following the disruption to DMA's operations in
the St. Louis, MO area as a result of the floods, a Study Team was established to consider the future of DMA's printing
and distribution operations. On 4 January 1994, the Study Team reported to the Director, DMA, and made certain recommendations
calling for the streamlining of those operations to the end of improving customer service, making better use of resources,
and realizing recurring cost savings. Among other things, the Study Team recommended that a plan to consolidate the
management of the DMA printing and distribution operations and a detailed action plan for the collocation of DMA's
printing and distribution operations in a new facility to be built in the St. Louis, MO area by 1998 be developed. In
an announcement made 7 January 1994, the Director approved the Study Team's recommendations, including the recommendations
to develop a plan to consolidate the DMA printing and distribution operations and to develop an action plan for the
collocation of those operations in St. Louis, MO. As part of that action plan, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Kansas
City District, acting on behalf of the DMA, contracted for an Environmental Assessment of the DMA proposal to consolidate
and collocate printing and distribution. The Environmental Assessment was prepared to evaluate the relocation
of a new site in the St. Louis metropolitan area of certain elements of the DMA Aerospace Center's printing operations
conducted at 8900 South Broadway, St. Louis, MO prior to the flooding and the consolidation to this proposed new St.
Louis location of current DMA printing and distribution activities located at Philadelphia, PA, Bethesda, MD, and
Riverdale, MD.



Notice is hereby given, pursuant to section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, the Council
on Environmental Quality Guidelines (40 Code of Federal Regulations (C.F.R.) Part 1500) and Department of Defense
Regulation ``Environmental Effects in the United States of DoD Actions'' (32 C.F.R. Part 188) that an Environmental
Impact Statement is not being prepared for the proposed consolidation of the DMA printing and distribution operations
and their collocation in the St. Louis, MO area at the Richardson Road site located near I-55 in northeast Jefferson
County, MO. The Environmental Assessment of this proposed action indicates that the proposed action will not create
any significant adverse impact on the physical environment and that no significant controversy related to the natural
environment is associated therewith. As a result of these findings, the Chief, Safety and Health Division, Human
Resources Directorate, DMA, has determined that the preparation of an Environmental Impact Statement is not required
in this case.

It is anticipated that approximately 250 positions Agency-wide will be reduced as a result of this proposed action.
Retraining, relocation and retirement incentives will be used to minimize the impact of this consolidation; however,
pending a final agency decision, the specifics of any such incentives have yet to be developed.

The Environmental Assessment and the Finding of No Significant Impact are on file and may be reviewed by interested
parties.

<USDEPT>DEFENSE NUCLEAR FACILITIES SAFETY BOARD</USDEPT>



<DOCTITLE>Resolution of Potential Conflict of Interest</DOCTITLE>



The Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board (Board) has identified and resolved a potential conflict of interest
situation related to its contractor, Mr. Nicholas P. Armenis. This Notice satisfies the requirements of 10 CFR 1706.8(e)
with respect to publication in the 

Federal Register

. Under the Board's Organizational and Consultant Conflict of Interests Regulations, 10 CFR Part 1706 (OCI Regulations),
an organizational or consultant conflict of interest (OCI) means that because of other past, present, or future planned
activities or relationships, a contractor or consultant is unable, or potentially unable, to render impartial assistance
or advice to the Board, or the objectivity of such offeror or contractor in performing work for the Board is or might
be otherwise impaired, or such offeror or contractor has or would have an unfair competitive advantage. While the
OCI Regulations provide that contracts shall generally not be awarded to an organization where the Board has determined
that an actual or potential OCI exists and cannot be avoided, the Board may waive this requirement in certain circumstances.

The Board's mission is to provide advice and recommendations to the Department of Energy (DOE) regarding public health
and safety matters related to DOE's defense nuclear facilities. This includes the review and evaluation of the content
and implementation of health and safety standards including DOE orders, rules, and other safety requirements, relating
to the design, construction, operation and decommissioning of DOE defense nuclear facilities. In late 1991, Congress
amended the Board's enabling Act, broadening the Board's jurisdiction over defense nuclear facilities to include
the assembly, disassembly, and the testing of nuclear weapons. With this increase in responsibility, the Board revised
its priorities to include reviews of additional facilities, including, principally the Pantex Plant (Pantex),
Nevada Test Site (NTS), and additional facilities at Oak Ridge Y-12 Plant. The Board also recognized the need
to direct its attention to the activities of the weapons design laboratories such as Los Alamos National Laboratory
(LANL), Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), and Sandia National Laboratory (Sandia).

Two matters of immediate concern to the Board are the safety of ongoing weapons disassembly operations and maintenance
of the capability to safely conduct nuclear testing operations. While the DOE had been engaged in these activities
for decades, significant changes in the national security posture resulted in shifts in emphasis within DOE. Unprecedented
numbers of simultaneous nuclear weapon retirements strained DOE's capabilities to develop and implement safe and
well-engineered procedures. A Congressionally-mandated and Presidentially-extended nuclear testing moratorium
removed the primary mechanism (i.e., an active, ongoing testing program) by which the capability to execute tests
safely was exercised and ensured. At the same time, the weapons programs at the nuclear weapons laboratories were
losing skilled and experienced personnel due to retirement, downsizing, and reassignments. This combination of
issues required the Board to increase its attention, and with it the number of associated reviews, at both Pantex and
the NTS. Further, the Board recognized that it needed individuals with expertise in multiple technical disciplines,
not previously required, to effectively meet the challenges and responsibilities of its new authority. These technical
disciplines included conventional and nuclear explosive technology and safety, nuclear materials handling and
storage, criticality safety, and nuclear weapons assembly, disassembly, storage and testing.

While the Board initiated an employee recruitment effort for individuals with formal training and experience in
weapons related disciplines, it also recognized a need for technical assistance from outside experts who have direct
relevant experience in this area. The Board identified Mr. Nicholas P. Armenis as an individual with the requisite
knowledge and experience needed to provide the Board with immediate assistance in the weapons area and entered into
an agreement with him for support services. Under this arrangement, Mr. Armenis provides technical expertise with
respect to the design of nuclear weapons currently being returned to Pantex for dismantlement, including historical
insight related to specific design and test details of the weapons systems. In particular, his expertise related
to the mechanical aspects of weapons physics packages is being utilized to ensure the safe disassembly, handling,
and storage of these nuclear weapons systems. Through the Board's direction, he has participated in reviews of various
weapon dismantlement procedures, observed the complete dismantlement of selected weapons, and provided valuable
insight into DOE developed operating and inspection standards for these activities. The Board believes that its
activities, supported by Mr. Armenis, have contributed to the following achievements at Pantex; institution of
a practice whereby the responsible DOE laboratories (LANL, LLNL, Sandia) review procedures for disassembly of nuclear
weapons for identification of potential safety questions; and improved conduct of operations in disassembly of
nuclear weapons.

<TEXT>
 

The Board has subsequently learned that Mr. Armenis is providing consulting services to LANL that may create a potential
conflict of interest with his work for the Board. Specifically, Mr. Armenis assists the LANL staff in compiling complete
development reports for weapons that are presently in the stockpile and in preparing final documentation for NTS
tests that have been executed since none of the weapons have been thoroughly documented and final NTS device data has
not been compiled. His efforts involve working with LANL engineers in the proper compilation of data to assure consistency
in methods and to prevent the exclusion of critical details of this historical reconstruction of information.
The Board reviewed this situation and concluded that, even if the circumstances could give rise to a potential conflict
of interest situation, it is nonetheless in the best interest of the Government to have Mr. Armenis continue to provide
support to the Board for the reasons described below. Mr. Armenis possesses a comprehensive understanding of nuclear
weapons assembly and dismantlement procedures based on his approximately forty years of direct involvement in these
activities. He spent thirty years working at LANL as a design engineer and supervisor involved in the design and assembly
of nuclear devices from 1948 through 1977. He also assisted in the technical management and administration of a LANL
unit which was responsible for nuclear design, nuclear device assembly, production specifications liaison with
DOE contractors, and feasibility studies for various weapon programs. Further, since his departure from LANL, Mr.
Armenis has worked as a consultant for his former employer in this technical area. His efforts included reviews of
NTS test device records to determine document retention issues and the research of weapon development records. This
research has resulted in written histories of the development of various stockpile weapons. Therefore, Mr. Armenis's
unparalleled blend of hands-on expertise in the development of assembly and disassembly procedures of nuclear weapons,
coupled with his more recent work in research and recreation of these activities, makes him uniquely qualified to
assist the Board in its health and safety reviews of current DOE weapons disassembly efforts.
The Board also examined Mr. Armenis's current financial relationship with LANL, which includes a vested pension
program and approximately twelve weeks a year of the consulting work described above, and considered the potential
effect it may have on his objectivity in performing the Board's work. Based on this review, the Board determined that
these relationships should not interfere with his work for the Board since the pension, and any future increases,
is calculated according to fixed formulas and prior contributions, and the relative value of his LANL consulting
effort is low compared to the number of hours actually worked by Mr. Armenis each year.
Further, the continued use of Mr. Armenis by the Board is consistent with the spirit and intent of Board Recommendation
93-6 to the Secretary of Energy dated December 10, 1993. This recommendation highlights the need for DOE to retain
access to capability and capture the unique knowledge of individuals who have been engaged for many years in certain
critical defense nuclear activities in order to avoid future safety problems in these and related areas. The Board's
concern is that while documentation essential to DOE's current weapons dismantlement program exists on the design
and safety aspects of nuclear weapons, it is also important, for safety reasons, to involve individuals from the design
laboratories of LANL, LLNL, and Sandia. These individuals should participate in reviews of detailed dismantlement
procedures and specialized procedures and should respond to problems encountered in the course of weapon dismantlement.
The design individuals from the laboratories most needed in connection with dismantlement of a specific weapon are
those who had been active in the original design of that weapon.These individuals are believed to possess information
not recorded in documentation, such as reasons for specific design features and personal knowledge of any problems
that have arisen during design, fabrication, and stockpile life. Therefore, while the Board believes that DOE must
retain and utilize certain expertise in the weapons area, it also recognizes the value of acquiring specialized technical
support from Mr. Armenis in the fulfillment of its health and safety responsibilities.
The Board also recognized that it is unlikely that the work being performed by Mr. Armenis could be satisfactorily
performed by anyone else whose experience and affiliations would not give rise to a conflict of interest question.
That is because the individuals who have the requisite expertise in this area could only have obtained such expertise
through previous or current employment or consulting relationship with one or more of the weapons design laboratories.
The pertinent experience of other qualified individuals would therefore likely raise similar conflicting questions.
Finally, as the Board is required under its OCI Regulations, where reasonably possible, to initiate measures which
attempt to mitigate an OCI, Mr. Armenis and the Board agreed to the following during contract performance. Should
the effort Mr. Armenis is currently performing for LANL change from only providing assistance in the historical recreation
of past weapons activities to one of assessing the adequacy or safety of current weapons disassembly procedures or
some other task which would directly conflict with work he performs for the Board, he will immediately notify the Board,
which then will take further action as appropriate. Also, the efforts of Mr. Armenis will be overseen by experienced
technical staff of the Board who are able to ensure that all of his resultant work products are impartial and contain
full support for any findings and recommendations issued thereunder.
Accordingly, on the basis of the determination described above and pursuant to the applicable provisions of 10 CFR
part 1706, the Chairman of the Board granted a waiver of any conflicts of interests (and the pertinent provisions of
the OCI Regulations) with the Board's contract with Mr. Nicholas P. Armenis that might arise out of his existing relationship
with LANL.

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of arbitration panel decision under the Randolph-Sheppard Act.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 Notice is hereby given that on March 22, 1991, an arbitration panel rendered a decision in the matter of 

David Terry, Vendor, 

v.

 State of Tennessee, Department of Human Services (Docket No. R-S/89-4).

 This panel was convened by the Secretary of the Department of Education pursuant to 20 U.S.C. 107d-2, upon receipt
of a complaint filed by petitioner David Terry.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Pursuant to the Randolph-Sheppard Act (20 U.S.C. 107d-2(c)), the Secretary publishes a synopsis of arbitration
panel decisions affecting the administration of vending facilities on Federal property. 


Background 



David Terry, complainant, is a blind vendor licensed by the respondent, the Tennessee Department of Human Services
(TDHS). Mr. Terry signed an agreement with TDHS to operate vending facility 

#

249 located in the Safety Building in Knoxville, Tennessee. He began operation in July 1986. TDHS was given the right
to establish and maintain a food concession at the Public Safety Building by entering into an agreement with the City
of Knoxville, Tennessee, on March 21, 1972.

The State Licensing Agency (SLA), through its Department of Rehabilitation, operates the Tennessee Vending Facility
Program for blind vendors. The purpose of the program is to establish and support blind vendors operating vending
facilities on State, local, and Federal property. As the agency designated in Tennessee to carry out and manage the
vending facility program established by the Act, the SLA duly promulgated rules and regulations to govern the State
vending facility program. These rules and regulations are comprehensive in scope. Based on the State's Randolph-Sheppard
rules and regulations governing its program, Mr. Terry was required to make monthly income reports, paying a set-aside
fee based upon those monthly reports, and to maintain personal liability and product liability insurance. 

Mr. Terry, as noted previously, began his operation in July 1986. The major part of his sales came from persons employed
in the building and from trustees and inmates of the City Jail located on the second floor. In December 1986, only five
months after Mr. Terry started his operation, the City of Knoxville transferred operation of the City Jail to the Knox
County Sheriff's Department. The Sheriff's Department established on the second floor its own food commissary operated
by a sighted person and placed a cigarette machine on that floor as well. In January 1987, Mr. Terry complained to his
business enterprise counselor regarding the new commissary and vending machine possibly violating the priority
provided by the State rules and regulations to licensed blind persons. As a result of Mr. Terry's complaint, the cigarette
machine was removed in February 1987. However, the commissary remained. Mr. Terry then complained to the Committee
of Blind Vendors, the State representative body for all blind vendors. In July, the Sheriff agreed to allow Mr. Terry
to operate a concession booth in the Jail Intake Center, but, within a week, the Sheriff reversed this decision due
to alleged safety and security reasons. 

During the operation of his vending facility, Mr. Terry was warned about his poor performance in failing to file the
required monthly reports and to pay the set-aside fees. Due to these reasons, the agency terminated Mr. Terry's license
in March 1988. 

Mr. Terry filed a grievance on April 26, 1988, regarding the termination of his license. He also sought financial relief
for the period prior to his termination during which the Sheriff permitted operations that competed with his facility.
The Hearing Officer and the TDHS Commissioner denied the complaint. The TDHS Commissioner found that the evidence
did not establish that Mr. Terry sustained damages because of the Sheriff's actions.

Mr. Terry then filed a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education on January 6, 1989, requesting arbitration.
The arbitration panel was convened, and the hearing was held in Knoxville, Tennessee, on September 21, 1990. 



Arbitration Panel Decision 



In the substantive issues in this case, the panel agreed that Mr. Terry was harmed by the competing commissary and cigarette
machine established by the Sheriff, thereby diverting sales previously enjoyed by Mr. Terry. The panel also concluded
that Mr. Terry was partly responsible for the circumstances leading to his license termination because he was consistently
delinquent in filing his reports and in paying his fees. This conduct began prior to the Sheriff's actions. The panel
found that the adverse impact on Mr. Terry's facility was relevant to his inability to pay set-aside fees and to some
extent to the quality of his operations. Because of this adverse impact, the panel found that there was good cause for
the failure of Mr. Terry to pay the required set-aside fees. In determining damages due Mr. Terry, the panel took into
consideration the fact that Mr. Terry contributed to the circumstances that led to the termination of his license.


Mr. Terry claimed he was due damages in the amount of $400.00 per month from January 1987 through April 1988 (the month
of the termination of his license) or $6,400, and $1,500 for each month since the termination of his license or $49,500.
Because Mr. Terry's losses were caused in part by his own delinquencies, the panel ordered the SLA to pay Mr. Terry the
sum of $30,000, less set-aside fees he owes the agency in full and less his interim earnings in full. The arbitration
panel also ordered that Mr. Terry be reinstated in the program at a facility reasonably equivalent to the Public Safety
Building. The panel concluded that attorney's fees were allowable. 

The panel member selected by the SLA filed a dissenting opinion in which he maintained that the State was entitled to
the sovereign immunity embodied in the Eleventh Amendment to the United States Constitution. In his opinion, the
State did not waive this immunity by participating in the Randolph-Sheppard program and did not have to pay monetary
damages. 

The views and opinions expressed by the panel do not necessarily represent the views and opinions of the U.S. Department
of Education.

<DOCTITLE>Floodplain Statement of Findings for Proposed K-901 Operable Unit, Remedial Investigation Activities at
the K-25 Site, Oak Ridge, TN</DOCTITLE>


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Department of Energy (DOE).


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Floodplain Statement of Findings.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This is a Floodplain Statement of Findings for the proposed K-901 Operating Unit (OU) remedial investigation
activities at the Oak Ridge K-25 Site, prepared in accordance with 10 CFR 1022. DOE proposes to conduct remedial
investigation activities in the 100-year floodplain of the Clinch River located in Roane County, Tennessee. DOE
prepared a floodplain assessment describing the effects, alternatives, and measures designed to avoid or minimize
potential harm to or within the affected floodplain. DOE will endeavor to allow 15 days of public review after publication
of the statement of findings before implementing the proposed action.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 This is a Floodplain Statement of Findings for the proposed remedial investigation activities on the K-901
OU at K-25, prepared in accordance with 10 CFR Part 1022. A Notice of Floodplain/Wetlands Involvement was published
in the 

Federal Register

 [58 Fed Reg 51624 (October 4, 1993)] and a floodplain assessment was completed; no wetlands are involved in the proposed
action. DOE is proposing to conduct remedial investigation activities in characterize the site as to ground-water
quality, movement, and interaction with surface water and the types and levels of contaminants present and being
released from the OU. Surface water and sediment investigations would provide information to evaluate migration
pathway and contaminant load transported by the pathway. Soil investigation activities would focus on delineating
contamination within the OU and defining specific contaminant sources.


The proposed action employs various sampling techniques including: (1) installation of ground-water monitoring
wells; (2) drilling boreholes with a hollow-stem auger drilling rig; and (3) using hand augers and other manual sampling
methods. Some of the sampling activities associated with K-901 OU would be located in the 100-year floodplain
of the Clinch River. None of these activities would adversely impact the floodplain or measurably change flood levels.
Rather, implementation of the proposed action would have an overall positive effect on the environment and human
health by providing information to delineate contamination within the OU in order that remedial actions can be taken
to reduce the amount of contaminants entering the environment.
Drilling equipment access to some sampling sites may require some new gravel roads and the removal of some trees; however,
use of existing roadways and clearings would be optimized to reduce tree and vegetation removal. While most roadways
would be reclaimed and revegetated, some would be left in place to provide access to monitoring wells. In addition,
approximately 5 to 10 temporary drilling pads (25 ft  x  25 ft  x  1 ft) would be required; the land under these
pads would be reclaimed and revegetated at the conclusion of the action. Site access road construction and pad installation
activities would not measurably reduce the flood storage capacity of the floodplain, interfere with stream flow,
or produce hazardous flood velocities; therefore, no special mitigative measures would be required. Best management
practices, such as the placement of seals on the monitoring wells to prevent infiltration of surface water and the
mixing of ground water, would be implemented to ensure that only minimal amounts of disturbance to the floodplain
would occur.
Two alternatives to the proposed action were considered_no action and the relocation of sampling locations outside
of the floodplain. Both alternatives would ensure no disturbance of the floodplain but would seriously impact efforts
to characterize the site, result in an unacceptable remedial action plan, and would not be protective of human health
or the environment because the nature and extent of contamination would not be fully known.
The proposed action has been designed to avoid or minimize impacts to the 100-year floodplain and no adverse impacts
to the floodplain are expected to occur. The proposed action does confirm to applicable State floodplain standards.
DOE will endeavor to allow 15 days of public review after publication of the statement of findings prior to implementing
the proposed action.

<DOCTITLE>Golden Field Office; Notice of Financial Assistance Award to Geothermal Resources Council</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Department of Energy.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of financial assistance award in response to a non-competitive financial assistance application.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) pursuant to the DOE Financial Assistance Rules, 10 CFR 600.7(b)(2) is announcing
its intention make a financial assistance award to the Geothermal Resources Council to distribute educational material
and to provide a service to the geothermal community.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

This proposal was a solicited application. The Geothermal Resource Council, with headquarters in Davis, California,
is a non-profit organization incorporated in the state of California, has been funded in the past by the DOE-Geothermal
Program Office through a contract with Sandia National Laboratory. However, the Department believes that since
this effort is intended to benefit the United States public, that a grant mechanism is a more appropriate method of
providing funding. Competition for this effort would have an adverse effect on continuity and completion of the activities.



The programmatic evaluation [see 10 CFC 600.7(b)(2)(ii)(D)] completed for this proposal resulted in a recommendation
to fund this application for the following reasons:

The proposed project will contribute to the DOE mission of ``* * * providing the scientific and educational
foundation and technology * * * necessary to achieve efficiency in energy use, diversity in energy
sources, and access to technical information * * *'' (quotation from the Energy Mission Statement).
The Geothermal Resources Council (GRC) will do this by providing services to support the geothermal industry through
various activities and projects that are described below.

Through this financial assistance the GRC (a non-profit organization) will be able to continue to act as a focal point
for the geothermal industry. The objectives for this grant are as follows:

(1) Develop Geothermal Poster_The poster will show the major components of geothermal resource development: history
occurrence, exploration, production, utilization, potential and its environmental advantageous. The poster
will be distributed to Junior and Senior high school and college students.

(2) GRC Annual Meeting_The DOE would be a sponsor for the annual GRC meeting where papers are presented and discussed.
At the 1993 annual GRC meeting, there were approximately 600 registered attendees and 60 vendors.

(3) Drilling School_Well Control Course_This course will certify regulators in well control, thereby helping to
ensure geothermal drilling operations are conducted in an environmentally sound manner.

(4) Expansion of the GRC On-line Library_The current database will be enlarged by adding new citations and increasing
the keywords that can be searched for. The library will be a valuable tool for the geothermal community.

(5) Geothermal Heat Pump Training Center_Provide the seed money to design and construct a heat pump training center.
The training center would be used to train dealers, architects, engineers, students, etc. on topics such as Heating
Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) basics of heat pumps, HVAC heat pump installation and service and ground
loop installation. The Geothermal Heat Pump Training Center would only be used for training purposes, no research
will be conducted at this site. The majority of the funding will be provided by utilities and heat pump manufacturers.

(6) World Solar Summit_Two GRC representatives will attend the World Solar Summit in Barcelona, Spain with the purpose
of establishing and maintaining foreign governmental and industrial contacts that are critical for the U.S. geothermal
export program.

The probability of meeting the objectives listed below are very high, given that the GRC has been successful in the
past for similar endeavors.

The staff of the Geothermal Resources Council is uniquely qualified to provide this service. The GRC Staff is well
known and respected throughout the geothermal industry.

The GRC's base of operations is in an office that is fully capable of meeting their needs.

The budget proposed for the anticipated work was reviewed and is considered to be appropriate and adequate.

The major public benefit to be derived from the projects and activities are providing educational material to various
stakeholders (i.e., students, teachers, utilities, industry, and the public), and a technology transfer service
to the geothermal community. The services that are being provided through this grant are: Forums for presentation
and discussion of topics of general interest to the geothermal community; an educational program to keep well regulators
updated and certified, expansion of an on-line library which provides access to publications on geothermal energy,
as well as a list of geothermal power plants worldwide and a list of vendors of U.S. geothermal goods and services, assistance
in providing a training center for geothermal heat pumps which is a very efficient method of heating and cooling buildings,
and help in promoting the exportation of U.S. goods and services.

The services provided through the proposed grant are vital and strongly support the geothermal program's direction
and objectives. The Geothermal Resources Council, a Section 501 (c)(3) organization, is uniquely qualified and
positioned to perform the above mentioned tasks since the GRC is an accepted and respected industry organization.
The GRC has established an information network which is continually growing. The effort is a continuation of work
which has been funded by DOE and competition for this effort would have a significant adverse impact on the continuity
of the proposed activities.

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of Acceptance of an Unsolicited Application.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Department of Energy (DOE), DOE Chicago Operations Office, announces that pursuant to the DOE Financial Assistance
Rule, 10 CFR 600.14(f), it intends to award a grant based on the acceptance of an unsolicited application to the University
of Maryland at College Park. The objective of the work provided by this grant is to quantify the potential Electrohydrodynamic
(EHD) technique for heat transfer enhancement of in-tube condensation and in-tube evaporation processes of selected
ozone-safe refrigerants and refrigerant mixtures.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The University of Maryland at College Park has the necessary personnel, facilities, and other resources to fully
perform the work set forth in the grant. Currently, this university is the only known group that has ongoing research
especially in the EHD augmentation of heat transfer in heat exchanger. Within the last six years the university has
maintained a comprehensive computer search of EHD-enhancement technology world-wide and the state-of-the-art
equipment for use in EHD and Chlorofluorocarbons (CFC) substitute research. This University also developed a unique
and innovative theoretical computer models to analyze the effects of new EHD configuration and effects. This application
is meritorious based on the general evaluation that it will support a DOE mission for the research and development
of highly efficient alternatives to, and substitutes for, environmentally harmful CFC and CFC-dependent euipment
used in refrigeration application and that it is relevant to the general public purpose of support in the areas of reducing
the effects of stratospheric ozone depletion. This application represents unique and innovative idea, method and
approach which would not be eligible for financial assistance under a recent, current, or planned solicitation,
and, DOE has determined that, a competitive solicitation would be inappropriate. The project period for this grant
renewal is for a twenty-four month period expected to begin August 1, 1994. DOE plans to provide funding in the amount
of $206,000.00 for this project period.

Reporting Requirements




Woodman-Iannetti Oil Company, Great Bend, KS, LEE-0104




Woodman-Iannetti Oil Company filed an Application for Exception requesting exception relief from the requirement
that the firm file the Energy Information Administration (EIA) Form EIA-23, the ``Annual Survey of Domestic
Oil and Gas Reserves.'' In considering the Application for Exception, the DOE tentatively found that the firm was
not adversely affected by the reporting requirement in a way that was significantly different than the burden by similar
reporting firms. Accordingly, on May 3, 1994, the DOE issued a Proposed Decision and Order determining that the exception
request should be denied.




Hunt Oil Co., Pierce, ID, LEE-0086

 


Hunt Oil Co. filed an Application for Exception to relieve it from the requirement to prepare and file Form EIA-782B
with the DOE Energy Information Administration. On May 3, 1994, the Department of Energy issued a Proposed Decision
and Order which tentatively concluded that the exception request should be granted in part and Hunt be relieved of
its reporting requirement until August 1, 1994.

During the week of May 16 through May 20, 1994, the decisions and orders summarized below were issued with respect to
applications for refund or other relief filed with the Office of Hearings and Appeals of the Department of Energy.
The following summary also contains a list of submissions that were dismissed by the Office of Hearings and Appeals.




Supplemental Order 



341 Tract Unit of the Citronelle Field, 

5/18/94, 

LFX-0008 




The DOE issued a Decision and Order concerning the disbursement of an escrow fund made available as a result of the termination
of exception relief issued to The 341 Tract Unit of the Citronelle Field. The escrow fund, which is continuing to accrue
interest, totals approximately $131 million. OHA decided that refiners as a group absorbed 5.4 percent of the cost
of that exception relief. Each refiner listed on the Entitlements List for November 1980 will receive an allocable
share of the escrow fund based on its percentage of runs to stills during that month. Refiners' final refunds will be
based on the 5.4 percent absorption rate. 



Refund Applications 



Enron Corporation/Odessa L.P.G. Transport, Inc., 

5/17/94, 

RF340-95 




Odessa L.P.G. Transport, Inc. (Odessa) submitted an Application for Refund in the Enron Corporation refund proceeding.
The DOE found that Odessa had proved that it was injured with respect to Enron propane that it purchased and resold during
the period June 1974 through January 1981. Accordingly, the DOE granted Odessa a principal refund of $116,781 for
this product and accrued interest of $47,635. The total refund granted to Odessa was $164,416. 




The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company, 

5/18/94, 

RF272-89582, RR272-92 




Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company (Goodyear), a major manufacturer and retailer of tires and industrial rubber
products, filed a Motion for Reconsideration of a Decision and Order that denied in part a crude oil refund application
it had filed. In its reconsideration request, Goodyear argued that the DOE had erroneously denied it a refund with
respect to its purchases of specified products. The DOE rejected Goodyear's arguments with respect to all the products
except isoprene. Although the DOE determined that isoprene was not an eligible product, the DOE further determined
that, for certain purchases, Goodyear had rebutted the end-user presumption of injury, i.e., the presumption that
the isoprene supplier, as the end-user of eligible products used to make isoprene, is presumed injured by crude oil
overcharges. The DOE based the latter determination on Goodyear's showing that for a portion of the refund period,
one of Goodyear's isoprene suppliers had increased isoprene prices to Goodyear based on a dollar for dollar increase
in its crude oil costs and, therefore, that for those purchases Goodyear bore the impact of overcharges attributable
to isoprene feedstocks. The DOE, therefore, granted Goodyear an additional crude oil refund in the amount of $3,554.


The DOE also considered two other products for which Goodyear had previously sought a crude oil refund but which the
DOE elected to defer in its earlier decision pending the submission of additional evidence by Goodyear. The two products
at issue were butadiene and petroleum wax. After reviewing the evidence and/or arguments Goodyear had presented,
the DOE determined that Goodyear had failed to demonstrate that the products in question had been produced in a crude
oil refinery. Accordingly, the DOE concluded that those products were not eligible for a crude oil refund.

<DOCTITLE>Issuance of Decisions and Orders the Week of May 23 through May 27, 1994 </DOCTITLE>



During the week of May 23 through May 27, 1994, the decisions and orders summarized below were issued with respect to
appeals and applications for other relief filed with the Office of Hearings and Appeals of the Department of Energy.
The following summary also contains a list of submissions that were dismissed by the Office of Hearings and Appeals.

 


Appeal




Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer & Feld, 5/26/94, LFA-0368 




Akin Gump, Strauss, Hauer & Feld (Akin Gump) filed an Appeal from a determination issued by the FOI and Privacy
Acts Branch, Reference and Information Management Division of the Department of Energy (DOE Headquarters) in response
to a request from Akin Gump under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). Akin Gump sought the U.S.Russia Highly Enriched
Uranium Purchase Agreement signed by President Bill Clinton and Russian President Boris Yeltsin (Purchase Agreement).
In considering the Appeal, the Office of Hearings and Appeals found that DOE Headquarters performed an adequate search
for the Purchase Agreement. Accordingly, the Appeal was denied. 



Introductory Order 



Westinghouse Hanford Company, 5/26/94, LWZ-0031 





Westinghouse Hanford Company (WHC) filed a Motion to Dismiss the underlying complaint and hearing request filed
by Helen ``Gai'' Oglesbee under the Department of Energy's Contractor Employee Protection Program, 10 C.F.R. Part
708. On August 24, 1992, Oglesbee filed a complaint under Part 708 with the DOE Richland Field Office (DOE/RL) which
was forwarded to the Office of Contractor Employee Protection on October 2, 1992. In his Decision, the Hearing Officer
found that: (1) the OCEP Director did not abuse her discretion in accepting Oglesbee's complaint as timely filed;
(2) it was unnecessary to determine whether Oglesbee's complaint specifically met each of the criteria outlined
in 10 C.F.R.  708.6, since the decision to accept a complaint is clearly within the discretion of the OCEP; (3)
WHC was not prejudiced by the OCEP's acceptance of the complaint. Accordingly, WHC's Motion was denied. 



Implementation of Special Refund Procedures 


County Fuel Company, INC., 5/24/94, LEF-0015 





The DOE issued a Decision and Order implementing procedures for the distribution of $38,214.98, plus accrued interest,
in alleged overcharges obtained from County Fuel Company, Inc. These funds were remitted to settle possible pricing
violations in its sales of motor gasoline during portions of 1979 and 1980. The DOE determined that these funds will
be distributed in accordance with the DOE Petroleum Overcharge Distribution and Restitution Act of 1986 (PODRA).
Accordingly, Applications for Refund will be accepted from any party who purchased refined petroleum products during
the specified periods, March 1, 1979 through March 18, 1980. The specific information to be included in Applications
for Refund is included in the Decision. 



Refund Application 



National Railroad Passenger Corporation, 5/27/94, RF272-21241 




The DOE issued a Decision and Order concerning an Application for Refund filed on behalf of the National Railroad Passenger
Corporation (Amtrak) in the crude oil overcharge special refund proceeding being conducted by the DOE under 10 C.F.R.
Part 205, Subpart V. The DOE determined that the refund claim was meritorious and granted a refund of $535,554. The
DOE denied the Objections filed by a group of States, finding that the econometric data submitted by the States did
not rebut the presumption that the Applicant was injured by the crude oil overcharges. In addition, the DOE denied
the Objections filed by a group of Utilities, Transporters, and Manufacturers, finding that (1) Even if Amtrak were
a government authority, it would still be eligible for a refund for its own purchases of refined petroleum products
and (2) because Amtrak was specifically excluded from the Settlement Agreement does not exclude it from the DOE's
crude oil refund proceeding.

Central Nebraska Public Power and Irrigation District Nebraska Public Power District; Notice Extending Time to
Comment on Revised Draft Environmental Impact Statement



July 18, 1994.



On April 1, 1994, the Commission issued a revised draft environmental impact statement (RDEIS) on applications for
relicensing the Kingsley Dam Project No. 1417 and the North Plate/Keystone Diversion Dam No. 1835. These two hydropower
projects are located on the North Platte, South Platte, and Platte Rivers in Nebraska. Comments on the RDEIS are currently
due on July 25, 1994.

Several parties have filed motions requesting or supporting an extension of time to comment on the RDEIS. Interior
seeks an extension until August 12, 1994, to submit comments on the RDEIS that will incorporate pulse flow recommendations
to be included in its revised recommendations under Section 10(j) of the Federal Power Act. EPA requests a conference
on water quality issues pursuant to its EIS review authority, and seeks a further extension of the comment period on
the RDEIS to September 8, 1994, to permit the conference to be held.

Interior states that the pulse flow recommendations are its highest priority and, together with its other Section
10(j) recommendations, will form the basis for formal consultation with the Commission under Section 7 of the Endangered
Species Act. In view of the potential significance of Interior's recommendations in these proceedings, the extension
is reasonable and will be granted.






EPA states that a conference is needed to assist the parties in evaluating the RDEIS and to discuss issues related to
water quality, such as minimum flows to meet water quality temperature standards and the Commission's role under
Section 401 of the Clean Water Act. However, by letter dated July 12, 1994, Governor Nelson of Nebraska questioned
the need for a conference and informed the Commission that the State has no plans to change or reconsider its Section
401 certifications for these projects. In view of the general nature of EPA's request, the advanced stage of these
proceedings, and the information presented in Governor Nelson's letter, the Commission staff has determined that
there is no need for a conference on water quality issues as part of the EIS process.

The comment period on the RDEIS is extended to August 12, 1994. Anyone wishing to comment in writing on the RDEIS must
do so by that date. Comments must be filed with the Secretary, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol
Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426. Comments should clearly reference the Kingsley Dam Project No. 1417 and the North
Platte/Keystone Diversion Dam Project No. 1835 on the first page.

<DOCTITLE>General Services Administration; Notice of Application for the Construction, Operation, Maintenance, and Connection
of Facilities for Importation of Natural Gas at the United States/ Canada International Boundary</DOCTITLE>


July 18, 1994. 



Take notice that on July 12, 1994, the General Services Administration (GSA), Denver Federal Center, Building 41,
Room 200, P.O. Box 25006, Denver, Colorado, 80225-006, filed an application pursuant to section 3 of the Natural
Gas Act, Executive Order No. 10485, as amended by Executive Order No. 12038; and Delegation Order No. 0204-112
of the Secretary of Energy. GSA seeks a Presidential Permit for a point of entry for the importation of natural gas and
section 3 authority to construct, operate, maintain and connect natural gas import facilities. The proposed facilities
will extend from the Canadian border to the Piegan Immigration and Customs Station near Babb, Montana. GSA's proposal
is more fully set forth in the application which is on file with the Commission and open to public inspection. 

GSA says the import facilities will consist of 2,155 feet of 1 and one-half inch pipe. The proposed pipe will deliver
up to 146 Mcf per day to the Piegan Border Station and several adjacent Staff residences. The estimated cost of the facilities
is $12,500. The line will connect to the facilities of the Chief Mountain Natural Gas Cooperative, who will also build
a tap and meter in Canada. GSA says that natural gas service is needed to replace propane which currently fuels heating
equipment at the Piegan Border Station. GSA says the current propane heating system is sub-standard and violates
local mechanical codes. The GSA requests that the Commission grant this application on an expedited basis.

Any person desiring to be heard or to protest this application should file a motion to intervene or protest on or before
August 1, 1994, in accordance with Rules 211 and 214 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure. All motions
to intervene or protests should be submitted to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street,
N.E., Washington, D.C. 20426. All protests filed will be considered, but will not serve to make protestants parties
to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party must file a motion to intervene in accordance with Rule 214.

July 18, 1994.



Take notice that on July 7, 1994, Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America (Natural), 701 East 22nd Street, Lombard,
Illinois 60148 and K N Interstate Gas Transmission Company (K N Interstate), 370 Van Gordon Street, Lakewood, Colorado
80228, filed in Docket No. CP94-650-000 an application pursuant to Section 7(b) of the Natural Gas Act
for permission and approval to abandon an exchange service between Natural and K N Interstate performed pursuant
to Natural's Rate Schedule X-51, all as more fully set forth in the application which is on file with the Commission
and open to public inspection.

Natural and K N Interstate state that pursuant to a gas exchange agreement between Natural and K N Interstate, Natural
delivered up to 25,000 Mcf of natural gas per day to K N Interstate at a point on K N Interstate's Buffalo Wallow pipeline
located in Roger Mills County, Oklahoma and K N Interstate redelivered equivalent volumes of natural gas to Natural
at a point on K N Interstate's Buffalo Wallow field gathering system in Hemphill County, Texas. Natural and K N Interstate
further state that by a letter agreement dated April 7, 1994, they agreed to terminate the agreement as of May 1, 1993.

Any person desiring to be heard or to make any protest with reference to said application should on or before August
8, 1994, file with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20426, a motion to intervene or a protest
in accordance with the requirements of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.214 or 385.211)
and the Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.10). All protests filed with the Commission will be considered
by it in determining the appropriate action to be taken but will not serve to make the protestants parties to the proceeding.
Any person wishing to become a party to a proceeding or to participate as a party in any hearing therein must file a motion
to intervene in accordance with the Commission's Rules.

Take further notice that, pursuant to the authority contained in and subject to jurisdiction conferred upon the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission by Sections 7 and 15 of the Natural Gas Act and the Commission's Rules of Practice and
Procedure, a hearing will be held without further notice before the Commission or its designee on this application
if no motion to intervene is filed within the time required herein, if the Commission on its own review of the matter
finds that permission and approval for the proposed abandonment are required by the public convenience and necessity.
If a motion for leave to intervene is timely filed, or if the Commission on its own motion believes that a formal hearing
is required, further notice of such hearing will be duly given.

Under the procedure herein provided for unless otherwise advised, it will be unnecessary for Natural and K N Interstate
to appear or be represented at the hearing.

<DOCTITLE>Dry Cleaning Industry; Notice of Availability of Comparison Study of Conventional Dry Cleaning and an Alternative
Process</DOCTITLE>





<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of availability. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 EPA is announcing the availability of a study entitled ``Multiprocess Wet Cleaning: A Cost and Performance Comparison
of Conventional Dry Cleaning and an Alternative Process.'' The study is the result of a joint EPA/industry effort
that demonstrated the viability of an alternative non-solvent ``wet'' cleaning process which relies on soaps, heat,
steam and pressing to clean clothes that are traditionally dry cleaned. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Agency's Design for the Environment Program within the Office of Pollution Prevention and Toxics formed a partnership
with the dry cleaning industry, universities, and environmental, labor, and consumer groups to explore ways to reduce
exposure to perchloroethylene (PCE), the chemical solvent used by most dry cleaners to clean clothes. In November
and December 1992, a short-term, high volume demonstration project was conducted to compare the cost and performance
of the alternative non-solvent process with traditional dry cleaning methods that use PCE. Results of the project
indicate that the wet cleaning process appears to be economically competitive and acceptable to consumers. The new
wet cleaning method, which can reduce the public's exposure to toxic dry cleaning chemicals, may be a viable alternative
for some of the nation's dry cleaners.

<DOCTITLE>Policy for the Development of Effluent Limitations in National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System Permits
to Control Whole Effluent Toxicity for the Protection of Aquatic Life: Notice of Availability </DOCTITLE>


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency.

 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of availability. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This notice announces the availability of a final policy document entitled ``Policy for the Development of Effluent
Limitations in National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) Permits to Control Whole Effluent Toxicity
(WET) for the Protection of Aquatic Life.'' The purpose of the new policy is to promote uniform, nationwide compliance
with existing statutory and regulatory requirements for the control of WET and to assist permit writers in implementing
these requirements.

 
</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Since 1984 EPA has undertaken various regulatory activities for the control of WET to protect aquatic life. In 1984,
EPA published the ``Policy for the Development of Water Quality-Based Permit Limitations for Toxic Pollutants.''
49 FR 9016 (March 9, 1984). The policy discusses such issues as integration of chemical specific and biological permit
limits; chemical, physical, and biological testing requirements (including WET testing requirements); and use
of data. 


In 1989, EPA revised the regulations governing the development of water quality-based effluent limitations, including
those to control WET. 40 CFR 122.44(d)(1). The regulations impose specific requirements such as requiring effluent
limits where the permitting authority finds ``reasonable potential'' to cause an exceedance of applicable water
quality criteria. 
In 1991, EPA revised the 1985 

Technical Support Document for Water Quality-based Toxics Control

 (TSD). The new TSD provides an explanation of the technical support for WET testing and gives detailed guidance on
development of water quality-based permit limitations for WET and toxic pollutants. 
Based upon its accumulated experience in administering the WET control program to date, EPA decided to develop a new
WET control policy to supplement existing policy. The new policy consists of eight policy statements, explanations
of each policy statement, and appendices containing background materials. In part, the policy restates EPA's strong
continuing commitment to existing Clean Water Act provisions and the regulatory requirements at 40 CFR 122.44(d)(1)
governing the control of WET for the protection of aquatic life. It also addresses some specific areas where questions
have arisen regarding the implementation of these requirements. 
The text of the eight statements of policy is provided below. 


1. Basis for WET Controls 


The permitting authority should evaluate WET water quality criteria attainment for acute WET at the edge of the acute
mixing zone and for chronic WET at the edge of the chronic mixing zone except where the State has different requirements
for evaluating WET criteria.

1

 The permitting authority will develop WET effluent limitations based upon the more stringent of the acute or chronic
criterion applied at the edge of the respective mixing zone, or, alternatively, on both. 




2. Evaluation of Dischargers for Reasonable Potential 


At a minimum, the permitting authority should review all major dischargers for reasonable potential to cause or contribute
to exceedance of WET water quality criteria. 


3. Evaluating Reasonable Potential 


The permitting authority will consider available WET testing data and other information in evaluating whether a
discharger has reasonable potential to cause or contribute to exceedance of WET water quality criteria. 


4. Consequences of Establishing Reasonable Potential 


Upon finding reasonable potential to cause or contribute to exceedance of WET water quality criteria, the permitting
authority will impose effluent limitations to control WET.

5. Whole Effluent Toxicity Monitoring 



Where appropriate, the permitting authority should impose WET monitoring conditions upon dischargers that do not
have effluent limitations to control WET. 



6. Compliance Schedules in NPDES Permits 



Where allowed under State and federal law, NPDES permits may contain schedules for compliance with WET effluent limitations.




7. Whole Effluent Toxicity Controls and the Pollutants Ammonia and Chlorine 



The requirements of the water quality permitting regulations apply without regard to the pollutant(s) that may be
causing toxicity, including ammonia and chlorine. 



8. Whole Effluent Toxicity Controls and Publicly Owned Treatment Works (POTWs) 



The requirements of the water quality permitting regulations apply to all dischargers, including POTWs.

Announcement of Cooperative Agreement to 
the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials 



Summary 



The Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) announces the availability of fiscal year (FY) 1994
funds for a sole source cooperative agreement with the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials (ASTHO)
to continue educating State and territorial health officials in health effects of hazardous substances in the environment.
Approximately $75,000 is available in FY 1994 to fund this cooperative agreement. It is expected that the award will
begin on or about September 30, 1994, for a 12-month budget period within a 3-year project period. Continuation awards
within the project period will be made on the basis of satisfactory progress and availability of funds. 

The proposed cooperative agreement is to address the need to improve information exchange and transfer between State
and Federal agencies, and among State agencies; to increase training opportunities to help States improve the capacity
to conduct risk assessment and risk communication; to recommend a strategic plan to increase public and State health
professionals' awareness of the toxic pollution problems in the Great Lakes States, improve their ability to diagnose,
treat and manage illness or injury related to environmental problems, and enhance their ability to communicate health
risk information; and to build capacity to respond to community concerns by providing training and guidance in addressing
issues of community concern related to hazardous waste sites. Funding is to support a full time position to implement
and conduct these activities. 

ATSDR will collaborate with the planning, implementation, and evaluation of risk communication training programs,
Public Learning Institute, teleconference briefings, consultation service, newsletter column and materials;
and development, printing, and distribution of the national directory of risk assessors and environmental scientists.


The Public Health Service (PHS) is committed to achieving the health promotion and disease prevention objectives
of ``Healthy People 2000,'' a PHS-led national activity to reduce morbidity and mortality and improve the quality
of life. This announcement is related to the priority area of Environmental Health. (For ordering a copy of ``Healthy

products. This is consistent with the PHS mission to protect and advance the physical and mental health of the American
people. 



Eligible Applicant 



Assistance will be provided only to ASTHO for this project. No other applications are solicited. The program announcement
and application kit have been sent to ASTHO. 

ASTHO represents the chief public health official of each State and territory. Through its own membership, the ASTHO
Environment Committee, the Association of State and Territorial Health Risk Assessors (ASTHRA), other affiliate
organizations, and the Public Health Foundation, ASTHO has developed unique knowledge and understanding of the
needs and operations of State health agencies. Association members have already developed an enormous wealth of
experience in risk communication and have identified risk communication programs as a priority need for State health
agencies.

ASTHRA is an organization functioning under the umbrella of ASTHO and is composed of State health professionals involved
in health risk assessment. ASTHRA promotes information exchange between State level scientists and other professionals
who are responsible for environmental health risk assessments. States have varying capacity to meet the demand for
either developmental or sophisticated risk assessment. Improved information exchange, technology transfer,
and increased training opportunities will enhance the capacity of State health agencies to respond to the demand
for environmental services, information, and risk assessment. Therefore, a structure to improve the partnership
between ASTHO, ASTHRA, and ATSDR is essential. 
ASTHO has advised ATSDR that the ASTHRA membership is the target audience to reach in supporting the continued development
of ASTHO's health risk assessment component. In 1993 through the cooperative agreement, ASTHO conducted six risk
communication workshops. It is anticipated that ASTHRA will continue these activities.

Determination of Regulatory Review Period for Purposes of Patent Extension; Cattlyst

 

 50 Type A Medicated Article



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Food and Drug Administration, HHS.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has determined the regulatory review period for Cattlyst

 

 50 Type A Medicated Article and is publishing this notice of that determination as required by law. FDA has made the
determination because of the submission of an application to the Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks, Department
of Commerce, for the extension of a patent which claims that animal drug product.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (Pub. L. 98-417) and the Generic Animal Drug
and Patent Term Restoration Act (Pub. L. 100-670) generally provide that a patent may be extended for a period
of up to 5 years so long as the patented item (human drug product, animal drug product, medical device, food additive,
or color additive) was subject to regulatory review by FDA before the item was marketed. Under these acts, a product's
regulatory review period forms the basis for determining the amount of extension an applicant may receive.


A regulatory review period consists of two periods of time: a testing phase and an approval phase. For animal drug products,
the testing phase begins on the earlier date when either a major environmental effects test was initiated for the drug
or when an exemption under section 512(j) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act became effective and runs until
the approval phase begins. The approval phase starts with the initial submission of an application to market the animal
drug product and continues until FDA grants permission to market the drug product. Although only a portion of a regulatory
review period may count toward the actual amount of extension that the Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks may
award (for example, half the testing phase must be subtracted as well as any time that may have occurred before the patent
was issued), FDA's determination of the length of a regulatory review period for an animal drug product will include
all of the testing phase and approval phase as specified in 35 U.S.C. 156(g)(4)(B).
FDA recently approved for marketing the animal drug product Cattlyst

 

 50 Type A Medicated Article (laidlomycin propionate potassium). Cattlyst

 

 50 Type A Medicated Article is indicated for improved feed efficiency and increased rate of weight gain. Subsequent
to this approval, the Patent and Trademark Office received a patent term restoration application for Cattlyst

 

 50 Type A Medicated Article (U.S. Patent No. 4,431,665) from Syntex (U.S.A), Inc., and requested FDA's assistance
in determining the patent's eligibility for patent term restoration. FDA, in a letter dated May 19, 1994, advised
the Patent and Trademark Office that this animal drug product had undergone a regulatory review period and that the
approval of Cattlyst

 

 50 Type A medicated Article represented the first permitted commercial marketing or use of the product. Shortly thereafter,
the Patent and Trademark Office requested that the FDA determine the product's regulatory review period.

FDA has determined that the applicable regulatory review period for Cattlyst

 

 50 Type A Medicated Article is 4,253 days. Of this time, 3,762 days occurred during the testing phase of the regulatory
review period, while 491 days occurred during the approval phase. These periods of time were derived from the following
dates:
1. 

The date an exemption under section 512(j) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act became effective

: July 14, 1982. FDA has verified the applicant's claim that the date the investigational new animal drug application
(INAD) became effective was July 14, 1982.
2. 

The date the application was initially submitted with respect to the human drug product under section 512(b) of the
Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act

: October 30, 1992. FDA has verified the applicant's claim that the date the new animal drug application (NADA) for
Cattlyst

 

 50 Type A Medicated Article (NADA 141-025) was initially submitted was October 30, 1992.
3. 

The date the application was approved

: March 4, 1994. FDA has verified the applicant's claim that NADA 141-025 was approved on March 4, 1994. This determination
of the regulatory review period establishes the maximum potential length of a patent extension. However, the U.S.
Patent and Trademark Office applies several statutory limitations in its calculations of the actual period for patent
extension. In its application for patent extension, this applicant seeks 3 years of patent term extension. Anyone
with knowledge that any of the dates as published is incorrect may, on or before September 20, 1994, submit to the Dockets
Management Branch (address above) written comments and ask for a redetermination. Furthermore, any interested
person may petition FDA, on or before January 25, 1995, for a determination regarding whether the applicant for extension
acted with due diligence during the regulatory review period. To meet its burden, the petition must contain sufficient
facts to merit an FDA investigation. (See H. Rept. 857, part 1, 98th Cong., 2d sess., pp. 41-42, 1984.) Petitions
should be in the format specified in 21 CFR 10.30.
Comments and petitions should be submitted to the Dockets Management Branch (address above) in three copies (except
that individuals may submit single copies) and identified with the docket number found in brackets in the heading
of this document. Comments and petitions may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday
through Friday.

<DOCTITLE>Miscellaneous Compliance Policy Guides; Revocation</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Food and Drug Administration, HHS.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is announcing the revocation of eight compliance policy guides (CPG's) because
either they are outdated, their issues are addressed elsewhere, or they no longer reflect current FDA policy. This
action is being taken to ensure that FDA's CPG's are accurate and reflect FDA policy and sound scientific principles.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 FDA is revoking eight of its CPG's because either they are outdated, their issues are addressed elsewhere, or they
no longer reflect current FDA policy. The following eight guides are being revoked:


(1) CPG 7125.02 ``Quantity of Contents Declaration on Labels of Liquid Animal Feeds''
CPG 7125.02 was established in 1980 under the Metric Conversion Act of 1975 (15 U.S.C. 205b) to clarify FDA's preference
for metric labeling for liquid animal drugs. The Metric Conversion Act of 1975 was amended by the American Technology
Preeminence Act of 1991 (ATPA) (Pub. L. 102-245). Section 107 of the ATPA amended the Fair Packaging and Labeling
Act (FPLA) (15 U.S.C. 1451 

et seq

.) to require that the most appropriate metric units be used as the primary system for expressing quantity of content.
Section 107 of the ATPA was repealed by Pub. L. 102-329, which provided certain technical amendments to the FPLA,
including dual (metric and English) labeling and certain exemptions. These amendments provide a more appropriate
basis for metric labeling. Therefore, CPG 7125.02 is unnecessary. 
(2) CPG 7125.04 ``Diethylcarbamazine''
 CPG 7125.04 was established to provide monograph criteria for diethylcarbamazine-containing drugs instead of
requiring new animal drug application (NADA) approval. Since establishing this CPG, FDA has determined these products
are not exempt from the NADA approval process. Therefore, CPG 7125.04 no longer reflects FDA policy.

(3) CPG 7125.07 ``Impact of CGMPR Violations on NADA''
 The Center for Veterinary Medicine has routinely been involved in reviewing results of inspections and district
endorsements involving NADA's and abbreviated new animal drug applications (ANADA's). For those facilities unable
to manufacture in compliance with current good manufacturing practices (CGMP's), approval of applications was
delayed pending reinspection and satisfactory corrective action. Compliance Program Guidance Manual (CPGM) 7368.001,
part V, describes district responsibilities in reporting their findings for preapproval inspections. The current
CPGM is adequate to cover this issue of CGMP noncompliance in the preapproval stage. Therefore, CPG 7125.07 is superfluous.

(4) CPG 7125.08 ``Hexachlorophene in Pet Shampoos''
 Pet shampoos are considered grooming aids if they contain hexachlorophene at not more than 0.1 percent (as a preservative)
and are not labeled with therapeutic claims. CPG 7125.21 ``Animal Grooming Aids'' and 21 CFR 500.46 adequately address
the issues. Therefore, CPG 7125.08 is not needed.
(5) CPG 7126.15 ``Crotolaria Seeds in Grains and Feeds''
At FDA's urging, the feed industry has become meticulous in inspecting incoming raw ingredients for foreign materials,
including crotolaria seeds. Crotolaria, although once a nuisance and a toxin, has not been a compliance problem for
years. Therefore, CPG 7126.15 is no longer relevant.
(6) CPG 7126.30 ``Diethylstilbestrol Residues in Edible Animal Tissue''
 The approval for use of Diethylstilbestrol in animal drugs or feeds was withdrawn in the 

Federal Register

 of July 6, 1979 (44 FR 39618 at 39619), as confirmed by the Commissioner's decision in the 

Federal Register

 of September 21, 1979 (44 FR 54852 at 54900). Therefore, CPG 7126.30 is obsolete.
(7) CPG 7126.32 ``Current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) Violations in Medicated Feed Mills_Direct Issuance
of Regulatory Letters''
 Compliance Program Guidance Manual (CPGM) 7371.004 describes current policy concerning warning letters and provides
model letters. Therefore, CPG 7126.32 is obsolete because it describes regulatory letters that are no longer issued.
(8) CPG 7126.39 ``Ammonium Chloride Used in Ruminant Feeds''
CPG 7126.39 concerned a formerly approved use of ammonium chloride in 21 CFR 558.45 for treating urinary calculi (see
the 

Federal Register

 of March 3, 1986 (51 FR 7382 at 7395)), which has since been withdrawn (see the 

Federal Register

 of October 26, 1987 (52 FR 39911 at 39912). There are no approved drug claims for use of ammonium chloride in ruminant
feed and the agency has not documented any evidence of misuse of the compound in several years. Therefore, CPG 7126.39
is obsolete.

<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Food and Drug Administration, HHS.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is announcing its approval of the application by Grieshaber & Co., Inc.,
Kennesaw, GA, for premarket approval, under section 515 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act), of Grieshaber
Scleral Buckling Balloon Catheter. FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) notified the applicant,
by letter of June 2, 1994, of the approval of the application.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

On August 27, 1992, Grieshaber & Co., Inc., Kennesaw, GA, 30144, submitted to CDRH an application for premarket
approval of the Grieshaber Scleral Buckling Balloon Catheter. The device is a scleral buckling balloon catheter
and is indicated for use as a temporary implant to buckle the sclera to facilitate retinal reattachments where multiple
or single breaks in the anterior two-thirds of the globe do not subtend a retinal arc of more than one clock hour (6 millimeters).
The application includes authorization from Storz

 

, St. Louis, MO 63122-6694, to incorporate information contained in its approved premarket approval application
(PMA) for the Lincoff Balloon (P820009). 


In accordance with the provisions of section 515(c)(2) of the act as amended by the Safe Medical Devices Act of 1990,
this PMA was not referred to the Ophthalmic Devices Panel, an FDA advisory panel, for review and recommendation because
the information in the PMA substantially duplicates information previously reviewed by this panel.
On June 2, 1994, CDRH approved the application by a letter to the applicant from the Acting Director of the Office of
Device Evaluation, CDRH. A summary of the safety and effectiveness data on which CDRH based its approval is on file
in the Dockets Management Branch (address above) and is available from that office upon written request. Requests
should be identified with the name of the device and the docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document.


Opportunity for Administrative Review


Section 515(d)(3) of the act (21 U.S.C. 360e(d)(3)) authorizes any interested person to petition, under section
515(g) of the act (21 U.S.C. 360e(g)), for administrative review of CDRH's decision to approve this application.
A petitioner may request either a formal hearing under part 12 (21 CFR part 12) of FDA's administrative practices and
procedures regulations or a review of the application and CDRH's action by an independent advisory committee of experts.
A petition is to be in the form of a petition for reconsideration under  10.33(b) (21 CFR 10.33(b)). A petitioner
shall identify the form of review requested (hearing or independent advisory committee) and shall submit with the
petition supporting data and information showing that there is a genuine and substantial issue of material fact for
resolution through administrative review. After reviewing the petition, FDA will decide whether to grant or deny
the petition and will publish a notice of its decision in the 

Federal Register

. If FDA grants the petition, the notice will state the issue to be reviewed, the form of review to be used, the persons
who may participate in the review, the time and place where the review will occur, and other details.
Petitioners may, at any time on or before August 22, 1994, file with the Dockets Management Branch (address above)
two copies of each petition and supporting data and information, identified with the name of the device and the docket
number found in brackets in the heading of this document. Received petitions may be seen in the office above between
9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.
This notice is issued under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (secs. 515(d), 520(h) (21 U.S.C. 360e(d), 360j(h)))
and under authority delegated to the Commissioner of Food and Drugs (21 CFR 5.10) and redelegated to the Center for
Devices and Radiological Health (21 CFR 5.53).

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is announcing the availability of a guideline entitled ``Guideline for Establishing
a Safe Concentration.'' This guideline includes information and guidance to regulated industry and the public on
food factors. This guideline is being made available as a revision to a document entitled ~``General Principles for
Evaluating the Safety of Compounds Used in Food-Producing Animals'' which is a compilation of eight guidelines (hereinafter
referred to as ``the compilation''). The new guideline replaces guideline IV entitled ``Guideline for Establishing
a Tolerance,'' which is no longer in effect. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

In the 

Federal Register

 of December 31, 1987 (52 FR 49589) FDA announced the availability of a compilation of seven guidelines entitled ``General
Principles for Evaluating the Safety of Compounds Used in Food-Producing Animals.'' The compilation was issued
in accordance with FDA's requirement under the general safety provisions of sections 409, 512, and 706 of the Federal
Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) to determine whether each food additive, new animal drug, or color additive
proposed for use in food-producing animals is safe for those animals and whether the edible products derived from
treated animals are safe. The pertinent regulations implementing the statutory provisions are in 21 CFR part 70,
21 CFR 514.1, and 21 CFR part 570.


Under the act, the sponsor of a compound is required to furnish FDA with the scientific data necessary for demonstrating
that residues of the sponsored compound in the edible products of treated animals are safe. The compilation was developed
to inform sponsors of the scientific data that FDA believes will provide an acceptable basis for determining the safety
of the compound. 
Guidelines state procedures or practices that may be useful to the persons to whom they are directed, but are not legal
requirements. Guidelines represent the agency's position on a procedure or a practice at the time of their issuance.
A person may follow a guideline or choose to follow alternate procedures or practices. If a person chooses to use alternate
procedures or practices, then that person may wish to discuss the matter further with the agency to prevent an expenditure
of money and effort on activities that may later be determined to be unacceptable to FDA. A guideline does not bind the
agency, and it does not create or confer any rights, privileges, or benefits for or on any person. When a guideline states
a requirement imposed by statute or regulation, however, the requirement is law and its force and effect are not changed
in any way by virtue of its inclusion in the guideline.
FDA is announcing the availability of a new guideline entitled ``Guideline for Establishing a Safe Concentration''
that includes information and guidance to regulated industry and the public on food factors. This guideline is being
made available as a revision to the compilation and replaces guideline IV entitled ``Guideline for Establishing
a Tolerance,'' which is no longer in effect. 
The new guideline sets out new consumption values that FDA's Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM) will use in partitioning
the Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) for drug residues among the edible products of food producing animals. The new daily
consumption values for total red meats and poultry, across all species, are 300 grams (g) of meat (as muscle tissue),
100 g of liver, 50 g of kidney, 50 g of fat, 100 g of eggs, and 1.5 liters (l) of milk. These values are a more realistic estimate
of actual food consumption than the values currently used by CVM. 
CVM will continue to regulate eggs and milk as independent commodities, which means that these products are not considered
components of the 500 g of edible muscle and organ tissues. The intake estimate of milk will remain 1.5 l. CVM will now
assume, however, that an individual consumes an entire portion of meat and edible tissues and an entire portion of
milk on a daily basis. Therefore, a part of the ADI will be reserved for milk when evaluating products approved in lactating
dairy cows and products seeking approval in both lactating dairy cows and another animals species. The other part
of the ADI will be partitioned among the animal tissues as described above. For products approved in both laying hens
and other animals, a part of the ADI will be reserved for eggs.
In addition to incorporating the new food factors, the concept of negligible tolerance has been omitted from the new
guideline because CVM usually can establish a finite or zero tolerance when assessing the safety of a drug. 
Interested persons may, at any time, submit to the Dockets Management Branch (address above) written comments on
the guideline. Two copies of any comments are to be submitted, except that individuals may submit one copy. Comments
may be seen in the office above between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday. 
Received comments will be considered in determining whether further revision of the guideline is necessary. 
A copy of the compilation which includes the new guideline entitled ``Guideline for Establishing a Safe Concentration,''
is available for public examination in the office above, between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.

<DOCTITLE>HIV Care Grant Program</DOCTITLE>



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Health Resources and Services Administration, HHS.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of grants made to States and territories.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) announces that fiscal year 1994 funds have been awarded
to States and territories (hereinafter States) for the HIV Care Grant Program. Although these funds have already
been awarded to the States, HRSA is publishing this notice to inform the general public of the existence of the funds.
In addition, HRSA determined that it would be useful for the general public to be aware of the structure of the HIV Care
Grant Program and the statutory requirements governing the use of the funds.



Funds will be used by the States to improve the quality, availability, and organization of health care and support
services for individuals and families with HIV infection. The HIV Care Grant Program was authorized by Title II of
the Ryan White Comprehensive AIDS Resources Emergency (CARE) Act of 1990, Public Law 101-381, which amended
Title XXVI of the Public Health Service Act. Funds were appropriated under Public Law 103-112.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:



Availability of Funds



A total of $162,705,300 was made available for the Title II HIV Care Grant Program. These funds have been allotted to
the States according to a formula based on the number of AIDS cases reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
for the 24 months ending September 30, 1993, and a per capita income factor. Below is the distribution of funds by State.






Eligibility Criteria



In order to receive funding under Title II of the CARE Act, each State was required to develop:

 A detailed description of the HIV-related services provided in the State to individuals and families with
HIV disease during the year preceding the year for which the grant was requested, and the number of individuals and
families receiving such services; and

 A comprehensive plan for the organization and delivery of HIV health care and support services to be funded
with the title II grant, including a description of the purposes for which the State intends to use such assistance.

Each State was also required to submit an application containing such agreements, assurances, and information as
the Secretary determined to be necessary to carry out this program, including an assurance that:

 The public health agency that is administering the grant for the State will conduct public hearings concerning
the proposed use and distribution of the Title II grant assistance;

 The State will, to the maximum extent practicable, ensure that HIV-related health care and support services
delivered with Title II assistance will be provided without regard to the ability of the individual to pay for such
services and without regard to the current or past health condition of the individual; ensure that such services will
be provided in a setting that is accessible to low-income individuals with HIV disease, and provide outreach to inform
such individuals of the services available; and, in the case of a State that intends to use grant funds for the continuation
of health insurance coverage, ensure that the State has established a program that assures that such amounts will
be targeted to individuals who would not otherwise be able to afford health insurance coverage, that income, assets,
and medical expense criteria will be established and applied by the State to identify those individuals who qualify
for assistance, and that information concerning such criteria will be made available to the public;

 The State will provide for periodic independent peer review to assess the quality and appropriateness of health
and support services provided by entities that receive Title II funds from the State;

 The State will permit and cooperate with any Federal investigations undertaken regarding programs conducted
under Title II;

 The State will maintain HIV-related activities at a level that is equal to not less than the level of such expenditures
by the State for the 1-year period preceding the fiscal year for which the State applied to receive a grant under Title
II; and

 The State will ensure that grant funds are not utilized to make payments for any item or service to the extent
that payment has been made, or can reasonably be expected to be made, with respect to that item or service (1) under any
State compensation program, under an insurance policy, or under any Federal or State health benefits program, or
(2) by an entity that provides health services on a prepaid basis.



General Use of Grant Funds



States may use the HIV Care Grant funds to:

 Establish and operate HIV care consortia within areas most affected by HIV. The statute defines a consortium
as an association of one or more public, and one or more nonprofit private health care and support service providers
and community-based organizations operating within areas determined by the State to be most affected by HIV disease.

 Provide home- and community-based care services for individuals with HIV disease. Funding priorities must
be given to entities that provide assurances to the State that they will participate in HIV care consortia if such consortia
exist within the State, and will utilize the funds for the provision of home- and community-based services to low-income
individuals with HIV disease.

 Provide assistance to assure the continuity of health insurance coverage for low-income (as defined by the
State) individuals with HIV disease. The State must establish a program that assures that (1) funds will be targeted
to individuals who would not otherwise be able to afford health insurance coverage, and (2) income, asset, and medical

<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Health Resources and Services Administration, HHS.

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of grants made to eligible metropolitan areas. 






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) announces that fiscal year 1994 funds have been awarded
to the 34 eligible metropolitan areas (EMAs) that have been the most severely affected by the HIV epidemic. Although
these funds have already been awarded to the EMAs, HRSA is publishing this notice to inform the general public of the
existence of the funds. In addition, HRSA determined that it would be useful for the general public to be aware of the
structure of the HIV Emergency Relief Grant Program and the statutory requirements governing the use of the funds.




The purposes of these funds are to deliver or enhance HIV-related (1) outpatient and ambulatory health and support
services, including case management and comprehensive treatment services, for individuals and families with HIV
disease; and (2) inpatient case management services that prevent unnecessary hospitalization or that expedite
discharge, as medically appropriate, from inpatient facilities. The HIV Emergency Relief Grant Program was authorized
by Title I of the Ryan White Comprehensive AIDS Resources Emergency (CARE) Act of 1990, Public Law 101-381, which
amended Title XXVI of the Public Health Service Act. Funds were appropriated under Public Law 103-112.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

Availability of Funds 



A total of $319,989,000 was made available for the Title I HIV Emergency Relief Grant Program. Of the amount available,
50 percent was allocated to the 34 EMAs according to a formula based on the number and incidence of AIDS cases reported
to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) as of March 31, 1993. The other 50 percent was awarded competitively
to the EMAs as supplemental grants. Below is a distribution of grants made to the 34 EMAs. 






Eligible Grantees 



Metropolitan areas which were eligible for grant awards under Title I were those areas for which, as of March 31, 1993,
there had been reported to and confirmed by the CDC a cumulative total of more than 2,000 cases of AIDS; or, for which
the per capita incidence of cumulative cases of AIDS was not less than 0.0025, as computed on the basis of the most recently
available data for the population in the area. Included were all human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected persons
with severe immunosuppression (<200 CD4+ T-lymphocytes/

m

L or a CD4+ T=lymphocyte percentage of total lymphocytes of <14), pulmonary tuberculosis (TB), recurrent pneumonia,
or invasive cervical cancer.

Grants were awarded to the chief elected official (CEO) of the city or urban county in each EMA that administers the
public health agency providing outpatient and ambulatory services to the greatest number of individuals with AIDS.


To be eligible for assistance under Title I, the CEO was required to establish or designate an HIV health services planning
council to: (1) establish priorities for the allocation of funds within the eligible area; (2) develop a comprehensive
plan for the organization and delivery of health services described in the statute that is compatible with any State
or local plan regarding the provision of health services to individuals with HIV disease; and (3) assess the efficiency
of the administrative mechanism in rapidly allocating funds to the areas of greatest need within the eligible area.
The planning council must include representatives of: health care providers; community-based and AIDS service
organizations; social services providers; mental health services providers; local public health agencies; hospital
planning agencies or health care planning agencies; affected communities, including individuals with HIV disease;
non-elected community leaders; State government; and grantees receiving categorical grants for early intervention
services under Title III of the CARE Act. The allocation of funds and services within the EMA must be made in accordance
with the priorities established by the planning council. 

To be eligible to receive a grant under Title I, the EMAs were required to submit an application containing such information
as the Secretary required, including assurances adequate to ensure: 

 That funds received would be utilized to supplement not supplant State funds provided for HIV-related services;


 That the political subdivisions within the EMA would maintain HIV-related expenditures at a level equal to
that expended for the 1-year period preceding the first fiscal year for which the grant was received. Funds received
under Title I may not be used in maintaining the required level of expenditures; 

 That the EMA has an HIV health services planning council and has entered into intergovernmental agreements
with the political subdivisions and has developed or will develop a comprehensive plan for the organization and delivery
of health services, in accordance with the legislation; 

 That entities within the EMA that receive Title I funds will participate in an established HIV community-based
continuum of care if such continuum exists within the EMA; 

 That Title I funds will not be utilized to make payments for any item or service to the extent that payment has
been made, or can reasonably be expected to be made, with respect to that item or service (1) under any State compensation
program, under an insurance policy, or under any Federal or State health benefits program, or (2) by an entity that
provides health services on a prepaid basis; and 

 To the maximum extent practicable, that HIV health care and support services provided with Title I assistance
will be provided without regard to the ability of the individual to pay for such services, and without regard to the
current or past health condition of the individual. Such services will be provided in a setting that is accessible
to low-income individuals with HIV disease, and a program of outreach will be provided to inform such individuals
of such services. 



General Use of Grant Funds 



EMAs must use the Title I HIV Emergency Relief grants to provide financial assistance to public or nonprofit entities,
for the purpose of delivering or enhancing_

 HIV-related outpatient and ambulatory health and support services, including case management and comprehensive
treatment services, for individuals and families with HIV disease; and 

 HIV-related inpatient case management services that prevent unnecessary hospitalization or that expedite
discharge, as medically appropriate, from inpatient facilities. 

Services supported by the Title I grant funds must be accessible to low-income individuals and families, including
women and children with HIV infection, minorities, the homeless, and persons affected by chemical dependency.

Executive Order 12372 



Grants awarded for the Title I HIV Emergency Relief Grant Program are subject to the provisions of Executive Order
12372, as implemented under 45 CFR Part 100, which allows States the option of setting up a system for reviewing applications
within their States for assistance under certain Federal programs. The application packages made available by HRSA
to the EMAs contained a listing of States which have chosen to set up such a review system and provided a point of contact
in the States for the review. 

The catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance Numbers are: Formula Grants_93.915; Supplemental Grants_93.914.

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of Intent (NOI)_Proposal to Amend the Grand Resource Area Resource Management Plan, Grand County, Utah. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) proposes to amend the Grand Resource Management Plan (RMP). Seven (7) parcels
of public land would be managed for disposal by Public Land Sale under the authority of Section 203 of the Federal Land
Policy and Management Act of October 21, 1976 (FLPMA) (90 Stat. 2750; 43 U.S.C. 1713), Land Exchange under the authority
of Section 206 of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of October 21, 1976 (FLPMA) (90 Stat. 2756; 43 U.S.C. 1716),
or Recreation and Public Purposes Patent under the authority of Section 3 of the Act of June 14, 1926, as amended by the
Recreation and Public Purposes Act of January 25, 1988 (102 Stat. 3815; 43 U.S.C. 869-2). 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The proposed amendment identifies certain lands as suitable for disposal by Public Land Sale, Land Exchange, or patent
under the Recreation and Public Purposes Act. Lands have been identified that are needed for community expansion,
sanitary landfill, or tailings disposal; for disposal of lands under short-term authorizations; and to resolve
long-standing trespass. The lands being studied are described as follows: 



Salt Lake Meridian, Utah 



Parcel 1. Fish Ford 



T. 21 S., R. 24 E., (30.00 acres) 



Section 27, E1/2W1/2SE1/4; 

Section 34, NE1/4NE1/4NE1/4; 

Section 35, NW1/4NW1/4. 



Parcel 2. Klondike Area 



T. 23 S., R. 19 E., (2560.00 acres) 



Section 14, All; 

Section 15, All; 

Section 22, All; 

Section 23, All. 



Parcel 3. Dewey 



T. 23 S., R. 24 E., (29.00 acres) 



Section 8, lands south of State Route 128 in the N1/2SW1/4. 



Parcel 4. Stateline (Dolores River) 



T. 23 S., R. 26 E., (5.00 acres) 



Section 32, N1/2NE1/4SW1/4SE1/4. 



Parcel 5. Professor Valley Ranch 



T. 24 S., R. 23 E., (13.07 acres) 



Section 21, within SE1/4SE1/4 (3.25 acres); 

Section 27, within NE1/4NW1/4NW1/4 (2.39 acres), NE1/4NW1/4SW1/4NE1/4, N1/2NE1/4SW1/4NE1/4 (7.43 acres). 



Parcel 6. North Moab 



T. 25 S., R. 21 E., (5.625 acres) 



Section 26, SW1/4SE1/4SW1/4NW1/4SE1/4 (0.625 acres), NW1/4SW1/4SE1/4SE1/4 (2.50 acres), SE1/4SW1/4SE1/4SE1/4
(2.50 acres). 



Parcel 7. Castleton 



T. 25 S., R. 23 E., (5.00 acres) 



Section 25, N1/2SW1/4NW1/4NE1/4. 




The existing plan does not identify these lands for disposal. However, expressions of interest have been received
from Grand County and members of the public that appear to have merit and the disposal of which may be in the public interest.
Therefore, they will be considered through the plan amendment process. 

General issues to be addressed in the amendment include impacts of the proposed disposals to livestock forage, wildlife
habitat, cultural resources, visual resources, and public safety. Site-specific environmental assessments will
be prepared at such time that a specific disposal is being considered.

Notice of Changes in Status of Extended Benefit (EB) Periods for the States of Washington and Maine



This notice announces changes in benefit period eligibility under the Extended Benefit (EB) Program for the States
of Washington and Maine.



Summary



The following changes have occurred in the States of Washington and Maine since the publication of the last notice
regarding States' EB status:

 May 29, 1994 Washington State triggered ``on'' to EB based on its 13-week Insured Unemployment Rate (IUR) exceeding
5.0 percent and surpassing 120 percent of the average of such rates for the corresponding 13-week periods in each of
the preceding two calendar years.

 June 25, 1994 The EB trigger mechanisms for Maine have been below the thresholds necessary to be triggered ``on''
to EB since the week beginning May 1, 1994. However, Section 203(b)(1)(A) of the Federal-State Extended Unemployment
Compensation Act of 1970 specifies that no EB period shall last for less than 13 consecutive weeks, regardless of whether
or not the necessary thresholds are met. That 13-week period ended for Maine on June 25, 1995.



Information for Claimants



The duration of benefits payable in the EB Program, and the terms and conditions on which they are payable, are governed
by the Federal-State Extended Unemployment Compensation Act of 1970, as amended, and the operating instructions
issued to the States by the U.S. Department of Labor. In the case of a State beginning an EB period, the State employment
security agency will furnish a written notice of potential entitlement to each individual who has exhausted all rights
to regular benefits and is potentially eligible for extended benefits (20 CFR 615.13(c)(1)). In the case of a Stat
ending an EB period, the State employment security agency will furnish a written notice to each individual who is filing
claims for Extended Benefits informing them of the ending of the EB period and its effect on the individual's right
to Extended Benefits (20 CFR 615.13(c)(4)).

Persons who believe they may be entitled to EB benefits, or who wish to inquire about their rights under the programs,
should contact the nearest State employment Service office of unemployment compensation claims office in their
locality.

<DOCTITLE>Minimum Wages for Federal and Federally Assisted Construction; General Wage Determination Decisions</DOCTITLE>



General wage determination decisions of the Secretary of Labor are issued in accordance with applicable law and are
based on the information obtained by the Department of Labor from its study of local wage conditions and data made available
from other sources. They specify the basic hourly wage rates and fringe benefits which are determined to be prevailing
for the described classes of laborers and mechanics employed on construction projects of a similar character and
in the localities specified therein.

The determinations in these decisions of prevailing rates and fringe benefits have been made in accordance with 29
CFR Part 1, by authority of the Secretary of Labor pursuant to the provisions of the Davis-Bacon Act of March 3, 1931,
as amended (46 Stat. 1494, as amended, 40 U.S.C. 276a) and of other Federal statutes referred to in 29 CFR Part 1, Appendix,
as well as such additional statutes as may from time to time be enacted containing provisions for the payment of wages
determined to be prevailing by the Secretary of Labor in accordance with the Davis-Bacon Act. The prevailing rates
and fringe benefits determined in these decisions shall, in accordance with the provisions of the foregoing statutes,
constitute the minimum wages payable on Federal and federally assisted construction projects to laborers and mechanics
of the specified classes engaged on contract work of the character and in the localities described therein.

Good cause is hereby found for not utilizing notice and public comment procedure thereon prior to the issuance of these
determinations as prescribed in 5 U.S.C. 553 and not providing for delay in the effective date as prescribed in that
section, because the necessity to issue current construction industry wage determinations frequently and in large
volume causes procedures to be impractical and contrary to the public interest.

General wage determination decisions, and modifications and supersedeas decisions thereto, contain no expiration
dates and are effective from their date of notice in the 

Federal Register

, or on the date written notice is received by the agency, whichever is earlier. These decisions are to be used in accordance
with the provisions of 29 CFR Parts 1 and 5. Accordingly, the applicable decision, together with any modifications
issued, must be made a part of every contract for performance of the described work within the geographic area indicated
as required by an applicable Federal prevailing wage law and 29 CFR Part 5. The wage rates and fringe benefits, notice
of which is published herein, and which are contained in the Government Printing Office (GPO) document entitled ``General
Wage Determinations Issued Under The Davis-Bacon and Related Acts,'' shall be the minimum paid by contractors and
subcontractors to laborers and mechanisms.

Any person, organization, or governmental agency have an interest in the rates determined as prevailing is encouraged
to submit wage rate and fringe benefit information for consideration by the Department. Further information and
self-explanatory forms for the purpose of submitting this data may be obtained by writing to the U.S. Department of
Labor, Employment Standards Administration, Wage and Hour Division, Division of Wage Determinations, 200 Constitution
Avenue, NW., room S-3014, Washington, DC 20210.

Withdrawn General Wage Determination Decision



This is to advise all interested parties that the Department of Labor is withdrawing, from the date of this notice,
General Wage Determination No. ND94-0055 dated April 29, 1994.

Agencies with construction projects pending, to which this wage decision would have been applicable, should utilize
Wage Decision ND940027. Contracts for which bids have been opened shall not be affected by this notice. Also, consistent
with 29 CFR 1.6(c)(2)(i)(A), when the opening of bids is less than ten (10) days from the date of this notice, this action
shall be effective unless the agency finds that there is insufficient time to notify bidders of the change and the finding
is documented in the contract file.

Notice of Recognition as a Nationally Recognized Testing Laboratory.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This notice announces the Agency's final decision on the application of Wyle Laboratories for recognition as a Nationally
Recognized Testing Laboratory (NRTL) under 29 CFR 1910.7.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 



Notice of Final Decision



Notice is hereby given that Wyle Laboratories, which made application pursuant to 29 CFR 1910.7, has been recognized
as a Nationally Recognized Testing Laboratory for the equipment or material listed below.

The address of the laboratory covered by this application is: Wyle Laboratories, 7800 Governors Drive, P.O. Box 077777,
Huntsville, Alabama 35807.



Background



Wyle Laboratories (WL), a publicly-held corporation, was founded in 1949 in El Segundo, California, as an independent
test laboratory to support the aerospace industry. In 1959, Wyle expanded to a new location in Norco, California and
created the Huntsville facility in 1962 to support the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and
the establishment of the George C. Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) in Huntsville, Alabama, with testing, engineering,
and research capabilities. Of the three major operations at the Huntsville facility, the one of interest to the NRTL
Accreditation program is the Test Operations Division, which includes the Product Safety Department. The Product
Safety Testing and Certification Department of the Test Operations Division is responsible for the testing, certification,
and factory follow-up inspections of the products.

Wyle Laboratories applied to OSHA for recognition as a Nationally Recognized Testing Laboratory in April 1992. An
on-site evaluation was conducted from November 2-6, 1992, and the results discussed with the applicant who
responded [Ex. 3A(2)] with appropriate actions and clarifications to recommendations made as a result of the survey
[Ex. 3A(1)]. These actions were accomplished prior to the preparation of the final report. The final on-site review
report (Ex. 3A) consisting of the on-site evaluation of WL's testing facilities and administrative and technical
practices, and the corrective actions taken by WL in response to these evaluations, and the OSHA staff recommendation,
were subsequently forwarded to the Assistant Secretary for a preliminary finding on the application. A notice of
WL's application together with a positive preliminary finding was published in the 

Federal Register

 on January 6, 1994 (59 FR 783-785). There were eight responses, all of a positive nature, to this 

Federal Register

 notice of the WL application and preliminary finding (Docket No. NRTL-1-93).

The Occupational Safety and Health Administration has evaluated the entire record in relation to the regulations
set out in 29 CFR 1910.7 and makes the following findings:



Capability



Section 1910.7(b)(1) states that for each specified item of equipment or material to be listed, labeled or accepted,
the laboratory must have the capability (including proper testing equipment and facilities, trained staff, written
testing procedures, and calibration and quality control programs) to perform appropriate testing.

The on-site review report indicates that WL does have testing equipment and facilities appropriate for the areas
of recognition it seeks. The laboratory has available all the general test equipment required to perform the testing
required by the particular standards for which accreditation is sought. If any unique pieces of additional equipment
are necessary, WL will obtain them as required.

<TEXT>
 

WL's laboratory has adequate floor space for testing and evaluation and an adequate number of technical and professional
personnel to accomplish the services required for the present workload in the areas of recognition it seeks. Environmental
conditions in the laboratory are adequately controlled for the type of testing performed in the laboratory.

OSHA has determined that Wyle Laboratories has appropriate written test procedures, and calibration and quality
control programs to enable it to adequately perform appropriate testing.



Creditable Reports/Complaint Handling 



Section 1910.7(b)(4) provides that an OSHA recognized NRTL must maintain effective procedures for producing creditable
findings and reports that are objective and without bias. The laboratory, in order to be recognized, must also maintain
effective procedures for handling complaints under a fair and reasonable system. Wyle Laboratories meets these
criteria.

WL's application as well as the on-site review report indicate that WL does maintain effective procedures for producing
creditable findings and reports that are objective. The laboratory maintains a system for identifying product samples
submitted for testing to ensure that there is no confusion regarding the identity of the samples or the results of the
measurement.

Wyle Laboratories' Standard Operating Procedure documents the investigation and testing for product safety investigations.
These standard operating procedures specify the records that are to be maintained for the investigation, list the
general steps of the investigation in chronological order, specify the personnel responsible for conducting each
stage of the investigation, and require the investigators to verify that the latest edition of the standards are used.

Wyle Laboratories has a written Appeals Procedure which provides an unbiased review of questions or protests regarding
the results or process of Wyle Laboratories' Product Safety Certification Program by a client or any interested third
party.



Type of Testing



The standard contemplates that testing done by NRTLs fall into one of two categories: testing to determine conformance
with appropriate test standards, or experimental testing where there might not be one specific test standard covering
the new product or material. WL has applied for recognition in the first category.



Follow-Up Procedures



Section 1910.7(b)(2) requires that the NRTL provide certain follow-up procedures, to the extent necessary, for
the particular equipment or material to be listed, labeled, or accepted. These include implementation of control
procedures for identifying the listed or labeled equipment or materials, inspecting the production run at factories
to assure conformance with test standards, and conducting field inspections to monitor and assure the proper use
of the label.

Wyle Laboratories performs inspections of factory production runs to assure conformance with the appropriate product
safety standard and WL's Certification Report. The adequacy of the manufacturer's Quality Control Program will
be reviewed on the initial inspection.

WL's Follow-Up Services Agreement requires that it will have access, unannounced and unrestricted, to all facilities
where products may be fabricated, processed, or stored. Such inspections will be conducted at approximately three-month
intervals from the date of the initial inspection, (four times per year), depending upon production schedules. The
inspection is to assure that the product on the production line is identical to the product tested and approved for
labeling.

The procedure states that unresolved discrepancies found during the follow-up inspections could result in forfeiture
of the right to apply the label, removal of the already affixed labels, and the recall of products sold with the label.
WL will retain the right to notify vendors, authorities, potential users, and others of the improper, or unauthorized,
use of its mark.

WL will conduct field inspections to monitor and assure the proper use of its certification mark after the products
are delivered.



Independence



Section 1910.7(b)(3) requires that an NRTL be completely independent of employers subject to the tested equipment
requirements and of any manufacturer or vendors of equipment or materials being tested. The applicant stated in it
application that it is in complete compliance with this requirement.

OSHA believes, based upon an examination of the application with particular reference to the statements in Exhibit
2A(1), Section 3, pages 12 and 13, and the response (Ex. 4) to questions raised by the Office of the Solicitor, that Wyle
Laboratories is independent within the meaning of section 1910.7(b)(3).



Test Standards



Section 1910.7 requires that an NRTL use ``appropriate test standards'', which are defined, in part, to include any
standard that is currently designated as an American National Standards Institute (ANSI) safety designated product
standard or an American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) test standard used for evaluation of products or
materials. As to the non-ANSI UL test standards for which WL has applied to test products to, OSHA previously had examined
the status of the Underwriters Laboratories Inc. (UL) Standards for Safety and, in particular, the method of their
development, revision and implementation, and had determined that they are appropriate test standards under the
criteria described in 29 CFR 1910.7(c) (1), (2), and (3). That is, these standards specify the safety requirements
for specific equipment or classes of equipment and are recognized in the United States as safety standards providing
adequate levels of safety; they are compatible and remain current with periodic revisions of applicable national
codes and installation standards; and they are developed by a standards developing organization under a method providing
for input and consideration of views of industry groups, experts, users, consumers, governmental authorities,
and others having broad experience in the safety fields involved.

Final Decision and Order



Based upon a preponderance of the evidence resulting from an examination of the complete application, the supporting
documentation, and the OSHA staff finding including the on-site report, OSHA finds that Wyle Laboratories has met
the requirements of 29 CFR 1910.7 to be recognized by OSHA as a Nationally Recognized Testing Laboratory to test and
certify certain equipment or materials.

Pursuant to the authority in 29 CFR 1910.7, Wyle Laboratories is hereby recognized as a Nationally Recognized Testing
Laboratory subject to the conditions listed below. This recognition is limited to equipment or materials which,
under 29 CFR Part 1910, require testing, listing, labeling, approval, acceptance, or certification, by a Nationally
Recognized Testing Laboratory. This recognition is limited to the use of the following test standards for the testing
and certification of equipment or materials included within the scope of these standards.

WL has stated that all the standards in these categories are used to test equipment or materials which may be used in
environments under OSHA's jurisdiction. These standards are all considered appropriate test standards under 29

is based upon the NRTL's evaluation and accreditation of the manufacturer's quality assurance program;

The Occupational Safety and Health Administration shall be allowed access to WL's facilities and records for purposes
of ascertaining continuing compliance with the terms of its recognition and to investigate as OSHA deems necessary;

If WL has reason to doubt the efficacy of any test standard it is using under this program, it shall promptly inform the
organization that developed the test standard of this fact and provide that organization with appropriate relevant
information upon which its concerns are based;

WL shall not engage in or permit others to engage in any misrepresentation of the scope or conditions of its recognition.
As part of this condition, WL agrees that it will allow no representation that it is either a recognized or an accredited
Nationally Recognized Testing Laboratory (NRTL) without clearly indicating the specific equipment or material
to which this recognition is tied, or that its recognition is limited to certain products;

WL shall inform OSHA as soon as possible, in writing, of any change of ownership, facilities, or key personnel, including
details;

WL will continue to meet the requirements for recognition in all areas where it has been recognized;

WL will not test or certify any equipment or materials for a client which installs its equipment in an electronic enclosure
cabinet manufactured or distributed by Wyle.

WL will always cooperate with OSHA to assure compliance with the letter as well as the spirit of its recognition and
29 CFR 1910.7.

<USDEPT>NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION</USDEPT>






The Cleveland Electric Illuminating Company, et al.; Perry Nuclear Power Plan, Unit No. 1; Environmental Assessment
and Finding of No Significant Impact



The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an amendment to Facility Operating
License No. NPF-58, issued to the Cleveland Electric Illuminating Company, et al. (the licensee), for operation
of the Perry Nuclear Power Plant, Unit No. 1, located in Lake County, Ohio.


Environmental Assessment


Identification of Proposed Action



The proposed action would revise the operating license to reflect the proposed merger of the Toledo Edison Company
into the Cleveland Electric Illuminating Company. The two companies are currently wholly-owned subsidiaries of
the Centerior Energy Corporation. As described in the application, the company formed from the merger is intended
to be renamed. The name of the combined operating company has yet to be determined (hereinafter referred to as ``NEWCO'')
and the licensees indicate it will be provided by supplemental letter. The proposed amendment would (1) replace the
Toledo Edison Company and Cleveland Electric Illuminating Company with NEWCO as a licensee, (2) designate NEWCO
as owner of Perry Nuclear Power Plant, Unit 1, and (3) make other associated changes to the license as indicated in the
amendment application. Centerior Service Company would be unaffected by the amendment and would remain a licensee.

The proposed action is in accordance with the licensee's application for amendment dated June 2, 1994.



The Need for the Proposed Action



The proposed action in the form of an amendment application is needed to reflect the result of the proposed merger of
the Toledo Edison Company into the Cleveland Electric Illuminating Company. This action is also intended to maximize
the operating efficiencies of the two affiliated companies.



Environmental Impacts of the Proposed Action




The Commission has completed its evaluation of the proposed action and concludes that there will be no changes to the
facility or to the operating, maintenance, engineering or other nuclear-related personnel as a result of the proposed
merger and license amendment. The proposed merger would not change the technical qualifications and responsibilities
of personnel. All of the Cleveland Electric Illuminating Company personnel in the Perry organization would be transferred
to NEWCO upon completion of the merger. This organization would continue to report to Centerior Service Company.
After the merger, NEWCO and Centerior Service Company would be required to continue to operate, manage, and maintain
the Perry Nuclear Power Plant, Unit 1, in accordance with the conditions and requirements of the NRC. No changes resulting
from the merger are expected with regard to the following: lines of authority and responsibility, essential nuclear
support functions provided to Perry, effectiveness of the organization, priorities and ongoing plant improvement
projects, technical qualifications, and corporate financial resources presently available in support of Perry
operations.

The change will not increase the probability or consequences of accidents, no changes are being made in the types of
any effluents that may be released offsite, and there is no significant increase in the allowable individual or cumulative
occupational radiation exposure. Accordingly, the Commission concludes that there are no significant radiological
environmental impacts associated with the proposed action.


With regard to potential nonradiological impacts, the proposed action does not affect the nonradiological plant
effluents and has not other environmental impact. Accordingly, the Commission concludes that there are no significant
nonradiological environmental impacts associated with the proposed action.


Alternatives to the Proposed Action



Since the Commission has concluded there is no measurable environmental impact associated with the proposed action,
any alternatives with equal or greater environmental impact need not be evaluated. The principal alternative to
the action would be to deny the request. Such action would not enhance the protection of the environment.



Alternative Use of Resources



This action does not involve the use of any resources not previously considered in the Final Environmental Statement
for the Perry Nuclear Power Plant, Units 1 and 2, documented in NUREG-0884.


Agencies and Persons Consulted



The NRC staff consulted with the Ohio State official regarding the environmental impact of the proposed action. The
State official had no comments.



Finding of No Significant Impact



Based upon the environmental assessment, the Commission concludes that the proposed action will not have a significant
effect on the quality of the human environment. Accordingly, the Commission has determined not to prepare an environmental
impact statement for the proposed action.

For further details with respect to the proposed action, see the licensee's letter dated June 2, 1994, which is available
for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, The Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington,
DC 20555, and at the local public document room located at the Perry Public Library, 3753 Main Street, Perry, Ohio 44081.

<DOCTITLE>Arizona Public Service Company; Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station, Units 1, 2, and 3; Consideration of Issuance
of Amendment to Facility Operating License, Proposed No Significant Hazards; Consideration, Determination, and
Opportunity for a Hearing </DOCTITLE>



The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an amendment to Facility Operating
License Nos. NPF-41, NPR-51, and NPF-74 issued to Arizona Public Service Company (the licensee)
for operation of the Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station, Units 1, 2, and 3 located in Maricopa County, Arizona.


The proposed amendment would implement recommended changes from Generic Letter (GL) 93-05, ``Line-Item Technical
Specification Improvements to Reduce Surveillance Requirements for Testing During Power Operation.'' Specifically,
the licensee proposed to change their Technical Specifications corresponding to the following GL 93-05 line
numbers: 4.1.2, 5.8, 5.14, 6.1, 7.5, 8.1, 9.1, 12, and 14. 

Before issuance of the proposed license amendment, the Commission will have made findings required by the Atomic
Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act) and the Commission's regulations. 

The Commission has made a proposed determination that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.
Under the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facility in accordance with the
proposed amendment would not (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee
has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: 



Standard 1_

Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. 

This amendment request does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated based on the safety analysis, because the proposed changes to the TS do not affect the assumptions,
design parameters, or results of any UFSAR accident analysis. The proposed amendment does not add or modify any existing
equipment. The changes to the surveillance requirements will result in an overall improvement in plant safety by
reducing the frequency of plant trips and subsequent challenges to the safety systems, decreasing equipment degradation
due to excessive testing, reducing radiation exposure to plant personnel (which is not justified by the safety significance
of the surveillance), and eliminating an unnecessary burden on plant personnel (time required for testing is not
justified by the safety significance of the testing). Therefore, the proposed TS changes do not involve a significant
increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. 



Standard 2

_Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously analyzed. 

This amendment request does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
analyzed since the proposed TS changes do not involve modifications to any of the existing equipment or affect the
operation or design basis of the equipment. The proposed changes increase the surveillance intervals for a small
fraction of the SR [surveillance requirement], while ensuring that overall plant safety is improved. Therefore,
the proposed TS changes would not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously
evaluated. 



Standard 3

_Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. 

The margin of safety presently provided is not reduced by the proposed changes in surveillance intervals in this TS
amendment. The operability requirements of the affected systems, structures, and components are not changed by
this TS amendment. Although the proposed changes increase the surveillance intervals for the affected TS, the reliability
and operability of systems, components, and structures continues to be ensured by periodic testing. Since equipment
reliability and operability will be maintained, the proposed TS changes will not involve a significant reduction
in margin of safety. 

The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration. 

The Commission is seeking public comments on this proposed determination. Any comments received within 30 days after
the date of publication of this notice will be considered in making any final determination. 

Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendment until the expiration of the 30-day notice period. However,
should circumstances change during the notice period such that failure to act in a timely way would result, for example,
in derating or shutdown of the facility, the Commission may issue the license amendment before the expiration of the
30-day notice period, provided that its final determination is that the amendment involves no significant hazards
consideration. The final determination will consider all public and State comments received. Should the Commission
take this action, it will publish in the 

Federal Register 

a notice of issuance and provide for opportunity for a hearing after issuance. The Commission expects that the need
to take this action will occur very infrequently.

Written comments may be submitted by mail to the Rules Review and Directives Branch, Division of Freedom of Information
and Publications Services, Office of Administration, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555,
and should cite the publication date and page number of this 

Federal Register

 notice. Written comments may also be delivered to Room 6D22, Two White Flint North, 11545 Rockville Pike, Rockville
Maryland, from 7:30 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. Federal workdays. Copies of written comments received may be examined at the
NRC Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555.

The filing of requests for hearing and petitions for leave to intervene is discussed below.

By August 22, 1994, the licensee may file a request for a hearing with respect to issuance of the amendment to the subject
facility operating license and any person whose interest may be affected by this proceeding and who wishes to participate
as a party in the proceeding must file a written request for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene. Requests
for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's ``Rules of Practice
for Domestic Licensing Proceedings'' in 10 CFR Part 2. Interested persons should consult a current copy of 10 CFR 2.714
which is available at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington,
DC 20555 and at the local public document room located at the Phoenix Public Library, 12 East McDowell Road, Phoenix,
Arizona 85004. If a request for a hearing or petition for leave to intervene is filed by the above date, the Commission
or an Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, designated by the Commission or by the Chairman of the Atomic Safety and Licensing
Board Panel, will rule on the request and/or petition; and the Secretary or the designated Atomic Safety and Licensing
Board will issue a notice of hearing or an appropriate order.

As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall set forth with particularly the interest of the
petitioner in the proceeding, and how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding. The petition
should specifically explain the reasons why intervention should be permitted with particular reference to the following
factors: (1) The nature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made party to the proceeding; (2) the nature and
extent of the petitioner's property, financial, or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect
of any order which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest. The petition should also identify
the specific aspect(s) of the subject matter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Any person
who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has been admitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting
leave of the Board up to 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended
petition must satisfy the specificity requirements described above.

Not later than 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file
a supplement to the petition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions which are sought to be litigated
in the matter. Each contention must consist of a specific statement of the issue of law or fact to be raised or controverted.
In addition, the petitioner shall provide a brief explanation of the bases of the contention and a concise statement
of the alleged facts or expert opinion which support the contention and on which the petitioner intends to rely in proving
the contention at the hearing. The petitioner must also provide references to those specific sources and documents
of which the petitioner is aware and on which the petitioner intends to rely to establish those facts or expert opinion.
Petitioner must provide sufficient information to show that a genuine dispute exists with the applicant on a material
issue of law or fact. Contentions shall be limited to matters within the scope of the amendment under consideration.
The contention must be one which, if proven, would entitle the petitioner to relief. A petitioner who fails to file
such a supplement which satisfies these requirements with respect to at least one contention will not be permitted
to participate as a party.

Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subject to any limitations in the order granting leave
to intervene, and have the opportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, including the opportunity
to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses.

If a hearing is requested, the Commission will make a final determination on the issue of no significant hazards consideration.
The final determination will serve to decide when the hearing is held.

If the final determination is that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration, the Commission
may issue the amendment and make it immediately effective, notwithstanding the request for a hearing. Any hearing
held would take place after issuance of the amendment.

If the final determination is that the amendment request involves a significant hazards consideration, any hearing
held would take place before the issuance of any amendment.

A request for a hearing or a petition for leave to intervene must be filed with the Secretary of the Commission, U.S.
Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Docketing and Services Branch, or may be delivered
to the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555, by the above
date. Where petitions are filed during the last 10 days of the notice period, it is requested that the petitioner promptly
so inform the Commission by a toll-free telephone call to Western Union at 1-(800) 248-5100 (in Missouri
1-(800) 342-6700). The Western Union operator should be given Datagram Identification Number N1023
and the following message addressed to Theodore R. Quay: petitioner's name and telephone number, date petition was
mailed, plant name, and publication date and page number of this 

Federal Register

 notice. A copy of the petition should also be sent to the Office of the General Counsel, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,
Washington, DC 20555, and to Nancy C. Loftin, Esq., Corporate Secretary and Counsel, Arizona Public Service Company,
P.O. Box 53999, Mail Station 9068, Phoenix, Arizona 85072-3999, attorney for the licensee.

Nontimely filings of petitions for leave to intervene, amended petitions, supplemental petitions and/or requests
for hearing will not be entertained absent a determination by the Commission, the presiding officer or the presiding
Atomic Safety and Licensing Board that the petition and/or request should be granted based upon a balancing of the
factors specified in 10 CFR 2.714(a)(1)(i)-(v) and 2.714(d).

For further details with respect to this action, see the application for amendment dated January 4, 1994, which is
available for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW.,

<DOCTITLE>John W. Boomer, Address Deleted; Order Prohibiting Involvement in NRC-Licensed Activities (Effective Immediately)</DOCTITLE>



I



John W. Boomer has been a nuclear medicine technologist since 1972. On February 11, 1993, Mr. Boomer, as the President
of Chesapeake Imaging Center, Inc. (CIC or Licensee) applied for an NRC license. On March 23, 1993 Materials License
No. 47-25238-01 was issued to CIC by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC or Commission) pursuant to
10 CFR parts 30 and 35. The license authorized the possession and use of radiopharmaceuticals for nuclear medicine
activities in accordance with the conditions specified therein. The license was terminated this date.



II



On July 30, 1993, the NRC conducted an initial inspection of CIC at its facility located in Chesapeake, West Virginia.
As a result of the inspection, multiple violations of NRC requirements were identified. One specific violation identified
involved the failure to perform weekly surveys for removable contamination in the nuclear medicine department between
March 24 and July 30, 1993. As a result of this inspection, a Notice of Violation is being issued contemporaneously
with this Order.

Between August 3 and September 30, 1993, an investigation was conducted by the NRC Office of Investigations (OI) to
determine if certain violations identified during the July 30, 1993, inspection were the result of deliberate misconduct.
Based on investigative findings, the NRC staff concludes that Mr. Boomer deliberately caused CIC to violate the requirement
to perform the weekly contamination surveys, after being advised by the CIC facility Manager and CIC technical consultant
that such surveys were required. Mr. Boomer was aware of the NRC requirement to perform weekly contamination surveys,
yet deliberately failed to meet the requirement in violation of 10 CFR 35.70(e) and 10 CFR 30.10.

A transcribed telephone enforcement conference between the NRC staff and Mr. Boomer was held on March 8, 1994. Mr.
Boomer indicated during the enforcement conference that he had significant difficulties in obtaining the funds
from investors and did not recognize the severity of the noncompliance but rather focused on the needs of patients
traveling miles to obtain the studies. Mr. Boomer also stated during the enforcement conference that he did accept
responsibility for not obtaining the equipment in a more timely fashion and for not notifying NRC and indicated that
he would exercise better judgment in the future. From the discussions at the enforcement conference, the staff believes
an order to remove Mr. Boomer from involvement in NRC-licensed activities is warranted based on (1) The deliberate
noncompliance with the NRC's weekly survey requirement, (2) the fundamental lack of assurance that he will in the
future comply with Commission requirements, (3) his position as President, (4) his approximate 20 years experience
in NRC-licensed activities, and (5) his decision to continue operations although he knew he was not in compliance
with the weekly survey requirement.



III



Based on the above, Mr. Boomer engaged in deliberate misconduct which caused the licensee to be in violation of 10 CFR
35.70(e). The NRC must be able to rely on the Licensee and its employees to comply with NRC requirements, including
the requirement to perform weekly contamination surveys. Compliance with the NRC requirement to perform weekly
contamination surveys is necessary to protect members of the public as well as Licensee employees from unnecessary
radiation exposure that could result from undetected radioactive contamination. Performance of weekly contamination
surveys is an important safety requirement intended to prevent radioactive contamination of patients, employees
and other members of the public. Mr. Boomer's deliberate actions in causing the Licensee to violate these requirements
have raised serious doubts as to whether he can be relied on to be involved in NRC-licensed activities.

Consequently, I lack the requisite reasonable assurance that licensed activities can be conducted in compliance
with the Commission's requirements and that the health and safety of the public will be protected if Mr. Boomer were
permitted at this time to be involved in NRC-licensed activities. Therefore, the public health, safety and interest
require that Mr. Boomer be prohibited from any involvement in NRC-licensed activities for a period of three years
from the date of this Order, and if he is currently involved with another licensee in NRC-licensed activities, he must
immediately cease such activities, and inform the NRC of the name, address and telephone number of the employer, and
provide a copy of this order to the employer. During this period Mr. Boomer also shall be required to provide a copy of
this Order to any prospective employer who engages in NRC-licensed activities prior to the time that Mr. Boomer accepts
employment with such prospective employer. The purpose of this notice is so that any prospective employer is aware
of Mr. Boomer's prohibition from engaging in NRC-licensed activities. Additionally, Mr. Boomer is required to notify
the NRC of his first employment in NRC-licensed activities following the prohibition period. Furthermore, pursuant
to 10 CFR 2.202, I find that the significance of Mr. Boomer's conduct described above is such that the public health,
safety and interest require that this Order be immediately effective.



IV



Accordingly, pursuant to sections 81, 161b, 161c, 161i, 161o, 182 and 186 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended,
and the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 2.202, 10 CFR 30.10, and 10 CFR 150.20, it is hereby ordered, effective immediately,
that:

1. Mr. John W. Boomer is prohibited for three years from the date of this Order from any involvement in NRC-licensed
activities. NRC-licensed activities are those activities which are conducted pursuant to a specific or general
license issued by the NRC, including, but not limited to, those activities of Agreement State licensees conducted
pursuant to the authority granted by 10 CFR 150.20.

2. For a period of three years from the date of this Order, Mr. John W. Boomer shall provide a copy of this Order to any prospective
employer who engages in NRC-licensed activities (as defined in 1 above) prior to his acceptance of employment with
such prospective employer. The purpose of this requirement is to ensure that the employer is aware of Mr. Boomer's
prohibition from engaging in NRC-licensed activities.

3. The first time Mr. Boomer is employed in NRC-licensed activities following the three year prohibition, he shall
notify the Regional Administrator, NRC Region II, 101 Marietta Street, NW., Suite 2900, Atlanta, Georgia 30323,
at least five days prior to the performance of licensed activities or his being employed to perform NRC-licensed activities
(as described in 1 above). The notice shall include the name, address, and telephone number of the NRC or Agreement
State licensee and the location where the licensed activities will be performed.

4. If Mr. Boomer is currently involved in NRC-licensed activities at an employer or entity, Mr. Boomer shall, in accordance
with Paragraph 1 above, immediately cease such activities and provide notice within 20 days of the date of this Order
to the Director, Office of Enforcement, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555 of the name, address
and telephone number of the employer or entity where the licensed activities are being conducted. Further, Mr. Boomer
shall provide a copy of this Order to his employer if his employer is engaged in NRC-licensed activities.

The Director, Office of Enforcement, may, in writing, relax or rescind any of the above conditions upon a showing by
Mr. Boomer of good cause.



V



In accordance with 10 CFR 2.202, Mr. Boomer must, and any other person adversely affected by this Order may, submit
an answer to this Order, and may request a hearing on this Order, within 20 days of the date of this Order. The answer may
consent to this Order. Unless the answer consents to this Order, the answer shall, in writing and under oath or affirmation,
specifically admit or deny each allegation or charge made in this Order and shall set forth the matters of fact and law
on which Mr. Boomer or any other person adversely affected relies and the reasons as to why the Order should not have
been issued. Any answer or request for a hearing shall be submitted to the Secretary, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,
Attn: Chief, Docketing and Service Section, Washington, DC 20555. Copies also shall be sent to the Director, Office
of Enforcement, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555; to the Assistant General Counsel for
Hearings and Enforcement at the same address, to the Regional Administrator, NRC Region II, 101 Marietta Street NW.,
suite 2900, Atlanta, Georgia 30323, and to Mr. Boomer if the answer or hearing request is by a person other than Mr. Boomer.
If a person other than Mr. Boomer requests a hearing, that person shall set forth with particularity the manner in which
his or her interest is adversely affected by this Order and shall address the criteria set forth in 10 CFR 2.714(d).

If a hearing is requested by Mr. Boomer or a person whose interest is adversely affected, the Commission will issue
an Order designating the time and place of any hearing. If a hearing is held, the issue to be considered at such hearing
shall be whether this Order should be sustained.

Pursuant to 10 CFR 2.202(c)(2)(i), Mr. Boomer, or any other person adversely affected by this Order, may, in addition
to demanding a hearing, at the time the answer is filed or sooner, move the presiding officer to set aside the immediate
effectiveness of the Order on the ground that the Order, including the need for immediate effectiveness, is not based
on adequate evidence but on mere suspicion, unfounded allegations, or error.

In the absence of any request for hearing, the provisions specified in Section IV above shall be final 20 days from the
date of this Order without further Order or processing. An answer or a request for hearing shall not stay the immediate
effectiveness of this Order.

<DOCTITLE>Georgia Power Co., et al.; Notice of Consideration of Issuance of Amendments to Facility Operating Licenses, Proposed
No Significant Hazards Consideration Determination, and Opportunity for a Hearing</DOCTITLE>



The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an amendment to Facility Operating
License No. NPR-5, issued to the Georgia Power Company, Oglethorpe Power Corporation, Municipal Electric
Authority of Georgia, City of Dalton, Georgia (the licensee), for operation of the Edwin I. Hatch Nuclear Plant, Unit
2, located in Appling County, Georgia.

The proposed amendment would revise Technical Specification (TS) 3.3.6.6 for Hatch Unit 2 to permit the traversing
incore probe (TIP) system to be considered operable with less than four operable TIP machines. The TIP system is used
to periodically determine the power distribution in the core, for the calibration of the local power range monitor
(LPRM) detectors, and for monitoring core thermal limits: the average planar linear heat generation rate (APLHGR),
the linear heat generation rate (LHGR), and the minimum critical power ratio (MCPR).

The proposed amendment will also allow the utilization of substitute TIP data for the inaccessible locations from
either symmetric TIP locations or from normalized TIP data as calculated by the online core monitoring system.

In the July 19, 1994, submittal, the licensee stated that, on July 11, 1994, with Hatch Unit 2 operating at 100% rated
thermal power, Plant Hatch shift personnel were performing the procedure for the TIP normalization required to be
performed every 31 effective full power days. Nearing completion of the procedure, personnel were unable to place
the ``D'' TIP into channel 9. It had apparently stuck in channel 8, indicating a problem with the indexing mechanism.
The indexing mechanism is located inside the primary containment (drywell), access to which is not possible at the
present power level. Based on the last successfully performed LPRM calibration, the next one is to be completed no
later than August 9, 1994. If the surveillance is not performed by that time, it will be necessary to declare the APRMs
inoperable and, thus, enter an immediate reactor shutdown in accordance with TS 3.3.1.b, Action 3.

The problem with the ``D'' TIP could not have been foreseen, although Plant Hatch has had problems with the indexing
mechanism in the past. However, each problem is unique and has a different root cause. Subsequent to the discovery
of the problem, efforts to return the ``D'' TIP to operable status were initiated. These efforts were led by the licensee's
engineering staff with vendor representatives on-site as well. The licensee has performed several tests which included
verification of proper voltage to the indexer motor, verification of proper motor winding resistance as well as over-voltage
tests on the indexing mechanism, and also conducted a reverse motor test in an attempt to free the indexer; however,
this attempt was unsuccessful. All the licensee's efforts to repair the TIP, without drywell access, were exhausted
on Friday, July 15, 1994.

Before issuance of the proposed license amendment, the Commission will have made findings required by the Atomic
Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act) and the Commission's regulations.

Pursuant to 10 CFR 50.91(a)(6) for amendments to be granted under exigent circumstances, the NRC staff must determine
that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration. Under the Commission's regulations
in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not (1) involve
a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated; or (2) create the
possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant
reduction in a margin of safety. As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue
of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below:




The change does not involve a significant hazards consideration for the following reasons:

(1) The proposed amendment does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated.

The TIP system is not used to prevent, or mitigate the consequences of, any previously analyzed accident or transient,
nor are any assumptions made in any accident analysis relative to the operation of the TIP system. No other safety related
system is affected by this change.

The use of substitute values from symmetric TIP locations or from calculations performed by the on-line computer
core monitoring system does not affect the consequences of plant transients previously evaluated in the FSAR [Final
Safety Analysis Report], because the total core TIP reading (nodal power) uncertainty is less than 8.7%. Thus, the
MCPR safety limit is not affected.

(2) The proposed amendment does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident
previously evaluated.

The proposed change does not involve the installation of any new equipment, or the modification of any equipment designed
to prevent or mitigate the consequences of accidents or transients. Therefore, the change has no effect on any accident
initiator, and no new or different type of accidents are postulated to occur.

(3) The proposed amendment does not result in a significant reduction in the margin of safety.

<DOCNO> FR940722-2-00098 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940722-2-00062 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

The total core TIP reading uncertainties will remain with the assumptions of the licensing basis, thus, the margin
of safety to the MCPR safety limits is not reduced. The ability of the computer to accurately represent nodal powers
in the reactor core is not compromised. The ability of the computer to accurately predict the LHGR, APLHGR, MCPR, and
its ability to provide for LPRM calibration, is not compromised. Therefore, the margin of safety is not significantly
reduced.




The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.

The Commission is seeking public comments on this proposed determination. Any comments received within 15 days after
the date of publication of this notice will be considered in making any final determination.

Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendment until the expiration of the 15-day notice period. However,
should circumstances change during the notice period, such that failure to act in a timely way would result, for example,
in derating or shutdown of the facility, the Commission may issue the license amendment before the expiration of the
15-day notice period, provided that its final determination is that the amendment involves no significant hazards
consideration. The final determination will consider all public and State comments received. Should the Commission
take this action, it will publish in the 

Federal Register

 a notice of issuance. The Commission expects that the need to take this action will occur very infrequently.

Written comments may be submitted by mail to the Rules Review and Directives Branch, Division of Freedom of Information
and Publication Services, Office of Administration, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555,
and should cite the publication date and page number of this 

Federal Register

 notice. Written comments may also be delivered to Room 6D22, Two White Flint North, 11545 Rockville Pike, Rockville
Maryland, from 7:30 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. Federal workdays. Copies of written comments received may be examined at the
NRC Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555.

The filing of requests for hearing and petitions for leave to intervene is discussed below.

By August 22, 1994, the licensee may file a request for a hearing with respect to issuance of the amendment to the subject
facility operating license and any person whose interest may be affected by this proceeding and who wishes to participate
as a party in the proceeding must file a written request for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene. Requests
for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's ``Rules of Practice
for Domestic Licensing Proceedings'' in 10 CFR Part 2. Interested persons should consult a current copy of 10 CFR 2.714
which is available at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington,
DC 20555 and at the local public document room located at the Appling County Public Library, 301 City Hall Drive, Baxley,
Georgia 31513. If a request for a hearing or petition for leave to intervene is filed by the above date, the Commission
or an Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, designated by the Commission or by the Chairman of the Atomic Safety and Licensing
Board Panel, will rule on the request and/or petition; and the Secretary or the designated Atomic Safety and Licensing
Board will issue a notice of hearing or an appropriate order.

As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall set forth with particularity the interest of the
petitioner in the proceeding, and how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding. The petition
should specifically explain the reasons why intervention should be permitted with particular reference to the following
factors: (1) The nature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made a party to the proceeding; (2) the nature and
extent of the petitioner's property, financial, or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect
of any order which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest. The petition should also identify
the specific aspect(s) of the subject matter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Any person
who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has been admitted as party may amend the petition without requesting
leave of the Board up to 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended
petition must satisfy the specificity requirements described above.

Not later than 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file
a supplement to the petition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions which are sought to be litigated
in the matter. Each contention must consist of a specific statement of the issue of law or fact to be raised or controverted.
In addition, the petitioner shall provide a brief explanation of the bases of the contention and a concise statement
of the alleged facts or expert opinion which support the contention and on which the petitioner intends to rely in proving
the contention at the hearing. The petitioner must also provide references to those specific sources and documents
of which the petitioner is aware and on which the petitioner intends to rely to establish those facts or expert opinion.
Petitioner must provide sufficient information to show that a genuine dispute exists with the applicant on a material
issue of law or fact. Contentions shall be limited to matters within the scope of the amendment under consideration.
The contention must be one which, if proven, would entitle the petitioner to relief. A petitioner who fails to file
such a supplement which satisfies these requirements with respect to at least one contention will not be permitted
to participate as a party.

Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subject to any limitations in the order granting leave
to intervene, and have the opportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, including the opportunity
to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses.

If the amendment is issued before the expiration of the 30-day hearing period, the Commission will make a final determination
on the issue of no significant hazards consideration. If a hearing is requested, the final determination will serve
to decide when the hearing is held.

If the final determination is that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration, the Commission
may issue the amendment and make it immediately effective, notwithstanding the request for a hearing. Any hearing
held would take place after issuance of the amendment.

If the final determination is that the amendment request involves a significant hazards consideration, any hearing
held would take place before the issuance of any amendment.

Options Price Reporting Authority; Notice of Filing and Immediate Effectiveness of an Amendment to the National
market System Plan of OPRA Relating to Exemptions form OPRA's Indirect Access Fee for Certain Subscribers



July 15, 1994.



Pursuant to Rule 11Aa3-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), notice is hereby given that on
June 27, 1994, the Options Price Reporting Authority (``OPRA'') submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission
(``SEC'' or ``Commission'') an amendment to the Plan for Reporting of Consolidated Options Last Sale Reports and
Quotation Information (``Plan''), exempting from OPRA's Indirect Access Fee those subscribers who receive a data
feed transmission of options market information from an OPRA vendor on a single stand-alone computer for the sole
purpose of providing a single-screen display of options information for the subscriber's own internal use. OPRA
has designated this proposal as concerned solely with an existing fee, permitting it to become effective upon filing,
pursuant to Rule 11Aa3-2(c)(3)(ii) under the Act. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments
from interested persons on the amendment.



I. Description and Purpose of the Amendment



The purpose of the proposed amendment is to respond to recent and ongoing changes in computer and communications technology
that have resulted in an ever greater number of OPRA subscribers choosing to receive options information in the form
of a bulk data feed transmission from a vendor, rather than as a vendor-controlled interrogation or display service.
At the time the Subscriber Indirect Access Fee was first adopted, only a relatively few large subscribers received
a data feed transmission, usually to serve multiple terminals in a network. The Subscribers Indirect Access Fee was
intended to allocate to these subscribers OPRA's higher administrative costs associated with providing access
to subscribers whose terminal population is not under vendor control. Recent changes in computer and communications
technology have now made it cost effective for an increasing number of smaller OPRA subscribers to access options
market information by means of vendor-provided, data-feed transmissions received on a single computer terminal.
Since such single-device data-feed subscribers do not subject OPRA to the higher costs associated with multiple
device counts and entitlements, OPRA has determined that it would more fairly allocated its costs through the fees
charged to various categories of users of options market information to exempt such single-device data feed subscribers
from the Subscriber Indirect Access Fee. Such subscribers will continue to be subject to OPRA's basic Subscriber
Fee, and the Indirect Access Fee will continue to apply to multiple terminal users of data feed transmissions.



II. Solicitation of Comments



Pursuant to Rule 11Aa3-2(c)(3), the amendment is effective upon filing with the Commission. The Commission
may summarily abrogate the amendment within 60 days of its filing and require refiling and approval of the amendment
by Commission order pursuant to Rule 11Aa3-2(c)(2), if it appears to the Commission that such action is necessary
or appropriate in the public interest, for the protection of investors and maintenance of fair and orderly markets,
to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanisms of a National Market System, or otherwise in furtherance of the
purposes of the Act.

Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed extension that are filed with Commission, and all written communications relating to the proposed
extension between the Commission and any person, other than those withheld from the public in accordance with the
provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying in the Commission's Public Reference Room.
Copies of the filing also will be available at the principal office of OPRA. All submissions should refer to File No.
S7-8-90 and should be submitted by [insert date 21 days from the date of publication].

For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority, 17 CFR 200.30-3(a)(29).

<DOCTITLE>Self-Regulatory Organizations; National Securities Clearing Corporation; Order Approving Proposed Rule Change
Modifying Clearing Fund Requirements</DOCTITLE>



July 15, 1994.



On April 4, 1994, the National Securities Clearing Corporation (``NSCC'') filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission (``Commission'') a proposed rule change (File No. SR-NSCC-94-06) under Section 19(b)
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'').
 Notice of the proposed rule change was published in the 

Federal Register

 on May 25, 1994, to solicit comments from interested persons.
 No comments were received by the Commission. This order approves the proposal.






I. Description of the Proposal



The proposed rule change modifies NSCC's clearing fund requirements for those NSCC members for which NSCC sponsors
an account at The Depository Trust Company (``DTC''). The modified requirements are designed to more accurately
reflect NSCC's risks associated with such sponsoring. The modified requirements also will be more consistent with
the way in which NSCC and DTC address similar risks associated with dual NSCC/DTC members.


Currently under certain situations, NSCC applies a factor in calculating its clearing fund requirements for members'
non-continuous net settlement (``non-CNS'') activity (

e.g.

, envelope settlement system activity'').
 The DTC settlement activity of members which NSCC sponsors into DTC (``sponsored members'') is included in the non-CNS
calculation. The factor is applicable when a member's average daily envelope settlement system debits exceed the
member's excess net capital. For the reasons set forth below, NSCC desires to eliminate application of the factor
in the clearing fund calculation related to sponsored members' DTC settlement activity. In lieu thereof, NSCC has
determined to add an additional advisory surveillance criteria to its guidelines for placing a member on surveillance
status in order to cover circumstances where a sponsored member's average daily envelope settlement system debits
plus its average daily DTC settlement debits exceed the sponsored member's excess net capital.






In File No. SR-NSCC-82-10, NSCC amended its clearing fund formula to permit the collection of additional
clearing fund deposits from members using NSCC's envelope settlement system.
 Calculation of the additional clearing fund deposits involved use of a factor. The primary purpose of the additional
clearing fund deposits and the use of a factor was to better protect NSCC against the risks presented by the envelope
settlement systems (

i.e.

, that securities delivered through the envelope settlement systems would not be available for return to the deliverer
in the event the receiver were to become insolvent and be unable to pay for the delivery). However, NSCC did not limit
the application of the factor to only the calculation of clearing fund requirements for physical envelope deliveries
but also applied it in the calculation of clearing fund requirements associated with the DTC settlement activity
of sponsored members.





NSCC believes that its current clearing fund formula, as applied to sponsored members, can result in excessive clearing
fund requirements. NSCC believes that the risk associated with sponsored members' DTC settlement activities will
be adequately addressed without the application of a factor. The proposed rule change, while eliminating the use
of a factor in determining a sponsored member's clearing fund requirement with respect to DTC settlement activity,
gives NSCC the ability to place a sponsored member on advisory surveillance status with an increased clearing fund
requirement under the circumstances where previously the factor would have been applied. Furthermore, NSCC will
continue to collect from each sponsored member a clearing fund deposit based not only on the member's NSCC settlement
activities but also based on its DTC settlement activities. The portion of NSCC's clearing fund deposit based on DTC
settlement activities generally will be the same amount the sponsored member would be required to deposit with DTC
for that DTC settlement activity if the sponsored member had a regular account at DTC.


II. Discussion




For the reasons discussed below, the Commission believes the proposal is consistent with the Act and particularly
Section 17A(b)(3)(F) of the Act.
 Section 17A(b)(3)(F) requires that the rules of clearing agencies be designed to assure the safeguarding of funds
in the custody or control of clearing agencies or for which they are responsible.




The Commission agrees with NSCC that the elimination of the factor in determining a sponsored member's clearing fund
requirement with respect to DTC settlement activity will more appropriately reflect the relevant risks and that
it will be consistent with the way in which DTC addresses settlement risks for its members. At the same time, the Commission
believes that the modified NSCC clearing fund formula provides for the collection of deposits adequate to protect
NSCC from the risks associated with the DTC settlement activities of sponsored members. Accordingly, the modified
clearing fund formula should result in a more equal distribution of the financial burdens placed on NSCC sponsored
members while allowing NSCC to fulfill its statutory safekeeping obligation.


III. Conclusion




For the reasons discussed above, the Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the Act, particularly
with Section 17A(b)(3)(F) of the Act, and the rules and regulations thereunder.



It is therefore ordered,

 pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act, that the above-mentioned proposed rule change (File No. SR-NSCC-94-06)
be, and hereby is, approved.



For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.

<DOCTITLE>Financial Horizons Life Insurance Company, et al.</DOCTITLE>


July 18, 1994.



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or the ``Commission'').



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of application for exemption under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the ``1940 Act'').







APPLICANTS: 

Financial Horizons Life Insurance Company (``Financial Horizons''), Financial Horizons VA Separate Account-3
(the ``Account'') and Nationwide Financial Services, Inc. (``Nationwide'').




RELEVANT 1940 ACT SECTIONS: 

Order requested under Section 6(c) of the 1940 Act for exemptions from Sections 26(a)(2)(C) and 27(c)(2) of the 1940
Act.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY OF APPLICATION: 

Applicants seek an order permitting them to deduct a daily charge from the assets of the Account for mortality and expense
risks in connection with the offering of certain variable annuity contracts.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Following is a summary of the application, the complete application is available for a fee from the Public Reference
Branch of the SEC.


Applicants' Representations




1. Financial Horizons, a wholly owned subsidiary of Nationwide Life Insurance Company (``Nationwide Life''), is
a stock life insurance company incorporated under the laws of Ohio. Financial Horizons established the Account on
July 24, 1991 to serve as a funding medium for certain individual deferred variable annuity contracts (the ``Contracts'')
issued by Financial Horizons. The Account is registered with the Commission under the 1940 Act as a unit investment
trust. The application incorporates by reference the registration statement, currently on file with the Commission
(File No. 33-66496), for the Account.

2. Nationwide, also a wholly-owned subsidiary of Nationwide Life, serves as the general distributor for the Contracts.
Nationwide is registered with the Commission as a broker-dealer and as an investment advisor. Applicants also represent
that Nationwide is a member in good standing of the National Association of Securities Dealers.

3. The Contracts are sold either as nonqualified contracts or as individual retirement annuities which may quality
for special tax treatment under the provisions of Section 408(b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.
Purchase payments may be allocated by the Contract owner to one or more subaccounts of the Account. Each subaccount
of the Account will invest at net asset value in shares of the corresponding mutual fund which is registered under the
1940 Act. Prior to the annuity commencement date, a Contract owner may elect any of three annuity payment options.

4. Upon withdrawal of part or all of the Contract value, a contingent deferred sales charge (the ``Sales Charge'')
may be imposed by Financial Horizons. The Sales Charge is calculated by multiplying the applicable percentage by
the amount withdrawn and is deducted from the amount withdrawn. The Sales Charge will be applied as follows:

<DOC>
<DOCNO> FR940722-2-00104 </DOCNO>
<PARENT> FR940722-2-00065 </PARENT>
<TEXT>
 

5. After the first Contract year, the owner of a Contract may withdraw an amount, free of Sales Charge, equal to 10% of
the sum of all purchase payments made to the Contract at the time of withdrawal less any purchase payments previously
withdrawn that were subject to a Sales Charge. This privilege is noncumulative.
6. An annual Contract maintenance charge of $30 is deducted from the value of the Contract. Additionally, an administration
charge equal on an annual basis to 0.05% of the daily net asset value of the Account is deducted from the value of the Contract.
This administration charge is deducted during both the accumulation and the annuity phases of the Contract. Applicants
represent that Financial Horizons estimates that the annual administration charge of 0.05% for expenses will yield
an amount considerably less than the current and projected future administrative costs of Financial Horizons, even
when this charge is added to the $30 annual Contract maintenance charge. Applicants state that they will rely on Rule
26a-1 under the 1940 Act in deducting both charges and that both charges are guaranteed not to increase. Applicants
further state that Financial Horizons will monitor to ensure that the charges do not exceed expenses.
7. Financial Horizons will impose a daily charge equal to an annual effective rate of 1.25% of the value of the net assets
of the Account to compensate Financial Horizons for assuming certain mortality and expense risks in connection with
the Contracts. Approximately .80% of the 1.25% charge is attributable to mortality risk, and approximately .45%
is attributable to expense risk. If the mortality and expense risk charge is insufficient to cover actual costs and
assumed risk, Financial Horizons will bear the loss. Conversely, if the charge exceeds costs, this excess will be
profit to Financial Horizons. If Financial Horizons realizes a profit from the charge, the profit will become part
of the general account of Financial Horizons and may be used in its discretion.
8. Applicants state that the mortality risk borne by Financial Horizons consists of: (a) The risk of guaranteeing
to make monthly payments for the lifetime of the annuitant regardless of how long the annuitant may live; and (b) the
risk of promising to pay a death benefit upon the death of the designated annuitant prior to the annuity commencement
date even where the investment experience in the Account has eroded the purchase payments made by the Contract owner.
Applicants state that the expense risk assumed by Financial Horizons is the guarantee that the Contract maintenance
charge and the administration charge will never increase regardless of actual expense incurred by Financial Horizons.


Applicants' Legal Analysis and Conditions


1. Applicants request that the Commission, pursuant to Section 6(c) of the 1940 Act, grant the exemptions from Sections
26(a)(2)(C) and 27(c)(2) of the 1940 Act in connection with Applicants' assessment of the daily charge for the mortality
and expense risks. Sections 26(a)(2)(C) and 27(c)(2) of the 1940 Act, in pertinent part, prohibit a registered unit
investment trust and any depositor thereof or underwriter thereof from selling periodic payment plan certificates
unless the proceeds of all payments (other than sales load) are deposited with a qualified bank as trustee or custodian
and held under arrangements which prohibit any payment to the depositor or principal underwriter except a fee, not
exceeding such reasonable amount as the Commission may prescribe, for performing bookkeeping and other administrative
services of a character normally preformed by the bank itself.
2. Applicants assert that the charge for mortality and expense risks is reasonable in relation to the risks assumed
by Financial Horizons under the Contracts.
3. Applicants represent that the charge of 1.25% for the mortality and expense risks assumed by Financial Horizons
is within the range of industry practice with respect to comparable annuity products. Applicants state that this
representation is based upon the analysis by Financial Horizons of publicly available information relative to other
insurance companies of similar size and risk ratings offering similar products. Applicants represent that Financial
Horizons will maintain a memorandum, available to the Commission upon request, setting forth in detail the products
analyzed in the course of, and the methodology and results of, its comparative survey. Financial Horizons also maintains
a supporting actuarial memorandum, available to the Commission upon request, demonstrating the reasonableness
of the mortality and expense risk charge given the risks assumed under the Contracts.
4. Applicants represent that Financial Horizons has concluded that there is a reasonable likelihood that the proposed
distribution financing arrangement will benefit the Account and the Contract owners. The basis for such conclusion
is set forth in a memorandum which will be maintained by Financial Horizons and will be made available to the Commission
upon request.
5. Applicants represent that the Account will invest only in management investment companies which undertake, in
the event such company adopts a plan under Rule 12b-1 of the 1940 Act to finance distribution expenses, to have
such plan formulated and approved by the company's board of directors, a majority of whom are not interested persons
of such company within the meaning of Section 2(a)(19) of the 1940 Act.


Conclusion


Applicants assert that for the reasons and upon the facts set forth above, the requested exemptions from Sections
26(a)(2)(C) and 27(c)(2) of the 1940 Act are necessary and appropriate in the public interest and consistent with
the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the 1940 Act.



For the Commission, by the Division of Investment Management, pursuant to delegated authority.

July 18, 1994.



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Securities and Exchange Commission (the ``Commission'' or the ``SEC'').



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of application for exemption under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the ``1940 Act'').







APPLICANTS: 

Minnesota Mutual Life Insurance Company (the ``Company''), Minnesota Mutual Group Variable Annuity Account (the
``Separate Account''), and MIMLIC Sales Corporation.




RELEVANT 1940 ACT SECTIONS: 

Order requested under section 6(c) for exemptions from sections 26(a)(2)(C) and 27(c)(2) of the 1940 Act.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY OF APPLICATION: 

Applicants seek an order to permit the deduction from the assets of the Separate Account of a mortality and expense
risk charge under certain variable annuity contracts (``Contracts'').



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Following is a summary of the application. The complete application is available for a fee from the Commission's Public
Reference Branch.



Applicant's Representations



1. The Company is a mutual life insurance company organized under the laws of Minnesota. It is licensed to do business
in all States except New York (where it is an authorized reinsurer), the District of Columbia, Canada and Puerto Rico.

2. The Separate Account, registered as a unit investment trust under the 1940 Act, is a segregated investment account
of the Company that funds the Contracts and other variable annuities contracts. The Separate Account is divided into
sub-accounts, each of which invests solely in the shares of one of the following management investment companies:
The Index 500 and Money Market Portfolios of MIMLIC Series Fund, Inc., Vanguard Wellington Fund, the Vanguard Long
Term Corporation Bond Portfolio of Vanguard Fixed Income Securities Fund, Inc., Scudder International Fund, Inc.,
Fidelity Contrafund, Inc., and Janus Twenty Fund.

3. The Contracts are group deferred variable annuity contracts designed to provide benefits under deferred compensation
plans of State and local governments and other tax-exempt organizations as provided in section 457 of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. In a typical plan, the sponsor or eligible governmental unit is the owner of the Contract
and will designate individuals eligible to become participants in the Contracts. The Contracts and all interests
under them are subject to the general interests of creditors of the owners of the Contracts.

4. MIMLIC Sales Corporation, registered as a broker-dealer under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and as an investment
adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, is the principal underwriter of the Contracts.

5. There is an annual Contract administration charge of 0.15 that is deducted in reliance on Rule 26a-1. This
charge may be increased to 0.40% provided the charge could continue to be deducted in reliance on Rule 26a-1.

6. The Contracts do not provide for a front-end sales charge to be deducted from purchase payments. Instead, a contingent
deferred sales charge (``CDSC'') of up to 6% of the amount withdrawn or surrendered is charged. Applicants represent
that the sum of the CDSC charges deducted will not exceed 9% of purchase payments made by or on behalf of a participant.
The following table shows the applicable percentage for withdrawals or surrenders in the first month of each of the
first seven participation years:






7. The Company will deduct a mortality and expense risk charge that is equal, on an annual basis, to 1.25% of the average
daily net asset value of the Separate Account: approximately .60% for mortality risks and .85% for expense risks.
The current level of the proposed charge is 0.85%, of which 0.40% is for mortality risks and 0.45% is for expense risks.

The mortality risks assumed by the Company arise from its guarantees to make annuity payments as provided in the Contracts
regardless of how long a participant lives and regardless of any improvement in life expectancy of participants as
a class. Also, the Company bears mortality risks associated with the Contract's death benefit provision. The expense
risk assumed by the Company arise in connection with the Company's guarantees to make annuity payments in accordance
with annuity tables provided in the Contracts regardless of whether the Company's estimates of expenses is correct
over the life of the Contracts.

Applicants' Legal Analysis and Conditions


1. Sections 26(a)(2) and 27(c)(2) of the 1940 Act prohibit a registered unit investment trust and any depositor or
underwriter thereof from selling periodic payment plan certificates unless the proceeds of all payments are deposited
with a qualified trustee or custodian and held under arrangements which prohibit any payment to the depositor or principal
underwriter except a fee, not exceeding such reasonable amounts as the Commission may prescribe, for performing
bookkeeping and other administrative services.
2. Applicants request an order under section 6(c) exempting them from sections 26(a)(2)(C) and 27(c)(2) of the 1940
Act to the extent necessary to permit the deduction of the mortality and expense risk charge from the assets of the Separate
Account under the Contracts.
3. Applicants represent that the mortality and expense risk charge is within the range of industry practice with respect
to comparable annuity products. Applicants base this representation on an analysis of publicly available information
about comparable products, taking into consideration such factors as any contractual right to increase charges
above current levels, the existence of other charges, the number of transfers permitted without charge and the ability
to make free withdrawals. The Company represents that it will maintain at its home office a memorandum, available
to the Commission, setting forth in detail this analysis.
4. To the extent the CDSC is insufficient to cover the actual cost of distribution, the excess distribution costs will
be paid from the Company's general assets, including the profits, if any, from the mortality and expense risk charges.
The Company represents that there is a reasonable likelihood that the proposed distribution financing arrangements
will benefit the Separate Account and Contract owners. The basis for such conclusion will be set forth in a memorandum
maintained by the Company at its service office and available to the Commission upon request.
5. The Company represents that the Separate Account will invest only in management investment companies that undertake,
in the event the company adopts a plan to finance distribution expenses under Rule 12b-1 under the 1940 Act, to have
a board of directors, a majority of whom are not interested persons of the company within the meaning of section 2(a)(19)
of the 1940 Act, formulate and approve any such plan.


Conclusion


Applicants assert that, for the reasons and upon the facts set forth above, the requested exemptions from sections
26(a)(2)(C) and 27(c)(2) of the 1940 Act to deduct the mortality and expense risk charge from the assets of the Separate
Account under the Contracts meet the standards in section 6(c) of the 1940 Act. Applicants assert that the exemptions
requested are necessary and appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and
the purposes fairly intended by the policies and provisions of the 1940 Act.

Part II


Program Information


In the Soviet-Eastern European Research and Training Act of 1983 the Congress declared that independently verified
factual knowledge about the countries of that area is ``of utmost importance for the national security of the United
States, for the furtherance of our national interests in the conduct of foreign relations, and for the prudent management
of our domestic affairs.'' Congress also declared that the development and maintenance of such knowledge and expertise
``depends upon the national capability for advanced research by highly trained and experienced specialists, available
for service in and out of Government.'' The program provides financial support for advanced research, training and
other related functions on the countries of the region. By strengthening and sustaining in the United States a cadre
of experts on Eastern Europe and the independent states of the former Soviet Union, the program contributes to the
overall objectives of the FREEDOM Support and SEED programs.
The full purpose of the Act and the eligibility requirements are set forth in Pub. L. 98-164, 97 Stat. 1047-50,
as amended. The countries include Albania, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Estonia, Georgia,
Hungary, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldava, Poland, Romania, Russia, Slovakia, Tajikistan,
Turkmenistan, Ukraine, Uzbekistan, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Slovenia, Croatia, Serbia, Montenergro, and the Former
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. (No funds may actually be spent in Serbia.)
The Act establishes an Advisory Committee to recommend grant policies and recipients. The Secretary of State, after
consultation with the Advisory Committee, approves policies and makes final determinations on awards.
Applications for funding under the Act are invited from US organizations prepared to conduct competitive programs
on the independent states of the former Soviet Union and the countries of Eastern Europe and related fields. Applying
organizations or institutions should have the capability to conduct 

competitive award programs that are national in scope.

 Programs of this nature are those that make awards which are based upon an open, nationwide competition, incorporating
peer group review mechanisms. Individual end-users of these funds_those to whom the applicant organizations or
institutions propose to make awards_must be at the graduate or post-doctoral levels, and must have demonstrated
a likely career commitment to the study of Eastern Europe and/or the independent states of the former Soviet Union.

Applications sought in this competition among organizations or institutions are those that would contribute to
the development of a stable, long-term, national program of unclassified, advanced research and training on the
countries of Eastern Europe and/or the independent states of the former Soviet Union by proposing;

(1) 

National programs

 which award contracts or grants to American institutions of higher education or not-for-profit corporations in
support of post-doctoral or equivalent level research projects, such contracts or grants to contain shared-cost
provisions;

(2) 

National programs

 which offer graduate, post-doctoral and teaching fellowships for advanced training on the countries of Eastern
Europe and the independent states of the former Soviet Union, and in related studies, including training in the languages
of the region, with such training to be conducted, on a shared-cost basis, at American institutions of higher education;

(3) 

National programs

 which provide fellowships and other support for American specialists enabling them to conduct advanced research
on the countries of Eastern Europe and the independent states of the former Soviet Union, and in related studies; and
those which facilitate research collaboration between Government and private specialists in these areas;

(4) 

National programs

 which provide advanced training and research on a reciprocal basis in the countries of Eastern Europe and the independent
states of the former Soviet Union by facilitating access for American specialists to research facilities and resources
in those countries;

(5) 

National programs

 which facilitate public dissemination of research methods, data and findings; and those which propose to strengthen
the national capability for advanced research or training on the countries of Eastern Europe and the independent
states of the former Soviet Union in ways not specified above.






Note:

 The Advisory Committee will not consider applications from individuals to further their own training or research,
or from institutions or organizations whose proposals are not for competitive award programs that are national in
scope as defined above. Support for specific activities will be guided by the following policies:




_

Publications.

 Funds awarded in this competition should not be used to subsidize journals, newsletters and other periodical publications
except in special circumstances, in which cases the funds should be supplied through peer-review organizations
with national competitive programs.

_

Conferences.

 Proposals for conferences, like those for research projects and training programs, should be assessed according
to their relative contribution to the advancement of knowledge and to the professional development of cadres in the
fields. Therefore, requests for conference funding should be directed to one or more of the national peer-review
organizations receiving program funds, with proposed conferences being evaluated competitively against research,
fellowship or other proposals for achieving the purposes of the grant.

_

Library Activities.

 Funds may be used for certain library activities which clearly strengthen research and training on the countries
of Eastern Europe and the independent States of the former Soviet Union and benefit the fields as a whole. Such programs
must make awards based upon open, nationwide competition, incorporating peer group review mechanisms. Funds may
not be used for activities such as modernization, acquisition, or preservation. Modest, cost-effective proposals
to facilitate research, by eliminating serious cataloging backlogs or otherwise improving access to research materials,
will be considered.

_

Language Support. 

The Advisory Committee encourages attention to the non-Russian languages of the independent states of the former
Soviet Union and the less commonly taught languages of the East European countries. Support provided for Russian
language instruction/study normally will be only for advanced level. Applicants proposing to offer language instruction
are encouraged to apply to a national program as described above which has appropriate peer group review mechanisms.
_

Support for Non-Americans. 

The purpose of the program is to build and sustain U.S. expertise on the countries of Eastern Europe and the independent
states of the former Soviet Union. Therefore, the Advisory Committee has determined that highest priority for support
always should go to American specialists (i.e., U.S. citizens or permanent residents). Support for such activities
as long-term research fellowships, i.e., nine months or longer, should be restricted solely to American scholars.
Support for short-term activities also should be restricted to Americans, except in special instances where the
participation of a non-American scholar has clear and demonstrable benefits to the American scholarly community.
In such special instances, the application must justify the expenditure.



In making its recommendations, the Committee will seek to encourage a coherent, long-term, and stable effort directed
toward developing and maintaining a national capability on the countries of Eastern Europe and the independent states
of the former Soviet Union. Program proposals can be for the conduct of any of the functions enumerated, but in making
its recommendations, the Committee will be concerned to develop a balanced national effort which will ensure attention
to all the countries of the area. Legislation requires and this announcement indicates under 

Program Information 

of this section that in certain cases grantee organizations must include shared-cost provisions in their arrangements
with end-users. Cost-sharing is encourage, whenever feasible, in all programs.


Part III


Available Funds


Awards are contingent upon the availability of funds. Funding may be available at a level up to $10 million. The precise
level of funding will not be known until legislative action is complete. In Fiscal Year 1994, the Congress appropriated
to the program $10 million from the Agency for International Development budget.
The Department legally cannot commit funds that may be appropriated in subsequent fiscal years. Thus multi-year
projects cannot receive assured funding unless such funding is supplied out of a single year's appropriation. Grant
agreements may permit the expenditure from a particular year's grant to be made up to three years from the grant's effective
date, depending upon the source of the appropriation.


Applications


Applications must be prepared and submitted in 20 copies in the form of a statement, the narrative part of which should
not exceed 20 double-spaced pages. This must be accompanied by a one page executive summary, a budget, and vitae of
key professional staff. Proposers may append other information they consider essential, although bulky submissions
are discouraged and run the risk of not being reviewed fully. The one-page summary and budget should precede the narrative
in the proposal.
Proposed programs should be described fully, including benefits for the fields. All applicants should provide detailed
information about their plans for peer evaluation and review procedures and estimates of the types and amounts of
anticipated awards.
Applicants who have received a grant from this program in the previous competition should provide detailed information
on the peer evaluation and review procedures followed, and awards made, including, where applicable, names/affiliations
of recipients, and amounts and types of awards. If an applicant received support prior to the last competition, a summary
of those awards also should be included.

Descriptions of all competitive award programs should specify both past and anticipated applicant-to-award ratios.

Proposals from national organizations involving language instruction programs should provide for those programs
supported in the past year information on the criteria for evaluation, including levels of instruction, degrees
of intensiveness, facilities, methods for measuring language proficiency (including pre- and post-testing),
instructors' qualifications, and budget information showing estimated costs per student.

A description of affirmative action policies and practices must be included in the application.

Applicants should include certifications of compliance with the provisions of: (1) the Drug-Free Workplace Act
(Pub. L. 100-690), in accordance with Appendix C of 22 CFR 137, Subpart F; and (2) Section 319 of the Department
of the Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Act (Pub. L. 101-121), in accordance with Appendix A of
22 CFR 138, New Restrictions on Lobbying Activities.



Budget



Since funds provided by AID would come separately from its East European (including the Baltic states) and New Independent
States programs, proposals must indicate how the requested funds will be distributed by region, country (to the extent
possible), and activity. Subsequently, grant recipients must report expenditures by region, country, and activity.

Applicants should familiarize themselves with OMB Circular A-110, ``Grants and Agreements with Institutions
of Higher Education * * * Uniform Administrative Requirements,'' and OMB Circular A-133, ``Audits
of Institutions of Higher Learning and Other Non-Profit Institutions'' and indicate or provide the following information:

(1) Whether the organization falls under OMB Circular No. A-21, ``Cost Principles for Education Institutions,''
or OMB Circular No. A-122, ``Cost Principles for Nonprofit Organizations;''
(2) A detailed program budget indicating direct expenses by program element, by region (the independent states of
the former Soviet Union or Eastern Europe), indirect costs, and the total amount requested. NB: Indirect costs are
limited to 10 percent of total direct program costs. Applicants requesting funds to supplement a program having other
sources of support should submit a current budget for the total program and an estimated future budget for it showing
how specific lines in the budget would be affected by the allocation of requested grant funds. Other funding sources
and amounts, when known, should be identified;
(3) The applicant's cost-sharing proposal, if applicable, containing appropriate details and cross references
to the requested budget;
(4) The organization's most recent audit report (the most recent U.S. Government audit report if available) and the
name, address and point of contact of the audit agency.

All payments will be made to grant recipients through the Department of State by wire transfers.


Technical Review



The Advisory Committee for Studies of Eastern Europe and the Independent States of the Former Soviet Union will evaluate
applications on the basis of the following criteria:

(1) Responsiveness to the substantive provisions set forth above in PART II, Program Information (40 points);
(2) The professional qualifications of the applicant's key personnel and their experience conducting national
competitive award programs of the type the applicant proposes on the countries of Eastern Europe and the independent
states of the former Soviet Union (30 points); and
(3) Budget presentation and cost effectiveness (30 points).

<DOCTITLE>Petition for Waiver of Compliance </DOCTITLE>




In accordance with 49 CFR 211.9 and 211.41, notice is hereby given that the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA)
has received a request for waivers of compliance with certain requirements of the Federal safety laws and regulations.
The petition is described below, including the regulatory provisions involved, the nature of the relief being requested
and the petitioner's arguments in favor of relief. 


National Railroad Passenger Corporation (Amtrak) 


[Waiver Petition Docket Number PB-94-3] 


Amtrak is seeking a waiver of compliance from certain sections of the Railroad Power Brakes and Drawbars Regulations,
49 CFR Part 232. Amtrak is requesting that it be permitted to extend the clean, oil, test and stencil (COT&S) period
from 36 months to 48 months on all passenger cars equipped with 
26-C Brake Equipment. Section 232.17(b)(2) states_``Brake equipment on passenger cars must be clean, repaired,
lubricated and tested as often as necessary to maintain it in a safe and suitable condition for service but not less
frequently than as required in Standard S-045 in the Manual of Standards and Recommended Practices of the Association
of American Railroads (AAR).'' Paragraph 2.1.2 of Standard S-045 (AAR Manual Section A, Part III) currently
specifies 36 months for 26-C Type Brake Equipment. 


FRA Docket Number H-91-2 authorized Amtrak to conduct a 
four year test of the 26-C Brake Equipment on 50 cars of their 103 Horizon car fleet built between May 1989 and January
1990. A tear down inspection of five representative cars was conducted after the four year service period. The test
has now been concluded and a final report indicating satisfactory performance of the brake equipment over the four
year test period has been issued. As a result of this performance, Amtrak has requested that the COT&S period for
all cars with 26-C Brake Equipment be extended to 48 months. 


Interested parties are invited to participate in these proceedings by submitting written reviews, data or comments.
FRA does not anticipate scheduling a public hearing in connection with these proceedings since the facts do not appear
to warrant a hearing. If any interested party desires an opportunity for oral comment, they should notify FRA, in writing,
before the end of the comment period and specify the basis for their request. 
All communications concerning these proceedings should identify the appropriate docket number (e.g., Waiver Petition
Docket Number PB-94-3) and must be submitted in triplicate to the Docket Clerk, Office of Chief Counsel,
FRA, Nassif Building, 400 Seventh Street, S.W., Washington, D.C. 20590. Communications received before August
22, 1994 will be considered by FRA before final action is taken. Comments received after that date will be considered
as far as practicable. All written communications concerning these proceedings are available for examination during
regular business hours (9:00 a.m.-5:00 p.m.) in Room 8201, Nassif Building, 400 Seventh Street S.W., Washington,
D.C. 20590.

ACTION:

 Notice of open meeting. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 FRA will hold an informal open meeting on August 29, 1994, in order to present the initial results of an analysis of locomotive
crashworthiness. The meeting will be open to any interested person who wishes to attend as an observer. 


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The provisions of law that were contained in section 10 of the Rail Safety Enforcement and Review Act (Pub. L. 102-365),
simultaneously repealed and reenacted as 
section 4(t) of Pub. L. 103-272 on July 5, 1994, require that FRA assess the adequacy of existing locomotive crashworthiness
standards. At this open meeting, FRA's Office of Research and Development will present the methodology and the initial
results of the analysis. These first results are based on a model developed for this research project relying on engineering
data from existing locomotive designs. Using information gleaned from previous accidents, accident scenarios
are applied to the model. This analysis will be used to assess crashworthiness as required by statute. 


Since the issues to be discussed have potential bearing on future FRA regulatory activities, this meeting will be
open to any interested person who may wish to observe. There will also be an opportunity for questions.

<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of receipt of petition for determination that nonconforming 1991 Mercedes-Benz 230CE passenger cars are
eligible for importation.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This notice announces receipt by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) of a petition for a determination
that a 1991 Mercedes-Benz 230CE that was not originally manufactured to comply with all applicable Federal motor
vehicle safety standards is eligible for importation into the United States because (1) it is substantially similar
to a vehicle that was originally manufactured for importation into and sale in the United States and that was certified
by its manufacturer as complying with the safety standards, and (2) it is capable of being readily modified to conform
to the standards.


</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
Background


Under 49 U.S.C. 30141(a)(1)(A) (formerly section 108(c)(3)(A)(i)(I) of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle
Safety Act (the Act)), a motor vehicle that was not originally manufactured to conform to all applicable Federal motor
vehicle safety standards shall be refused admission into the United States unless NHTSA has determined that the motor
vehicle is substantially similar to a motor vehicle originally manufactured for importation into and sale in the
United States, certified under 49 U.S.C. 30115 (formerly section 114 of the Act), and of the same model year as the model
of the motor vehicle to be compared, and is capable of being readily modified to conform to all applicable Federal motor
vehicle safety standards.
Petitions for eligibility determinations may be submitted by either manufacturers or importers who have registered
with NHTSA pursuant to 49 CFR Part 592. As specified in 49 CFR 593.7, NHTSA publishes notice in the 

Federal Register

 of each petition that it receives, and affords interested persons an opportunity to comment on the petition. At the
close of the comment period, NHTSA determines, on the basis of the petition and any comments that it has received, whether
the vehicle is eligible for importation. The agency then publishes this determination in the 

Federal Register

G&K Automotive Conversion, Inc. of Santa Ana, California (``G&K'') (Registered Importer No. R-90-007)
has petitioned NHTSA to determine whether 1991 Mercedes-Benz 230CE (Model ID 124.043) passenger cars are eligible
for importation into the United States. The vehicle which G&K believes is substantially similar is the 1991 Mercedes-Benz
300CE. G&K has submitted information indicating that Daimler Benz A.G., the company that manufactured the 1991
Mercedes-Benz 300CE, certified that vehicle as conforming to all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety standards
and offered it for sale in the United States.

The petitioner contends that it carefully compared the 230CE to the 300CE, and found the two models to be substantially
similar with respect to compliance with most applicable Federal motor vehicle safety standards.

G&K submitted information with its petition intended to demonstrate that the 1991 model 230CE, as originally
manufactured in the same manner as the 1991 model 300CE that was offered for sale in the United States, or is capable
of being readily modified to conform to those standards.

Specifically, the petitioner claims that the 1991 model 230CE is identical to the certified 1991 model 300CE with
respect to compliance with Standards Nos. 102

<DOCTITLE>Receipt of Petition for Determination that Nonconforming 1991 Mercedes-Benz 300CE Passenger Cars Are Eligible
for Importation</DOCTITLE>

National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, DOT.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of receipt of petition for determination that nonconforming 1991 Mercedes-Benz 300CE passenger cars are
eligible for importation.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This notice announces receipt by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) of a petition for a determination
that a 1991 Mercedes-Benz 300CE that was not originally manufactured to comply with all applicable Federal motor
vehicle safety standards is eligible for importation into the United States because (1) it is substantially similar
to a vehicle that was originally manufactured for importation into and sale in the United States and that was certified
by its manufacturer as complying with the safety standards, and (2) it is capable of being readily modified to conform
to the standards.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 





Background



Under 49 U.S.C.  30141(a)(1)(A) (formerly section 108(c)(3)(A)(i)(I) of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle
Safety Act (the Act)), a motor vehicle that was not originally manufactured to conform to all applicable Federal motor
vehicle safety standards shall be refused admission into the United States unless NHTSA has determined that the motor
vehicle is substantially similar to a motor vehicle originally manufactured for importation into and sale in the
United States, certified under 49 U.S.C. 30115 (formerly section 114 of the Act), and of the same model year as the model
of the motor vehicle to be compared, and is capable of being readily modified to conform to all applicable Federal motor
vehicle safety standards.

Petitions for eligibility determinations may be submitted by either manufacturers or importers who have registered
with NHTSA pursuant to 49 CFR Part 592. As specified in 49 CFR 593.7, NHTSA publishes notice in the 

Federal Register

 of each petition that it receives, and affords interested persons an opportunity to comment on the petition. At the
close of the comment period, NHTSA determines, on the basis of the petition and any comments that it has received, whether
the vehicle is eligible for importation. The agency then publishes this determination in the 

Federal Register

.

G&K Automotive conversion, Inc. of Santa Ana, California (``G&K'') (Registered Importer 90-007)
has petitioned NHTSA to determine whether 1991 Mercedes-Benz 300CE (Model ID 124.051) passenger cars are eligible
for importation into the United States. The vehicle which G&K believes is substantially similar is the 1991 Mercedes-Benz
300CE that was manufactured for importation into, and sale in, the United States and certified by its manufacturer,
Daimler Benz A.G., as conforming to all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety standards.

The petitioner claims that it carefully compared the non-U.S. certified 1991 Mercedes-Benz 300CE to its U.S. certified
counterpart, and found the two vehicles to be substantially similar with respect to compliance with most Federal
motor vehicle safety standards.

G&K submitted information with its petition intended to demonstrate that the non-U.S. certified 1991 Mercedes-Benz
300CE, as originally manufactured, conforms to many Federal motor vehicle safety standards in the same manner as
its U.S. certified counterpart, or is capable of being readily modified to conform to those standards.

Specifically, the petitioner claims that the non-U.S. certified 1991 Mercedes-Benz 300CE is identical to its U.S.
certified counterpart with respect to compliance with Standards Nos. 102

States Subject to the Waiting Period Provision Imposed by the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act; States Having
Alternative Systems to the Waiting Period Provision; Listing of Chief Law Enforcement Officers for Purposes of the
Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act (93F-057P) 



<AGENCY>

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of States subject to the waiting period provision of the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act and States having
alternative systems, and a list of chief law enforcement officers for purposes of the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention
Act.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 Beginning on February 28, 1994, the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act imposes a 5-day waiting period on the sale,
delivery, or transfer of a handgun in States that do not require a background check. ATF is issuing this notice to inform
Federal firearms licensees of the States that do not currently require a background check, as well as those States
requiring a background check for handgun purchasers. In addition, ATF has compiled a list of chief law enforcement
officers for purposes of the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act.



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Background 



On November 30, 1993, Public Law 103-159 (107 Stat. 1536) was enacted, amending the Gun Control Act of 1968 (GCA),
as amended (18 U.S.C. Chapter 44). Title I of Pub. L. 103-159, cited as the ``Brady Handgun Violence Prevention
Act'' (hereafter ``the Act'') provides, in part, for a national waiting period of 5 days before a licensed importer,
manufacturer, or dealer may lawfully transfer a handgun to a nonlicensed individual. 

The Act provides that the waiting period provisions of the law are effective on February 28, 1994, and cease to apply
on November 30, 1998. The statute also provides alternatives to the waiting period provisions. 

On February 14, 1994, ATF issued temporary regulations implementing the provisions of Public Law 103-159 (T.D.
ATF-354, 59 FR 7110). 

During February, letters were sent to all Federal firearms licensees advising them as to whether their sales or other
dispositions were subject to the Federal 5-day waiting period or their State background check system. In addition,
licensees in States which are subject to the Federal 5-day waiting period were advised of the designated chief law
enforcement officers in their State.

ATF has completed a study of relevant State laws to determine which States are subject to the federal waiting period
provisions and which qualify as ``alternative'' States. Information regarding each category is set out below:
